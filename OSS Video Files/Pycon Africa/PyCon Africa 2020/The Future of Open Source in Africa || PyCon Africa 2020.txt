because it's a very important

00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,439
conversation that

00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,199
at some point that we should be having

00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,520
and

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,960
really really glad that um i'm having

00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,040
this opportunity to

00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:40,160
be a co-host for the pioneer section

00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:11,840
okay okay okay hi everyone my name is

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,720

growth in africa

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:25,840
um but i think i have been

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:28,479
involved and inspired by open source for

00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,320
about 15 years

00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:32,079
and that sort of characterizes my

00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,320
journey and i think

00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:35,920
um looking back and looking forward i'm

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,720
very excited about the future of open

00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,720
source in africa

00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,200

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,560
that if i keep dropping

samson will lead the conversation i

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,799

i don't know did i say sauce which is a

00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,200
monetization

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,160
in africa so it's a really broad system

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,480
it's a really broad

00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,239
structure and architecture but yeah i'm

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:28,080
really excited about this and

00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,080
oh about open source in africa

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,800
i think um

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,280
i mean i started coming into consoles

00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,879
about just three years ago now

00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,560
so i'm still coming up in the process so

00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,519
don't see me as an expert in april

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,519
source also

00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,560
so samsung is my boss in the open source

00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,840
all right so

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:51,840
no no no no i'm still i feel as new as

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,840
um

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:08,560
so it's probably

00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:11,680

above that i think i'm involved i've

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,000
been involved

00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,479
in the in the android space and android

00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,240
is just

00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,759
another whole world of open cross that

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,120
you looked at uh

00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:18,560
from 2012 oh my god it's been

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,000
eight years so so yeah so that's

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,919
that's that's that's what i've been

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,440
doing and uh yeah just playing around

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,919
and just like having fun with the whole

00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,680
office

00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:27,759
but i think i'm over and above that i

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,880
think something below i organized the

00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,160
open source chapter of oscar in nairobi

00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,320
for that matter so

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,000
yeah that's that's really amazing yeah

00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,080
yeah awesome

00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
yeah so um yeah so i think that's that's

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,560
everybody and i don't think marlene is

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,639
here so

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,320
just go ahead um so yeah so this is a

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:47,680
very product conversation because

00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,680
um i believe um about

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,680
i believe everybody here at some point

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,560
have come across the world open source

00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,639
or

00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,600
some newbies that have acts like what is

00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,600
the word open source

00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,919
and i believe like most of the people in

00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,280
this section here just hear us on like

00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,960
what are the ways to contribute to open

00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,360
source so um

00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,880
myself and marlin we came up with a i

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,840
believe an interesting question so we

00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,759
try not to

00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,840
don't worry we're not going to ask any

00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:15,360
serious questions which are

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:17,520
possible um but um i would encourage

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,319
everybody

00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,840
to keep it under a minute so um to make

00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,720
it much easier for everybody to answer

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,039
so we could

00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,919
wrap up as much as possible so yeah so

00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:29,120
the first question

00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:33,120
um hello why don't you hear me hi

00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:35,199

i'm sorry i've just been coming in and

00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,120

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,759
let's continue uh so okay you can go

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,479
ahead

00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,479
and ask the first question

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,840
oh you want me to go ahead first okay

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,039
awesome because i wanted to like ladies

00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,400
first so

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:51,759
oh sure i mean if

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,560
i think you can go ahead and then i'll

00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:57,199
ask the next question

00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,800
oh great so the first question here on

00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,240
my list is why should people be

00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,120
interested in contributing to open

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,280
source

00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,039
and uh what are the benefits so this is

00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,240
an open question um

00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,639
you could raise your hand if you want to

00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,639
answer

00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:16,400
did you get the did you get a question

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:20,080
yeah now i can go first

00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:22,000
yeah okay okay sure yeah so

00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,240
open source why should people contribute

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,840
to open source i think open source is

00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,599
i like to think about the benefits and

00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,759
why the world needs the benefits open

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:32,400
source brings

00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,360
just having the freedom to not be tied

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,440
into

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,960
a certain provider and being able to

00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,599
contribute and

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,319
have like community build something that

00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,080
they actually

00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,000
want it's something that's truly

00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:47,919
beneficial and

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,479
open source has values that i think

00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,759
the world needs to mirror like openness

00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:53,919
accountability

00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,039
and contributing into open source for me

00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:57,759
is

00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,639
getting into those values and bringing

00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,440
them into the

00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,319
ground and software particularly i think

00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,360
is something that

00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:07,599
needs a lot of those values so

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,280
that's the benefit of doing open source

00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:11,280
i mean besides

00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,639
um like the societal benefits i just

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,919
mentioned

00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:19,520
it open source as like

00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:23,840
is it does so many

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:26,800
things and yeah career-wise growth

00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,759
learning opportunities networking reach

00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,440
there's just so many

00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,360
aspects that open source brings to you

00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,839
as a person and

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,719
getting into it really is it's uh it's a

00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,080
win-win thing

00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:41,440
my opinion awesome awesome

00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:45,279
um anybody ask you to with a different

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,279
um idea around that question

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,000
okay

00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,080
i think um one of the benefits of open

00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,320
source is sort of

00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,200
foiling and eventually quenching your

00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,760
curiosity

00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,120
you know it's like if you owned a car

00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,480
and then you were driving your car all

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,480
day long and you never even

00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,160
like popped up the hood to see what's in

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,360
there what's making the car drive where

00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,320
do you put water

00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,760
where you put oil and then at some point

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,279
even when you start doing that

00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,880
when you want to go a little bit further

00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,560
you might even want to go up you know

00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,360
open some other thing maybe the engine

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,600
of the device

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,360
so if you're the curious kind of person

00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,640
and just like daniel said that is kind

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,320
of like the cultural

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,880
or the personality or the kind of people

00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,480
we need on this continent i think open

00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,240
source is one area where

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,320
when you develop i.t and then you delve

00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:37,839
into software you can actually

00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,839
quench that curiosity

00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,519
yeah that's that's that's that's that's

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,680
really amazing because um

00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,880
the fact the fact is because it's a it's

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,800
molecule

00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,920
i think this this this oh marines down

00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,640
here okay

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,279
because this kind of like goes into um

00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,160
my

00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,959
my oh my can you hear me you keep

00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,920
dropping so

00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,920
i just wanted to be sure

00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,720
i'm not sure yet i think that's all

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,720
right

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:09,120
well okay now yeah sure

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,600
yeah so we're not gonna get one more

00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,079
minutes

00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,480
on this topic um anybody else here to

00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,480
commence

00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,560
frank right here okay okay i did your

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,399
first day okay all right so just to

00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,240
speak to you basically

00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,160
daniel said and i'll just like take one

00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,640
point he said being that

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,839
open source gives you an opportunity to

00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,920
contribute to get like

00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,279
a real life experience so most times

00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,920
when you graduate from school

00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:37,120
you don't get a job like easily right

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,800
because people want to see that they

00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,720
have prior experience maybe

00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,320
working in like another company before

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,600
joining their company right

00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,279
people don't really want to have well i

00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,000
don't have prior experience working on

00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,519
anything

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,040
i think open source gives you that

00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,720
opportunity to be able to contribute

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,000
like using myself as an instance i

00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,600
basically got my

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,200
job because i was able to contribute

00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,800
open source and talk about

00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,800
those things i was able to do right so

00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,839
if i did suppose so they'll probably not

00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,519
have

00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:03,760
experience with working like a company

00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,680
or an organization so that's

00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,800
one important thing that i think open

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,040
source gives to

00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,839
gives to people an opportunity to be

00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,760
able to get like

00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:15,680
job opportunities or get connected to

00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:17,600
people via contributing

00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,040
yeah that's that's that's that's amazing

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,360
yeah yeah

00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,480
so frank um do you want to answer that

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,959
yeah

00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,640
yes yes yes yes so so let me let me look

00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,320
at it from the point of view of as a

00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,360
developer that is if you're a junior

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,079
developer

00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,680
um something that i nearly said about

00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:36,160
the whole curiosity a bit

00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:38,079
i look at it from the the other point of

00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,519
even your skills are usually expanded

00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,360
because when you look at a code base

00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,240
like i remember my first interaction

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,760
with the android

00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,959
um core like the platform uh codebase

00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,800
when i was looking at it and i was like

00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,440
okay cool what if i added this i removed

00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,360
this

00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,880
and you get to learn different ways in

00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,560
which more experience people are

00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:57,360
actually relieving from stuff

00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,639
and i think um getting that tweaking you

00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,160
know you start to possible by like

00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,360
editing one or two things and the next

00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,440
thing you know now you know

00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,800
okay if i want to do a specific thing if

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,959
i want to do a login

00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,000
this is i've learned from you know

00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,320
different people

00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,360
um i think um if it was einstein who

00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,880
said that

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,399
you you you sort of like you've been

00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,560
able to grow more by standing on the

00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,839
shoulders of giants or other men so

00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,600
that's what you do with the whole

00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:22,480
platform like when you get in touch with

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,160
like hoping something like that

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,920
and so it does all these whole career

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,480
benefits and also it improves you as

00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,480
a person

00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,440
yeah actually thanks for being that part

00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:36,000
of the conversation because

00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,639
that comes to the second um question to

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,639
your friend

00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,320
um so like as a software engineer

00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,639
yourself like um

00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,760
how do you think being part of the open

00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:47,680
source community

00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,680
helps you personally or career-wise

00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:54,160
uh so so like one of the things is is i

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,639
love i love the way

00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,000
um so you see like once you all start um

00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,160
contributing towards

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,920
to open source you get to interact with

00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,920
very opinionated people

00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,680
and i think um sometimes writing your

00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,680
code and learning to deal with

00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,120
opinionated people is really good

00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,959
because you will do something and you

00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,880
think that's the best version of your

00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:14,399
act and then someone will ask you

00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,160
why did you do it like that and then

00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,000
they really correct you from like let's

00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,760
say if you return 20 lines of code they

00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,360
reduce it like 10 or five

00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,959
and they show you a better way of doing

00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,800
things i think so number one is

00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,920
you also start to learn best practices

00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,760
because i think every open source

00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,440
project has this code of conduct so

00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,360
you start learning how do i work with a

00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,279
whole global or a whole

00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,440
um diverse set of people how do i

00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,880
contribute in a meaningful way

00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,639
um the other thing that i think is also

00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:41,920
very important to note is

00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,320
as a software engineer i think um you

00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,800
being

00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,000
at the forefront of contributing to

00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,720
something that means

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,160
more um to the whole world that helps

00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,360
the whole world where

00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,959
there's no direct monetary benefit

00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,480
i think it does something to you in that

00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,680
you get to stretch yourself because now

00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,680
you're asking yourself

00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,120
why am i doing this and the pay is not

00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,240
there in the front and so you have to

00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,360
give the best version of yourself

00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,839
because someone else is going to

00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,959
actually get straightforward

00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:11,040
yeah i think that's that's um

00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:13,360
i think that's very interesting because

00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,360
um

00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:19,440
which goes down to um my next question i

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,560
don't know if melanie is still here but

00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,079
i can see her

00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:25,440
um you know speaking about because we

00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,160
can't really talk about open source in

00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,079
africa

00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,000
if we don't really discuss about like

00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,760
the challenges and the obstacles right

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,079
um so this is a generic question but i

00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:37,199
would love so far to comment on this

00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:38,880
um you know so the question goes this

00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:41,279
way uh what are the obstacles that

00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:43,040
africans face when it comes to

00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:45,040
contributing to open choice

00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,639
um so it could be your own personal

00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,360
experience it could be somebody that you

00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,800
mentor

00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,560
it could be your program in this case

00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,079
like death career um

00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,680
you know because i know from the fact

00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,240
that one of the things could be internet

00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,399
it could be

00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,000
laptops it could be you know just

00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,720
basically the for ways to have

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,839
you know one-to-one mentorship so what's

00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,120
your idea around

00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:06,880
you know what you think is in the

00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,440
problem that

00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,440
makes you know the content africa a

00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,480
little bit away from open source

00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,760
okay well i think i think there are

00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,839
there are quite a lot of challenges but

00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:21,040
i would not even want to go into

00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:22,399
the one way i want to start from time

00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,839
zone actually

00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,720
now we have to be frank a lot of open

00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:28,399
source another open source project

00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,399
actually generated from the us

00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,959
these are from the like literally from

00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,399
the u.s so a lot of these developers

00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,360
are from the u.s and a lot of these

00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,720
players are already started by

00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,199
developers from the us

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,560
so the time frame the time zone is when

00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,920
all of the issues because

00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,160
when you when you see sensitive

00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,880
design you're called to contribute right

00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,959
now

00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,880
to open source and you are learning and

00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:50,240
you got having six hours different

00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,079
i'm telling you that by the time you say

00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,519
okay let me contribute tomorrow morning

00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:55,120
maybe you've seen something simple that

00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,240
if you know this is quite easy for me to

00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,560
quickly contribute to

00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,759
understand by tomorrow that's fixed

00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,040
already because

00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,519
i mean there are people working with

00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,920
that particular time zone so that's

00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,440
not that's not like the major issue

00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,480
another thing i've noticed was there was

00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,279
the time i had to contribute to a

00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,639
product

00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,600
okay it was a product it was a whole

00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,880
company i wanted to work with the

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,160
companies

00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,560
about a year ago also and i went to the

00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,199
uh

00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,959
repo i mean one of the skills one of the

00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,399
easy ways to actually get

00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,920
complicated i don't like you is you

00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,480
could just show them what you can do

00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,000
first

00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,519
they don't actually reach out to you so

00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,800
i went out there okay

00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:31,279
and a lot of the issues i was saying

00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,160
there was i saw i saw issues on fortune

00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,279
i saw

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,720
i saw a lot of issues with the

00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,360
programming language that are not what

00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,519
i'm even

00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:40,000
used to and these are like like the

00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,000
connection

00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,240
is i guess negative languages called

00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,199
java

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,759
right wait what why did you when did

00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:51,040
people

00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,040
write in java yeah right

00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,319
languages time zone the programming

00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,839
language legacy codes itself that

00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:10,079
doesn't actually

00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,199
allow beginners just only try and dive

00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:13,039
into it because

00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,319
you don't you know definitely that no

00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,679
you don't even understand the code

00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,880
itself you know with all the comments

00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,559
and documentation

00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,799
yeah so i think that's the reason but

00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:22,720
i'm happy now that a lot of a lot of

00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:24,319
codes have been agree we've seen a lot

00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,160
of documentation have been updated to

00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,120
actually allow people who just come into

00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,559
programming

00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,240
to actually be able to contribute these

00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:33,120
particular packages to

00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,120
this particular language

00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,840
all right i don't think she can hear me

00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,360
yeah so i'll move the spotlight so i

00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,559
need you so

00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:00,820
um you know again you're you're you're

00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:03,900
you know one

00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:03,900
[Music]

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,200
yeah so when it comes to like the

00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,919
forefront of communities

00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,640
so what you know in in in your day to

00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,160
day

00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,600
not particularly to your job though like

00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,039
you know in your day day-to-day

00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:32,240
activities you know going

00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:33,760
closely events and you know

00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,600
talking to people and having some kind

00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,000
of mentorship what what's your opinion

00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,480
on what

00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,559
how do you see these obstacles you know

00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,160
or have you tried to

00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:44,400
what are those obstacles that you think

00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,720
that kind of um

00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,160
you know make africans or in this case

00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,640
nigeria in this case

00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,760
stay away from you know open source

00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,039
because you keep saying oh i want to

00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:56,640
contribute to open source

00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:58,640
but for some reason just do

00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,240
um very impressed by the direction which

00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,240
um sultan um

00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,000
sort of addressed this question which is

00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,520
the obvious things like infrastructure

00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,640
we don't need to be labeled those ones

00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,320
like those ones are there and it will

00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,760
continue being problems

00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,520
but i think one other thing that is a

00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:16,080
big problem is culture

00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:19,039
and it's a culture of being wrong

00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,240
or being possibly being wrong and also a

00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:22,320
culture of feedback

00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,559
you know so sometimes people don't want

00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,840
to show what they do or let another

00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:28,000
person review their work

00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,520
so like openly so you don't want to

00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,200
submit maybe a patch

00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,720
or you don't want to respond to an issue

00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,520
because the feedback that would be given

00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,559
on that issue

00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:39,440
might even just be public as well um

00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:41,520
so i think this is one area where we can

00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:45,120
do more we can do better

00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:47,440
and generally um

00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,720
with events and even with communities

00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,360
you'll notice that

00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,120
people's attitude changes over time so

00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,799
first of all they want to attend meetups

00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,640
or they don't want to attend meetups

00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:58,960
then they want to contribute then they

00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,400
want to lead and then they won't even go

00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,120
ahead and create new communities when

00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,120
they see the venue

00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,840
oh

00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:24,400
wanting to always be right yeah go ahead

00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,400
you're froze

00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,559
oh i think it's still

00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:34,720
okay i totally understand what

00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,080
is saying i think that's that's a really

00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,039
really big point i think what he's

00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,720
trying to say is

00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:41,520
i'm trying to feel him for my birthday

00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,520
he comes back though

00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:47,520
we as humans we take we take feedback

00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,039
very serious

00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,559
when it comes to business when it comes

00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:53,120
to personal

00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:55,120
goods and you you don't want to feel

00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:57,200
belittled by somebody telling you that

00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,720
oh this this part you upgraded this

00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,640
particular fix you did

00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,000
this this this this is something that

00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,919
i've done 15 years ago

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,080
this is 2020. you don't like coats like

00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,080
this

00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,480
and a lot of people feel i'm comfortable

00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:13,600
at the particular stage where i

00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,960
am it's not as if there is a

00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,480
loop on my neck to contribute to open

00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,039
source so i don't need to put myself out

00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,200
there

00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:20,400
so it's like the fear of the unknown

00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,679
channel that i've been trying to point

00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,559
out the fear of the unknown kind of

00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,600
makes me feel like

00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:27,200
i have nothing to lose so since

00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:30,080
it's just like that and i know what i

00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:33,520
think again is the companies also

00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:35,200
i mean okay something mentioned

00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,640
two companies in nigeria or two

00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,760
companies in nigeria actually that

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:41,600
actually has a code that's

00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:45,840
open source that's a strong spotlight

00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,840
you're putting me right now so i

00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,840
uh

00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:47,520
can you mute yourself we can't hear you

00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:49,600
we can't hear you yeah

00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,360
yeah so i think i think let's let's um

00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,000
um so daniel this question is for you

00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,559
right um

00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,360
uh this was a question from maureen uh

00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:57,360
she said um

00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:06,159
um yes i'm saying right that you know

00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,120
yeah so this is a question from from

00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:09,679
marlene

00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,200
so she said particularly in zambia um

00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,840
what are the challenges

00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,200
um that you know developers face face in

00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,080
this case when it comes to contributing

00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:20,320
to open source

00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:22,480
particularly you know in zambia

00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:25,120
i think it's it's also more of a culture

00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,120
problem and

00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:32,159
so i think we've grown as

00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:34,000
um a lot of africa like open source i

00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,159
like

00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,679
a what's the word there's a philosophy

00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:39,120
and i i don't i think

00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,880
i'm great i don't know if that was

00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,240
online i'm talking over anyone i hope

00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:45,919
i'm not talking about anyone

00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:48,480
um yeah he's saying yeah daniel

00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:50,400
yeah daniel yeah i don't think i don't

00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,600
think the the platform enables everybody

00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,720
to speak or daniel

00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:58,000
daniel all right yeah okay

00:23:54,720 --> 00:24:00,400
us becoming who we are and embracing

00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
the culture of open source like open

00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,360
source can be

00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,960
open source can be applied to a lot of

00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,799
different areas so open source like a

00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,720
philosophy open source journalism open

00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:10,080
source technology technology when you're

00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,240
trying to apply open source to

00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,320
technology the issues that

00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,760
we have in general when you talk about

00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:18,880
infrastructure come up

00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:21,760
but then applying those like um

00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,200
like the values and actually getting to

00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,840
work on open source

00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,440
i like to um think of like maslov's

00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,679
hierarchy of needs so

00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,559
before you can think of something like

00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:32,320
open source

00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:33,919
so like this hierarchy basically is

00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,240
before you can do anything

00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:37,360
you think you talk about your safety you

00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,320
try and get like

00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:41,919
um your loved ones fed and your security

00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,400
and then you can start doing things that

00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:45,760
can

00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:47,440
help you be a better person so in in in

00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:50,000
zambia specifically

00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:52,000
open source is like doing things to make

00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,720
you a better person and grow

00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
in your career and if that's not

00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,919
something that can

00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,200
cater for the things below you give you

00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:01,279
money give you

00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,960
like you know put food on your table and

00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:03,520
people won't do that and that's a huge

00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,720
problem

00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:09,919
it's it just isn't like a viable

00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:11,120
it isn't on people's minds so people got

00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:13,679
other things to worry about

00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:16,799
that's a huge reason why they aren't

00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:18,799
contributing to open source software

00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:20,810
um that's that's that's a that's a

00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:23,360
that's a very strong one

00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:23,520
[Applause]

00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:23,520
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:23,520
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,760
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:28,080
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah okay so so i

00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:30,320
think that that's a really amazing point

00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,919
down here as and i think even it does

00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,039
not already apply to xander it applies

00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:36,159
to nigeria and

00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:38,559
tons of other even this applies

00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,279
in the individuals in general all over

00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:40,880
the world

00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:42,400
if you i mean you have you have a

00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,480
certain set of

00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:47,679
certain sort of reward and certain sort

00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:50,640
of responsibilities

00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,520
so you don't spend your time and i think

00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,159
over the

00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:55,679
past few months marilyn and i and even

00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:57,440
daniel himself here we've been working

00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:01,600
on something called alpha phi

00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:03,520
so affirmative part is an organization

00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,600
start this problem of open source

00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,440
contribution from that particular part a

00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:10,159
where you can contribute to open source

00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,440
and get revenue get credits like some

00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:13,440
get something back

00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,440
in return for contribution so it's gonna

00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,880
help your career as an individual

00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,080
it's gonna help your environment you're

00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,559
gonna have your contract you're going to

00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,480
help

00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:22,840
you scale in terms of financial returns

00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,559
also so i think more on that will still

00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:27,120
cause

00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:28,720
yeah you see i've been very silently

00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,760
tweeting to myself about

00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:34,559
um one of these companies be it like

00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,039
zazo africa and zambia pestac or flutter

00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,159
wave

00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:38,720
they really need to work with like

00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:41,919
github sponsors to get

00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:45,279
um african open source developers

00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:47,440
to be compensated um

00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:48,320
yeah yeah i think i think that's a good

00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,600
one

00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,440
you know i think that's something that

00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:55,200
needs to happen because if people can be

00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:56,799
paid for their contributions then

00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,480
i think we would have more people doing

00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:00,320
open source in africa

00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,000
i i i don't know i don't know who's here

00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:06,000
from github but

00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:09,679
if anybody um

00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,200
please please integrate github sponsors

00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:14,159
to some african payment like

00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,760
flight away and rest we need we need

00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:18,960
people to get paid we need

00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:20,320
to get paid yes um so yeah um so

00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,640
so this this goes down to my next

00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:24,960
question um so i need to mention about

00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,720
culture which is very important myself

00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,080
um you know the way i got into open

00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,559
source is basically because i

00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,399
tried to neglect some cultures just to

00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:34,480
get you know into open source

00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:37,360
particularly due to the onboarding

00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:40,559
process so these questions goes to dd

00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:41,600
um recently i started helping the genome

00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,760
project which are

00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,840
you know the the device interface when

00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,840
it comes to the linux desktops

00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,880
um particularly to work on your own body

00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,919
process right

00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:53,120
so um so i don't know um how i want to

00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:54,799
phrase this question maybe

00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,640
it should be something personal to you

00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:59,120
or maybe how you got into open source

00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,159
but the question is like on what are

00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:03,279
those challenges

00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:06,399
your face when it comes to onboarding um

00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:07,760
maybe targeting yourself and having to

00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:10,480
think that you know

00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,679
um do you think having much better

00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,240
onboarding process

00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:16,159
from an organization point of view or

00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,960
from an immigration perspective could

00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:19,440
better

00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,799
um get more africans to join an open

00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,559
source project

00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:25,039
again you have experience when it comes

00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:28,000
to season of dock and dlc

00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:29,440
so do you want to like um talk more and

00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,559
you know have a much better onboarding

00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,600
process

00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:35,120
yeah i think it's really important for

00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,720
open source organizations to have good

00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,600
on boarding process because it

00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,360
definitely

00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,120
improves like the number of

00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:44,320
contributions they get right

00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:45,919
so imagine going to organization where

00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,760
they don't break down issues they don't

00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:49,360
tell you if this issue is for beginners

00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,000
or if it's for like intermediate or for

00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,919
experts

00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,360
and then you just jump on anything that

00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:53,840
would most likely be for our next part

00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,799
that you're

00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:59,200
a beginner you would definitely get that

00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:59,200
okay

00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:04,399
organization has like a good on boarding

00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:06,240
process meaning when you join

00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:08,000
what's good you can clearly see that oh

00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,760
hey this is the github repository

00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,360
and when you get to you call brazil you

00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,039
can see that

00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,640
it's actually labeled right so they have

00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:17,600
issues for beginners which is like

00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:19,840
i think they call it um good facebook

00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,520
beginner friendly they have like certain

00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:23,440
types that make you identify this

00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:26,159
particular issue right

00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,159
so you can easily

00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:39,039
um like forums and even if they have

00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,039
those

00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,720
hard to go to foreign position and

00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,919
people don't respond to you kind of

00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,880
makes you want to like probably go to

00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:46,720
like another one

00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,120
so if open source organizations have

00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,480
good on boarding process for like

00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,080
newbies or

00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,600
experts let them know that you can

00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,760
easily talk to someone

00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:57,200
know who to reach out to some email

00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,520
addresses it's not an email address or

00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,760
someone

00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,799
nobody responds to like over a month so

00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,880
that means nobody's actually

00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:05,200
looking at that email address but that's

00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:07,200
the website or something right

00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,399
so if not no doubt there's still open

00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,240
source organizations that are doing

00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:12,720
really really great in terms of

00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,840
onboarding newbies yeah really amazing

00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,440
but then there are also some of them

00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,520
that are not doing like the best thing

00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,200
and imagine if a beginner goes there for

00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,760
the first time he or she would most

00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,240
likely

00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:24,640
not want to delve into open source

00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,640
anymore

00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:30,399
interesting um so i think so far we've

00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,320
talked about

00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:34,080
culture we've talked about onboarding

00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:36,640
we've talked about um

00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:38,080
payments you know compensation or how to

00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,480
take open source developers because

00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,960
again

00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,760
um this was something i i talked about

00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,279
at the

00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,200
github universe when i had the

00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:47,279
opportunity to discuss

00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,559
you know open source in africa because

00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:51,840
one of the things that i

00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:53,360
have seen um because one of the things

00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,240
i've seen in the continent is due to the

00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,960
fact that

00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,720
we are much younger um when it comes to

00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:01,760
age range compared to

00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:03,840
um other states europe or asia

00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:05,600
so that means it's almost very difficult

00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:07,840
to see somebody

00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,799
in the tech space with a straight 10

00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,760
years experience

00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:13,679
11 years experience you know or probably

00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:15,440
just used to get a job at google

00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:17,440
you know all those companies that could

00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,360
hire you to work on open source right

00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,960
so this this kind of comes down to my

00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,679
next question so this is a broad

00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,360
question

00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:25,120
um to answer just raise your hand you

00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:27,279
know i'll point you then you could

00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,559
then you can answer so the question goes

00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:32,159
this way um

00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:33,279
what are the responsibilities um for

00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:35,600
companies to support

00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:37,039
open source communities and developers

00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,600
in the continent what what what do you

00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:39,120
think

00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:41,200
companies should be doing better because

00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:43,519
i believe um everybody here

00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,640
works or afflicted in some organization

00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:46,000
right um

00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,399
so what do you think is the better way

00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,880
for companies to help the ecosystem in

00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:54,080
terms of

00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:54,080
interest so i see sultan first okay yeah

00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:58,960
yeah so come on go ahead okay all right

00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,440
so

00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,960
uh okay so i would i would start with a

00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,960
very short example

00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,159
number one is we have let's say for

00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,559
instance we have two

00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:09,600
payments for instance we have to

00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:14,720
payments

00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:17,919
uh platform payments api platform

00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:19,440
for instance one is is easily used

00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:20,960
and another one gives a lot of problem

00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:24,399
to use now

00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:26,559
what data would would do they'll publish

00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:29,039
it would be i wanted to bring the points

00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:30,399
about what api i did writes back in the

00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:30,960
days but i think that's going to be

00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:32,960
later

00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,480
so what i'm saying is a community

00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,720
actually that's like the simple answer

00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,760
equity community now so i saw something

00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,240
on twitter today

00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:41,200
the currency maintainer for babel said

00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:44,159
that

00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:45,039
he was he wants to make a few updates

00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:49,120
and exact same

00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:50,240
x is w x you know him right

00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,480
i can't remember his name but i think

00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:56,080
that's his name is x w x

00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:58,240
so he act yeah exactly yeah

00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:00,080
exactly exactly exactly so he asked him

00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,559
and somebody else to join in

00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:03,760
they're kind of a discord a discord

00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:05,120
channel and that's people that are

00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:07,519
interested in contributing

00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:09,200
to join that discuss channel so they can

00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:10,000
talk on how to contribute now that's a

00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,960
community

00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,720
that's how you're talking to the

00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,679
community now if even some people just

00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,840
join that's cool

00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:16,960
you get to interact in writing you feel

00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,640
more connected

00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,559
to your projects when you go to people

00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:24,159
that are having a particular project

00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:25,600
take up foreign

00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:27,440
open source project and decide that oh

00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:30,720
we're going to be using this code or

00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:32,399
slack for the community for this project

00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,399
people would join interact with

00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:34,799
developers from fruita wave and be like

00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:36,159
oh i'm

00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:38,159
going to situate your payment system but

00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:38,960
i fixed this he says i was able to make

00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:40,399
it easier

00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,000
however you guys start using something

00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:43,279
like this seems like that you

00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,440
feel more connected to that particular

00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:47,200
system and before you know you see that

00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:50,480
nobody would complain about futaba's

00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:52,399
api so i'm just just an example

00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,840
i'm not personally confused i'm just

00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:56,399
saying the answer

00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:58,960
is community you are able to create a

00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:00,480
community around the products

00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,480
even if it's open source even if it's

00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:07,840
terrible you especially

00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:07,840
kind of people are alone

00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:15,599
so i think what you're saying is like

00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,960
companies want first of all

00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:18,879
they need to show some sort of

00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,960
commitment to open source right

00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:22,240
so whether it's having one open source

00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,320
or one community

00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:25,359
evangelist or something and then you

00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,720
know

00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:28,879
all the way to have things like an open

00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:29,919
source programs office and a process

00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:33,200
organization

00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:35,839
um or department the other thing is um

00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:37,679
sort of encouraging your developers to

00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:39,280
actually contribute to open source

00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,879
and to sort of create some of their work

00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,720
in a very open fashion

00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:44,720
you know should you be able to identify

00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:47,760
what you can share what you can share

00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:47,760
and create sort of like

00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:07,520
and then finally i think one thing that

00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:10,079
companies have to do

00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:11,440
with an open source culture is succeed

00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:12,560
right we've talked about payments we

00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,480
talked about money

00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:16,240
but if you have this fancy open source

00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,800
company and you are not

00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:20,720
out there you know really looking very

00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:23,040
successful or being very successful

00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:24,000
then there isn't an appetite for an open

00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,520
source culture

00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,280
if you look at some of the very big

00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,079
companies and i use this as a general

00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,839
example

00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:31,359
that you have companies that have driven

00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:33,119
their business with proprietary

00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:34,880
and closed software and then you have

00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:35,599
companies that have a business with open

00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,280
software

00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:39,119
and both have altered ended up being

00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,320
trillion dollar of millions of billion

00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:42,480
dollar companies

00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,160
when do you see that kind of success

00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:46,160
then they are encouraged to

00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,760
go in one direction so if if an open

00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,680
source if a company

00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:52,560
doesn't exhibit some sort of open

00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,680
culture and doesn't succeed with that

00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,119
sort of open culture

00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:57,359
there's no way you can confuse a lot of

00:35:55,119 --> 00:36:00,079
other companies to be open and i think

00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:01,599
when aisha said so in the comments it's

00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:02,320
very clear that some of our indigenous

00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:05,280
companies

00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:06,720
have built very successful businesses in

00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,320
a very closed fashion

00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,920
and it would really take someone

00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:12,800
building a business

00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:14,720
in a rather open passion and also

00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,000
leveling up and succeeding at that level

00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:19,040
for people to really believe

00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:21,920
that being open is the way to go or it's

00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:24,480
always one goal yeah and i don't i want

00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:26,720
to say something answer something

00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,520
can everybody hear me yeah yeah we can

00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,680
you go ahead

00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,960
um sorry i kind of what i really said

00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:33,040
now is just

00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,640
start the point in my mind now the thing

00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:36,320
is we are aware that

00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,680
companies a lot of companies are out

00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:40,880
there that the beauty they are

00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:42,079
from an open source programs open source

00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,800
library soft stuff

00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:46,320
and let's say you know that oh our

00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,680
organization is using open source and

00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,480
because of that we are giving back to

00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,240
open source

00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,680
they're making it public but the issue i

00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:55,359
think we're having is that

00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:56,160
we build their products on open source

00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:58,320
softwares

00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,680
open source products but they're not

00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:02,480
published they are successful

00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:03,760
but i'm not putting it out there for you

00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,280
we're going to open source software

00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,720
we're going to open source software

00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,000
but they're successful using open source

00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,960
software but they're not pushing it in

00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,960
your face

00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,240
so people are naturally aware that oh

00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,520
this company is using open source

00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:16,079
software using open source

00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:17,359
api open source libraries and code but

00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:19,599
this is what they are using

00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:21,200
but they are not publicizing it and they

00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:23,520
are really criticized

00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:25,359
so i think what we should be encouraging

00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:27,200
now is if you are a company

00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:28,560
using an open source software to

00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,760
actually scale your business

00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,839
let people know that this is what you

00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,359
are using and appreciate it

00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:35,359
by starting your own open source

00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:36,160
software or even making people know that

00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:38,079
okay

00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,880
you need to support us i mean just let

00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:40,480
people know that this is what you're

00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,079
using

00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,800
as if you built your own framework

00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:44,800
yourself or something

00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:50,000
yeah i think i think i lost it for some

00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:53,359
reason the platform keeps switching

00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:56,960
audio um it seems like there's a

00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:56,960
if an air statement is running

00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:04,960
yeah so let me add another

00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,960
let me

00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:10,400
there's some companies who are um

00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,079
the way the whole conversation should we

00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,200
make this open should we make this more

00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:14,800
close should we

00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:17,200
put it out there i think one of the

00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,880
fears that probably we have and you see

00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,400
this in our educational system all over

00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:23,760
the continent is that

00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,320
we are not taught to like share or group

00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,160
work

00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,839
what we are actually told most of the

00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:29,440
time is hey

00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:31,920
uh the best thing that you can do for

00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,520
yourself is you you have to like hide

00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,240
your work you have to hide the things

00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,400
that you're doing

00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:38,079
you have to focus on your thing and so

00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,400
because it starts from that educational

00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:42,720
culture where everyone is being told hey

00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,240
yeah prevent prevent like don't share

00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,880
don't share it's not a culture that we

00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,800
have

00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:49,520
when kids are going to school it's like

00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:51,280
my thing my you know my that that whole

00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:53,359
element of like my thing

00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,640
needs to first of all stop because these

00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:55,599
are the people who are going to create

00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,200
these companies

00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:58,720
and once they clear the companies the

00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,640
culture starts to trickle down

00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:02,160
and so when you write your piece of code

00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,560
these companies you'll find that someone

00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,480
is

00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:06,640
is like afraid of sharing and they have

00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,760
different examples of like payment apis

00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,680
for instance even in

00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:12,320
in in the country where i mean again i'm

00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:14,880
not going to mention any names

00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:16,720
they're good examples where where they

00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,800
have a version that doesn't work

00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:21,119
but then the developer community has

00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,960
built something that works really well

00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:24,880
but then instead of them even adopting

00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,839
it or eating the humble pie and adopting

00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:28,000
it what they do is

00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:30,800
they'll try and prevent that version

00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:34,880
that works from even working in there

00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:36,800
yeah so so actually

00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:39,599
yeah so we have um can you everybody

00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:42,160
have me yeah they can hear you

00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:43,680
also well we have um you know we're

00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,079
almost running out of time so i'll just

00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,480
ask

00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:47,680
um two more questions um so one is going

00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,560
to be to i need

00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:51,520
and then one general question so um i

00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:55,520
know you were talking about

00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:56,880
um companies before i lost your audio

00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,359
you were talking about how this is kind

00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,599
of a

00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:01,200
open source program office um in

00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:02,640
companies which i think is a very good

00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,640
idea it's something that

00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:06,319
have worked in you know most of this um

00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:10,480
western world like the u.s

00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:13,599
and this tastes like a company um so um

00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:14,160
the open source festival was something

00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:17,440
that

00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:19,920
kind of in my opinion um

00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,960
kind of i don't want to say to that but

00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,920
it enhances

00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:25,280
the passion in some because people have

00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:28,480
the opportunity to

00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:30,319
for some reason to connect um and then

00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,119
we use the particular statement um i

00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:33,040
don't know

00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:34,319
how you see the statement but it's

00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:37,680
something i want to ask

00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:39,040
so as we get to the next video creators

00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:42,079
um

00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:42,079
what is your advice

00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,480
what is the advice when it comes to

00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,760
hiring african talent because most of

00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:49,520
the time i know we've asked this

00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:53,839
question before but i wanted to maybe

00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:55,280
have a little bit of um touching it

00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:57,119
they keep encouraging africans to

00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:58,000
contribute to open source but for some

00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:01,200
reason

00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,200
it's almost impossible to hire africans

00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,240
right so which is something that i'm not

00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,240
really sure why

00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:08,480
why is that that's the problem but

00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:11,520
what's your opinion when it comes to

00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:13,359
the company's carrying

00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:14,400
so i'll be very brief about this i think

00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:16,000
that other people that can answer this

00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,839
question a little bit better than i can

00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,680
um companies just have to do the work

00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:21,200
and they have to invest in it you know

00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:23,760
um

00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:26,560
can any other person hear him yeah i can

00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:28,319
hear an idea here

00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:30,560
so i think some companies just have to

00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:32,000
do the work and they have to make a very

00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:34,480
conscious investment

00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,920
to you know bring in what what you would

00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:37,599
say are these very experienced

00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:39,200
developers like like when people

00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:41,200
start leveling up with open source they

00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:43,839
become international talent right

00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:44,560
and well they could work with anybody

00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:47,520
and they have

00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:48,319
like very much at the beginning the

00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,319
opportunity

00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:51,359
the networking and everything it's just

00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:53,920
so broad

00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:54,720
and at that point you have to value that

00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:57,119
developer

00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:58,720
and you also have to value the culture

00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:59,599
that that sort of developer can bring to

00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,040
your team

00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:03,119
and then when you see opportunities like

00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:05,200
the open source festival whether it's a

00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:06,400
local regional international thing you

00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:10,079
need to get involved

00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:12,480
and you also need to create some kind of

00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:14,319
willingness to understand what this

00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,119
state is about and why you should invest

00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:17,200
in the space

00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:18,720
so i think it's about people companies

00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:21,760
whoever's leading companies

00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:22,720
making that upfront investment better

00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:26,160
understanding

00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:29,119
the space the reason why and adopting

00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:30,960
that sort of culture and like many other

00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:32,960
things we've done in our career with

00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,480
communities and everything you need to

00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,760
learn so you're sort of like

00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:38,319
i think france anybody you just have to

00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:40,880
be humble and then go to the

00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:42,560
people the places the organizations

00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:44,960
where these things have been done

00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,920
learn how to do them perfect them and

00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:49,200
then contribute

00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:49,200
to the community

00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:56,880
and your talent yeah yeah awesome

00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:58,720
yeah so so since we have um i think

00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:02,480
we're almost out of time

00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:02,480
but so this is a rough question

00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:17,760
the um decided to just go crazy and just

00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:19,440
i don't know what happened but thank you

00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:21,200
the discussion has been so great from

00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,960
the from what i've picked up

00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:24,880
i did want to give a little bit of time

00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,680
to answer a couple of questions from the

00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,839
comments

00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:28,880
i saw a couple of people were asking so

00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:32,720
that we have

00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:35,680
uh some some input as well um

00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:36,720
did anyone want to re reiterate a

00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:40,160
comment

00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:40,800
a question i know that david has just

00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,400
said

00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:44,160
is there a feeling that the massive

00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:46,400
increase in remote working

00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:48,640
caused by the ongoing pandemic is going

00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:50,480
to make it easier to get hired

00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:52,560
has anyone applied for a remote position

00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:53,839
recently and i think hiring is such a

00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,880
key part of the conversation i think

00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:57,680
that maybe you

00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:58,400
touched on that briefly in terms of you

00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,680
know if

00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:02,079
people are going to be giving to

00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:04,800
companies by contributing to open source

00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:06,800
are those companies providing value as

00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,560
well to the community by hiring them

00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:12,000
right back and so

00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:14,480
do you think that um you know in this

00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,920
season are there going to be more hires

00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:18,240
because of the remote work

00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:21,280
uh that has come with the pandemic so

00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:21,280
does anyone have any on

00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:39,680
yeah i need you can go ahead it's just

00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:42,880
just a yes

00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:44,640
yeah i mean i think i mentioned i look

00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:47,359
at strategy and i it's an open source

00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:50,319
company i was an open source contributor

00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:51,920
um before and i got hired remotely and i

00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:53,839
think that's something we've done

00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:55,920
we just shared a blog post about one of

00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:59,119
our most active community members

00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:01,119
derek from who's been a

00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:03,839
very active contributor for three years

00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:05,440
and we've hired him remotely so i think

00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:08,319
everything going on really is

00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:08,960
accelerating and helping fuel remote

00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:10,400
hiring

00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:12,079
so there's definitely a lot more

00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,119
opportunities open to people around the

00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:17,200
world

00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:19,119
and open source is a really good entry

00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:21,280
something that can yeah with that

00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:23,359
exactly i congratulations i know you

00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:26,000
just got hired which is exciting

00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:26,480
i know sultan you also just recently

00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,920
joined

00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:30,160
a company that you're working with

00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:33,760
remotely do you want to talk about that

00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:37,520
a little bit as well

00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:39,440
what's what we'll do at gone through

00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:40,880
you know like a driveway the philippine

00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,599
missions manager has gone for the whip

00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,119
something like that

00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:44,839
and those are the barcelona for the

00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:47,839
world and what we're doing

00:45:44,839 --> 00:45:47,839
we're

00:45:55,359 --> 00:46:01,760
and my own particular job is to support

00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:03,599
the adoption of publicization in africa

00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,800
saying something at that time that for

00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:05,520
companies that want to go into

00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,520
absolutely

00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:09,040
intentional about it this is exactly

00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:11,440
what impression that means

00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:13,280
i mean i'm in africa i'm not in africa i

00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:15,359
work in africa and that's why i'm

00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:16,880
focusing on the african part i mean some

00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:18,319
other companies could have just said oh

00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:20,079
let's just get somebody and say the best

00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:21,040
thing is i'm in africa so i mean you're

00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:22,319
not enough you don't know what the

00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:24,079
chinese people are facing they don't

00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:25,200
know what the content photos in africa

00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:26,480
are faces so

00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:29,040
the best person for the world would be

00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:31,200
somebody that the ecosystem

00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:32,640
so that's been intentional and this is i

00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:34,319
work with an amazing team

00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:36,079
and we've been we have a lot of plans

00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:38,640
coming up for content creators

00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:39,520
now in terms of content creators we

00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:41,440
developers

00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:43,920
are like we are at the middle of

00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:46,480
everything because we are consumers

00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:48,240
and we are creators also i mean you

00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:50,000
really write articles that is work with

00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:51,599
us and we also consume articles we can

00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,599
zoom to your videos

00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:56,000
and podcast that means we are also users

00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:59,119
also so my workout is to

00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,800
make sure that you get paid for con for

00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:03,599
attending curtin contents here

00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:04,560
and the word open source in my work is

00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:06,160
the fact that

00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:11,839
recommendation is very interesting i've

00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:11,839
written kind of

00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:15,760
i don't know if it's just me did sultan

00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:19,440
just freeze

00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:21,599
yeah i think he he dropped me oh

00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:25,839
africa this is the reason why they are

00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:25,839
not hiring us

00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:35,119
the issues are universal to be honest

00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,760
it's really just exacerbated on the

00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:38,960
continent

00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:41,760
because you yeah

00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:44,079
i know uh so david had a question he

00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:46,160
said how are people taught what open

00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:46,960
source projects are best to use to solve

00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,880
specific

00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:50,480
problems so we know that open source

00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:54,400
technology is usually

00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:57,119
the best technology to use but uh

00:47:54,400 --> 00:48:00,640
which ones are the correct ones to use

00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:00,640
does anyone have an answer to that

00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:04,640
like in terms of as we consume open

00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:06,319
source software yes frank

00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:09,119
let's go to trade up front yeah so let

00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:12,480
me are you touching that

00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:13,839
so i i i think i think i think

00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:16,000
let me give a good example from from

00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:20,559
something that is more homegrown

00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:24,240
and that is that is that would be um

00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:26,160
so there was different so shahid does it

00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:30,319
helps with disaster management it's just

00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:31,920
in very few ways and so you will see

00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:33,520
initially when it started off there are

00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:35,839
all these contributions and so

00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:37,760
the best way i think as a metrics for me

00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:38,800
is when you look at the number of people

00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:40,319
who are contributing

00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,920
to the project itself that's usually

00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:44,480
number one number two is

00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:46,319
do they have um like with these open

00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:48,480
source projects do they have use cases

00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:49,520
and and i draw this example from me who

00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:51,200
is in software is

00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:52,880
any new software that's released out

00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:54,000
there they will have something to do

00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:56,880
with a showcase

00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,720
or where it's being applied um one of

00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:00,559
the times is if you if you don't see a

00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:02,400
use case there if you look at those use

00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:04,240
cases there or if you approach those

00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,520
companies or various kind of solutions

00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,559
that have been built based on that open

00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:08,960
source technology

00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:10,800
and you ask them this question um it's

00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:12,720
usually easy for them to give you like

00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,200
direct replies and i can give an example

00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:15,280
of

00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:16,400
right now even at my place of work um we

00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:17,599
have these technologies that they're

00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,440
using so sometimes

00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:21,040
we have to sort of like stretch the

00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,400
boundaries of our imagination just to

00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:24,800
build software and code

00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:28,160
and so we have sometimes it forces you

00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:28,160
to actually reach out to a certain

00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:32,240
i have seen you using organization

00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:34,319
what's your experience with using it

00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:35,760
and and the beauty is if they are using

00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:37,119
something that is open source they

00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:38,319
actually give you feedback

00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:39,599
and they're not they don't take it as

00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:40,800
this is something proprietary so i'm

00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:42,559
going to die

00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:44,079
um and also what for me it's like i look

00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:45,599
at the use cases and i think i've seen

00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:47,440
most policies

00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:49,200
and they say hey let's adopt this and

00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:50,640
it's so fascinating how that solution

00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,280
that has been developed here in africa

00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:55,760
is being used

00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:55,760
globally um to do different instances

00:49:56,079 --> 00:50:00,400
yeah very cool that's a great answer um

00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:03,200
i don't know dd

00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,599
i know that you also contribute quite a

00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:07,200
bit

00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:09,440
as well to open source and for you

00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:10,640
what makes you drawn to a project to

00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:12,720
contribute on your

00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:14,880
end like why did you choose the projects

00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:18,079
that you chose

00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:21,599
yeah so for me it's the community really

00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:24,000
so if i try to at some point i try to

00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:24,960
join different open source organizations

00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,359
and try to see

00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:28,720
how active they are in their forums

00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:29,599
because i think that is really important

00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:33,440
because

00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:35,359
you may you respond to like one week

00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:37,680
i understand that people are busy so

00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:39,119
maybe a few days is fine and i'm also

00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:40,880
really patient so i know that

00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:42,800
most of these open source maintainers

00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:45,200
are actually volunteers as well

00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:46,720
but we also need people to be able to

00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:48,559
respond to our questions

00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:50,400
as soon as they can maybe like in a span

00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:52,400
of um one week which is not probably

00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:54,480
terrible so that's those are the things

00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:57,119
i actually look out for okay

00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:58,800
yeah open source organization cool the

00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:00,400
people they are just supportive

00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:02,319
um because most time being contributed

00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:03,760
to open source a lot of things may not

00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:05,040
really make sense immediately so you

00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:06,319
need to ask questions

00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:08,160
so are they willing to answer your

00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:09,280
questions how are they answering those

00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:11,520
questions they're answering it

00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:14,000
like it would be trying to make you feel

00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:16,240
dumb more dumb than you thought you were

00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:19,119
or they do anything like a really cool

00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:21,680
way as well i also i also look out uh

00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:22,880
sudan as well so i think these are like

00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:25,920
the most important things i

00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:28,400
look out for and again um sometimes i

00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:30,079
contribute to open source projects that

00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:31,760
i've probably used once or twice or

00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:33,119
maybe i've heard a lot about the project

00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:34,559
and i just find i find it really

00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:34,960
interesting like what you're actually

00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:36,880
doing

00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:38,079
so let's say vlc for instance i'm using

00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:39,839
i've been using the app

00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:42,000
like since i was like in secondary

00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:43,520
school um so like being able to

00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,400
contribute to it is exciting because i

00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:46,640
know that i have

00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:48,319
impact like i've benefited from this

00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:49,839
open source organization one way or the

00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:50,400
other so it's also kind of the process

00:51:49,839 --> 00:51:52,319
of

00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:53,920
maybe giving back as well like okay hey

00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:55,760
you did this for me you are doing this

00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:58,800
for free for like so many people

00:51:55,760 --> 00:52:02,079
so let me also like help as well

00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:03,760
yeah oh that's awesome um

00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:07,040
thank you for that that's that makes a

00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:08,960
lot of sense um i know that aniti

00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:10,480
wants to respond to michael i don't know

00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:12,720
what michael said or

00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:14,960
what do you want to respond to yeah so i

00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:17,680
i think michael was referencing

00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:18,960
um lucille and it was like an argument

00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:20,400
can be made that contributing to open

00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:22,960
sources

00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:24,800
you know it's too free on paid level and

00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:27,200
three for people with privilege

00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:28,800
um everything is hard for beginners to

00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:30,160
be honest it has to be made easy for

00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,119
beginners if you wanted to jump into

00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:33,200
android development

00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:34,720
or machine learning or even just basic

00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:36,400
css i try to read

00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:38,000
these articles on css and i always get

00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:41,920
lost i just close them and they

00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:43,680
go to the next admin a conscious f1 has

00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:44,559
to be made to make it easy for beginners

00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:46,720
and i think

00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:48,480
a lot do a lot of stuff to make sure you

00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:49,839
can make your first contribution and try

00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:51,119
to encourage you to say even if it's

00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:52,480
just documentation

00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:54,319
it's great and then when you have

00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:55,200
programs like maybe system of docs or

00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:57,280
summer of code

00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:59,520
or any other programs there's usually an

00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:00,640
entry level for beginners so

00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:03,359
i don't think there's anything that is

00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:06,000
really extremely easy for beginners

00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:07,680
um free on paid label and people with

00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,920
privileged time and money

00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:10,800
um i think um samsung you've got a lot

00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:13,359
of work to do

00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:15,200
in sort of helping educate and give

00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:16,079
people a lot more information about the

00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:17,839
culture

00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:20,319
because i think the culture of

00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:22,079
entitlement and instant gratification

00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:24,160
are two things i've i've been spending a

00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:25,680
lot of my time trying to get developers

00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:27,359
to understand that

00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:28,960
nothing comes easy you know we have

00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:31,359
these ones um it takes

00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:33,359
20 years to become an overnight boxer so

00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:34,480
it's not very different in open class

00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:37,359
i think there's just a lot of

00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:39,119
orientation that needs to be done

00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:40,640
and then forums like this where people

00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:43,680
who have experience

00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:44,400
with the um the ecosystem on the

00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:46,800
community

00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:48,960
or just the discipline can come back and

00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:51,359
tell you that it all looks nice and rosy

00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:53,760
right now but five years ago when i

00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:57,599
started seven years ago when i started

00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:59,280
this is the only route so it may look

00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:01,760
hard for beginners it may look like free

00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:04,160
on paid label but if you can take away

00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:05,359
entitlement and need for instant

00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:07,599
gratification

00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:08,800
you can you can eventually get the

00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:10,480
benefits from

00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:11,920
from from open source on the open source

00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:15,599
community

00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:17,520
that's awesome yeah um so samson

00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:18,800
thank i just want to first say thank you

00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:20,880
to samson for
