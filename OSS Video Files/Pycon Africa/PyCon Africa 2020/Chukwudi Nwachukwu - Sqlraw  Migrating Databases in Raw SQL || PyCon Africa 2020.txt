Description: 
	Sqlraw aims to help anyone write DB migrations for PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB & SQLite (and more, yet to come)Since it does not have any attachment to any Python web framework, it is easy to use for development in any framework of choice and even use it for other programming languages.

It is a Python CLI that is lovely to work with. There are many utilities in it that aims to make the developer work easy by shortening the time spent developing applications.

You will not face the many challenges that arise as a result of writing tests for your application since you can test the DB queries independently of the main application itself.
