thank you all so much for coming to the

00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,279
session about the innovation

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:24,400
ninja uh i really appreciate it

00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:26,960
um so to start off uh

00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,160
i'm gonna challenge you to grab two

00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,080
things okay

00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,599
so the first thing that you're going to

00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,040
grab is going to be something that

00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:36,480
begins with the first

00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:38,640
letter of your first name so for example

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:42,160
my name is amber and i brought

00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,719
my breakfast i brought an apple um so

00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,920
a for apple a for amber the second thing

00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,960
i want you to grab

00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,079
is an item that begins with the first

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,480
letter of your

00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,879
last name so mine's a little bit tricky

00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:58,800
i have a last name of vanderburgh

00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:02,000
but i found a vinyl record

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:05,119
so i have a for amber a for apple

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,360
v for vandenberg b for vinyl so i'm

00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:10,640
going to give you just a second to

00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,000
grab those two items that begin with the

00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:16,720
first letter of your first name

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,720
first letter of your last name ready go

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:25,920
you got five seconds four

00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:29,119
three two one stuff

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,439
all right uh let's see if you can

00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,720
uh i know we're not on video share but

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,560
if you can put in the chat

00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,240
the two things that you got for your

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:41,840
first name and your last

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:41,840
name uh the two things that you have

00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,360
it didn't give you a lot of time you

00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,360
have to be really creative

00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:57,119
i know michael has a y in his last name

00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,799
a mug only y is a hard last name

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,520
i wonder what a y thing is that you

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,520
could grab

00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,640
anyone else have something that they

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,399
grab that began with the first letter of

00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,200
their first name or the first letter of

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,200
their last name

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,360
two one yeah

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,120
uh that can be it can be kind of a

00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,160
difficult uh

00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,720
a a difficult challenge but

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,000
here we say i couldn't go get the second

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,360
thing what did you get for the first

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,280
thing you have a mouse

00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,280
oh my gosh i hope it's not a live mouse

00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:42,720
i gotta drive okay awesome

00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:46,000
awesome so great see i got an apple

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:49,680
because in my family i am the apple

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,959
of my grandfather's eye so i'm the apple

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,840
of his eye and i got

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,519
a vinyl record because i love music and

00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,599
so those are two things about me

00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,000
and see this is a really simple way that

00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:03,120
you can begin your meetings within

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,280
your teams or organizations and finding

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,640
in this time uh some of us are

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,480
experiencing a little bit of

00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:13,280
zoom fatigue uh or screen fatigue

00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,280
and uh one challenge that many teams are

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,519
facing is bringing the personality and

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,000
bringing the human side back to

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,159
our team meetings and so this is a fun

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,200
way just to begin your meetings

00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:27,280
uh yourself

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,040
it kind of gets our innovative juices

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,680
flowing and

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,080
it allows us to engage in conversation

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,560
again

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,560
right from the get-go as i said my name

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,920
is amber vandenberg and i

00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,360
am from tulsa oklahoma i'm the founder

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,239
of the pathways group

00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,080
and so we do leadership development and

00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,239
team building consulting

00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,599
all over the world we work with teams to

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,879
help them perform

00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:55,680
uh more efficiently more effectively and

00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,640
more enjoyably as well so that's kind of

00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,040
what we do

00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,080
and we begin our meetings with fun

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,120
activities like this

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,080
because we are again trying to solve

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,799
that problem of

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,159
making meetings more enjoyable and when

00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:11,519
it comes to innovation

00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:12,799
this really is the beginning of where we

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,519
should start

00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,959
see whenever we are seeking to be

00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:20,479
innovative we first must

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:23,840
clearly identify what problem we are

00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:26,639
actually solving see if you want to be

00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,880
innovative for innovative sake and if

00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,440
you want an answer then you'll probably

00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,040
find an answer but if we're not asking

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,759
the right questions and

00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,840
clearly identifying what that problem is

00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,960
then the answer that we receive

00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:44,160
might not be the solution that we seek

00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:46,560
it's so imperative that we are asking

00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,840
the right questions and clearly

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,120
identifying

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:54,240
what problems we are solving in

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:57,199
our innovation initiatives and

00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,320
generally whenever i uh begin working

00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,720
with teams in those

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,400
innovative methods and we are clearly

00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,120
defining that problem

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,000
i find that within teams innovation

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,680
challenges

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,320
come down to three major uh three major

00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,800
challenges three major categories

00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:17,039
and see in these different categories

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:20,080
it's going to dramatically affect the

00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:21,440
methods that we use in our innovation

00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,000
strategy

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,440
the first type of challenge that we face

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,280
within a team

00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:32,720
is to fix an existing problem

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,039
so if we already have an existing system

00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,320
or

00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:38,080
product or service and there is a

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,639
problem there is something that we need

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,120
to fix and whenever we are faced with

00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,120
this

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,639
type of challenge and this type of

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,280
problem solving

00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,000
um the next step that we can take is

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,120
more of a

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,280
causal analysis this is when we can ask

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,840
questions to really

00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,560
come down to the root of what that

00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,400
problem is

00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:03,440
and what specifically we are fixing

00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,400
see the next type of challenge that many

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,319
teams face

00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,680
and the type of problem solving that we

00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,960
face is

00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:14,800
to improve or to progress an

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:17,759
existing system or product

00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,240
and these are really the two major types

00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,440
of

00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:24,400
problem solving or innovation strategies

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,759
that teams will face either we're fixing

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,520
an existing problem

00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,680
in which case it's so important to do

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,880
more of a causal analysis

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:36,319
or we are evolving or we are

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:38,720
progressing an existing system

00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,680
or product and oftentimes in this

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,240
scenario

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,199
we are doing a little bit of value

00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,680
engineering

00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,039
and asking questions on what

00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,400
specifically

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:51,280
is going well within this certain

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,560
product

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,880
uh what can we improve upon it's for

00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,759
this reason that we have an iphone five

00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,800
six seven eight nine all right every

00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,520
single time

00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,720
there is a progress there is an uh there

00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,080
is more of the

00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:10,080
evolving in that product or service and

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,240
we will face these types of problem

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,199
solvings for a few different reasons it

00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,840
could be to

00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,639
meet government regulations it could be

00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,039
to

00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,840
stay up on competitive advantage it

00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,960
could be to

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,759
increase customer loyalty there's a few

00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,280
different reasons

00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:29,919
why we would um progress and

00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,440
evolve in our systems and products but

00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,639
clearly value engineering

00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,120
is going to be a little bit different

00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:38,000
than a causal analysis and so

00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:41,120
it's important that we first identify

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,080
what types of problems we're solving

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,520
the third type of problem solving is to

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,560
create something

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,000
totally new and so in these scenarios i

00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,879
think of companies like

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,840
disney and edison and they are creating

00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:57,599
something that is

00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:59,120
entirely new and the systems that you

00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,199
and the approach that you'll make in

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,360
these scenarios um

00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,400
are going to be a little bit different

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,199
uh generally

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,599
in that scenario uh a good friend of

00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,720
mine

00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:14,000
jim belafor he uh highly recommends

00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:17,759
uh tris which is t-r-i-z

00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,520
and that is a very common way that

00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,520
leads you through the methods of

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:25,039
creating new product

00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,240
all together and that was a lot of

00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:29,280
information but

00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,400
see so often times whenever teams and

00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,839
organizations

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:35,120
come into a war room where they come

00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,159
into a room to be

00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,240
extremely innovative we want to

00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:42,240
uh almost romanticize and come up with

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,320
very creative ideas but

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,279
again if we want answers we'll get

00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,040
answers

00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:49,200
but if we're not asking the right

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,200
questions then those answers

00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,560
might not be the solutions that we're

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,000
actually seeking

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,640
we must first above all else take the

00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,839
time to

00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:01,200
truly identify what problem we are

00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,360
actually solving

00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,200
and that will affect the methods that we

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,600
use to

00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,800
move forward in our innovation methods

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,519
and it will help us

00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,560
clearly define our success measures on

00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:16,240
the back end

00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:18,399
of of our project so

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,839
again recap you're going to either be

00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,839
fixing an existing

00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,680
problem product or system you're going

00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,839
to be improving or progressing upon an

00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:28,320
existing product problem or system

00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:29,440
or you're going to be creating something

00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,519
entirely

00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:36,800
new now whenever we

00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:38,800
come after we have identified these

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,800
uh what type of problem we are solving

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,839
and what types of methods that we

00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:46,240
are going to use to move forward in

00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,440
being successful in this innovation

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,240
initiative

00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,279
then oftentimes we will all come

00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,839
together

00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,959
whether that be in a physical room or in

00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,279
this new landscape

00:09:54,959 --> 00:10:00,399
in more of a virtual room and we will

00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:03,120
come in more of a collaborative sense

00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:06,240
and to really come up with uh different

00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:10,079
ways to solve these problems

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:13,680
but there are three major balances

00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:16,480
that we can seek within our

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,600
team dynamic and within our team

00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,120
environment

00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:24,000
to really increase the innovation

00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,360
within our teams and see the first type

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,800
of balance that we can see

00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:32,320
within our team dynamic is within

00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:35,920
flow now flow is a concept that is

00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,040
by a man named mihaishi mihai i think i

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,680
said that right

00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,920
and he's a psychologist that writes that

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:45,680
it's important that we find a balance

00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:47,519
between the ability of our team and our

00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:51,040
current ability that we have

00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:54,720
and the challenge of what we can take on

00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:58,399
for example if i am wanting to

00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,800
bake um then then i have to acknowledge

00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,079
that

00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:05,279
my current ability to make food

00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:08,480
is like making toast and so

00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:10,880
taking on a five course meal uh might be

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,519
a little bit overwhelming it might be

00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,640
beyond

00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:17,279
my current ability whereas if i

00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,480
am see and in that scenario i'm more

00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:21,200
likely to get

00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,920
frustrated and to get disheartened and

00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,680
to not

00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,920
complete the task in the same regard if

00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,279
i

00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:31,519
am a very well-known chef and i

00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:33,920
uh work for a massive restaurant and

00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:36,480
then i'm tasked with making toast

00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,959
then in that same regard i'm more likely

00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,600
to get

00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:41,120
bored and to get a little bit frustrated

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,399
and disinterested

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:47,600
and in either scenario you

00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:49,839
are less likely to enter into that flow

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,920
state where you've met that balance

00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:55,200
between ability

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:57,519
and challenge and so as we're working

00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,720
together as a team it's important to

00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:03,440
uh do a quick assessment as to what our

00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,959
current ability is what are your recent

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,440
accomplishments and

00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:08,160
then looking at the challenge as well

00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,680
and so

00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,760
being able to create an environment

00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:15,200
where you're more likely to enter in

00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:17,839
to that flow state

00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:20,560
uh the next sort of balance that you are

00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:23,040
looking for within your team dynamic

00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,160
to really increase that innovation

00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,320
within your team

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,160
is to find a balance between the

00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:31,200
constraints and the limits

00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:34,240
within your team now there's a myth

00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:36,959
that within a team if there are

00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,000
no constraints and there are no limits

00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,320
then we have a

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,160
totally blank slate and we can be as

00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,560
creative as possible

00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,920
but research actually shows that those

00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,959
limits and constraints

00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:51,760
actually can increase innovation

00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:53,120
it gives us more of a framework to work

00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,920
around and it can

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,399
uh narrow that scope within our work and

00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,120
so

00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,880
having some sort of limits and knowing

00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,760
what those constraints are within your

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,200
team

00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:08,639
are really uh important and can

00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:11,360
actually be beneficial to the innovation

00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,920
within your organization at the same

00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,079
time

00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,920
we want to find a balance because if we

00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:17,920
go on the other extreme and provide

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,240
all sorts of constraints then that can

00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:23,200
be a bit crippling as well so we want to

00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,279
seek to have that balance of identifying

00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,480
what our limitations are what the

00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:30,079
constraints are

00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:33,519
within the scope of that project

00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:34,480
so that you can have a clearly defined

00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:38,240
framework

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,600
to work within and so again finding that

00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,920
balance within

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,199
those constraints and identifying

00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:47,440
clearly identifying

00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:49,279
what that framework is can be extremely

00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,639
extremely helpful as you are moving

00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,399
forward

00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,240
and then the third area of balance that

00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:56,560
you can seek within your

00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,320
uh building your environment is within

00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:01,279
your feedback loops

00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,720
now most of you probably know quite a

00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:05,360
bit about feedback loops

00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,720
um working within uh working within

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,600
devops and working within

00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,360
uh your team in your organization but

00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,360
whenever i'm talking about feedback

00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,720
loops i'm talking about really in that

00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,760
ideation phase

00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:20,480
as you are coming up with ideas to over

00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:22,399
uh to solve these challenges and to

00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,120
solve these problems

00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:26,079
and there is a balance between allowing

00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,279
space

00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:32,320
for ideas to be fully said um

00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:35,440
and to be formated uh

00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,680
formulated to some extent before they

00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,040
are

00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,720
shut down so there is a balance between

00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,160
if i'm coming up with an idea and i've

00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,600
said the first few words and then it

00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,320
gets shut down and we do that over and

00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,440
over again

00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:50,399
that can actually lessen

00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,800
the freedom that a team member can feel

00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,639
to

00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:55,199
share those ideas and to enter into

00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,959
their most innovative self and so we

00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:59,279
want to allow a space

00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:00,160
where ideas can be fully said before we

00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,880
are shutting

00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,680
uh those ideas down so quickly in the

00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,680
same regard

00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,279
we also want to have a balance within

00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,120
that feedback loop so we're not

00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:11,279
going with the first idea and running

00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,440
all the way with the with one idea

00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:15,760
before we come back and give that

00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:18,560
feedback to assess whether or not

00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:20,320
that is the most uh the best idea to

00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,320
move forward within your team so

00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,839
it's important to have some sort of

00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,399
balance within

00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:28,399
those feedback loops especially in the

00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:31,600
ideation phase talking about

00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:34,800
in your brainstorming room uh

00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,959
especially in identifying how you're

00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,839
going to give that feedback

00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:41,120
in a very timely manner so that people

00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:44,800
have the freedom

00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:46,639
to share those ideas but then also you

00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,959
are giving timely feedback

00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,880
uh if you need to if you would like to

00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,800
move forward with one idea or

00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,360
maybe come back and assess a few other

00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:58,320
ideas so looking at those feedback loops

00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,519
is so critical especially in that

00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,680
ideation phase

00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,959
as you are coming up with the most

00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,839
innovative way to

00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:08,720
solve your to solve these challenges and

00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:11,440
the problems that are presented to us

00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,000
and so finding balance within these

00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,680
three

00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,120
uh three things is really really

00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,480
important

00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:21,839
and as we are working within our teams

00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,040
uh i generally work within their team

00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:26,399
dynamics

00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,959
see oftentimes whenever we are coming up

00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,120
with

00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:30,240
innovative ideas whenever we are being

00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,720
creative

00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,560
many times these ideas they come from

00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,600
our own mind and they're very

00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:40,800
personal to us

00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:43,120
and we can and we invest

00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,639
a lot of ourselves into these innovation

00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,680
methods and into these

00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:50,000
innovation initiatives and

00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,800
one thing that i work with teams is

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,560
assessing

00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:58,800
the team dynamics and how we can work

00:16:54,560 --> 00:17:02,000
together as a team to

00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:04,559
really maximize the value of

00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,720
the collaboration within these

00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:10,000
innovation methods

00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,520
now whenever i assess team dynamics i do

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,880
a couple things

00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:17,360
that are very specific and very catered

00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,240
to the ideation phase to the

00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,199
implementation

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,000
phase of your innovation methods in your

00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,000
team

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,280
so one of the first things that i do

00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,640
whenever i

00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:31,919
come into a team um depending on the

00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:34,559
team dynamic is i will do an assessment

00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:37,120
now this can look a little bit different

00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:38,559
depending on how long the team has been

00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,039
together if this is a

00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,640
new project if this is a similar project

00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:44,720
that they've done before if this is an

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,280
entirely new organization

00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:49,600
so i look at those dynamics to assess

00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:52,960
which assessment is going to

00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:55,039
be the most productive for the team

00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,799
but generally uh whenever i'm coming

00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:59,679
into a newer team

00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:00,559
i will ask all of the members to pull

00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:04,559
out

00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:06,480
an index card and on the

00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:08,480
front side of the card i'll have them

00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,440
right a couple of the strengths that

00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,080
they can bring

00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,559
to the team and so it'll be you know

00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,200
just

00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:16,000
three or four different attributes that

00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,559
they can bring

00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,200
to the team and then on the opposite

00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:21,280
side

00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,240
i will have all of the team members

00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,760
write something

00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:28,000
that they wish somebody else in the team

00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,360
can contribute so what is the strength

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,080
that you really wish

00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,520
somebody else on the team has i'll give

00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,559
you an example

00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:39,760
whenever i come into a team i am a

00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:42,320
big visionary person i can see the

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:45,600
forest but not always the trees

00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:48,559
um i have a lot of energy and i can

00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,679
see the big picture but on my opposite

00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:53,280
side of the card i

00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:55,679
always really want someone that has

00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,799
um has more of a detailed mind so

00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,039
someone that can

00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:00,320
really see those details and to follow

00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:03,440
through

00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,799
and this will identify ways that we can

00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,280
complement each other

00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:08,160
and also areas in which we might have

00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,640
conflict

00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,360
see i might have uh we might have

00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,799
tension

00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:17,200
in uh we might have tension in that

00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:19,039
she is frustrated that i don't see the

00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,080
details and i can be frustrated that she

00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:22,720
doesn't see

00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:25,600
the uh larger picture but will

00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:28,640
complement each other in this way

00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:31,360
and so i will uh

00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,120
yeah it's always it's always now

00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,559
difficult to know how to integrate that

00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:38,000
innovation within your work

00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:40,960
and so um what i'll do is i'll begin

00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
having that proactive conversation with

00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,280
the team member

00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,280
before the tension even even begins

00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,039
so we've already identified areas for

00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,679
complement and areas for

00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:53,760
possible conflict and so i engage in

00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:55,840
proactive conversations

00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:58,320
and proactive conversations is again

00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:01,919
about a five-minute conversation

00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:04,960
but is so powerful it goes like this

00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:07,039
at some point in this relationship

00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,880
there's probably going to be tension

00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:11,360
it's probably going to be heat

00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,679
not only that we're talking very

00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,960
specifically in areas that we perceive

00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:18,240
that there might be

00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:21,440
a future future conflict and so

00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:23,679
while the emotions are low now

00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,159
let us proactively discuss how we're

00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:29,039
going to handle this

00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:30,559
and that's it that's the conversation

00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:33,280
but it is so powerful

00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:34,080
because it does two things first it

00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,440
normalizes

00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:39,840
conflict a lot of times we

00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,600
teams do not want to address conflict

00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,880
because they don't want to admit that a

00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,840
problem is there they don't want to

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,880
admit that

00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:48,559
there has been conflict but through a

00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:52,240
proactive conversation

00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:55,520
we are acknowledging that not only is

00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:58,080
conflict normal it's actually expected

00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:00,960
within our team so the first thing is it

00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:03,280
that it does is it sets an expectation

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,880
the next thing is that it provides a

00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,960
script and a game plan

00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,960
so not only do i expect that this is

00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,440
probably going to happen in the future

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,799
i already know the next steps on what

00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,520
i'm going to do

00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:16,000
uh whenever those tensions arise those

00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,880
proactive

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,520
conversations are so critical within a

00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,799
team

00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:25,360
um and so i do that whenever i go into

00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:26,320
these ideation methods because i'm able

00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:29,600
to then

00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,960
identify those team dynamics and be very

00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:34,480
proactive in how

00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:37,679
we can best collaborate

00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:39,039
as we progress and move forward there's

00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:41,840
a couple other

00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:42,720
activities again i'll take only a couple

00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:46,880
minutes

00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:49,600
that you can use to assess team dynamics

00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,000
and that you can use to better cater

00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,799
your

00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,520
communication style or your leadership

00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:56,400
style

00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,440
whenever you are working within a team

00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,640
to

00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:02,559
not only come up with in the ideation

00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,679
phase but also in the implementation

00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:06,720
phase

00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:09,840
of implementing these ideas

00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,600
one really simple activity that i use is

00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:14,880
whenever i come into a meeting

00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:16,240
i'll ask very simple questions so if you

00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,799
prefer

00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,400
um if you prefer to be communicated

00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:23,520
communication to be

00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,799
more on zoom or phone call move to the

00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:28,320
right side of your screen

00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:30,640
if you prefer more email or text message

00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,600
move to the left side and if you have a

00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,799
gallery view

00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:36,080
on your um on your zoom meetings then

00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,200
that will give you a really quick

00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,919
snapshot of

00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,120
preferred communication style you can

00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:44,159
ask

00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:46,320
questions of if somebody prefers

00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:47,200
more morning meetings or more evening

00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,280
meetings and

00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,120
asking questions like this will again

00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:53,919
give you quick snapshot

00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,120
dynamics a snapshot of what the dynamics

00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:57,200
are within your team

00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,240
and give you a good idea of how you can

00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,720
cater the

00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:04,400
collaboration uh on these innovation

00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:06,640
methods within your team dynamics

00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,000
uh so those are yeah just a few

00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:11,520
different things that you can use

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:15,039
within your team and within your

00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:17,840
uh organization to identify those skills

00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:18,960
so these are more preferences that we've

00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,760
spoken and a lot of

00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,640
insights so these are what um what i

00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,559
perceive

00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,000
my strengths are this is what my

00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:28,720
preferences are

00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,120
but i'm going to give you one activity

00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,320
that

00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:35,440
you can use uh last activity to

00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:37,840
assess these team dynamics within

00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,200
your organization and for that i'm going

00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:44,240
to ask everyone to

00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:44,240
grab a piece of paper and a writing

00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:52,000
utensil

00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,760
and in that piece of paper and on that

00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,480
writing utensil i'm going to give you a

00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:58,720
challenge

00:23:54,480 --> 00:24:01,760
see i'm going to give you 60 seconds

00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:06,080
i'm going to give you 75 seconds and

00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:09,600
in that 75 seconds i want you to draw

00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:12,720
as many circle item objects

00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:14,000
as you can alright don't begin yet wait

00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,120
till i say go

00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:20,880
but in 75 seconds i want you to draw

00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:24,000
as many circle item objects

00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:25,520
so objects that are circle as you can

00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,240
wait just a second for you to get your

00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,240
pen and paper

00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:39,840
ready set go

00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:39,840
circle item objects as you can

00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:50,799
how many can you do

00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:50,799
circle item objects

00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:01,840
you are about halfway

00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:15,840
halfway in your circle item objects

00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:29,840
you have about 15 seconds left

00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:40,960
five seconds

00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:47,679
two one stop stop stop stop put the

00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:50,960
pencil down put the pencil down

00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,760
all right so um does anyone want to

00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,720
share in the chat

00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:57,840
some of the things that they drew some

00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,840
of the circle item objects

00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:08,400
generally whenever i uh do this activity

00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:12,559
within tn some people draw

00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,559
uh most people go within themes

00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:18,000
yes okay so clock ring coin metal

00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:18,960
plate some people will draw apple

00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,600
oranges

00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:29,200
uh football uh basketball baseball

00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:29,200
mickey mouse i've seen quite a few bb-8s

00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:36,720
so this was not a lot of time this was

00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,799
an activity that took

00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,840
a little over a minute uh sometimes i

00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:41,919
give teams you know

00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:44,320
closer to two minutes but i keep it

00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:47,440
within a very short time frame

00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:48,320
and there are some individuals within

00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,400
your team

00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:52,320
uh generally whenever i do this in about

00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,400
a minute and a half um

00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,840
again i'm more of a big picture person

00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:59,120
and so i draw

00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:00,799
honestly between 23 and 27 generally uh

00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:04,559
whenever i do this

00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:07,760
activity however

00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:08,640
in the way that i will ideate a lot of

00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,440
ideas

00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,760
is i will come up with a lot of ideas

00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,960
with

00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:16,080
very few details so um while i will say

00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,440
that there are a lot of different things

00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,840
it really just looks like a lot of

00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:23,039
circles so there's not a lot of detail

00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:25,279
in the pictures on the other hand

00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:27,440
there are other people within the team

00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:29,520
that will do these same activities

00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:32,320
and while i will come up with closer to

00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:35,520
23 they might come up with closer to

00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:38,799
a four or five but they'll have

00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:42,080
more detail and they will have

00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:43,360
more uh more detail and more thought and

00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,679
and actually be thought through a little

00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:47,200
bit differently and again this is a

00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:50,240
quick way that you can assess

00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:53,279
these team dynamics um to

00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:55,600
see okay who's a little bit more on the

00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:56,399
strategic thinking the detail orienting

00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,520
there's a little

00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:00,080
a little bit more on the um big picture

00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,480
side

00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:04,000
and these two can complement each other

00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,640
quite a bit

00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,240
uh especially when it comes to uh seeing

00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,640
that big picture on the implementation

00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,960
side

00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:13,440
but then also knowing those details and

00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:16,159
knowing the next step and the strategy

00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,039
within the team and so doing activities

00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:19,600
like this

00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:20,960
uh not only are they kind of fun uh but

00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,919
they give a really

00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,640
clear indication about how your brain

00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:26,960
will work

00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,480
uh your brain can work and within uh

00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,120
your team dynamic

00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,240
to again assess how those team dynamics

00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:35,360
are and how you can

00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,640
better adjust i'll give an example i was

00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:40,559
working with one team

00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:42,559
where most of the team members were

00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:45,600
very strategic very detail-oriented and

00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:48,320
they wanted more of a

00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:49,520
activity like this uh wasn't really

00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:52,320
their preference of

00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,120
giving an example for ideation so

00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,799
quickly

00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:57,279
and so whenever we would come into

00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:59,279
meetings um i would actually send an

00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:02,480
email 24 hours before

00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:03,679
to give um to give a heads up on what we

00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,399
were going to be

00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:06,960
uh ideating about what those innovation

00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:08,799
methods

00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,120
we were going to be using so there could

00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:13,919
be more preparation and more strategy

00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:15,440
on the front end whereas i would more go

00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:17,919
into the meeting and then

00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,039
uh kind of jump in that way so it kind

00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:22,240
of depended on

00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:24,880
who wanted more time on the

00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,440
front end for preparation to come in and

00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,440
who

00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,960
was going to come in and ideate more on

00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,559
the spot

00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,640
and so again having that a set

00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:36,000
assessment of those team dynamics

00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,000
is going to be so critical

00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:42,399
yeah very good yeah very good thomas um

00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:44,080
yeah so again assessing those team

00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:47,120
dynamics so critical

00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:49,360
so we've talked about uh the first thing

00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:51,440
which is the most important thing which

00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:54,880
is identifying the problem

00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:57,039
and being very clear in what

00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,880
you are actually solving and what

00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:01,039
success is going to be

00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,159
within those innovation methods i saw

00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:04,080
somebody uh

00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:05,679
said that it was very difficult to

00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,640
integrate that innovation within the

00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,840
workplace

00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:12,159
um what i encourage teams to do is

00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,840
start going through these activities on

00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:16,799
a micro level within

00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:18,240
uh within your team so just daily

00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:19,120
challenges that you're facing weekly

00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,039
challenges

00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,480
uh getting in the habit of practicing

00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:24,960
these routines

00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,399
and identifying the problem and being

00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,720
very clear in

00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:29,760
identifying what success is and then

00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,520
moving into

00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,799
those collaboration methods whether that

00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,840
be using tris

00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:36,399
root causal analysis or value

00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:39,520
engineering

00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:41,600
um and then going into the think tank

00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,799
um to truly i know you've been waiting

00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,440
for me to say this

00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:47,120
think outside of the box uh to come up

00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:50,559
with new ideas

00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:53,200
but our innovation has not stopped here

00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:54,000
here we've come up with a lot of great

00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,440
ideas

00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,840
but now it's time to filter through

00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,799
what ideas are going to be the most

00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,279
practical

00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:04,000
and are going to be the best fit in

00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:07,440
solving

00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:11,120
our challenges and so

00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:12,960
from here again i do uh i first identify

00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:16,080
the value that each

00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:19,279
proposed solution is bringing does it

00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:20,080
match the problem that we identified at

00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:21,600
the beginning

00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,200
again this might be a great idea but

00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,760
it's not related to

00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,960
this problem specifically so we might

00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,720
just put that idea

00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,640
more in a backlog and address it at a

00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,559
later time so we want to be very clear

00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:34,480
and identifying what that scope is

00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:36,320
within our innovation within that

00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:39,039
problem solving

00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:40,240
so first doing again a little bit of

00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:43,440
value analysis

00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:47,600
and prioritizing where um which

00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:51,039
solutions are going to be the best fit

00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:55,039
it's very important in this time to

00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:58,000
be very uh to be very cognizant of

00:31:55,039 --> 00:32:00,000
the business aspect as well many times

00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,720
there's a bit of a disconnect between

00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,559
those that um especially on the

00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:07,279
engineering on the developer side

00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:07,919
of those that come up with um with the

00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:11,279
ideas

00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:13,840
and then a lack of communication from

00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:15,519
a leadership team at the top and so it's

00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,640
important that we have a very clear

00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:20,240
communication

00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:23,760
on both sides um to keep in mind

00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:27,279
the business continuity and the

00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:29,519
um and how we can propose these ideas

00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:30,799
to um to those that are not in

00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:33,679
engineering and in

00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:35,360
in development um and so keeping that in

00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:36,000
mind especially whenever we're coming up

00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,640
with these

00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,120
solutions uh the biggest question that i

00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:42,240
ask

00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:45,120
honestly is it um

00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,559
so uh asking that especially looking at

00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:49,760
that ux so

00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:51,440
uh that is critical especially whenever

00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,120
looking at all of the solutions that you

00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,519
come up in the ideation phase and then

00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,159
identifying what is going to be the best

00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:59,200
fit

00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:02,159
moving forward and then after that

00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:03,760
uh is really the last step and that's

00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:07,679
implementing and then maintain

00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:09,840
maintaining uh and assessing those

00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:12,240
uh the solutions that we have come up

00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:15,440
with and the innovation that we have

00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:18,320
uh sought to implement within our team

00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,919
and within our organization whether that

00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:24,480
be again with the product

00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:27,360
a service uh or uh within a new system

00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,960
and so within that implementation phase

00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,559
again we can come up with a lot of great

00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,320
ideas but if we don't have the actual

00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:34,399
action of implementing it

00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,440
uh then we haven't achieved our overall

00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:39,519
goal and so

00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:41,919
uh this is really whenever i look into

00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:43,679
creating those timelines and creating a

00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:47,120
very specific game plan

00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:50,960
that is well communicated to

00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:54,080
my team uh into the organization on

00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:55,600
what the idea is and how we are going to

00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:58,559
implement it

00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:00,480
um so this really comes down to uh more

00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:02,720
basic project management

00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,600
on the operational side of implementing

00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,880
those ideas

00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:08,399
uh it will depend on the method of

00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:11,200
the type of challenge that you are

00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:13,599
solving on the method of implementation

00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:15,119
uh naturally if you are fixing an

00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:16,639
existing problem

00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:18,639
that's going to look a little bit

00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:19,440
different than launching a brand new

00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:23,359
product

00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:25,919
um so uh there isn't a specific

00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:26,720
type of uh implementation that's a

00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:29,679
catch-all

00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:31,280
um but again i'm looking at what that

00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:34,399
what that problem is that we're solving

00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:36,159
and then coming up with a clear um clear

00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:37,119
project management and the biggest thing

00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:40,159
is communicating

00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:42,000
what those timelines are and

00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:43,200
what can be expected within that

00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,839
implementation

00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:48,159
within my immediate team and within the

00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:52,000
organization as well

00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:54,480
and so again that communication um

00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,040
within the entire organization is going

00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:58,240
to be

00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:01,280
so so critical in that time

00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:04,560
see we are in a very unique

00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:07,760
opportunity right now because innovation

00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:10,640
uh in decades past have really come from

00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,760
opportunity uh looking at technology and

00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,839
computers and

00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,359
uh it really came from opportunity but

00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:18,240
we are in a

00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:20,400
unique and exciting landscape right now

00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:22,880
where innovation is coming from

00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:25,359
necessity and this is a rare and

00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:27,119
wonderful opportunity that we have to

00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:29,520
uh push our teams and push our

00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:33,520
organizations and push our product

00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:36,960
even further and see whenever

00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:40,240
and see the level at which a

00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:43,440
problem was created we must rise

00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:44,079
above to solve that problem and right

00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:48,480
now is

00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:51,040
our rare opportunity to rise up and to

00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,000
really unlock our most innovative cells

00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,839
so that we can

00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,440
change our teams bring change to our

00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:59,359
organization

00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:02,640
and really change our world

00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:04,640
so uh again my name is amber vandenberg

00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:06,079
i wanted to leave the last couple

00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:08,320
minutes uh

00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:10,320
uh it looks like i have oh it looks like

00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,880
we have just a little bit of extra time

00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,000
here

00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:16,160
um so i think with that um

00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,240
i am going to actually bring this all

00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:21,280
together and give you a

00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:22,880
um and give you a

00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,839
a way that we can bring this all

00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,560
together and put it into practice right

00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:29,440
now see

00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:30,720
whenever i was current uh just last week

00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:34,320
i was actually working with

00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:36,400
a team that was more on the front end

00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:41,920
development and they were

00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:45,280
looking at building a new uh type of

00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:47,119
a mascot for a veterinary

00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:50,240
very large veterinary clinic and so they

00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:53,599
had a picture of a dog

00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:55,200
and the feedback that they had gotten

00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:57,599
from the clients was that

00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:59,440
the clients really loved the dog but the

00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:02,880
dog looked a little bit grumpy

00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,200
and so what they wanted to do was create

00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,640
a

00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:08,160
happier looking dog that had floppy ears

00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,760
and that's all that and those were the

00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,880
two big things that they wanted is they

00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,920
wanted a dog

00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:16,160
that had floppy ears and that was it

00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,599
and the dog that they currently had did

00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,960
not have floppy ears and it looked

00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:22,240
really grumpy

00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:24,000
um so one thing that i'm going to have

00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,640
you do is pull out another piece of

00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,520
paper

00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:29,839
again this is going to be a one minute

00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:31,760
activity

00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:34,240
and i want you to take a piece of paper

00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:36,160
and make it landscape

00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:38,560
and i want you to draw one line down the

00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:40,640
middle and then draw

00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:42,480
three different lines across so you

00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:44,079
should have eight boxes

00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:46,320
some of you may have done an eight box

00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:47,040
challenge before but you've probably not

00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:51,280
done one

00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:53,839
in relation to a dog

00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,760
all right pull out your pen and paper

00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:59,520
this time i'm going to give you

00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:03,280
15 seconds per box to

00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:04,720
um draw a different type of dog all

00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,400
right so you're going so whenever i say

00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,359
next you're going to go from one box to

00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,560
the next

00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:12,320
to draw a different type of dog that

00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,520
meets the requirements that it's a

00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:16,720
happy-looking dog

00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:18,880
that has floppy ears okay

00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:20,800
don't worry you you're at your own home

00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,599
so uh you don't have to be a great

00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:24,800
artist

00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:28,560
um but um but yeah we're gonna

00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:33,839
give you just a minute to get that ready

00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:33,839
three two one

00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:43,119
we are drawing a mascot for a vet clinic

00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:43,119
is a happy looking dog

00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:50,880
next box don't have a lot of time

00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,880
don't have a lot of time

00:38:53,280 --> 00:39:03,440
a happy looking dog

00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,440
all right next box

00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:17,359
just a few more seconds on this box

00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,359
all right next box

00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:42,320
all right you got the next box you're

00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:45,040
halfway there you're halfway there

00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,040
next box

00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:56,079
next box you got two more boxes left to

00:39:54,160 --> 00:40:11,839
go you're going to draw a happy looking

00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:11,839
dog with floppy ears for a vet clinic

00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:25,839
next box

00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:39,839
and last one

00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:47,440
three two one stop stop stop stop

00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,880
did you think that that was harder or

00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:53,839
easier than the

00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:53,839
circle drawing activity

00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:09,119
uh

00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,839
harder yeah yeah that one it's supposed

00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:12,960
to be harder

00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:13,920
that is very specific yeah and

00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,800
especially

00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:18,560
this is an activity that um definitely

00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:21,839
used more towards front end but

00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:22,560
uh depending on the um prompt that you

00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:24,880
give

00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:26,720
um i use these questions this was an

00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:28,319
example of drawing dogs

00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,839
i'd love to see the pictures of your

00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:31,040
dogs if you want to put them in the

00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:34,640
slack channel

00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:37,280
um because honestly that is how

00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,920
i will share especially in this remote

00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:41,119
time

00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:43,119
with um share ideas with our team

00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:44,880
so we'll go through an activity like

00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:48,000
this and we'll give prompts

00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:50,800
such as actual web design

00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,160
we'll give ideas again on specifically

00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,319
solving a problem

00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:56,319
we'll identify the problem which is what

00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:57,920
we did in this case we identified what

00:41:56,319 --> 00:42:00,720
we needed to do we needed to

00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,680
improve an existing system we did a

00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:04,000
value

00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,800
analysis we did some value engineering

00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,400
what people

00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:10,240
liked was the fact that it was a dog we

00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,920
identified it was for a vet clinic but

00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:13,040
identified that people really loved

00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:16,160
floppy ears

00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:18,720
what they didn't like was that uh

00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:20,319
it had uh it didn't have a smile it

00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:21,359
didn't it did look kind of like a grumpy

00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:22,400
dog so we wanted

00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:23,760
something that looked a little bit

00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,720
better so we wanted to improve on what

00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:27,520
we had

00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:28,319
and so then we went into an eight box

00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:31,440
challenge

00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:33,839
to quickly come up with a lot of ideas

00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,640
now each person has eight different

00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:37,440
ideas

00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:38,240
and then we can share these ideas again

00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:41,280
if you're using

00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:42,720
microsoft teams it could be um it could

00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,720
be a sock channel

00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:46,800
you can share the ideas all on one

00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:47,280
platform and have all the ideas in one

00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,800
space

00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:51,040
even if you're not physically in the

00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:55,200
same space and then you can begin

00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:57,839
having threads um off of those posts

00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:59,200
and really building off of oh i liked

00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:01,119
this from this picture

00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:03,359
oh i didn't like that from that picture

00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:06,000
and then you can continue to build off

00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:08,240
and from there you can get a clear idea

00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,720
of the direction in which you want to go

00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:12,400
again this is kind of a more fun silly

00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:15,760
example that if you're giving

00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:19,440
uh very specific uh especially on

00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:21,280
um and sometimes people it's not even

00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,640
pictures it could be more of a word it

00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:24,960
could be more of a

00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:26,079
a vague idea again i only gave you about

00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,800
15 seconds per

00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:30,480
photo sometimes i'll give teams closer

00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:33,040
to 30 seconds

00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:35,680
but no more than a minute per box so

00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:40,240
that you can come up with a lot of ideas

00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:42,560
um well at least yeah exactly at least

00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:45,599
you did it thank you so much

00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:46,400
um and and again you don't have to be a

00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:48,960
great artist

00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,520
it's just a way to get those ideas out

00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,079
on

00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:54,079
paper very very quickly and again this

00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:56,800
is on the ideation phase

00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:58,720
and then we can go into choosing the

00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,560
right idea and going into that

00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:02,079
implementation phase

00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:04,240
so these are a lot of different

00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:05,280
activities again the circle drawing

00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:08,560
activity is good for

00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:09,119
doing analysis of team dynamics but this

00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:13,440
one

00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:16,720
is very specific in identifying those

00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:19,200
i did and then moving

00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:21,200
and then moving into the ideation phase

00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:24,960
imagine if i would have just said

00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:26,160
hey we need a picture of a dog

00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,680
we probably would have gotten eight

00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,440
pictures of a dog but we might have

00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:30,480
gotten some with pointy ears we might

00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,520
have gotten some that looked a little

00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,920
bit grumpy right so

00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:35,280
it was important that i first identified

00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:37,599
what we were looking for

00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:39,280
what the purpose was and what those

00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:40,960
constraints were so we're again we're

00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:44,079
finding that balance within

00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:45,520
flow uh within uh within those

00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:46,319
performance feedback loops which we'll

00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:48,640
get in the

00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:50,480
slack channels uh or whenever we post

00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:53,520
those photos if i

00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:55,200
am in a physically close team then

00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:57,839
we'll put them up on a wall and then we

00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:59,200
can make comments and we can

00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:01,520
uh do a little bit more real-time

00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:04,319
feedback that way as well

00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:05,359
so again it very much depends uh there

00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:08,079
are some

00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:09,359
um facilitators that will do this more

00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:11,760
on post-it notes

00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:13,760
and it will be more of writing out ideas

00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,319
uh that is another option that you can

00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:16,079
use

00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:18,319
again that's catered a little bit more

00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:20,880
towards being in a physical space

00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:21,760
i really like this activity because you

00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:24,480
can do it

00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:25,760
while you can while you are still remote

00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:27,520
um i know that some

00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:29,359
organizations and some teams are going

00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:32,400
to continue being remote

00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:33,839
in the future and so uh there's there

00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:36,720
are ways that you can

00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:38,000
practically collaborate um and come up

00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:40,720
with those ideas

00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,520
while you are still um while you are

00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,599
still remote

00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:45,680
and so again all of these activities of

00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:47,440
course you can do them in person

00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:48,960
but the thing that i really like about

00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:52,400
them specifically

00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:54,160
is that you can do them remotely as well

00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:57,920
and still come up with

00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:59,920
really great ideas if we were in a

00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:00,960
zoom chat or a way that had video

00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:03,359
conferencing

00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:05,520
of some way i'll actually have i

00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:07,839
actually did this yesterday where i had

00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:10,319
um everyone put up their piece of paper

00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:12,319
and kind of explain

00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:13,520
why they drew what they drew what the

00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:16,640
inspiration was

00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:19,599
and they can come up with that again

00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:20,319
this is something that is very good for

00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:23,359
coming up with

00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:24,160
very rapid ideation other activities you

00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:26,880
can use

00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:28,079
are more for the strategic okay now

00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,960
we're going to be a little bit more

00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:30,720
detailed

00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:32,079
and thinking through these ideas so it's

00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:34,640
not just going to be off the cuff it's

00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:37,119
going to be in more detail as well so

00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:39,599
you're able to use both uh in that

00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:43,280
ideation phase

00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:45,760
so uh with that um

00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:47,520
yeah with that i'm going to open it up

00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:50,079
to any questions

00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:51,119
that anybody has for me thank you so

00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:54,160
much for

00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:56,480
uh participating in uh

00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:58,240
in the different drawing exercises and

00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,960
in grabbing different items from around

00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,240
your house

00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:02,160
that you didn't realize this was going

00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:04,640
to be as interactive

00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:06,240
as it was uh but the thing that i love

00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:08,960
about this is you can

00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:10,079
replicate this and duplicate this um

00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:12,240
throughout your teens

00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:25,760
today and to help you be more innovative

00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:29,200
and to solve those problems

00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:31,599
um and i am going to put

00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:32,480
that's my linkedin link if anybody has

00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:35,200
any

00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:36,839
um wants to connect or has any questions

00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:53,839
on that as well

00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:53,839
um yeah also

00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:58,160
i would love to know why i drew why i

00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:01,119
was drying my hair yeah that's so great

00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:02,480
yeah so um in this are you talking about

00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:06,079
the dogs

00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:08,880
specifically um

00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:10,079
so that was an example where we were

00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:13,359
working with

00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:15,680
okay yeah so that was an example where

00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:16,720
um we're working with a veterinary

00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:20,400
clinic that they

00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:23,359
had uh more of a mascot of a dog

00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:24,559
on their website and they wanted and the

00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:27,200
dog that they had

00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:29,040
looked very grumpy and it didn't look

00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:32,240
very friendly and so they wanted

00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:34,400
a different design and so

00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:36,000
um so it was just really more of a

00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:38,960
prompt uh

00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,319
on what you yeah it was more of a prompt

00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:43,599
on how you can

00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:44,880
apply that within your team so

00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:47,200
that was the prompt that i gave and

00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:48,720
that's why you have the different dogs

00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:50,559
whenever i'm working within more of a

00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:51,359
development team the prompts that i'll

00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:54,480
give are

00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:56,319
more specific towards uh

00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:57,520
it could be more towards website design

00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:59,680
it could be more towards code that

00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:01,839
you're building it could be more towards

00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:03,280
i've actually done this in identifying

00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:06,480
what the problem is

00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:08,640
um so i could say what

00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:09,520
or it could be for goal setting so what

00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:12,559
is the goal

00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:14,240
that we have at the end of this project

00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:16,240
that we're doing what is going what is

00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:18,480
success going to be defined as

00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:19,280
and asking a prompt like that and then

00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:21,280
giving

00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:22,400
two minutes to come up with eight

00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:24,319
different answers

00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,520
i actually did this with the team

00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:27,680
actually yesterday

00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:28,880
um on what does success look like at the

00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:32,160
end of

00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:32,480
six months and from that we were able to

00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,079
see

00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:36,079
where the differences were and where the

00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:38,480
correlations were within

00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:40,480
the team and we were able to build a

00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:43,520
clearly defined agenda

00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:44,480
within the organization i did this a

00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:47,920
couple weeks ago

00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:48,800
with the team uh where we had a huge

00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:51,680
issue

00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:53,680
with um it was more within an hr team

00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:55,599
and we had a huge issue with turnover

00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:57,440
so we did an eight box challenge where

00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:59,520
everyone identified different reasons on

00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:01,599
why there might be such a big turnover

00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:02,880
and so from that we were able to ideate

00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:06,640
a lot of different

00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:07,040
uh ideas um and then we also asked it

00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:09,280
again

00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:10,079
on solutions on how we could improve

00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:11,599
turnover

00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:13,040
so we had a lot of different ideas and

00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:14,720
we could bring them all together and

00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:17,280
again find those similarities and those

00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:17,280
differences

00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:28,640
yeah yeah

00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:28,640
yours is grumpier

00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:42,640
awesome well

00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:43,680
um yeah as i said i'm i'm here with the

00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:45,599
pathways group

00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:47,119
and so we actually do this i mean a

00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:48,960
couple examples that i gave i did this

00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:50,240
for education yesterday i did this for

00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:52,319
an hr group but

00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:55,280
really the group that i work most within

00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:56,480
is you guys um i work within technology

00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:58,640
the most and so

00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:01,359
um yeah so these are the types of

00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:03,359
prompts and assessing team dynamics to

00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:05,520
um and identifying the problem and then

00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:07,520
implementing uh the solutions that we've

00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:09,599
come up with

00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:12,079
this is pretty much what we do within

00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:15,119
organizations within teams every day so

00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:17,680
uh if you have any questions i'd love

00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:18,720
yeah my linkedin is right up there i'm

also on twitter

00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:22,960
youtube all the social media um if you

00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:25,040
want to connect as well

uh feel free to reach out and

00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:40,559
yeah i think that that's i think that

00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:41,839
that's everything that i have unless i

00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:43,200
knew i'm going to hang out here for just

00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:46,559
a few more minutes in case

00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:46,559
anyone has any other questions

00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:55,200
thank you so much johnson thank you

00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:55,200
thank you so much

00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:06,480
yeah if any if anyone wants any other

00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:08,960
activities um

00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:10,400
that you can use for ideation and

00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:12,960
implementation

00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:14,640
in addition to strategies for actually

00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:15,520
how to implement and identify those

00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:17,359
problems

00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:20,000
uh yeah again just feel free to reach

00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:21,280
out um again it totally depends on what

00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,800
problem you're solving in the team

00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:24,800
dynamics within the organization

00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:32,800
what would be the best way to teach

00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:34,240
innovation

00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:37,040
are you talking about within your team

00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:39,440
specifically

00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:40,240
um i'm going to assume it's within your

00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:43,760
team

00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:43,760
so innovation is a muscle

00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:49,760
or in the company culture okay yeah um

00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:50,800
so innovation is is a muscle that needs

00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:54,000
to be flexed

00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:56,640
um and so it's really more of

00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,839
practicing it so you'll notice today you

00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:59,359
know i went in through a little bit of

00:52:57,839 --> 00:53:00,960
theory but then we also practiced it

00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:04,480
quite a bit as well

00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:07,119
um so i am all gung-ho for

00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:09,839
really stepping in and really beginning

00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:12,240
again this was a low stakes i mean

00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:13,440
drawing circles drawing dogs there there

00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:16,480
wasn't a huge

00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:18,000
risk in trying to flex that innovation

00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:21,280
muscle on a small scale

00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:22,480
and then i'll move up from there within

00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:24,960
the company culture

00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:26,079
uh within teams within the company

00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:28,960
culture

00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:30,640
i will work with teams more specifically

00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:33,200
and again looking at it on

00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:34,079
a daily or a weekly or a monthly level

00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:36,240
of okay

00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:37,520
what are some problems what are some

00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:40,960
things that

00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:42,480
we might be um

00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:44,480
what are some problems that we can solve

00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:45,280
and what are some more innovative ways

00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:48,240
that we can

00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:49,200
move forward um in solving those issues

00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:51,359
and so

00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:52,559
i really look at it from a very

00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:55,920
practical level

00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:57,280
um a very organization specific on what

00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:58,160
are some challenges that we can solve

00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:01,200
today

00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:01,599
in an innovative method and so i look at

00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:03,119
the

00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:05,680
kind of like the activities that we did

00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:06,400
today have books worth of activities

00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:07,920
that

00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:10,000
i'll use depending on those team

00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:12,079
dynamics so rather than just

00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,200
sitting in a room and coming up with the

00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:15,680
same ideas we'll

00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:17,200
uh really challenge the brain to think

00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:19,760
more innovative

00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:21,119
more innovatively and to come up with

00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:23,599
more ideas

00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:24,720
so generally you'll notice in the eight

00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:27,200
box challenge

00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:28,000
uh the first two dogs that you drew

00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:30,400
might be

00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,760
very uh the first ones that generally

00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,880
come into your head whenever you think

00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:35,680
about a dog

00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:36,799
but dog number seven and eight uh might

00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:38,640
have been a little bit

00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:40,720
different than what you had drawn before

00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:42,079
same with uh the circle challenge the

00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:43,839
first ones that you drew might have been

00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:46,799
very simple but as you move on

00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:48,160
uh you're forced to uh get a little bit

00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:48,880
more innovative the more time that you

00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,960
go on

00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:52,160
so definitely begin by challenging

00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:54,960
people um

00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:56,640
challenging teams from the get-go

00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:58,640
because it is a muscle

00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:01,119
that we have to flex and many times i

00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:03,760
find that teams and organizations that

00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:05,119
are not as innovative or they have real

00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:06,720
struggles with innovation

00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:09,760
it's because those muscles aren't being

00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:10,880
flexed and so there's a status quo that

00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:15,359
is accepted

00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:15,359
um or there is a level of

00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:21,839
there's a level of complacency rather

00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:24,160
than

00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:26,000
challenging that stress quote so we go

00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:28,400
into again assessing those

00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:30,079
team dynamics first identifying what the

00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:31,520
problems are and then assessing the team

00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:32,880
dynamics and then going into those

00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:34,640
challenges

00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:36,240
how to deal with resistance and

00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:39,440
innovation

00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:42,240
so generally resistance to innovation

00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:43,760
also comes to a resist with a resistance

00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:46,240
to change

00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:48,079
uh because innovation is generally a

00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:49,200
different way of looking at things and a

00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:52,240
different way

00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:54,079
of change and so

00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:56,960
there's a couple of people that i love

00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:58,880
to follow dr john carter

00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:00,640
is one of my favorite people to follow

00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:03,760
on change management

00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:04,319
and so what he does is he actually looks

00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:07,599
at

00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:08,160
bringing awareness that there is a

00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:09,920
problem

00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:11,839
uh so he has a great book called the

00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:14,799
iceberg is melting

00:56:11,839 --> 00:56:15,839
and so i generally look at change

00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:18,880
management

00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:19,760
in addition to innovation being a part

00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:21,839
of that

00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:24,000
uh because again you can have a lot of

00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:25,680
really great ideas but if you're not

00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,520
if you don't have a team that's on board

00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:31,040
or an organization that's on board to

00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:33,839
implementing that change and to

00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:34,960
implementing that innovation then

00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:36,880
there's going to be quite a bit of

00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:39,040
pushback so i look at change management

00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:40,240
first and then add an innovation as a

00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:43,280
piece to that

00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:45,920
um so there are some organizations that

00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:47,200
before we can even get to coming up with

00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:49,119
new ideas we have to

00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:50,640
create an environment and a culture

00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:53,200
where we're open to

00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:54,079
those new changes so uh again john

00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:57,440
crowder he

00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:59,280
uh that's k-o-t-t-e-r um he

00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:00,880
writes of again bringing that awareness

00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:01,599
to change and then bringing that

00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:04,240
momentum

00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:05,599
through those small wins uh so same idea

00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:06,960
with innovation we're bringing it

00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:10,079
through the small wins

00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:10,799
uh building up to more larger scale

00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:12,720
innovative

00:57:10,799 --> 00:57:15,440
methods within the organization and

00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:15,440
within the team

00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:19,680
that's a really great question and it's

00:57:17,839 --> 00:57:23,040
a very common

00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:23,040
challenge that teams face

00:57:24,799 --> 00:57:28,640
yeah these are really great questions

00:57:26,799 --> 00:57:31,200
guys

00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:31,200
and girls

00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:39,119
um yeah so yeah

00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:40,880
implementing that change is going to be

00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:42,160
a really big um

00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:44,720
i mean that's that's going to be the

00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:46,000
biggest measure of success is

00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:47,359
you can come up with a lot of great

00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,520
ideas but actually doing that

00:57:47,359 --> 00:57:52,079
implementation

00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:53,839
really where the success lies so um yeah

00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:57,839
those are some really great questions

00:57:53,839 --> 00:58:01,440
i think that i might be out of time here

00:57:57,839 --> 00:58:03,280
um but thank you so much noah i think i

00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:06,880
might be out of time here but again

00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:09,040
uh find me on yeah find me on any social

00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:11,680
media i'd love to connect

00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:13,920
and if you have any questions more about

00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:17,119
innovation within teams and how to

00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:18,880
help your team reach a more be more

00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:23,839
innovative in their problem solving

00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:23,839
