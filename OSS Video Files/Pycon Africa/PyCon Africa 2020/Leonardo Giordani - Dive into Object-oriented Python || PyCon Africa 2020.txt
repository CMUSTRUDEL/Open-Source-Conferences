Title: Leonardo Giordani - Dive into Object-oriented Python || PyCon Africa 2020

Description: 
	I see many Python programmers, not only beginners, that struggle to understand how to achieve some effects or what happens in their favourite library/framework. Class-based views in Django, high-order functions in the standard library, and sometimes the very class/instance difference can be perceived as magic, thus preventing the programmer to fully exploit their power and to avoid pitfalls.

In this tutorial I will go through the pillars of Object-oriented programming (encapsulation, delegation, polymorphism) showing how they are implemented in Python, with theoretical explanations and exercises. I already run this workshop ten times since 2014 and I always registered a great interest in the matter and a rewarding satisfaction from the attendees when they finally grasp the (eventually very simple) mechanisms that Python is based on.
