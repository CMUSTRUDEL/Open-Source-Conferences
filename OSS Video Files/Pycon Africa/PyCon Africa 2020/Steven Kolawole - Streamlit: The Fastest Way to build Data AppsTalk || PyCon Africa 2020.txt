Description: 
	When we think about building python-based data science apps, we think Flask. But there is a better option now. Streamlit.

Streamlit is an open-source web framework that lets you create apps for your machine learning projects with deceptively simple Python scripts, in hours. It supports hot-reloading, so your app updates live as you edit and save your file. No need to mess with HTTP requests, HTML, JavaScript, etc. In a short sentence, there is no need to write any front-end code. All you need is your favorite editor and a browser.

In this talk, we'll go through how to build a very simple Streamlit app step-by-step. I will also review the pros and cons of Streamlit, as regards to other popular Python web frameworks being used by Data Scientists and ML Engineers.
