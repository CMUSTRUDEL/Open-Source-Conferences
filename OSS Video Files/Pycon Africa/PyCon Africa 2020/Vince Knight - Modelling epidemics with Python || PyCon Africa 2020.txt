Title: Vince Knight - Modelling epidemics with Python || PyCon Africa 2020
Publication date: 2020-08-30
Playlist: PyCon Africa 2020
Description: 
	This talk will discuss the differential equations underlying a common model of epidemics called the SIR model. Once we have an understanding of these models we will take a look at using them to make predictions. This will take us on a little journey across some awesome mathematical/scientific libraries:

- Sympy for symbolic mathematics;
- Scipy for numerical integration;
- Matplotlib for drawing plots.

Amongst other things we will use this to see how social distancing can (literally) flatten the curve.

I'm hoping this talk will not only be interesting and show off some cool abilities in these libraries but also provide a topical investigation given the current set of events. Whilst no one will become an epidemiologist by watching this talk, I'm hoping it will provide a nice foundational understanding to some of the graphs and information we have all seen in the news this year.

okay

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,080
so uh uh thank you uh for for coming and

00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,199
and and watching this

00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,960
please do uh type in the comments at at

00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,320
the same time i'll i'll

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,080
kind of when i look this way i'm looking

00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,160
at the comments when i look this way i'm

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,599
looking at my slides i'll also be live

00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,280
coding at the same

00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,719
time well semi live coding copying and

00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,760
pasting some some code i've written

00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,800
before

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:42,640
um so you'll you'll you'll see that

00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:44,160
as we go um so yeah so this talk is on

00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,760
modeling epidemics with

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,280
with python and um my name is

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,879
is vince knight i'll say a little bit

00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,000
more about myself uh

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:56,879
uh you know in a couple of of slides

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
in the chat i've pasted uh there's a

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,800
link

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,760
that is being pinned to a github

00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,280
directory

00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,920
with um my slides but uh probably more

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,040
usefully

00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,960
the jupyter notebook that i'm

00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,880
essentially going to be writing as as we

00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,920
go so if you want to take a look at that

00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,680
um please do

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,600
so before talking about myself i want to

00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,520
talk about who i am not

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,799
so i am i am not the director of the

00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,600
national institute of algae and

00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,960
infectious

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:29,520
disease dr anthony fauci okay uh since

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:31,920
the outbreak of kovid 19

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,600
on twitter in family conversations

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,360
throughout the world there are a lot of

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,079
people that have all of a sudden become

00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,640
epidemiologists so a lot of people for

00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,119
example

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,600
who should have no opinion on the

00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:46,079
efficacy of masks now have one

00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,040
um and various other things so so this

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,079
talk

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,720
is at no way meant to make you

00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:54,640
an epidemiologist all right um what i am

00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:58,159
going to do in this talk is just

00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:01,119
uh go over some basic models

00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,320
of how this uh the various graphs we've

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:05,840
seen in the news

00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:09,360
um are about uh are obtained

00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:12,800
i will purposely

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:16,319
not use covid19 data

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,480
so um uh i'm kind of a big disclaimer

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,520
this is kind of the the theory and how

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,200
this works

00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:25,440
um but by watching this talk you are not

00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,040
an epidemiologist you are not an expert

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,040
i mean you might be an expert but it's

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,160
not thanks to this talk okay so

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:35,040
um uh my mathematical

00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,400
expertise is not epidemiology i am not

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,599
an epidemiologist

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,480
so listen to the experts listen to the

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,319
science

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,000
um if you take only one thing from this

00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,120
talk take that hope you'll take a couple

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,920
of other things but if you think only

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,280
one thing

00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,160
take that um but about a bit about

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,480
myself so

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,319
i'm a mathematician at cardiff

00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,280
university that's this top left

00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:58,159
logo there uh cardiff is in wales in in

00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,040
the uk

00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,519
and um you'll see our logo actually has

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,879
uh

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,319
it's bilingual so on the top that's

00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,800
cardiff university and underneath it

00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,319
says

00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,879
provision and that's hopefully not too

00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,920
bad a

00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:13,519
um a pronunciation so i'm a

00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,440
mathematician there

00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,239
and the favorite part of my job is i get

00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:21,519
to teach all our undergraduates and so

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,879
i teach uh generally two things i teach

00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:26,000
programming so i

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:27,599
i get to teach 180 first-year students

00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,799
every year how to use python and that's

00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,000
probably one of the things i enjoy doing

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,200
the most

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,799
and then i also teach our final year

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,360
students i teach them game theory which

00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,080
is my

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,280
area of expertise on the right there

00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,360
there's a logo

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:44,480
meant to represent my role in the uk

00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:48,159
uh python association which is the

00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:50,560
uh the charity that puts on um pycon uk

00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,840
um every year and has and does uh some

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,680
smaller other things

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,319
and so i'm one of the people that helps

00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:59,840
run uh the yearly pycon

00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:01,439
uh uk the icon on the bottom left is

00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,519
meant to represent my open source

00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,840
software contributions

00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:09,040
so that's actually the logo for a

00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:12,159
library called the axelrod library

00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,159
which is a game theoretic library that

00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:18,239
allows you to do agent-based modeling of

00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:21,919
prisoner dilemma uh uh situations

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:23,840
and um i plan for everything except for

00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:24,960
my cat deciding that that she needs to

00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,000
join this is chick

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:31,280
and she's gonna be a little pain um

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,720
so um and the actual library is

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,400
is actually quite a mature library now

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,440
it's five years old six years old

00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,479
something like that

00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,280
and it uh what's quite neat about it is

00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:42,000
that the first

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,479
lines of it were were actually written

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,120
in

00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,639
uh in in africa they're written in in

00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,440
vento namibia

00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,080
um and then the final logo on the bottom

00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,520
right there

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,120
that's the logo for the software

00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,320
sustainability institute

00:04:53,120 --> 00:05:00,080
which is an institute in the uk

00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:04,080
that aims to ensure research software

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:07,440
is well written and so very very loosely

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,000
research software is not always written

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,240
to

00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,520
a high standard research as a result of

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,520
that is not often

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:18,400
is often not reproducible and so the ssi

00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,320
of which i'm i'm one of many fellows

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,840
aims to kind of

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:25,199
improve the overall quality of research

00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,960
software

00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,160
and so that's another thing that i'm

00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,160
particularly interested in

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,360
one of the other things i just wanted to

00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:38,400
mention incredibly briefly

00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:41,919
is that i've been lucky enough to attend

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:45,919
up until 2018 i believe including 2018

00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:47,919
all of the pycon uh namibias and so

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,280
i don't know how clear this photo is uh

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,800
on the screen right now but

00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,160
one of the things about pycon namibia

00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,520
which has been which has taken place in

00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,479
vintok every year

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,240
uh that makes it very very special is

00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,680
the row of people at the back which are

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,360
the the high school students the

00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,800
learners who who get to

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,319
attend that and that makes it a very

00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,840
special conference and it's it's one of

00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,199
the things about pycons throughout the

00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,560
world

00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,600
every national pycon or or continental

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,800
pycon

00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,080
has a thing that makes it kind of unique

00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,280
they all have this common thread they

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,560
make them picons but they have these

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,120
things that make them

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,479
unique and so so this slide is both

00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,840
meant to kind of

00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:27,600
say hello to uh to any friends uh from

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,240
namibia i haven't been able to attend

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,080
the last

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:35,360
two pike on the movies uh because i've

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,639
had a had a son um and so so

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,560
he's not quite ready to go but we're

00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:41,039
looking but i can't wait to take him

00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,000
and visit picons in africa when he's a

00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,880
little bit older

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,720
um but also to kind of say just a huge

00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,400
well done to the organizers of this

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,560
picon africa um

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,080
i've really enjoyed the conference it's

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,960
actually one of my

00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,639
first ish uh virtual conferences i think

00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,639
it's been fantastic i think the talks

00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,720
have been fantastic

00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:03,520
but it has also had something special

00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:06,319
about it that has made it um

00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,960
pike on africa so so well done to to the

00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,960
organizers

00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:15,520
okay now to to kind of move on to uh

00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,960
some some of things that we're here for

00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,840
so

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,440
when uh what we're essentially aiming to

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,199
do when we model a pandemic

00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,880
is take the real world build a

00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:28,000
mathematical model of it

00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:31,199
and gain some information okay

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,919
and and so what you you see here you

00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,639
might

00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,759
remember for or or you might have seen

00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,000
before i should say

00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,520
this is the basic idea behind fibonacci

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,800
the fibonacci sequence

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,240
so uh fibonacci supposedly the story

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,840
behind the fibonacci sequence is he

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,479
wanted to know

00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,319
if i have one pair of rabbits this month

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:53,520
how many pairs of rabbits will i have

00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:57,199
in the future and he made a very simple

00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:59,039
a number of well incorrect assumptions

00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,280
incorrect weak assumptions strong

00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,720
assumptions about the real world in that

00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,560
rabbits don't die

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,520
a pair of rabbits makes a new pair of

00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:10,560
rabbits every year etc etc

00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,479
and according to those assumptions

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,479
this sequence of numbers appeared and

00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,960
the fibonacci sequence comes up

00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,800
uh relatively often for for programmers

00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:22,319
because it's a really nice

00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:25,520
um way to to write a recursive

00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:28,479
function so if i write if i define a

00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:31,520
python finally make this bigger

00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:35,279
if i define a python function that if

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:38,640
n is in 0 1

00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:43,039
returns 1 otherwise

00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,039
return the fibonacci um

00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:50,320
to the matchy

00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:53,040
number of the previous n plus

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,600
the one before that we can then do

00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:58,399
something

00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,399
like this

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,440
and so we get that fibonacci sequence

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:08,160
and um a slight aside

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,600
um this is actually one of the reasons i

00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,880
i think python is such a wonderful

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,000
language and specifically for

00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,600
mathematicians

00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,360
is that a lot of the time when you're

00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,399
writing down

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,320
uh python code you

00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,240
are writing down what could almost be

00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,800
mathematical notation if we just

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,519
chosen a slightly different notation so

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,120
a lot of

00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,200
a lot of python translates really well

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:32,720
to mathematicians which

00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,200
for my uh line of work is is incredibly

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,320
uh

00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:39,440
helpful by the way i'm gonna

00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,200
kind of have my slides and um and my

00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,760
jupiter notebook uh

00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,480
next to each other at this resolution so

00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,480
to speak so

00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,160
just comment if if it's not terribly

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,480
helpful the code should probably be the

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,000
most helpful thing and that's the

00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,279
general idea behind mathematical

00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,760
modeling you have a

00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,480
real world situation so the growth of

00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,640
rabbits

00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,040
you then have a model for it which is

00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,440
this thing here this is the model

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,959
and then so the writing down the

00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,399
mathematical equation is the model and

00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:08,800
then

00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,079
solving that model using that model or

00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,000
whatever we want to say and that and

00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,519
that's what i'm doing here with python

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
on the right

00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,200
is is actually being able to use it okay

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,720
of course you can come back to the fact

00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,200
that this particular model is not great

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,880
it's

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:27,680
it it assumes rabbits don't die um

00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:29,360
so so it's not the best model

00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,120
another slight example i i don't know

00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,640
how uh how well you can

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,320
can see this hopefully it's okay but

00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:38,000
that that's meant to be a picture of

00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:41,519
a car on a road um

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,680
and if you think of driving

00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,640
from some point to another point and you

00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,920
know it takes say

00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:50,880
10 miles from point a to point b

00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,399
and you know that you have made 3.5

00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,000
miles worth of a journey and you're

00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,760
interested in how much further you have

00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,440
to go

00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,200
this would be the same type of

00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,800
mathematical procedure you do right so

00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,079
you have a real world situation

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,200
and the real world problem is you want

00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,920
to know how much further you have to

00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,760
drive

00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,519
and what you do is you write down the

00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,839
mathematical model which in this case is

00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:12,640
this very simple function 3.5 plus

00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,440
x equals 10. and then you get

00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,880
information

00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,959
for that of how much further you need to

00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:20,399
go you solve that equation

00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:21,760
um you just take 3.5 away from 10 of

00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,279
course we wouldn't do that in that

00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,440
simple situation

00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:27,519
but that is akin to the whole idea of a

00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,000
mathematical model

00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,360
and in in both of these situations what

00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,120
i've written down is an equation i've

00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,480
written down the fibonacci equation

00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,320
i've written down that in that

00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,040
incredibly simple

00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,160
3.5 plus x equals 10 equation and what

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,560
our equations are

00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,839
there are relationships between

00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:48,320
quantities and other

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:50,000
quantities okay so um 3.5 miles and 10

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,839
miles is our relationship there number

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,040
of rabbits at this stage in time versus

00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,040
number of rabbits

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,360
number of rabbits at previous stages in

00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,800
time

00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,480
but if we had a slightly different

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,839
question our equation and our

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,680
mathematical model would have to be

00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:07,040
slightly different

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:11,040
so let's say that i had driven

00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:13,440
not 3.5 miles but 3.5 meters

00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,200
yards something much shorter and i

00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,040
realize there's a wall in front of me

00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:20,079
at a total of 10 meters from my starting

00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:23,200
point and so now i want to know

00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:26,240
how soon can i stop so

00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:29,600
brakes on the car will i or will i not

00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:32,240
hit the wall at the at the 10 meter

00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,440
uh mark okay and now if you start

00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,519
thinking about this

00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,200
what's on the slide there that you've

00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,680
driven 3.5

00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,800
meters and you have a total of 6.5

00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,279
meters to go

00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,519
that's not enough information okay

00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:47,200
quantities alone will not do here

00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,600
because really what we need to know is

00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,959
how fast is the car going okay that's

00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,760
the only way to be able to know whether

00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:54,800
or not we're going to

00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:56,320
going to hit that wall and that kind of

00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,959
brings on to another

00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,079
type of equation one that relates

00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:03,279
quantity

00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:05,360
to speed okay and so

00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,959
how many meters we've done then we need

00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,360
to know the relationship

00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,800
to the speed of the car at the time at

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,639
that point in time

00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:16,720
some of us might remember some some uh

00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,320
some physics some newtonian physics or

00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,519
some

00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:23,839
some mechanics again newtonian mechanics

00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:25,600
um in which case you realize what i'm

00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,959
what i'm perhaps talking about here

00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,440
but if you don't remember those things

00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:31,839
don't worry it's not terribly um

00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,760
important just know that the general

00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,200
kind of idea from where we were before

00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,920
of relating quantities to other

00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,320
quantities

00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:41,519
we're now moving a slight step of that

00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:45,120
relating quantities to speeds

00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:48,880
and if you think about

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:51,600
our car once we start braking

00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,160
once we start braking our speed goes

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,040
down

00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,240
right so as we are going further and

00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,320
further along

00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,519
our the speed of the car is going lower

00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,920
and lower and lower

00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,639
and then eventually we stop once we have

00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,959
no more

00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,320
speed and so really what we want to know

00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:09,519
is is this point

00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:12,880
here before or off the um

00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:14,959
the wall but what we've got here

00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,639
is a straight line going down and it

00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:19,680
might be uh

00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:21,519
clear that when you do put the brakes on

00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:24,160
a car or a bicycle or just

00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,560
on yourself as you try to stop walking

00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,959
how

00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,000
fast you slow down might itself change

00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,560
over time

00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,360
you might be slowing down quite slowly

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,760
at the start

00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,600
and then slowing down quite drastically

00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,920
all right if you think about

00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,199
when you're learning to ride a bike um i

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,959
remember when i kind of

00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:42,639
uh learned to learn to ride a bike and

00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:44,800
was able to ride a bike one of the first

00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:47,279
things i did was ride down a hill

00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,720
hit the front brake and fall over and

00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:51,120
and hurt myself i was fine

00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,839
um but now i know that when i ride a

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,720
bike

00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,360
i should use the back brake at first to

00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,279
slow down

00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,360
slowly and then once i slow down

00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:02,079
sufficiently

00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,120
so that i don't go flying over the the

00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:05,519
handlebars

00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,880
so we're not always going to be slowing

00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,800
down at the same

00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,199
rate okay so we've got speed and we've

00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,440
got the speed at which we reduce speed

00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:15,040
and and so our slow down might look

00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,320
something like like this so it might

00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,639
have a curve

00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,920
uh where it slows down kind of slowly

00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,120
and then speeds up it could be a

00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,639
slightly different curve that's not

00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,440
terribly important but what's important

00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,639
to know

00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:31,519
is that that curve is interesting

00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:35,120
okay and what we really want to know

00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:37,440
is what is this the the curve

00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,720
of the curve if we put a flat line of it

00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:43,040
what is that rate

00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:45,920
um and at a given point can i know

00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,399
how fast i'm going to slow down all

00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,639
right

00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:49,680
what will be my deceleration that's what

00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,720
we're told or

00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:54,399
negative acceleration and

00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,639
this is called in mathematics the

00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,240
derivative and the derivative is a

00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,920
fantastic tool it's essentially the

00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:03,600
basis of calculus

00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:05,279
um and to think about it loosely the way

00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,759
you calculate the derivative on a curve

00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,839
like this

00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,680
is you look at that curve you take two

00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:10,480
points on it and you draw the line

00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,920
between them

00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,600
and you take those two points and you

00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,320
move them closer and closer and closer

00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,920
together

00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,480
until they're essentially at the same

00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:20,839
spot essentially at the same spot

00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,040
and then that gives you the the

00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:25,040
deceleration and so that derivative is

00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,800
an important quantity it tells us a lot

00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,880
about the car

00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,320
or the quantity that we want to want to

00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,680
study

00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,720
so if you think about a coffee break

00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,759
please don't leave and go on a coffee

00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,800
break now but if you think about a

00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,000
coffee break

00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,279
which is not something the organizers

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,399
have had to worry about too much but if

00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,199
you think about a coffee break at a

00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,120
conference

00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,480
you want your coffee to be there on time

00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,920
and you don't want it to cool down too

00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,279
much you can't just put all your coffee

00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,160
out beginning of the day for all the

00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:48,000
coffee breaks

00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,360
you need to put your coffee out but you

00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,279
don't want it necessarily

00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,360
they're too too late because it'll be

00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:55,600
too hot to drink that's maybe a slight

00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,040
uh slight exaggeration but i for one am

00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,680
someone that doesn't like to drink my

00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,680
coffee too hot i like it relatively

00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,040
cool and so we can write down an

00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:06,400
equation

00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:09,439
that describes the

00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,319
way a cup of coffee cools down okay a

00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:14,720
cup of tea

00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:17,199
cup of boiling water whatever and

00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,880
this equation will be of this second

00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:22,480
type of equations that relates

00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,360
quantity to speed and the equation will

00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,839
look like this

00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,199
what we've got on the left there d big t

00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:29,120
d little t so the big t

00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,600
is the temperature and the little t is

00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,679
time that's that derivative so on that

00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,600
left-hand side of the equation

00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,120
that's the speed that's the speed at

00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:40,880
which the coffee cup

00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,600
changes temperature then what it relates

00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,240
to

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,280
is the difference between the overall

00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,679
temperature

00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,360
and so the room temperature and the

00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:52,559
temperature at a given point in

00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,280
in time so if our copy cut if our coffee

00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,280
cup

00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,799
is hotter than the temperature in the

00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,039
room so this

00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:00,080
is higher than that then this whole

00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,000
quantity here

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,280
is negative right if temperature in the

00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,720
room is 30 degrees

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:09,600
and my coffee cup is 100 degrees

00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,400
my coffee cup my cup of coffee is 100

00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,600
degrees

00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:16,799
and then i've got a minus 70 here

00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:18,480
which means that the the speed of my

00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:20,559
change of temperature is negative

00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,880
which means that my cup of coffee is

00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,160
going down if my cup of coffee was lower

00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,360
than the room temperature it would

00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,640
slowly increase

00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,120
okay and that's our model that is the

00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,320
model

00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:34,240
of a cup of coffee cooling down it's

00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,880
actually called newton's law of cooling

00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,760
so this was

00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,360
a an equation that newton came up with

00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:43,280
um

00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:45,039
and we can play with this using python

00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:47,200
so what we're going to do to do that is

00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:50,240
use a fantastic python library

00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:52,080
called simpay and senpai is a python

00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,120
library that allows you to do symbolic

00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:57,840
mathematics

00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,840
so for example if i create

00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:03,280
a simpai object which is a symbol called

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,039
t

00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:09,440
i can now do things like say what is t

00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:11,440
plus t it says it's 2t and various other

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,559
things like that

00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:16,240
so we can then write down i'm just

00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,360
copying and pasting this from from my

00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:21,120
other notebook

00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:23,679
we can write down if i go back one slide

00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,480
newton's second law of cooling newton's

00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:26,880
law of cooling for

00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,200
pardon me i have to do some things like

00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,280
create a symbolic function

00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,880
create the symbols that i have and then

00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,919
write down this equation and so the

00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,080
equation

00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:37,679
has a left-hand side which is derivative

00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,520
of t with respect to t

00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,720
and the right hand side which is just

00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:46,240
exactly what we have

00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:46,240
there and if i uh define those things

00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:51,840
[Music]

00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,360
i rebooted my system before speaking so

00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,240
i was like oh i just want to make sure

00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,080
that

00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,320
you know i need gremlins that are going

00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:00,160
to make my wi-fi slower aren't there

00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,679
and so so there we go we see we see that

00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,240
equation by the way

00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:06,159
um one thing that senpai does with the

00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,960
jupiter notebook it actually uses latex

00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:10,799
on the back end to

00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:14,400
render everything so it looks it looks

00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:17,840
pretty and then what we can do is we can

00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:20,960
solve this differential equation using

00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:22,080
a a simpi function called d solve for

00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,039
differential equation

00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,880
solve i believe um pass in an initial

00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:28,960
condition ics for initial conditions

00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:32,320
which is that the temperature at time t

00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:34,320
equals zero is a hundred um so that kind

00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,440
of goes back to the car slowing down

00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,280
you can write down a differential

00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,840
equation that describes the car slowing

00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,080
down

00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,960
but to actually know something about it

00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,080
you need to know

00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:47,600
the speed at a particular point in time

00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:49,360
and then we can just take some other

00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,440
things so for example i'm going to

00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,799
substitute in a value for k

00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:56,080
what the value actually is not terribly

00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:58,080
important and a temperature for the room

00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:00,159
and now we have this particular solution

00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:03,360
okay i've taken the right hand side

00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,799
of my equation so just this part and

00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,559
substitute in some values and i've got

00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:10,320
that particular solution

00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:12,480
and now we can um plot this using

00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,480
matplotlib and a bit of numpy just to

00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,840
make my code ever so slightly

00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,840
uh simpler

00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,280
and so all i'm doing there is creating a

00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:24,080
bunch of time points or creating

00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:31,840
500 values of t substituting them all in

00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:31,840
and here i'm just going to plot them

00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:40,080
and what we see over time is that the

00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,960
cup of coffee is

00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,240
is cooling down and so if i want to

00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,280
drink my coffee at i

00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,400
don't actually know what temperature i

00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,720
like my coffee i don't know i just don't

00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:51,039
like it too hot but let's say 50 degrees

00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,440
i should wait about 10 minutes for my my

00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:57,120
cup of coffee to cool down

00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:59,600
um right so

00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,360
with those things in mind that we have a

00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,880
real world situation and we can write

00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,640
down an equation that relates

00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,240
speed to quantity which is the type of

00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,320
thing we have here and then we can use

00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,440
python to solve it and gain information

00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:13,840
from it

00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,840
we're now going to move on to pandemics

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,880
and so what what you've got on the

00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:21,200
screen there is something called the s

00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,120
i well it's a diagram of something

00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,120
called the s-i-r

00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:27,200
model and we're basically going to make

00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:29,280
modifications to this as we go

00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,440
but you think of the general population

00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:34,880
as susceptible to a disease

00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:37,760
okay um and they get infected

00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,799
at a rate alpha so at a rate alpha you

00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:42,559
jump from s

00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:46,320
to i and then at a rate beta you recover

00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:49,919
so from being infected you recover

00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:51,520
um that's again a model

00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:54,080
a conceptual model in the same way that

00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:57,360
fibonacci said that rabbits just keep on

00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:58,640
going and going and going that's a

00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,720
simplistic model of

00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,720
how a disease works through a population

00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,159
but once we have that

00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,840
we can write down equations that

00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:08,960
describe it so

00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:10,159
the speed of s is going to be relate is

00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,559
going to go is going to be negative

00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,000
because

00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:14,400
everyone's going to get this disease and

00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,080
become infected it's related both to the

00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,600
number of infected and the number of

00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,559
susceptibles because if there's no one

00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,520
that's infected

00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:22,720
no one will get infected the rate of

00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,799
infections goes

00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,559
up by the same rate that the number of

00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:28,480
susceptibles goes down

00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:30,159
and it goes down by the rate at which

00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,159
you recover okay so you have those three

00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:35,039
differential equations

00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,240
and so now we would be within our rights

00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,640
to assume

00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,280
that we can aim to get something similar

00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,400
to

00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:44,640
to this okay that we can use sin pi

00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,840
um to obtain an equation like this that

00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,240
tells us

00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,520
the value of s i and r at a given point

00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,360
in time

00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,679
and so if we were to do that this would

00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,360
be the code to do it so we'd create

00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:58,000
three functions sir that will be

00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:00,960
functions create a number of symbols

00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,320
create these three equations and d solve

00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,840
is written in such a way that it can

00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,760
take systems of these differential

00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:09,600
equations

00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:12,080
and if um if you were to run that

00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:14,000
senpai essentially goes through all the

00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:16,799
implemented algorithms for solving

00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,240
differential equations and says we don't

00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:21,679
really know how to solve

00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:25,279
this one now that is not unsurprising

00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:26,880
solving the s-i-r model analytically

00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:28,720
in other words getting that closed-form

00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,360
solution where we could just plug values

00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,480
of t

00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:33,120
into it um is actually very hard it is

00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,559
there's a

00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,480
there's a paper and you can find the

00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:39,679
link to it in the notebook

00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:41,520
that i've i've linked to um that goes

00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,000
over that for a particular case and it's

00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:46,799
it's

00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:49,200
it's a hard equation to to solve but

00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:50,320
the good news is we can actually solve

00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,279
it doing something

00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:54,320
else we don't need to have this

00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:58,080
expression

00:24:54,320 --> 00:25:01,279
here um we don't even need to care if it

00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:04,480
if it's possible to get it because we

00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:04,480
can very very quickly

00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:11,360
get python to build the solution

00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,520
for us so what i'm pasting in there

00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:15,360
is the mathematical representation of

00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:18,880
these three equations so again

00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:20,159
similarly to the fibonacci sequence that

00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,600
we saw at the start where i could write

00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,279
down the mathematics of the fibonacci

00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,720
sequence and then i could code it up

00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:27,600
this is all i'm doing here i've got

00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:30,880
these three differential equations

00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:34,000
and um what they give

00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:36,720
is the derivative so it takes an element

00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,120
x and x will be an array of our values s

00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,320
i and

00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:43,440
r and then it just returns an a

00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:46,640
three array again which will just be

00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:48,640
minus alpha times i times s alpha times

00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:52,640
i times s minus beta times i

00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:54,240
and beta times i okay and so with that

00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,400
we can obtain the derivative at any

00:25:54,240 --> 00:26:00,080
given point in time if we

00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:01,919
too um so for example if x was 1

00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,279
10 and 0 so we had one susceptible

00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:06,240
member of the population

00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:07,520
10 infected no recovered if our alpha

00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,840
was 1 out of 1000

00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:12,080
and i beat it with 1 out of 5 what would

00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:15,440
be the derivatives at that point in time

00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:18,000
okay so uh we'd see that

00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,559
the rate at which the recovers uh is

00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,080
changing

00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:21,679
would actually be a very high positive

00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,600
number because there's none in there yet

00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:25,279
everyone from infected so someone's

00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,880
going to recover relatively quickly

00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:28,159
so that's useful and then in the same

00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,240
way that with the fibonacci sequence

00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:32,559
once i've written down the function

00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,799
that coded up the recursive rule i could

00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:36,320
just use a for loop to go through it

00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:38,159
here we essentially need the equivalent

00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:40,400
to that for loop

00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:42,720
but that equivalent needs a little bit

00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,159
more work

00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,000
and so we need to do something called

00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:48,400
numerical integration

00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,520
and so what we're going to use is scipy

00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,320
and so scipy

00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:53,840
is a wonderful python library that has

00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,760
it's kind of like the swiss army knife

00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,279
of of python of scientific python

00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,400
libraries because that's a little tool

00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:00,240
for everything when

00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,480
someone asked me hey vince how do i do

00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,559
this specific mathematical thing in

00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:07,039
in python more or less the first thing i

00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:10,480
think of it's a relatively kind of

00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:12,559
utility thing is psi pi will have it

00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,480
and so what sci pi does is it

00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:15,600
essentially steps through

00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,200
in the same way that i did with that

00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,640
recursive function essentially steps

00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,080
through our equation

00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,799
calculating the derivative of every

00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:24,399
stage adjusting the lines on our graphs

00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:25,600
and making another step it's very

00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:29,279
loosely what it does

00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:30,960
and the way it works is you call it

00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:32,799
uh you you pass it the function that

00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,880
defines the derivatives which is that dx

00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:37,600
that i defined up here

00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,000
you pass an initial condition so you

00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,559
pass

00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,840
it what our original population is so in

00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,120
this particular example i'm saying

00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,559
imagine we have a population of a

00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:48,159
thousand individuals

00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:49,840
we have 999 susceptible people one

00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:50,399
infected and zero recovered in other

00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,919
words

00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:54,720
we have the first case we need a bunch

00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:56,480
of t's

00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,799
i kind of glossed over this in our

00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,520
definition of dx that dx needs to take a

00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,880
t

00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:03,200
that's because theoretically our

00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:05,039
derivatives could also change over time

00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,200
in our particular case here they don't

00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:08,799
they just change

00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,039
based on the quantities but

00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:13,440
theoretically we could say that the rate

00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:14,480
of which the disease spreads changes

00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,440
dependent on

00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,720
the season for example so with covid

00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:22,000
there's a lot of hope

00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:23,520
that uh in the warmer climates

00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,080
that our transmission rates will go

00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:27,919
straight down

00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,120
and then we also pass whatever extra

00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:30,640
arguments go to the

00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:34,799
so a particular case the alpha and the

00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:37,760
beta and so if i run that

00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:38,720
and if i just take a look at x what i

00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:43,120
have

00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:44,720
is an array of arrays and

00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,480
that that first numpy array is that

00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,039
original population which is just the

00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:51,520
one i gave it 999 1 0

00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:52,159
and then over time we see what what's

00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:56,159
happened

00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:57,200
okay and that in itself is an incredibly

00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:59,720
powerful bit of

00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,880
bit of python toolkit um

00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:04,399
scipy.integrate.od

00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:06,640
and just lets you do so much and so we

00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:13,840
want to visualize those things

00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:13,840
because as is it's not terribly useful

00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:19,440
and there you go that is the disease

00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:22,720
that is a model of the pandemic

00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:24,799
of a pandemic an epidemic over time what

00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,760
we see is our population starts out by

00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:28,000
being nothing but

00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:30,000
a population of susceptible individuals

00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,399
those susceptible individuals

00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,240
slowly go down as the number of infected

00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:35,200
goes up but as the number of infected

00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,799
goes up

00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,880
so do the number of people that are

00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:41,120
recovered and then once

00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,320
everyone once you get to this peak and

00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,760
again if uh

00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,440
if you've been watching the news over

00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:48,240
the past

00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,279
it feels like years but months that peak

00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,039
is very important we're going to talk

00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:53,520
about that peak a little bit more

00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:54,320
once you get to that peak then all of a

00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,720
sudden

00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:58,640
the there are no more infected people to

00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:01,440
to infect because we've infected

00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,919
all the people and everyone's recovered

00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,360
um

00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:05,200
some of you might be asking what does

00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,159
recovered mean and i'll come back to

00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,320
that later but

00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:10,320
at the moment recovered is just a lovely

00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:13,760
mathematical term for

00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:16,880
not susceptible and not infected

00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:18,159
um and now with this model what we can

00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,320
start doing is kind of

00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:21,600
ask questions of the effect of that

00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,919
alpha

00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,840
okay so all i'm going to do is just

00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:26,559
essentially put that same code inside a

00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:29,440
loop

00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:31,120
and um and try out six different values

00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,679
of alpha between 0 and

00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:35,679
1 over 200 and i'm just calling that

00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:38,880
same function i'm plotting over time

00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:38,880
as we as we go

00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,559
and what we see here is that if alpha is

00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,760
zero

00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:46,080
okay so there's basically no

00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:48,880
transmission then our curve of

00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:50,559
um uh infected i'm only following the

00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,000
infected on this graph by the way

00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:53,200
uh our curve of infected people

00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,320
basically doesn't change because no one

00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,760
gets infected

00:30:54,320 --> 00:31:02,320
um but then as alpha increases

00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:02,320
our peak gets higher and

00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:07,519
this alpha is a

00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:08,960
numeric value for that infection and

00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:09,840
it's it's multiple things the disease

00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,640
itself

00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:14,159
uh how much we interact how easy it is

00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,360
to spread when we interact

00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:17,360
now some of those things we can't

00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,960
control like um

00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:21,279
how easy disease is to spread when we

00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:24,399
interact does the disease spread

00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:25,840
um even if we're wearing masks and uh we

00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:26,720
stay away from each other if it did it

00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:30,559
was incredibly

00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:33,279
uh uh virulent and that's a bad thing

00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:34,960
or does it only spread you know if if if

00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:36,720
we're really close and we're speaking

00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,799
right at each other's face

00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,399
um that's a representation of alpha and

00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:43,679
we can't really control that that's

00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:47,039
the that thing that part of alpha

00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:49,519
is uh inherent to the the bio biological

00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:51,760
disease itself the things we can control

00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:53,679
is how much we get into contact with

00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:57,279
other people okay

00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:58,840
um so and another example of this is

00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:01,120
for example with sexually transmitted

00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:03,279
diseases uh

00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,880
one way we control their spread is is

00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:09,760
through education programs

00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:11,760
of of of being safe essentially

00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:14,240
but what we could see here and for

00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:15,679
example what someone um

00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,600
in government would do in their coming

00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:18,880
up with policy is they'd look at this

00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,720
graph

00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,080
and they'd look at these alphas and

00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:25,279
they'd go well you know what

00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:28,880
our hospital only has 500

00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:30,880
icu beds and and so if

00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,320
any time if we're in one of these graphs

00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,440
the green the red the purple or the

00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:36,559
brown graph

00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,200
then our our hospital could not cope

00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:38,960
with it

00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:42,000
however if we can get to this orange

00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:43,519
graph then we'll be under 500 and our

00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,679
hospital could at least cope with it so

00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:47,440
that peak would

00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:49,919
uh be spread over time and would be less

00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:52,480
likely to have it and so this alpha here

00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:54,399
is essentially made up of many things

00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,760
including the r-naught rate

00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:57,679
that we've been hearing a lot about in

00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:59,440
the news okay and the r naught rate is

00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:00,159
the component of alpha that we can

00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:03,440
control

00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:04,640
uh sorry that we can't control uh but we

00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,519
try and control

00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:09,679
by reducing how much we mix and so what

00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:13,440
we see on this graph is that effect of

00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:16,480
social um distancing

00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,519
so i'm going to very briefly go through

00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,840
some of the models

00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:21,760
um i won't put up the python code for it

00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:23,039
because of because of time and i don't

00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:26,480
like to think too long

00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:28,960
but what we could then do

00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,919
is add in something we don't actually

00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,720
know

00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:35,679
with covid for example that once we're

00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:37,760
infected whether or not we have immunity

00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:39,600
so we can add that into the model we can

00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:41,279
say what happens if once you're infected

00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,919
some of the time you become recovered

00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:47,120
and that you're no longer

00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:48,799
infected or susceptible or what happens

00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:51,120
if you go back to the susceptible

00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:52,880
population

00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,159
and you just modify the differential

00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:56,240
equation slightly

00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:59,440
okay and again in the notebook i link to

00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:02,559
you can see links to all those things

00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:03,120
we could also model a vaccination what

00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:06,240
happens

00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:08,000
if we skip the infection and just make

00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,440
all of our population relevant to this

00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,720
disease recovered

00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,720
how does that affect things

00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:18,960
and then one of the final things we can

00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:22,399
do is i keep on talking about recovered

00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:23,200
but recovered mathematically just means

00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:26,320
you're not

00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:29,760
susceptible or infected however

00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:31,599
it could mean you're dead so um and and

00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,560
i shouldn't that's not funny i don't

00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:33,599
know why i was laughing there was

00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:36,960
perhaps a bit nervous

00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:40,320
um what we can however do

00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:42,800
is incorporate in our model a

00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,240
difference between recovered in that

00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:47,040
you're recovered and healthy

00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:48,480
and you're recovered and dead okay and

00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,440
we just do that by adding that actual

00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,839
parameter where p

00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:53,040
becomes the probability of recovering

00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:56,000
from the disease

00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:57,680
um and and no longer and and living

00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,599
where so one minus p is the property

00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:01,599
that you recover from the disease

00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:04,000
and are not living the differential

00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:05,200
equations just modified slightly

00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,119
and the main thing is that we have four

00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,480
of them but fundamentally the code as

00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:08,960
you can see if you click on my notebook

00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,480
actually

00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,480
let me go get that code for that final

00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:17,839
one

00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:27,680
the code is is no more no more

00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,440
complicated it's a long dock string

00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,640
there but it's essentially just

00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,920
these differential equations that i've

00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,720
written and really these differential

00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,040
equations

00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:36,160
the right hand sides once you've written

00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,920
down the picture

00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:41,520
and you have that model the conceptual

00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,520
model you can write that down relatively

00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:48,560
straightforwardly

00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,599
and so solving it this code is

00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,480
essentially the same as all the one

00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:52,000
we've seen before

00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:54,160
i have to modify it slightly because now

00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,040
my arrays my population is defined by

00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:58,079
four

00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:59,520
uh four numbers because my recovered are

00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:01,320
now being split into two

00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:03,119
and i just use this

00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:05,200
scipy.integrate.odeens an incredibly

00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:08,000
powerful function

00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:09,440
um and so if we have a kappa of a

00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,320
quarter

00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,839
so the kappa here means that a quarter

00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:16,000
of people when they get sick

00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:17,040
and recover they are still susceptible

00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,480
for the disease

00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:23,920
if we vaccinate nobody

00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:29,200
and if your probability of

00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:29,200
surviving an infection is 0.85

00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:34,720
this is what that would look like we'd

00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:37,680
have a fair amount of deaths but it'd be

00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,720
relatively low a really high peak of

00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:42,320
infection

00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:45,200
and so if we if we if we vaccinate it at

00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,200
a very fast rate

00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:48,720
this will change substantially we've

00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,960
essentially gotten rid of

00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,000
that infected bump there are still some

00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,079
people that got infected

00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,320
but fundamentally the vaccine is what

00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:57,520
really changes things

00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:00,720
and that's the importance of why we need

00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,720
to get a vaccine for kobe

00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:09,280
so i'll i'll start kind of

00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,040
uh summarizing here um

00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:13,520
i've spoken about two bits of python so

00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,880
senpai an amazing library senpai is a

00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,720
fantastic library

00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,240
that allows you to do symbolic

00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:21,359
mathematics and so

00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:23,440
uh since using simpai has a few papers

00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:24,480
that myself and some phd students of

00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,320
mine have written

00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,520
where we know the results are right not

00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,760
just because we've

00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,880
checked them and are hopefully somewhat

00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,920
uh correct

00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:36,640
uh somewhat capable mathematicians

00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:38,800
but we've also used simpai to do the

00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:41,200
mathematics on top of what we've done so

00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:42,240
so simpa is a wonderful library but

00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,040
there are some things that it can't

00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,640
necessarily do

00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:46,240
and frankly you don't even want that to

00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,599
do so when you want to solve these

00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:50,079
differential equations

00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,640
you don't necessarily for this type of

00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:52,400
work it

00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:54,800
need to solve them exactly in which case

00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:56,400
you have this numerical integration

00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,760
and then the general kind of idea that

00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,200
i've hopefully gotten across in this

00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:02,000
talk is that

00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,960
when you're doing applied mathematics

00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,640
you have this

00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:06,000
this little triangle between the real

00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:08,400
world your model of

00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,599
the real world and the insane insights

00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,119
you can gain from

00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:12,880
the model and sometimes those insights

00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:13,680
are perfect sometimes you need a bit of

00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,720
work

00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:17,520
and frankly this this triangle this

00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:20,640
triangle

00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:22,079
is a cycle um you're constantly going

00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,440
back going back to the real world

00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:24,960
realizing that your insights can be

00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,839
changed realizing that your model can be

00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,280
changed and that's

00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:29,040
that's not just applied mathematics

00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,000
that's science when when new evidence

00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:32,720
turns up

00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:36,079
uh science updates itself um and that

00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:38,480
that's what this tri-factor is about

00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:40,079
uh if you take two things from this talk

00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,200
the first one being that i'm not anthony

00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:43,280
fauci and

00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,880
you're probably not too i doubt uh

00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:47,520
here's time to watch this talk

00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:49,040
um is this graph here and that the real

00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:51,359
thing that controls

00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:54,320
what what that peak does is our

00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:57,040
effective social distancing

00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:58,240
um if you do have any questions i'd be

00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,000
delighted to take him if you want to get

00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,440
in touch with me i'm dr vince knight on

00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,320
twitter on github and a couple of other

00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,839
places

00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,280
my website where you can find a link to

00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:06,960
this talk and various other things is up

00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:09,119
there and if you want to email me

00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,000
please please do and just yeah just a

00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:11,119
final

00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,880
thank you thank you to all the other

00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:13,760
speakers i've really enjoyed being able

00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,000
to

00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,960
see your talks amazing congratulations

00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,359
to the organizers

00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,960
putting on a conference like this is not

00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:23,760
easy in normal times

00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,480
i i don't doubt it's even harder at the

00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,560
moment so

00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:28,000
so well done and yes if you have any

00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:29,760
questions please don't hesitate

00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,920
to ask but it's okay if you don't have

00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,920
any

00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:45,200
my pleasure money my pleasure okay

00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,200
i've seen your question

00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:53,760
yeah so so daniela you're you're i'm

00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,359
just gonna read out your question for

00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,040
those i can't see it um

00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:58,560
daniele that's a very good question so

00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:01,680
yes i was careful to say

00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:03,119
i'm not doing a covet talk um uh

00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:06,000
because i think it's important in these

00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:08,079
times to uh be aware of one

00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,000
on of the the boundaries of one owns

00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:10,400
expertise and i am not an epidemiologist

00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,520
so i

00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:16,640
i'm listening to epidemiologists uh

00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:18,640
but have um so then you're asking

00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:21,520
uh that despite that have i done any

00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:23,680
covert modeling or was i tempted to

00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:24,720
if uh not and if you did did i conclude

00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:28,000
anything so

00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:29,200
so uh no uh is this a very short answer

00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,240
uh but i'll try and give an answer

00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:32,079
that's perhaps more interesting than

00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:34,960
that uh i was not tempted to

00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:35,280
um i was very happy just just looking at

00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,200
the

00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,960
insights of the models i think perhaps

00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,680
as a mathematician that understands some

00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:43,599
of these

00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:45,520
things um i i i perhaps

00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:48,720
could look at these models with some

00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:50,880
understanding of what was being done

00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:52,240
behind the scenes but i don't

00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,839
necessarily need that i think in a lot

00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:55,119
of cases actually the modeling has been

00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:58,480
communicated fairly

00:40:55,119 --> 00:41:01,520
well if you did want to do this

00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:04,319
what you need to do is find

00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:06,079
out what the alpha the beta and various

00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:07,920
other parts of your of your models are

00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:09,920
so if i just go back to this plot here

00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:12,000
this picture here you need to find out

00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:14,720
parameters for the alpha the beta

00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,400
uh the kappa and the p so i remember

00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:18,319
when kobit first appeared

00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:20,400
uh people were saying i think that the

00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:23,599
death rate for

00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:25,839
the general population was three percent

00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:27,440
um i i have no doubt that that's been

00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:27,920
changed and that's the type of thing you

00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,480
would

00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:32,400
you would be able to uh put in here and

00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,680
going back to this constant cycle

00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,440
of going through things you'd be

00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:37,040
updating that as you go

00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:39,520
um something else you could do is

00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:42,560
compartmentalize this model even further

00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:44,480
because there are at risk populations at

00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:45,440
risk sections of our populations and so

00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:48,560
you could not just have

00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:51,040
s but s of a given age s of a given

00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:52,480
uh body type s people who are diabetic

00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:55,119
or not and various other uh

00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,680
risk factors so you could do all that

00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:58,160
and then your

00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,720
the final part of your your question was

00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:01,520
um

00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:02,000
if i have done that uh would i have

00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,400
concluded

00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,839
anything i i very much suspect that'll

00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,440
conclude the same things that

00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:10,560
that we're seeing reported by the

00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:12,160
scientists um

00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,359
but the things that you could do is kind

00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,480
of convince yourself to the

00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:16,319
effectiveness

00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:18,000
of that distancing you could say well

00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:19,280
what if people are doing this what if

00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,640
people are doing that

00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,319
and and you could get those answers

00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:24,240
fairly quickly so i'm not sure if that's

00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:25,599
a completely satisfying answer danielle

00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:28,480
thanks for being here by the way daniel

00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:31,839
thank you for watching my talk um

00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,839
so so yeah

00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,280
and thanks thanks uh for the others who

00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,560
are

00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:42,000
who are saying nice things um and thanks

00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:45,839
for being here everyone i

00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,839
i appreciate the audience

00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:52,560
and if anyone has any further questions

00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,680
after this you know just just i'm very

00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:57,119
happy to

00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:58,880
for you to get in touch with me on

00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:00,160
my jupiter notebooks up on github you

00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,520
can take a look at that as well if

00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:04,800
that's helpful

00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:12,400
um yeah but

00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:14,079
in the spirit of a of a pycon you know

00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,520
python has the tools to do all these

00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:16,560
things and that that numerical

00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:20,480
integrator really

00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:24,560
is um uh really is a fantastic

00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:25,920
uh implementation uh

00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,839
nick you asked me will you be writing a

00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,640
nice blog post introducing sir with

00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:30,880
python

00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,760
uh that's not a bad idea nick that's not

00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:34,960
a bad idea

00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:38,480
um so so um i i will do that

00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:39,680
and and and nick i i hear that you have

00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,839
recently gotten your

00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:43,599
your phd so i don't know if any of our

00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:45,440
our african friends are watching that

00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:48,400
don't know that but congratulations nick

00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:49,920
on uh successfully getting your phd um

00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,280
you did fantastic job

00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,960
kojo thanks for putting in frontline i'm

00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:55,119
sure i'll have to look at it again well

00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:57,040
if you have any questions kojo uh when

00:43:55,119 --> 00:44:00,400
that happens please don't hesitate

00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:01,520
um to get in touch um i i

00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:06,240
don't have anything off the top of my

00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:10,319
head profile about a a blog or linkedin

00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:12,160
um i i can send a link actually to a to

00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:14,480
an example paper that i

00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:15,760
i've actually let me um let me go get

00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:18,000
that right now

00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:19,920
so one of the courses i teach my first

00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,440
year programming course i get students

00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:24,880
to write a research paper

00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:26,560
on something and

00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,720
what i do is i provide them with some

00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,119
example

00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:31,440
[Music]

00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:32,160
some example work and what i'm just

00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:35,520
pasting on

00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:39,119
here is one such example

00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:42,240
which is for the the sio model

00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:43,680
that is in no way the

00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:45,040
source of truth you should look at for

00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,800
the sir model but it's at the top of my

00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:49,599
head that's one document i know i have

00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,160
i'm pretty sure if you if you google

00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:53,119
things

00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:54,720
uh you'd be able to find a lot although

00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:56,000
perhaps not all good things but the sir

00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,760
model is the starting point

00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,000
there are a lot more sophisticated

00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:01,440
models of epidemics that exist

00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,200
that really take into account the

00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,160
population structure right if everyone

00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:06,160
knows everyone

00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:08,079
um like for example in a school then

00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:10,319
that disease will spread a lot um

00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:12,240
and again in a school if you think about

00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:13,359
it the individuals that are really vital

00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:15,839
in that network

00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:17,040
um oh i've forgotten the name of the

00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:18,880
speaker i i feel

00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:20,560
terrible the the previous speaker on the

00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:23,119
rubik's cube gave a

00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:23,760
really cool talk but that graph you have

00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:25,839
these model

00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:27,119
dustin thank you nicoletta uh dustin

00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:29,359
gave a really cool talk

00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:30,720
about uh the rubik's cube using graph

00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:32,480
theory and networks

00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:34,800
and there are models of epidemics that

00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:36,560
use networks

00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:38,000
and if you think about a school the

00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:39,200
nodes in that network that are really

00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,640
really important are the teachers

00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:43,359
because the teachers interact with

00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:45,040
everybody okay whereas if you think of a

00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:46,319
really really sparse network so if you

00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,760
just think about a street

00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:50,000
where you might only interact with your

00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:51,760
neighbor on the right and on the left

00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,200
that that disease spread is going to be

00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:55,280
different so there are

00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:56,400
more sophisticated models in the sir

00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:58,480
model um

00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,920
i have zeroed out that the models that

00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,880
are being used at the highest

00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,880
governmental

00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:06,400
levels and by the who are more

00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:06,400
sophisticated than the sir model

00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:12,640
however in aggregate i

00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:15,839
would be interested to know how more

00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:15,839
much more insightful they are

00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:28,079
i feel like i've just rambled hopefully

00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:30,000
i've answered some questions there

00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:31,520
uh profiles you've written read through

00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,319
one of those references that's that's

00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:34,319
cool that's very cool

00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:46,480
so i i have a feeling that's it um

00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:48,160
i'm happy to stick around i'm delighted

00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,400
if anyone else wants to talk about this

00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:51,119
or

00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:51,119
or anything else

00:46:52,240 --> 00:47:00,000
but yeah

00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:01,599
yeah yeah danielle that's um so danielle

00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,440
has asked another question that these

00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:04,880
type of ideas could be modeled to could

00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,680
be used to model other things like the

00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:07,920
spread of

00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:10,720
uh knowledge yeah it's a really good

00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:13,680
idea um

00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:14,800
so i i believe i once went to a talk at

00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,720
a conference

00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:18,079
where they were using these models to

00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:22,400
look at

00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:25,760
religion but also to look at

00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:26,960
languages and specifically looking at

00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:31,119
the wealth language

00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:33,280
in um in in wales

00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:34,319
and and seeing if that the language

00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:37,440
essentially

00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:38,000
survives or not um again forget the name

00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,680
of a speaker

00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,680
someone gave a really neat talk about

00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:44,400
natural language processing

00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:44,800
uh and they were from south india and

00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:48,319
they

00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:50,800
spoke about applying it uh

00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:52,000
i'm loosely remembering so forgive me if

00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:55,119
you're in the audience applying

00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,240
it to um they use natural language

00:47:55,119 --> 00:48:00,319
processing

00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:02,400
to create translation for uh

00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:03,599
smaller languages languages are not

00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:06,480
english i should say not smaller

00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:09,760
languages are not english um

00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:10,400
uh and and so that would be similar you

00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:12,800
could build a

00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:14,640
a model like this to see what sort of

00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:16,319
interventions you could do and so

00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:18,480
coming back to welsh i know at some

00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:19,599
point welsh was in in in danger of dying

00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:21,200
it's just was

00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:23,200
decades ago and i'm really speaking out

00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:24,720
of out of my my knowledge here

00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:26,480
but you could certainly build models

00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:28,160
like this that show what would happen

00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,880
and in a similar way that i was able to

00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,720
go

00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:32,720
well what is the effect of a maxi

00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:35,440
vaccine look the disease dies down

00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:36,880
you could just pop in a number solve the

00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:40,640
model and you could see

00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:44,400
oh if we start making welsh education um

00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:46,240
uh mandatory uh up to the age of seven

00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:48,000
what would be the effect of that and and

00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:50,880
so you could definitely look at this to

00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,880
model transmission

00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:58,240
through society or transmission of

00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,800
rumors and things about dangerous

00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:01,760
stories

00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:03,119
has been shared yeah absolutely danielle

00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:06,000
that's a really really good

00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:06,720
uh point you could use this type of work

00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,839
to

00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:10,319
uh to spread to to model the spread of

00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:14,160
false

00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:18,079
information i suspect however

00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:20,559
that to model those things coherently

00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:23,200
and this is um i i don't know uh but

00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:24,559
this is my uh my hunch is to model those

00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:26,640
things correctly

00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:28,319
what you would really need is that i

00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:31,119
suspect that in those cases the network

00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:34,160
effect is really important

00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:36,720
because i think what happens with false

00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:38,720
information or rumors or or things like

00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:42,240
that

00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:44,800
what starts to happen is you get this

00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:46,160
um effect of the network where the

00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,520
network branches off and essentially

00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:49,359
creates separate networks

00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:51,440
where the information just spreads is

00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:51,839
different in sub-networks of the network

00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:54,880
so

00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:56,000
i think you could use this but my hunch

00:49:54,880 --> 00:50:00,000
would be

00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:01,200
for uh for information that not everyone

00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,720
might want

00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:04,480
you you really need to take into account

00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:06,720
the the topology of the network

00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:07,920
as opposed to just people's ability to

00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:12,000
read that everyone wants

00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:13,200
you you'd spread that in a different way

00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:17,119
i hope it answers your question i always

00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:17,119
feel like i ramble uh sometimes so

00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:24,800
great yeah codroid i

00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:26,319
i agree and and sakura you've written

00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,440
that i it's nice that concrete example

00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:28,800
of things i can do in python to help

00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:31,440
exercise my math skills

00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,839
um yeah absolutely i completely hear

00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:34,400
that

00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:35,920
i think something else that uh i try and

00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,520
really get across my students who are

00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:38,480
mathematicians right who don't always

00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:40,640
want to learn

00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:44,240
programming but i know when i was

00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:46,559
learning mathematics and for example

00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:48,160
when i learned linear algebra which is

00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:51,520
an area of mathematics

00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:52,640
that is about using big matrices so big

00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:56,240
squares of numbers

00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:59,680
and um i was constantly told

00:50:56,240 --> 00:51:00,960
oh we do these things because computers

00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:02,880
can do them efficiently

00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:04,880
but throughout my education i wasn't

00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:06,400
allowed not allowed i just we just

00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:07,440
didn't do it with code we just did it

00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,720
all by hand and

00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:10,000
so constantly told you you need to learn

00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:11,119
how to do this because computers can do

00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,400
it really fast

00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:14,640
and and that's what i think is so

00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:17,200
wonderful about programming

00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:18,960
for a mathematician but for everyone is

00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:20,960
that it's kind of that last little

00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:22,160
ingredient that you need to really have

00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:23,920
superpowers and

00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:25,839
and i fundamentally do really believe

00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:26,800
that mathematicians who can program we

00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:29,920
can do anything

00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:32,079
um i don't mean that in an arrogant way

00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,800
i i i tried to not mean that an arrogant

00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:34,079
way but i think

00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:35,680
i think once you have that mathematics

00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:36,000
and then the programming actually lets

00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:38,720
you

00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,520
do it that's just that's just a real

00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:41,119
superpower

00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:42,960
so so i think what i'm saying is kind of

00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:46,319
the uh the opposite direction of

00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:48,480
what you're saying kojo that um uh

00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:50,079
yes it's great to have some nice math

00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:52,160
examples to do python

00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:53,440
but it's also wonderful to have python

00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:56,880
because you can make the maths come

00:51:53,440 --> 00:52:00,880
alive and make it actually useful

00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:03,280
again rambling so if i'm not mistaken

00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,280
the um

00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:09,599
the keynote will be starting in in

00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:11,200
yes yes kojo we're we're in agreement

00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:14,400
absolutely yeah yeah

00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:16,400
uh if i'm not mistaken the the the um

00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:18,720
the keynote will be starting in in about

00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:22,000
five minutes so

00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:24,800
i guess we should leave thanks nick

00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:26,240
thanks thanks for coming we appreciate

00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:27,119
you coming daniel thank you i i

00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:29,839
appreciate everyone

00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:31,119
everyone uh taking time out to to watch

00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:32,240
this i i

00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:34,160
thank you and thank you for some really

00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:36,640
great questions everyone um

00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:37,760
i appreciate it great see everyone at

00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:40,400
the keynote

00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:41,359
thanks again for coming i'm going to

00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,480
leave now

00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:45,040
i don't know what happens if you stay

00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:47,839
here bye everyone
