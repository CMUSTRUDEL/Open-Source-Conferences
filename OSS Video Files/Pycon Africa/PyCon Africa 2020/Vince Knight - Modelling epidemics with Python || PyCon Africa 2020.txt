Title: Vince Knight - Modelling epidemics with Python || PyCon Africa 2020
Publication date: 2020-08-30
Playlist: PyCon Africa 2020
Description: 
	This talk will discuss the differential equations underlying a common model of epidemics called the SIR model. Once we have an understanding of these models we will take a look at using them to make predictions. This will take us on a little journey across some awesome mathematical/scientific libraries:

- Sympy for symbolic mathematics;
- Scipy for numerical integration;
- Matplotlib for drawing plots.

Amongst other things we will use this to see how social distancing can (literally) flatten the curve.

I'm hoping this talk will not only be interesting and show off some cool abilities in these libraries but also provide a topical investigation given the current set of events. Whilst no one will become an epidemiologist by watching this talk, I'm hoping it will provide a nice foundational understanding to some of the graphs and information we have all seen in the news this year.
