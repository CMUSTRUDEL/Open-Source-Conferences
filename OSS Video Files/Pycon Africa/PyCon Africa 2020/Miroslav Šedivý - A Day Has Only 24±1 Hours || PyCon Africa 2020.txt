Description: 
	We'll look at a few pitfalls you may encounter when working with datetimes in Python. We'll dissect the pytz library, explain why it contains over 400 individual time zones while focusing on the 52 entries in Africa. We'll also find the reason why pytz is not part of the standard Python, why it gets updated so often and why even that won't solve all your problems. Two centuries of short-sighted propaganda and long-term chaos in thirty minutes. Maybe that will make you want to avoid time zones in your code altogether!
