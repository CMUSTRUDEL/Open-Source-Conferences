Title: Miroslav Šedivý - A Day Has Only 24±1 Hours || PyCon Africa 2020
Publication date: 2020-08-30
Playlist: PyCon Africa 2020
Description: 
	We'll look at a few pitfalls you may encounter when working with datetimes in Python. We'll dissect the pytz library, explain why it contains over 400 individual time zones while focusing on the 52 entries in Africa. We'll also find the reason why pytz is not part of the standard Python, why it gets updated so often and why even that won't solve all your problems. Two centuries of short-sighted propaganda and long-term chaos in thirty minutes. Maybe that will make you want to avoid time zones in your code altogether!

	00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,920
ah

00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:19,920
hi pike

00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,840
hi pike in africa a day is only 24 plus

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,160
or minus one hour and i have less than

00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,840
30 minutes to speak about that

00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,279
what are we going to speak about today

00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,040
we are going to see how to check the

00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:34,320
current time in titan

00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,079
that you shouldn't check the current

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,840
time too often and it you should check

00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,760
what your government does

00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,600
my name is miroslav sheikhievi i was

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,680
born in bratislava slovakia which is the

00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,920
time zone where bratislava

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,360
studied in neon in france which is the

00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,280
time zone of your prairies

00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,960
and now i'm working in karazhara in

00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,760
germany which is the time zone of europa

00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,680
berlin

00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,520
i have spent my whole life in the single

00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,120
central european time zone

00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,640
and still there are so many time zones

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,320
out there that we are going to speak

00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,400
about today

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,040
so now it's a saturday the 8th of august

00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:08,000
2020.

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,799
uh in ghana in accra it's nine in the

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,479
morning

00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:15,520
um in nigeria nigeria it's uh

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:18,640
10 in the morning and it's 11

00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:21,200
in zimbabwe and here in carson

00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,759
shortly before noon and it's already

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,960
noon

00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:28,320
in nairobi in kenya so

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,720
how we are going to see uh we are how

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,799
can we check what the current time is in

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,759
python if you import the standard uh

00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,200
libraries um module daytime you ask for

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,079
data and data now

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,280
and then you will get this data object

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,000
that has

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,320
all the information but it looks like

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,720
this

00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,840
if you started in accra it looks like

00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,079
this if you started in

00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,600
lagos in harare and carousel it looks

00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,240
like this and in nairobi it looks like

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,079
this

00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,000
so you have you get four different

00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,200
objects and if you calculate the

00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,759
difference between them it will be

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,719
always

00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,439
one hour step even if you do it at the

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,759
same time

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,759
so you cannot compare really the objects

00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,680
uh which it with each other

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,959
um if your server is set to utc we'll

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,080
get the same as in

00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:15,040
acura so 9 a.m um

00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,400
so how to do how can we get the same

00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,680
time on each

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,040
computer you can ask for utc now so

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,959
actually you should never use

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,080
date and date and now as it is written

00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,800
there because it is

00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,280
depending it depends on your time zone

00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,560
and not

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,920
um the information which time zone is it

00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,840
in uh is not there

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,920
if you ask for utc now you will get the

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,440
current utc time and it will always be

00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,440
the same on every computer

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,760
if you want to have the information that

00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,000
you are actually in utc

00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,319
you can ask for now and with the date

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,440
times times on udc

00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:53,120
timezone information um

00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,280
but if you want to have the current time

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,360
somewhere else um

00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,879
then we will we have to define our

00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,400
offset so if we know we are one hour

00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,159
ahead of utc we can ask

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,400
for the current time in the time zone

00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:06,400
that is one hour ahead

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,599
but there are countries where you don't

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,120
know which

00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,560
offset you are currently in because

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,200
there is something like daylight saving

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,239
time

00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:16,959
so for example in lagos um

00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,760
if you want to know the the current time

00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,200
in lagos

00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:24,159
or in the region of uh of nigeria um

00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,799
you uh can use uh the the third party

00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,599
library

00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,920
pyth and then ask for the current time

00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:31,680
in

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:33,120
lagos and then the right information

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,519
will be there

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,959
um if you don't want the current time

00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,200
but you want to

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,879
change uh or get give the information

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,440
about the time zone to some other data

00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,920
object

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,200
for example you have this naive so that

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,319
times a knife

00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,319
time um with the in

00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:52,319
lagos so you are 10 am and you want to

00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,319
say that's lagos so i want to convert it

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,640
to other time zones

00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,159
never do replace because if you do this

00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,959
you will get a daytime object that has

00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:03,360
in the teaset info has africa lagos lnp

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,560
plus 14 minutes what's that we are going

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,319
to see what's that

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,680
but this is wrong this is not what you

00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,640
want in the uh

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,159
when you are using pyth always localized

00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,080
so use that africa lagos

00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,439
times an object and then localize and

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,160
then you will get

00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:19,919
the current time and or the time and

00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,199
with the west european uh west

00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:26,320
african time one hour ahead of utc

00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,560
uh if you are using that is it uh module

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,160
of

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,240
from date util from the third party

00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,759
library you can replace it works a

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,639
little bit differently but b white is

00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:37,199
that it's unfortunately not standard

00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,160
even better if you are using python 3.9

00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:42,880
uh or newer

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:45,360
um there is the zone info module

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,560
that uses the the timezone database from

00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,960
the standard library

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,160
and that will give you the current

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,720
information and you can do everything

00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,300
with that

00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,000
directly from the standard python

00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:57,520
[Music]

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,600
um okay so now imagine that

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,680
we what we want to do let's have an

00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,240
example uh let's say we want uh two

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,680
strings

00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,600
with the current date and with the

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,680
current uh date of week and

00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,360
then you do something like this this

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,520
will work

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,960
until it doesn't work it will break at

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,800
one moment when you are probably not

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,800
sitting in front of your computer

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,400
imagine that these two lines start you

00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:22,240
start them one microsecond

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:24,160
before midnight of a utc so the first

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,919
line executes one microsecond before

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,560
midnight and the second one after

00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,800
midnight

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,720
and you will get two different dates so

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,840
never look twice at your watch

00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,280
always look only once uh store it in a

00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,800
variable and then work with this

00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,880
variable

00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,160
so check for the current time only once

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,080
there is an exception when you want to

00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,680
check for the current time several times

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,440
um and that's exactly when you want to

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,039
measure some expensive operations so for

00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,600
example a download you want to measure

00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:51,759
how long time it did

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,960
what you can do you can check the

00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,000
current time at the beginning and then

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,680
at the end and then

00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,360
calculate the difference you get a time

00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,280
delta object and total seconds that will

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,080
give you the seconds

00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,440
there is a nice tip you can divide the

00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,440
time delta objects

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,120
and then you will get directly the float

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,840
so the number one one second in this

00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,919
case

00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,120
uh but datum is a little bit overkill

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,120
you can always use time

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,800
time because it gives you directly the

00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,080
number as float or the number of

00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:21,680
seconds as in is epoch so since 1970

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,400
and you can calculate the difference

00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,520
between two

00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:28,560
uh floats that's easy but

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,639
what can happen is uh that for example

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,759
if during this expensive operation

00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,639
uh your time your computer clock will be

00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,199
set to

00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:39,199
the re correct time because it was wrong

00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,440
before and the ntp server

00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,400
adjusted the clock and then it can even

00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,080
happen that ends

00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,319
happens before start so you get a

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,639
negative elapsed in that case this

00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,520
time monotonic that will give you

00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,520
guaranteed

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,520
always monotonic increasing number in

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,880
the second since sometime in the history

00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,280
which is not important because

00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,680
you only need a difference or if you can

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:03,039
get it even in nanoseconds

00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:05,919
so that was uh python and uh measuring

00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,639
time now let's have a look at time zones

00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,560
um

00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,840
how could you measure time you just look

00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,840
where is the sun

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,840
you get the highest position that's noon

00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,479
and then until the next noon you divide

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,960
it uh by

00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,520
24 you get a number of hours and you're

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,160
done

00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,360
and that's wrong because the sun and the

00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,479
earth they don't

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,080
rotate regularly and there are some

00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,840
there is something called like time

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,680
equation it means that every day

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,880
depending on your latitude

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:35,520
every day the sun noon is

00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,759
moved by a little bit during the year it

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,639
can be up to 15 minutes

00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,919
this is where this concept of mean time

00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,199
comes from so the mean

00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:48,960
noon when you calculate the uh

00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:51,680
the noon so there was local time

00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,919
and but then there came a railroad and

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,599
you didn't want to send two trains at

00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,080
the same time on the same track from

00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,879
both

00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,520
sides there could be an accident so

00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,440
there were

00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,919
local times original times of the

00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,479
countries and the green which meantime

00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:08,319
was the one that was then later used all

00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:12,319
around the world it took some time

00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:14,879
but they didn't put it and

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,240
actually this comes from europe uh this

00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,000
is how the time zones

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,319
looked like at the beginning but with

00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,039
many political decisions uh they changed

00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,599
and now

00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,879
for example the whole france and spain

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:27,280
huge countries in the west

00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,160
are using the same time as we in the

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,360
central europe

00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,360
the red one um

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,800
if you install the third party library

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,560
pyth and you ask

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,919
how many times those are there are over

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,959
400 time zones

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,959
so you would think that there is

00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:41,760
greenwich and plus 12 minus 12 some

00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,640
something like

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,760
25 uh time zones in the world now there

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,959
are many more like

00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:52,320
that um this is based

00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:53,760
on the fact that uh every country has

00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,920
its own time zone even if two

00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,480
neighboring countries use the same time

00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,360
and you have to take into account all

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,320
changes

00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,000
of the time uh all daylight saving time

00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,279
movement between two time zones

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,240
um in the history since 1970. so

00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,880
these 440 time zones here are they

00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,360
represent

00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:16,480
countries and different uh time zone

00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:19,279
concepts since 1970.

00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,680
um you see here the same color is the

00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:23,040
same

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:25,600
time same clock now so you see that

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,120
the most of europe is blue and it is the

00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,360
same as

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,480
more of the western or more of the

00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,279
eastern um

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,080
africa so like zimbabwe and south africa

00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:37,360
south africa

00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:39,040
uh this is our sudan this is because in

00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,279
europe we are currently at the daylight

00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,959
saving time so we are one hour ahead

00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,399
the same with the yellow color with

00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:47,200
western europe and

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,200
central africa

00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,600
um where does this information come from

00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,600
there is no organization that

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,680
decides about eisenhower every

00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,080
government does it themselves

00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,920
and there is one organization that tries

00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,600
to collect all the information

00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,360
and on this website you will find two

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,000
things there is a mailing list very

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,480
active mailing

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,200
list where everyone where people write

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,120
oh there is

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,680
some new information about time zone

00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,360
something has changed

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,959
in the history current there is our

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,560
government that wants to introduce their

00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,120
light saving time that wants to move to

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,399
stop

00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,440
do something like that and there is an

00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,800
archive

00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:27,920
that is released several times a year

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:30,240
2020 is quite

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,600
peaceful there is not there are not so

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,720
many changes until now there was only

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,160
one version

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,880
2020a the next one would be b and if you

00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,600
download

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,880
this file you will find some oak shell

00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,959
perl script

00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,240
but the most interesting information is

00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:47,360
in the files

00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,800
called africa asia europe north america

00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,560
and so on

00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,279
and there are two things in this file so

00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:56,720
for example look at africa 60 kilobytes

00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:58,800
there are there is some code information

00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,120
something like csv file with the

00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,920
information about all the changes of

00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,120
all time zones in africa and there are

00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,560
the comments that explain

00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:10,000
why it was done like that if there is

00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,640
one image that you want to take from

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,120
this talk

00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:15,600
take this one this is the history of all

00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,399
440 time zones around the world in the

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,480
past

00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:24,720
over 120 years plus the future of

00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:27,839
the next 18 or 20 years uh on the x-axis

00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,839
you see the years and on the axis it is

00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:33,120
the utc offset so zero

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:36,560
is greenwich or most of uh africa

00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:39,200
uh to the top uh there are uh the

00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,920
direction of uh east so there is asia

00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,959
and uh

00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,839
australia and bottom minus five and so

00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:47,040
on this is uh

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:49,519
america so what you see at the beginning

00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,839
before nineteen uh there are a hundred

00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:54,720
uh all the countries they have

00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:56,480
they are quite wild because this is the

00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,120
local mean time of the respective time

00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,800
zone

00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:04,399
so offset by minutes or seconds and then

00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:07,680
it tries to concentrate or on those 24

00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:08,720
plus or minus um time zones with some

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,200
half an hour or

00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,800
quarter on our offset the small clicks

00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,519
that you see this is daylight saving

00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,959
time

00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,480
which is important that you see this

00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,880
daylight saving time all around the

00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,760
world

00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,360
also in the future until 2038 it means

00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:24,880
with the current version of uh

00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,720
pyth or visit info uh your program

00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,800
will switch to the daylight saving time

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,519
in those countries where it is currently

00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,200
valid in the future if for example

00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,240
european union wanted to abolish

00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:38,079
daylight saving time

00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:40,639
um in the following two three years

00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:42,399
uh if that happens the new version would

00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,200
reflect that but your old version or

00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,959
this version

00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,120
if you test it put it into docker

00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:51,279
virtual and and then think okay

00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:53,839
it works um then it may show wrong time

00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:55,040
and there are a few ticks or a few lines

00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,279
vertical lines uh

00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,720
through the whole uh chart these are

00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:01,519
some islands in the pacific

00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,120
that switched the whole they jumped the

00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,800
whole day because uh they moved

00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,200
from extreme east to east and west or

00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:10,800
vice versa

00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:14,160
this is an except for africa

00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:16,240
so you see that there is not so

00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,279
much of daylight saving time these are

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,720
mostly

00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,720
the countries in the north and in the

00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,040
south of course around the equator you

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,880
don't

00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,480
need daylight saving time although there

00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,160
was daylight saving time so for example

00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,760
you see in the 20s and 30s there

00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,079
there are small ticks but there are only

00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:33,279
like 20 minutes uh tall

00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:36,160
this is ghana in the 20s and 30s

00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:37,040
and 40s because the government decided

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,399
that

00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:43,360
people should have between september and

00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,320
december to get 20 minutes of more

00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,519
daylight

00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,760
after their work in some other countries

00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,720
it

00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,120
looks uh even wilder so let's have a

00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,519
look

00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,480
at this file what what's there in it so

00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,639
the most uh

00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,600
simple the simplest example is here um

00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,480
ivory coast

00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,959
abigail um there are only two lines the

00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,440
first

00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,720
one says that the local mean time valid

00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,800
until 1912

00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,000
was 16 minutes and eight seconds behind

00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,680
utc and

00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:15,120
since then uh ivory cost is on

00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:17,279
uh gmt so zero uh

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,480
minutes zero hours ahead of utc so the

00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:21,279
same time

00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,399
um important thing is that this local

00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:25,360
meantime 16 minutes

00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:26,639
eight seconds was local for abigail so

00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,839
all the countries or the

00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:31,279
cities around they had of course a

00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:33,360
different local meantime

00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:35,360
so you shouldn't rely on that actually

00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:39,040
never rely on the information for

00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,800
any place before 1970 because

00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,160
of course the local in time uh was

00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,360
different in every um

00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:47,839
every place um

00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,399
to make it simpler there are many more

00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,440
countries

00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,480
um in that region that are just aliases

00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,639
for abhijan

00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,600
so maligam biagina and so on all these

00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,360
countries they

00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,440
if you ask for the current time or for

00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,440
the historical time

00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,279
in those countries it will be the same

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:07,120
as in abigail so these are just

00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:09,279
symbolic links um

00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,240
why is ghana not there as i said in the

00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:13,519
20s 30s

00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:15,279
until 20 1948 between september and

00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:17,519
december there were 20 minutes ahead of

00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,880
utc so the format is a little bit

00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,720
different here

00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,079
um let's move a little bit uh to the

00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,639
east lagos

00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:26,320
uh the same until 1919 there were 30

00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,959
minutes 36 seconds

00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,560
ahead of utc now then they moved to one

00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:33,120
hour ahead of utc

00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,639
and again plenty of other countries that

00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,680
are using the same

00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,480
types of information maputo this is

00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,440
mozambique

00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,160
two hours ahead of utc the same and

00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,199
again

00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:48,480
several countries that are in the same

00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:50,160
time zone nairobi uh

00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,000
this was a little bit more complicated

00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:55,440
so you see in the 30s 40s

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,920
50s there where uh 202

00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,360
hours and 30 minutes 245 minutes ahead

00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,480
of utc

00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:05,199
yeah and again plenty of countries that

00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,160
are in the same time zone

00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:08,639
where it is a little bit more

00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:12,079
complicated this is uh

00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:13,920
algeria you see that every year they

00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:15,920
decided about the daylight saving time

00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,880
that it started or ended at a different

00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,199
date

00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:21,600
so this is this gets a little bit more

00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:23,759
complicated you have to get

00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,880
all the information and in the file in

00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,800
this file you will also

00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,920
find all the links to all newspaper

00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:31,199
articles that

00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:34,839
describe what happened in the 40s

00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:37,839
70s 80s so that was

00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:39,680
algeria um morocco

00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:41,759
this is only these are only the last few

00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:45,040
lines of morocco

00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:48,320
you see that due to ramadan months

00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:50,320
which moves every year they

00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,320
decided that they are going to use the

00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:56,480
light saving time during ramadan

00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:58,240
for up to 2087. so far far far future

00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,160
and in the comment you'll see that

00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:03,279
assume that morocco will no longer

00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,959
observe the st after 2097 at some point

00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:07,039
this table will need to be extended

00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,720
uh though quite possibly morocco will

00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:11,360
change the rules first

00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,959
i'm sorry 2087 that's not my problem

00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:16,000
anymore

00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:18,880
so this is overview of all 552

00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,919
time zones in africa in the past 50

00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,400
years

00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,520
um and on the y axis you see numbers

00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,280
between 0 and 12

00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:29,919
and this is actually at every day

00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,720
number of or or the total offset of all

00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,640
these

00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,840
countries so you see every year there is

00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,000
something like this which

00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,600
means daylight saving time but you see

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,160
that these switches are not

00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,360
regular there are always some tiny steps

00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,360
and these steps means that

00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,640
uh there are different countries that

00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,440
started daylight saving time at a

00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,160
different moment

00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,880
where there are very narrow jumps uh

00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,440
these are

00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:54,080
very probably uh the ramadan months in

00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:57,039
northern africa

00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,640
um if you see we are speaking about

00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,160
daylight saving time in many countries

00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:03,120
it is called summertime

00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:05,039
on the north half uh whole northern

00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:08,240
hemisphere

00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:10,640
we for the winter in winter we use

00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,520
standard time we never call it winter

00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,919
time

00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,039
although some people do that actually

00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:17,520
winter time there was

00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:18,480
winter time only once in the history in

00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:22,320
one country

00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:25,120
and that was czechoslovakia in 1946 47.

00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,919
this is the law or the decree of the

00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,480
government

00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,360
uh that says on that was declared on the

00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,360
27th

00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:36,320
of uh november 46 that uh from the 1st

00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,840
of december 46 until the 23rd of

00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,320
february 47

00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,000
the time should move backwards by even

00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,440
more one hour so there was in summer we

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,039
were one hour

00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:49,120
ahead then october november we were

00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:52,000
our normal time standard time and then

00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:54,799
december and january february we were

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
another hour back so actually in summer

00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,160
there was daylight saving time

00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,080
this looks like a daylight wasting time

00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,240
this happened only once never again

00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,600
but the decree is valid and the law is

00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,039
valid and actually the czech and the

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,320
slovak governments they are

00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:10,000
allowed to declare uh wintertime or

00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:12,480
daylight uh wasting time

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,960
at any time but of course in europe we

00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,679
usually have all countries have the same

00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,000
rules for daylight saving time but you

00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,520
see

00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,600
this was declared on the twin on the

00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:24,880
27th of november so only

00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:27,280
three or four days ahead it's too late

00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,559
if there is a change you should always

00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:32,240
give this information to this

00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:35,520
data soon enough at least one year

00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,640
because what you need is to to put it

00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,840
into the new version

00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:42,799
and a new release and then

00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:44,400
from this file everything all the

00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:45,039
information about time zones on your

00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,559
computer

00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:49,840
doesn't matter whether it is python

00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:52,400
database systems calendars android

00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:54,160
iphone and and then all the systems even

00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:57,280
embedded systems

00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,280
like airports

00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,120
plenty plenty plenty of systems and they

00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,919
are going to use that so you should

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:05,200
um inform your government should inform

00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:08,320
about this

00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,840
ahead really ahead in advance

00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,440
because let's have a look at some

00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,440
examples um

00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,200
there is istanbul europe istanbul or

00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,960
asia istanbul these cities on both

00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,720
continents

00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,080
their entries they look like this and

00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,320
you see in the 2011

00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,360
14 15 there are some changes although

00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,200
turkey usually

00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,880
uses the same daylight saving time rose

00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,400
as the rest of europe

00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,640
and the comments say that turkey will

00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,760
change into the summer time zone

00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:36,240
on march 28 instead of march 27th

00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:38,640
so two weeks before they just decided

00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,120
that because of some nationwide exam on

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,400
sunday

00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,320
they are going to move to the daylight

00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,799
saving time on one day later that's a

00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,480
complete

00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:46,240
cause you don't want to do that don't do

00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,559
that please 2014

00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,440
they didn't learn nothing because of

00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,360
some

00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,200
turkish local election again they moved

00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:57,600
the clocks forward

00:20:53,200 --> 00:21:00,080
one day later again again and again

00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,159
and even some changes were announced but

00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:04,320
then they were to back so in the code

00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:05,679
you see nothing and in the comments you

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,280
see uh we are going to change we are not

00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:10,480
going to change

00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,679
uh caracas uh again this is in venezuela

00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,880
southern america

00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:16,720
uh on mid on 15th of april they

00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,960
informed that they are going to advance

00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,039
30 minutes on the first of may

00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,640
two weeks ahead that's late and then

00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:24,799
you'll see some information some url

00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,000
from reuters or from official gazette

00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:28,000
so there is a link to some

00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,799
spanish-speaking newspaper that informs

00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,320
about that

00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:34,240
portal this is heidi in the past 10

00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,679
years also they decide are we going to

00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,440
start daylight saving time or not and

00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:40,240
then change it there and there

00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,919
that's really complicated uh so in

00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:45,280
pyongyang this is south korea and

00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:48,480
north korea south korea in the 40s 50s

00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:51,679
they turned back one half an hour

00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:54,080
but it was only internal because all

00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:56,480
the external services like meteorology

00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,480
navy

00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,840
airports and so on telecommunications

00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,600
they

00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:06,240
kept the old time so during the 50s uh

00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:08,159
south korea had a different time zone

00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:11,200
when communicated to the exterior and in

00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:14,880
terror pyongyang that's south korea they

00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:18,640
changed the time in 2015

00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:20,320
and then again 2018 they changed it back

00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,840
and there is a link it appears to be the

00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,880
front page story at the top of the

00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,720
rightmost column

00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,000
so actually it is also a link to some

00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,280
korean newspaper

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,600
with the information that we are going

00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:32,559
to change the time
