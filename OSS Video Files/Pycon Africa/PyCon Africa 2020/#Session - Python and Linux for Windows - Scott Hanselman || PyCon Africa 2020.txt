hi

00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:21,920
everyone um we are back again

00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:24,560
scott and i are back again um and

00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,880
we are back because william who is

00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:30,720
supposed to be our keynote speaker

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:33,920
what is not able to make it he um

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,719
unfortunately his power lift and

00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,440
he's in america so it's just very

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,520
strange

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,120
uh and even in his tweet he just tweeted

00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,280
out literally just now

00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,160
saying that he has never lost power

00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,079
before

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,559
and it's the first time that has

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,039
happened but he's lost power and so he

00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,239
can't

00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:56,239
um he can't actually join us

00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:58,800
um and with verona it's not likely you

00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:01,039
can you can go to a coffee shop so

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,239
for those of you who are watching uh

00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,479
unexpected william

00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:06,960
we really apologize for that and william

00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:10,400
is really sad about that as well

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:14,159
but fortunately scott has offered to do

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,159
a session with us in the meantime

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,560
to kind of replace the gap in the

00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:21,200
schedule and he's kindly

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,400
agreed to speak uh he's going to be

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,439
talking about python

00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:28,799
and windows subsystem for for linux so

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,079
um yeah scott take it away cool

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,040
so will you stay here with me and we'll

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,720
do it together yes so i'm gonna be

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,479
staying here on the call with scott to

00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,439
help him out with with the python

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,000
aspect of things all right cool so are

00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,479
you do you

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,439
use a mac or do you use windows marlene

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,159
i use mac

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,880
yeah okay so you use mac and a lot of

00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,560
people use

00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:52,479
a mac because when when windows people

00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,520
go out and they learn about something

00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,960
online

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,719
usually they'll go out and they'll go

00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,399
and they'll google for something

00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:00,719
and they'll say like i want to um you

00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,399
know install redis

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,240
and then the windows person with their

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,840
windows laptop goes and they find a

00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,879
how-to page

00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:11,680
and it says hi you know

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:14,000
go to the terminal and then they see

00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,000
this

00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,080
and windows people feel really sad

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,440
because windows people don't have that

00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,480
they have

00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,000
like this and when we see that we're

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,239
like oh

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,040
whatever the thing i want to install it

00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,480
doesn't work

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:34,959
on on windows and then they're sad

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,680
and while python has great windows

00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,560
support we know that python lives in the

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,680
windows store

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,480
and you can always download it from

00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:45,519
python.org python works great on windows

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,599
linux and the linux kind of experience

00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,319
is still kind of really standard

00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,360
and you might find libraries or native

00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,440
libraries

00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,560
that only work on a linux kind of an

00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,000
environment

00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,959
and then you get into things like docker

00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,959
and containers the windows people feel

00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,879
excluded because they don't have that

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:06,080
prompt they don't have that linux

00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:07,840
environment you know so there's a couple

00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,480
of really cool things

00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,440
that have happened recently on windows

00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,159
that make

00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,440
python a nice place to be and i wanted

00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,239
to show them to you

00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,080
so the first one is you know on windows

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,080
when you open up a terminal

00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,840
you usually end up with a screen like

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,280
this

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:29,680
and this isn't as cool as item

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,640
right it's got no tabs it's not it's not

00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,760
pretty

00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,360
it just kind of sucks it's the only

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,599
you would think of this as being dos

00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,920
right you remember learning like dos

00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,959
on your on your windows machine so the

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,159
terminal

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,959
on windows sucks and then there's lots

00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,000
of different

00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,440
shells and people

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,360
i think when they're starting out and

00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,920
they get on windows they get confused

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:58,879
because

00:03:53,920 --> 00:04:02,799
a console a terminal

00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:04,080
and a shell are all different things

00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,560
and then they'll they'll go and they'll

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,319
say oh shells on windows suck

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,239
and terminals on windows suck and then

00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:12,560
the windows consoles trash

00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,000
and they get confused about that so i

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,440
did a blog post

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,160
called shells consoles and terminals

00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,720
where i talk about the difference i

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,120
remind

00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,000
people let's see if my blog is still

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,600
there we go

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,759
that a terminal if you remember

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,720
looks like that doesn't it like a

00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,120
terminal

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,080
is a worn out right like terminals were

00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:39,360
typewriters for a very long time right

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:42,720
and if i go and run like python

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:45,520
um and it pops up like this

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,520
on windows

00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,960
i'll make it full screen

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:55,199
python is the shell in this context

00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:58,880
right it returns a string

00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:01,120
but did python paint

00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:04,160
did was python the responsible program

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,160
that did the painting

00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,840
do you want to guess who painted the

00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,639
string

00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:15,840
pixels who drew the pixel

00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,960
pixels onto the screen yeah i don't

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:21,120
think it's python

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:26,320
exactly python returned a string

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:29,840
and a console host painted it

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,800
so this this string like the python is

00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,080
the shell

00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,720
i type some stuff and a string comes

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,800
back

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:41,199
there was no put pixel painty

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,120
stuff happening here right so it's

00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,560
really important to separate the

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,160
difference between

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,160
the console and the shell

00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:56,479
the console hosts and paints

00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,160
the output from the shell now you've got

00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,720
a mac do you use like item or what's

00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,720
your terminal

00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,960
uh i just use the terminal that's there

00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,600
on the mac

00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,400
right good okay right so there you go so

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,000
on mac

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:14,160
you use terminal dot app and on windows

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,440
we have one that's kind of called con

00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,600
host oops

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,039
the console host and i think there's a

00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,639
couple of other ones there's like i

00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:24,720
term and i term two and then there's

00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,400
hyper you know there's different

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,440
terminals you can go and download if you

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,199
want to have

00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:33,039
you know cool looking stuff on windows

00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,479
we have also these shells and things but

00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,000
there's also

00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,919
what's the ones on windows there's

00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,039
terminus

00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:45,440
there's a con emu these are

00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:45,440
third-party third-party consoles

00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,520
you see how when i run python and i hit

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:53,120
properties

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:57,039
this dialog box comes up

00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:59,759
it was not shipped by python

00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:01,440
if i run that old dos box that we saw

00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:05,199
before

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:08,720
over here and i open up properties

00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:11,120
look that one says python

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:14,319
that one says command prompt but clearly

00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,240
the box is the same right

00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,639
so you're right what you just said is

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,759
right python's not responsible for this

00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,840
it's just being

00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,120
hosted by it because python is not a

00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,479
terminal

00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:29,440
it's a shell cool so

00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,479
windows now has a new thing called the

00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,240
windows

00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:36,880
terminal it's new and it's open source

00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,479
if you ever find yourself you know

00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,160
hanging out with a windows person and

00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:42,800
you see them using the old

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,680
terminal you've got to say hey i talked

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,280
to scott

00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,440
and he's got the whole new terminal it's

00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:50,639
great and you get

00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:53,680
tabs you can have as

00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:56,960
many different shells

00:07:53,680 --> 00:08:01,520
as you want right wow

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:03,520
and if i wanted i could go and find out

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,160
where my python is installed i'm

00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:09,360
actually looking right here

00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:12,479
here we go i've got python

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,160
here okay

00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:17,120
i don't know what i'm doing by the way

00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:19,199
so bear with me

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,680
here we go so i can see where it's

00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,680
installed

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,520
okay so i'm just going to copy that into

00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,199
the clipboard

00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,879
and i'll put it over here in notepad

00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,599
just to keep the location so there's

00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,880
where

00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:36,880
python is installed on my computer

00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:40,000
okay yeah all right so now i know that

00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:42,320
and i'm on windows i can go

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,240
in my new terminal and i can click

00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,120
settings

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,320
and i can modify this menu so i'm going

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,959
to hit settings

00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,720
and it's going to load up visual studio

00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:55,600
code

00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,760
and it's just basically a json list each

00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,560
one of those menu items

00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:02,080
i'll make it a little bigger there we go

00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,760
each one of these menu items is a

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,600
different list

00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,959
different item in the list there so

00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:11,040
let's go and say

00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:14,080
make another one and we'll give it a

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:16,800
a good and goods are just

00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,560
globally unique identifiers and they

00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,440
don't really need to be globally

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,320
any they just need to be global enough

00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,920
so i'm just going to

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,760
pick one and i don't know change a

00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,760
couple of numbers that's close enough

00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:35,440
and then we'll name it oops

00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,320
enter name i think that was python three

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,320
point

00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:44,000
three point seven two point seven

00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:46,320
cool a man line i think we'll do that

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,560
yeah oh we need an icon i always gotta

00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:52,160
get an icon oh my goodness

00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:57,519
to find out where our python icon is

00:09:52,160 --> 00:10:01,360
i have a icon python

00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:04,079
open location i wonder where the python

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:06,399
so you're using your icon right now for

00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:08,720
the terminal yeah so i want an icon so i

00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,959
get a cool little icon

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,399
i basically want to get like an icon

00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,480
like this

00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,160
or something for my menu it's not

00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,000
important i'll leave it for now

00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,079
but we can come back and we can

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,839
customize whatever makes us happy

00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:24,079
so we'll skip that for now we'll come

00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:27,360
back a little later

00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:29,600
now under command line i left it blank

00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,079
let's go back over to notepad here and

00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,920
let's take this one here

00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:36,079
i'm going to change my backslashes to

00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:39,760
forward slashes and i'm going to paste

00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:42,959
my path right there

00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,519
i just made a new menu item and this is

00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,680
how we

00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,279
run python so let's go back to our

00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,440
terminal notice that i didn't have to

00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:52,079
run it again it has automatically

00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,079
picked it up

00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:58,480
look oh it just showed up at the top and

00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,040
you see it has no icon

00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,560
so really clearly i have to stop

00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,920
everything and get an icon

00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,959
but the point is that if this works if

00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,920
i'm doing what i

00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,240
think i'm doing oh look at that now i've

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,000
got

00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:17,360
python in the new windows terminal

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,040
as a first class citizen so then you

00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,959
could i could give this to you marlene

00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:25,519
and you could put in anaconda

00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:27,600
or jupiter lab whatever right

00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,760
right and it's obvious now that these

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:33,120
are shells

00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,120
in the larger terminal

00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,880
additionally i could do something like

00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,880
this

00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:46,640
background

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,640
i think i can set the color

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,800
what's a good color here that's kind of

00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,800
a

00:11:53,279 --> 00:12:00,000
that's not probably good let's try red

00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,000
green blue

00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,880
red green

00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:13,279
a little garish

00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:16,240
oh wait that's pretty bright that's a

00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:16,240
little bright my friend

00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:28,800
there you go now there's my

00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:31,760
original shell in one tab and i can even

00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,760
go and do this

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,560
and now i've got my one prompt here and

00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,760
my python one here

00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:41,440
so just in a few minutes on windows i'm

00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,920
getting myself set up

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,120
with a nice python environment with a

00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,680
very cool new

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,160
shell and i can use my mouse and i can

00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,079
scroll

00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:53,839
[Music]

00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:53,839
and get the big font

00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:59,360
alt enter and now i'm full screen

00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,519
i don't know how to clear the screen on

00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,519
python

00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,720
okay so now i'm full screen yeah i'm

00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,800
running this on windows

00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,480
i can go and modify that and that's

00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,000
really great and i could have different

00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,480
python environments

00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,240
different versions like i said anaconda

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,760
jupiter etc etc

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:24,160
and this can be totally um

00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,000
customized to look like whatever i want

00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,800
it to look like and this is all part of

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,240
it's all free it's part of the windows

00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,279
terminal

00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,120
and you can get this in the in the

00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:37,040
windows store

00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,279
now the other thing that i can do which

00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:43,920
is kind of silly and i'll show you this

00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:46,320
really quick before i show you

00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,920
some linux things on windows yeah see

00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,680
rob in the chat is saying that this

00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,880
needs to be

00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:54,800
important this needs to be made

00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:57,040
right away i agree this should be the

00:13:54,800 --> 00:14:02,000
default

00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:04,160
watch this my friend

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,279
i have to use forward slashes because

00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:09,440
backslashes and

00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:16,800
jason are not

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:19,760
a good thing

00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:22,000
is that a swoops do you have a space

00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,000
there

00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:31,440
what are you mad about oh that's

00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:34,240
background image alignment

00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,240
too specific

00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:40,160
i've got an animated gif

00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:48,880
in my python environment

00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:51,440
wow hey naomi

00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:53,519
hey girl print why how do you print in

00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,600
python

00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,560
it's print with a parenthesis print and

00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:00,959
then in

00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:03,760
brackets you need to be in brackets for

00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:05,199
yeah cool so one of the things that's

00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:08,800
silly about that

00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:11,839
is i can change those images

00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,720
and the colors and the fonts based on

00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:15,040
errors

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,680
of my application so if i were doing

00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,279
like testing

00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,920
i could have the python when it's unit

00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:24,639
test and then it could show an image

00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:26,560
or a fun animated gif that tells me that

00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,959
that thing actually happened or not

00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,079
so rob in the chat there is asking if

00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:33,120
they can have

00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:36,880
cygwin bash as a shell

00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:38,160
and you can you can't so cygwin is a

00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,959
shell on windows

00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,959
marlene that

00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,120
remember how we talked at the beginning

00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,440
about how windows people show up

00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:54,560
on a website that has a tutorial and

00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,600
they see that dollar sign and they wish

00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,680
they had it

00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,199
so rob is saying yeah i used cygwin well

00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:02,480
cygwin

00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:04,720
is fake linux

00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,639
it's not really linux it's just bash

00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,880
it's the bash shell

00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,240
and some of the utilities like them and

00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,639
things like that

00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,839
but what people really want is the

00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,639
ability

00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:18,959
to actually run linux on windows which

00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:21,759
sounds kind of like a crazy thing to do

00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,240
like how would you run linux on windows

00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,440
like

00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,040
usually you write a particular machine

00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,440
do you ever use like parallels or

00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,839
anything like that

00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,440
you're like sometimes virtual box you

00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:35,920
probably don't need to because

00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:37,519
your mac runs right and it works great

00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,759
and it's time for me

00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:41,680
exactly it works great for you and some

00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:44,880
people might just run the python for

00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:48,000
windows which is what i set up earlier

00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:51,360
but windows now

00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:54,639
supports running linux

00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:58,240
natively i actually have five

00:16:54,639 --> 00:17:00,000
different linuxes installed here

00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,279
and it's not like a virtual machine like

00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,920
if you ever use parallels

00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:05,520
when you start it up it's like here goes

00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:08,400
parallels

00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:10,079
and it's like it's a thing it's like

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,679
four minutes to start up or something

00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:15,199
and it's a big giant

00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:17,039
you know big launching experience

00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,520
but if i'm going to launch ubuntu let's

00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:23,120
watch what happens when we launch ubuntu

00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:25,039
1 1000 to 1000.

00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:27,520
so in in two seconds let me close it and

00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,520
i'll do it again

00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:34,320
one one thousand we fired

00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:37,120
complete linux in less than a second

00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,320
cold it was two seconds warm it was a

00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,400
second

00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:43,679
so let's prove right maybe it's a lie

00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,679
maybe scott's lying to us

00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:51,039
okay look that's actually ubuntu 1804.

00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,840
wow now let's run that's great i'll run

00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:55,039
another one

00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,039
this is ubuntu

00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:02,480
2004. so suddenly

00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:04,640
i've got one tab here i'll color that

00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,520
and make it red and now i've got one tab

00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,440
here

00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:12,840
i'll make that one green that's ubuntu

00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,880
2004 that's ubuntu 1804. this is real

00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:18,400
ubuntu like there's

00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:23,280
h here's bim

00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:25,200
this is real so this means

00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:28,000
that directory structure here is

00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:30,400
actually my windows machine

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,960
yeah but i want to go over here in the

00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:37,520
linux file system where i have my own

00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:42,400
home area right we'll make a folder here

00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:44,880
called marlene in my home yeah okay

00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,559
yeah all right so then do i have python

00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,320
installed

00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:50,720
is it like dash dash version how do you

00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:53,760
ask about python there you go

00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:56,160
yes i've got python 2. how do i get

00:18:53,760 --> 00:19:00,320
python 3 how do i install that on linux

00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:01,679
right uh i think you should be able to

00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,080
say

00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,280
python 3. i forgot it i'm not sure i

00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,960
might already have it that's a great

00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,679
point

00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:12,080
see you're right okay cool and i can

00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:14,880
actually go and say i think it's which

00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,880
python3

00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:21,679
ah look at that we had just learned that

00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:23,840
we are in fact looking at uh the

00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:25,520
location of python 3 is installed at

00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,520
which is cool right

00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,840
and i want to point out that the the

00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:33,280
location of where i'm at right now

00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:34,799
isn't windows it's this linux world and

00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,320
on mac you have the thing it's called

00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,000
that i think it's called the finder is

00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:41,120
that where you look at your files right

00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,480
yeah so we have explorer and this is

00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,160
kind of interesting if i

00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,240
push enter right now i'm actually going

00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:50,080
to run a windows

00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:55,120
app from linux so i hit enter

00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:58,400
and it actually pops up windows explorer

00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:01,840
and it knows it's on ubuntu

00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:05,280
in fact any linux

00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,760
that's running shows up automatically in

00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,960
my

00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:12,720
in my world here and that's really cool

00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,440
yeah i put a file there let's go and do

00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,919
that

00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,919
so let's make of a python file

00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,960
now that i know how to print things in

00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,960
python

00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:29,360
okay do you put a semicolon or do you

00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,360
know semicolon in pi

00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:34,640
okay that's very cool

00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,000
no file name how do you do a phone right

00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,520
what have i done

00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,480
let me oh i got it i forgot to give it a

00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,480
file name sorry

00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:45,039
i see justin is laughing in the comments

00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:48,320
because of the windows comment

00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:49,840
that's okay it wasn't windows

00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,679
it was not windows it could have been

00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,840
ordinarily i with you

00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:55,280
i would 100 blame them but nope it was

00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:58,400
me i pushed i pushed

00:20:55,280 --> 00:21:01,520
ctrl w too fast okay

00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:04,720
so here

00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:07,760
i do a refresh and you'll see this

00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:11,200
on windows i'm seeing the file that i

00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:14,799
literally just made over in

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,480
ubuntu world so here's where it gets

00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:18,000
really powerful

00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,080
you do you ever use visual studio code

00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,360
or what's your favorite editor

00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:25,360
yeah i'm using well i use visual studio

00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:27,760
code not for other uh program and

00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:30,400
pycharm as well for

00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:32,240
python as well but both i actually have

00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,760
both on my laptop so

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,280
wow great and that's really common

00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,200
people have multiple different

00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:39,520
um environments you can see here that

00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:42,640
i've got multiple pythons

00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:44,559
in linux on windows so here we see

00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:47,600
python 3.6

00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:49,120
under here is python374 in the windows

00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,320
world so you have to keep track of where

00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:54,799
these things are

00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:54,799
but a moment ago we just made a file

00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:02,880
here in the linux world

00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,280
but i can run visual studio code and

00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,559
press

00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:08,480
enter it's actually launching a windows

00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:10,840
app so it's a windows app

00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,799
but if you look in the lower left corner

00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:16,159
here

00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:17,200
it knows we're connected to ubuntu again

00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:19,120
on the same machine

00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,559
and this isn't just a virtual machine

00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:23,440
because you saw that it started in

00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:24,960
one second exactly this is a very

00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:28,480
integrated environment

00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:31,600
now watch this is awesome so now

00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:35,760
i've got python this py

00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:37,840
file here and if i look at my extensions

00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:41,840
if i want i can see do i have python

00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,840
extensions already installed

00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:47,520
just look at this for the python

00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:50,400
extension

00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,600
this is a bit of a brain twister so bear

00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,400
with me here

00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,039
i'm running a windows app yeah i'm

00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,320
running

00:22:55,039 --> 00:23:01,679
vs code but i'm going to install

00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:03,440
the linting and the debugging inside

00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,520
linux because that's where it belongs

00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:08,720
because that's where python lives

00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:10,720
right okay so let's install that

00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,679
and i want to show you if we look over

00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:15,360
here in the extensions

00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:18,320
here we go reload required so we'll just

00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:21,679
do a quick reload forget our extension

00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:26,799
and i want to juxtapose i have

00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:28,880
35 extensions local to my computer

00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:30,320
you just saw a moment ago that i do not

00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:34,240
have

00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:37,760
uh python36 installed in on windows

00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:40,559
inside ubuntu

00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,960
i have just two extensions so visual

00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:43,840
studio

00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:47,279
we have a client server application now

00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:50,799
the language service lives in linux

00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:54,400
the app runs in windows yeah

00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:56,480
not cool so rob is asking in the chat

00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,440
yeah exactly so rob is asking can i make

00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,760
a terminal

00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,520
shortcut to launch the python shell from

00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:04,559
a linux subsystem as a shell

00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:06,559
oh this is great what a great question i

00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:09,600
don't know let's find out

00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:11,120
so if i come out here to like dos

00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,840
i'm in dos or whatever you know i'm on

00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:16,960
windows if i type bash

00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:19,840
run bash right so could i type bash

00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,840
python3

00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,919
how do you what's the command because

00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:27,360
like pell bash to then run

00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:30,799
run a thing there's gonna be a rule here

00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:32,960
let's find out well usually i

00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:34,880
i think you just say like python 3 and

00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,480
then the name of the file

00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:39,600
no but i want to like run the shell the

00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:42,080
python shell you know what i mean

00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:45,120
i want to go and tell bash to launch a

00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,120
binary to launch

00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:52,000
i want to tell bash is what i do

00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:54,240
on windows to go and like run my sh my

00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:58,159
shell

00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:59,840
i think this is bad we'll do it

00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:01,200
that will do it it didn't do it though

00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,000
so let's make sure i'm using the right

00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,960
bash

00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,960
okay so there's cash

00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:10,799
but hang on there's also wsl.exe

00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,840
wsl.exe

00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:22,039
wsl is the windows subsystem for linux

00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:25,840
so i think i might be able to go

00:25:22,039 --> 00:25:29,440
wcell.exe exec python3

00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:33,120
there you go

00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:34,720
i think that's what rob wanted so

00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,400
can i make a terminal shortcut to launch

00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,360
the shell directly into the shell so

00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,679
there you go

00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:41,600
so i've just gone and run ubuntu and

00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:44,080
then passed in the next exec

00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,440
which is that i think i could have also

00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,760
done what we were trying to do which was

00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,240
run

00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:50,320
bash and then tell bash to run python so

00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,960
it's up to you

00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:55,279
okay so that's a great question so so

00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,400
basically anything you can ask for yes

00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:58,559
you can do

00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,600
now this command line here this wsl that

00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:01,440
you had said

00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,679
a moment ago that you're not familiar

00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,679
with

00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:07,919
is the manager it's kind of our command

00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,960
line

00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:13,840
and we can say wsl list

00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,039
and i can list out that's my default

00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,400
linux

00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,960
and then i've got a bunch of other

00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,720
linuxes this way i can test all my

00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:25,039
software on different ones

00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:27,120
right yeah so back to here

00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:29,200
if we open up this one remember when we

00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:32,400
just installed python

00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:34,559
inside linux

00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,960
and basically if we go back to linux we

00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:40,240
can run

00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:43,200
actually probably on top let's try h top

00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:45,279
see how it says vs code server this vs

00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,120
code client vs code server

00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:48,960
so this is really cool from a windows

00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,840
developer perspective and all of this is

00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,400
free

00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,919
all this is open source no one's trying

00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:57,120
to sell you anything

00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:57,120
i should be able now

00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:06,559
how do i do oh here we go look we can

00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:08,240
just pop something up

00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:10,720
okay cool this is where you're going to

00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,720
help me now

00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:17,279
so do i pick it i thought this one right

00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,399
look at that it's actually found in each

00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,840
and notice the path

00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:22,559
yeah actually finding them in the right

00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:25,760
location i'll pick that one

00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:29,760
right and then if you look down here

00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:31,279
it knows i'm on ubuntu and i've got

00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,440
python there and then it's saying well

00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:36,559
hey you want to get

00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:39,360
pilot okay

00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:41,360
so if i say install it's going to go and

00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,799
walk me through all these things for pip

00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:45,200
and all those different environments

00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:46,080
and i drop down to the command line down

00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,200
here

00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:50,240
i can go an apt install or run homebrew

00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,120
or whatever right

00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,600
so you might be running homebrew and

00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,720
then

00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:58,480
look i'm getting intellisense and

00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:02,399
documentation

00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:03,279
for python right so how's it doing it

00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:06,399
right

00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:10,559
the the thing that paints the the text

00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:12,240
is windows but the language services

00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:14,840
python language services the python

00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:18,399
linter lives over in

00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:21,760
linux that's very cool

00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:23,200
when is this mainstream available now

00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:26,000
it's been available for a couple of

00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,760
years yes absolutely so you can

00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,279
you can do this now i've got youtube's

00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:32,080
on it um

00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:34,320
there's two wsls there's w01 w cell 2

00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:36,159
but if you want to run

00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,360
to be clear to answer vince's question

00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:39,520
for his students

00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,720
if you want to run python on windows and

00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,559
use visual studio code

00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,960
all of this exists but if what you

00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:45,679
really want is for your students to have

00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,799
a limits

00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:51,840
experience what you do

00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:52,880
is you go into this part of windows

00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:56,559
calling

00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:59,679
turn windows features on and off

00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:01,840
and you just check this box windows

00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:03,600
subsystem for linux and you turn that on

00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:06,320
uh you have this on your computer

00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:09,760
already uh vince in the question

00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:11,200
uh in the chat there and um this uh has

00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,159
been around for a while and it's also

00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,679
supported on

00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:17,840
windows home which is super important

00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:19,120
because not every student has the pro

00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:22,159
version of windows

00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:25,760
this works on the regular home version

00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:27,440
exactly so to rob brescino's point

00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:29,440
all the python development stuff on

00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,039
crypto libraries

00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,480
all that stuff is a nightmare to install

00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:35,760
yes you can do all of that

00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:37,600
so the steps are for any win this is

00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:40,240
great because it opens up python to any

00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:43,840
windows to any windows laptop

00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:46,960
so right windows features

00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:48,720
you go and turn on the wsl subsystem

00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,799
then you go and you get the windows

00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,640
terminal and the store and that's also

00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:55,919
on github

00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,799
you go and you get visual studio code vs

00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,039
code

00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:00,640
and then visual studio code will walk

00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:03,200
you through all of this stuff

00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,480
and install the extensions that you need

00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,039
automatically

00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,159
it's super super easy and then when you

00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:11,360
want to go and get

00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:14,720
a linux you actually can just go

00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:15,360
here to the store and type in literally

00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:20,159
search for

00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:23,440
linux in the store as amazing as that is

00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:25,120
yeah and look ubuntu and susa

00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,480
are just literally in the windows store

00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,880
now it might seem like they're trying to

00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:32,720
sell you something they're not the store

00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:34,000
is just making a tarball of the linux

00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:37,600
that you want and then it just

00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:42,320
unzips the tarball for you

00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:46,159
is that cool oh and then i think

00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:51,840
see if this works that's very cool

00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:54,080
look let's look at that

00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:56,000
it's asking me what i want to do so

00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,919
let's just debug this current python

00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,960
file

00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:01,360
now look at that i'm on windows and i'm

00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,640
doing

00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:06,559
live interactive debugging

00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,480
true python but look at the command line

00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:12,559
down here marlene

00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:14,880
yeah so you saw the environment python3

00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:16,399
it launches vs code server and this is

00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:19,360
the trick

00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:20,960
see it's listening on a different port

00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:23,039
and that's how

00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,960
we're communicating with linux on the

00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:26,480
same computer over a port

00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,279
and then look there's the python

00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:33,279
debugger right there debug py

00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:35,120
see and it launches listening on a port

00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:36,880
and then at this point i just need to go

00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,480
and install pip and get my linters and

00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,919
stuff so i need to figure out

00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,039
you know which linter i'm going to use

00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:41,840
and install it and all that kind of

00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:43,679
stuff

00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:45,440
because right now it says there's no pip

00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:49,279
installer so

00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:52,399
how do you install pip in my terminal

00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:52,399
i have to go in here uh

00:31:53,200 --> 00:32:01,600
it should be python three

00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:04,640
i think 5.3 pip is still hang on let me

00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:07,840
come on google it together shall we

00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:09,120
yeah python3

00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,120
these are the things that i would have

00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:14,240
expected oh it's get up py

00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:16,000
that's what it is i

00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,440
but remember i'm on ubuntu so i'll go

00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,679
and do that

00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:22,080
oh there it is sudo apt this is great

00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:24,000
now this is a great example look at this

00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,840
those dollar signs remember this is

00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,960
where the windows user

00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:34,880
feels sad they don't need to feel

00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:34,880
right so now we just go back out here

00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,640
see

00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:47,120
that's going to go off really fast

00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:49,039
i love the progress bars on ubuntu

00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,240
right you feel powerful when a progress

00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:52,000
bar happens

00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,600
cool so now i've got that look how nice

00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:57,360
and fast that was

00:32:53,600 --> 00:33:01,120
we go back over here and i think we were

00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:01,120
setting up a linter if i recall

00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:08,240
linter enable linter select linter

00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:12,960
highlight install

00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:20,640
look look it's installing it for me

00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:22,880
inside cool

00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:25,120
yeah look at that isn't that great so

00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,880
now i've got my linter installed

00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,919
now what's what's a how what's a good

00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,360
thing that you can do with a linter

00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:32,799
what's the silly thing we can type that

00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,799
the linter will get mad at us about

00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:41,440
uh i'm not sure maybe just uh

00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:44,880
um i'm not sure maybe you could run

00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:48,240
print but maybe without

00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:52,559
i don't know without the brackets or

00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:53,440
without the see look at that great point

00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:56,720
so i just did it

00:33:53,440 --> 00:34:01,039
without a quote for example i lit

00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:03,120
caught it and i can go and click on it

00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:05,200
peek on the problem i get the actual

00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:09,119
information from pilot

00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:12,639
all again living in the linux world

00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:16,240
isn't that great yeah that's pretty cool

00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:18,399
yeah so that is the the correct or the

00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:20,639
better experience for people who are

00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:23,839
interested in running python

00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:26,639
today but they want a linux environment

00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:27,679
and you notice down here i can even run

00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:30,720
my bash

00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:33,760
inside vs code great way

00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:34,879
for people to learn linux and use their

00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,599
existing windows machines because

00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:36,879
honestly

00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:38,960
i think it's fair to say that not

00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:42,159
everybody running around the continent

00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:45,040
has the latest macbook pro right

00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:46,159
that's very true if you've got a random

00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:49,520
bell

00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:51,359
from wherever you can do this today

00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,800
you can get wsl and you can be running

00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:54,000
linux and you'll be a much more

00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,720
effective

00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,280
uh developer because it's probably linux

00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:02,480
that you're going to end up deploying to

00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:04,400
later right

00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,320
yeah no that's great and i think for

00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,000
most people i would say most people on

00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:11,839
the continent are using when

00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:14,800
are not using um macs or linux

00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:16,720
so it's a great thing if this is

00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:19,839
something that's accessible to them yep

00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:21,760
exactly i see questions there

00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:23,839
saying the linter is in the linux world

00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:27,119
yes everything so

00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:29,680
all language services only windows

00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:30,800
is printing and drawing on the screen

00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:34,720
and if i go

00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:38,480
file open file i'm in i'm in the linux

00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:40,400
file system so yes um the linter the

00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:43,200
compiler the runner

00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:45,520
the the debugger all of this is

00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:47,359
experienced is entirely in this world so

00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:50,960
when i fix that

00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:54,800
um and i go and hit f5 you know f

00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:56,480
f5 and run it and go and bug that

00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,960
now i'm doing live debugging you can see

00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:02,320
i got global variables call stack

00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:03,200
that's entirely linux world so i could

00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,280
uninstall

00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:07,440
python from windows entirely i don't

00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,880
even need python

00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,640
right because it doesn't live in this

00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,440
world i'm just using the environment

00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:14,240
around it

00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:17,040
it's really really nice vs code is in

00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:18,240
the windows world yes

00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,240
because i'm using windows and then of

00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:22,040
course to our original point remember i

00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:25,040
can go back over here and i can say

00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:25,040
explorer.exe

00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:29,520
and now there's the windows file system

00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:32,240
and i can open up my python file and

00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,240
there it is see

00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:38,240
it's a lovely integrated integrated

00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,240
experience

00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:45,520
cool yeah that's really cool

00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:49,839
um yeah does anyone have any questions

00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:50,720
i'm not a super big windows user but i

00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:53,920
would love to

00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:55,359
i think we have we actually have three

00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:58,320
minutes

00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:58,320
um left

00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:04,320
any last minute questions for scott

00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,520
about this feel free to ask in the

00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:09,200
comments i thought it was

00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:11,359
it's pretty cool actually um

00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:13,119
yeah and it seems like a lot of people

00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:14,960
think this is helpful

00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:16,320
i know vince is saying so vince has a

00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:19,040
question and he's asking

00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,440
if you had two installs of python one in

00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:22,079
the

00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:24,960
linux world and one in the windows world

00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:24,960
would they be awake

00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:32,880
you'll note you'll note that in windows

00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:35,520
i've got python i think we said i have

00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:38,960
python 3.74

00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:42,160
okay so if we took our marlene

00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:44,000
file or hello py and i put it over in

00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:46,880
the windows world

00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,800
and i'll make a new folder here called

00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:52,560
marlene windows

00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:56,240
and i'll put that file in there

00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:57,119
yeah and make a copy now notice that

00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,680
i've got my win

00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:59,680
my my

00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:04,960
i've got my window my visual studio code

00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:08,240
rather pardon me

00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:12,000
here and then i'm going to go and

00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:14,320
right click and say open with code here

00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,079
i'll put visual studio code on the left

00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:20,800
and on the right

00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:23,839
the one on the right is in the windows

00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:27,599
file system and the one on the left

00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:27,599
is in the in the

00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:34,320
linux file system you'll notice

00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:38,160
over here it says ubuntu

00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:41,920
and python369

00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:43,599
over here it says python382 and it's on

00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:46,800
windows

00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:48,240
now rob is saying can i avoid installing

00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:51,440
python and windows at all

00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:52,800
yes absolutely 100

00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:55,359
you do not need to install python on

00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:57,760
windows but in visual studio code

00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:58,800
do everything in linux when you're in

00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,920
linux

00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:03,280
everything will happen remotely and

00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,960
even if you want to you could run it in

00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:07,520
a docker container

00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,720
so you don't even need to install python

00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:12,079
anywhere

00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:15,839
if you don't want to or vs code

00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:15,839
remote containers

00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:20,079
and we have a whole topic on doing

00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:23,200
remote container work

00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:24,079
specifically if you want to do python we

00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,240
walk you through

00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:27,520
exactly what that looks like and how to

00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:30,880
set that up

00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:33,280
so we have a section on vs code

00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:35,200
remote try python so if i go and search

00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:39,440
for vs code remote

00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:42,880
try python this is a sample we've got

00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:45,280
up on github okay so i'm just going to

00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,800
copy that to the clipboard and what i'm

00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:48,000
going to do is i'll just come out here

00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,920
to windows and i'll just

00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,359
come to the desktop and i'm just going

00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:57,440
to go and clone that repository

00:39:53,359 --> 00:40:00,640
okay so i want to point this out

00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:02,880
here's some python a whole app i'm going

00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:06,079
to run vs code

00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:07,280
i don't have it installed on windows

00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:09,280
and what's going to happen is it's going

00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,960
to pop up a dialog box in the corner

00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:17,200
here and it's going to say

00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:17,200
look this is a development container

00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:24,800
okay so what we can do is run this

00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:25,760
inside of docker it's going to open this

00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,480
thing up and

00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,599
install all the tools that you want in

00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:33,119
docker

00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:34,160
okay and when we reopen this as a

00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:39,839
container

00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:39,839
down here right it will oops

00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,240
oh i have to go and run docker i'm not

00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,520
actually running docker right now but

00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,520
what will happen is

00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,960
it will install python into the

00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,839
container run everything in the

00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,599
container

00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:53,599
and you don't have to install python

00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:55,359
even inside of linux it's just

00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:56,720
container based entirely which is pretty

00:40:55,359 --> 00:41:00,720
cool

00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:02,319
so that is all here under opening

00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,760
in a container developing a container

00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:04,160
and then to the questions that we had

00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,640
about

00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,440
vs code runs here vs code server runs

00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,760
here

00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,720
python lives and works and runs over on

00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:15,119
this side

00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:18,839
okay yeah

00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:21,839
that's very cool well that's

00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:21,839
right

00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:34,000
uh good luck and apologies to folks that

00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,720
we're looking forward to talking to

00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,200
william

00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:39,359
right now he's doing his best with his

00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:42,160
power situation

00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:44,079
and uh it's unfortunate let's see what

00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:45,599
he's got any more power back

00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:48,560
yeah it looks like he hasn't been back

00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:49,839
up in about 48 minutes so he's in a

00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,520
tough situation there but we'll

00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:56,240
hopefully see his stuff

00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:56,240
uh soon uh uploaded offline talk

00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:01,280
exactly but this has been really great
