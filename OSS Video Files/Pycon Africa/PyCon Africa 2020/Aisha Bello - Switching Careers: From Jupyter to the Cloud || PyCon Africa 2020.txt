Title: Aisha Bello - Switching Careers: From Jupyter to the Cloud || PyCon Africa 2020
Publication date: 2020-08-28
Playlist: PyCon Africa 2020
Description: 
	While many of us knew what we were passionate about from the get-go, others need to go through different career options to finally decide what they’re really passionate about. And who says we all have to follow one path throughout our careers. For some, they get bored after a number of years and are keen on trying something different. Not to say pursuing breadth (Jack of all trades/Generalist) vs Depth (Expertise in a niche/Specialist) is always going to be in fashion and means financial freedom. But what if we could chart our own path, not follow the crowd or what is in vogue but take advantage of the endless possibilities that exist in the software/technology world. What if we looked at things from a different angle where everything is connected, not an Us vs Them, but where all our experiences are neurons/layers part of a bigger neural network and we constantly take learning from the back propagations.

Here, I would walk the audience through my transition story of how I made the switch from being an attempted Django developer to a Data Specialist, a Network Engineer, and now a Cloud Engineer. I would also give real-life examples of developers turned business analysts/ product designers.

Like a popular African proverb “There are many roads that lead to the market, ” which means that whichever path you take, however long, bent or narrow the road is, as long as you eventually find your way to the market the real story is in the journey and your learning along the way. “To thy own self be true”. But many times thy self isn’t immediately apparent, there is a lot of growth and learning that needs to happen before getting to your end game.

Summary of proposed Agenda

* A brief history and introduction to the speaker’s career options over a number of years

* Key questions to ask yourself when making the move. E.g. financial implication, your WHY/End goal, Networking, and support system, where to begin.

* A list of general steps anyone making the switch can take

* Some good old advice from our African ancestors, and from people who have made the transition

* Standout projects from both worlds and how learning from one domain significantly helped with learning in the new domain

* Conclusion and next steps

currently mostly

00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,960
mostly focused on um infrastructure as

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,559
code you know

00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,800
automatic infrastructure cloud

00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:59,520
infrastructure um

00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,600
you know with python as an example but

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,600
i'm also mostly a generalist

00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,040
uh so from an architectural point of

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,439
view from a cloud architecture point of

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,520
view

00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:08,880
i focus on other things doing cloud

um paths and serverless type um

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,119
offerings

00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,320
um i started my python journey on the

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:20,159
website of things

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,520
yay django um then transitioned into

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,560
data science

00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,040
then i moved on to become um a network

00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,080
engine

00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,799
engineer uh and now i'm based

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,560
on the cloud on in i'm in the cloud i'm

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:35,360
at the cloudy side of these

00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,520
uh pipe clouds for shorts um i'm a very

00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:40,479

yes yes yes to that yes every time

00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:52,479
uh my mantra is like i'm learning i

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,720
believe that we

00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,880
i am constantly growing constantly

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,920
learning constantly on learning and

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,119
relearning

00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,159
and part of my own drive for continuous

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:05,119
improvement

00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,360
like i'm learning like i will never

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,440

i'm a jack of all trades you know my

00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,360

for another day

00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,280
uh but yeah like i'm uh that's literally

00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,959
my mantra

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,599
to be honest lifetime lifetime there now

00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:29,200

00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,480
below

00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,040
uh my gay hop chanted65 and i do co-host

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,680
a podcast with one of my girlfriends

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,360
um titled rogue on learning we do have a

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,239
tech series on that podcast where we try

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,840
to break down

00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:51,599
complex technical concepts um but now we

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:55,599
are moving on to the perks

00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:59,200
of mata and today we are talking

00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:00,879
about moving careers

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,560
so i wanted to start off this talk

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,319
talking about like you know from a

00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,239
journey perspective you know

00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,680
starting off to getting to that point

00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,879
where you know it's always going to be a

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,239
journey it's never really going to end

00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,159
but getting to that point where you feel

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,680
like you've matured in your journey

00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,360
and you're more present and more

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,800
conscious of what happens next

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:22,080
so who am i i am african

00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,280
not because i was born in africa but

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,680
because africa

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,040
was born in me now if you look at africa

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,280
as a construct like

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,879
not as a country as the whole continent

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,239
the different countries from the north

00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,640
to the south to the east

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,799
to the west there are different

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,840
countries different cultures even within

00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,760
the countries

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,519
you could not they could not be any more

00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,560
diverse in terms of like dialects and

00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,799
languages

00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,000
the full type of food that one tribe is

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,560
versus the other

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
um just the mannerisms and you know in

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,920
that diversity and

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,239
even in that complexity because human

00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,040
beings are complex in that complexity we

00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,920
are

00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,080
it's it's it's it's it's literally the

00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,319
beauty of it all right it's like

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,840
um everything that makes africa what it

00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,879
is it's it's people and it's

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,519
diversity in in culture and in

00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,200
everything

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,720
so if we look at africa as a country and

00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,159
i know that i am africa

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,640
um and i know that personally i like to

00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,160
know

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,160
different things like i don't want to be

00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,000
put in a box like i want

00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,079
to be the bosses like in many different

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,160
boxes as much as possible that was

00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,440
ever a culture that was possible and i

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,720
want to you know

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,560
i just don't want anyone to come in the

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,600
boston society will put you in a box

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,479
everyone have expectation about who you

00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,720
should be

00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,479
where you should aspire to like however

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,880
say like if you grew up in an african

00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,160
home

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,600
there are three things that you should

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,160
be through career paths that you should

00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,320
follow

00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,520
if you are not any of the and you don't

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,400
know what you are doing with your life

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,600
so if you are not a doctor an engineer

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,199
or a lawyer

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,639
everything else you are wasting your

00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,199
time with you wasting your energy every

00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,880
single day

00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,479
after parents cannot relate they cannot

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,639
understand so um

00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,400
so literally like you know as the whole

00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,479
society puts in this book

00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,400
so for me in terms of like discovering

00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,479
myself on this career journey

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,240
it's almost like it's okay if i like

00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,759
multiple things it's okay if i'm

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,639
interested in multiple things and if

00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,520
that one thing

00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,800
isn't where oh i'm learning python but

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,600
i'm not sure i want to be a social

00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,440
developer

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,880
i can be something else i can be

00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,120
anything else i could be

00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,960
everything because africa is everything

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,320
is not one thing africa is everything

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,880
like african is

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,560
africa is its people and its people are

00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,039
complex so

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,560
just to like you know the idea regarding

00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,080
that is that you can have many career

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,720
options you can follow many different

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,800
parts

00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,840
it's okay if you don't do the one thing

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,000
for the rest of your life

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,360
some people get bored i not abnormal

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,720
you're not you know

00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,360
being um liking or when i say being a

00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,160
jack of

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,600
all trades is not abnormal um and

00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,160
sometimes it's not like a jack of all

00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,840
trades

00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,919
at one point in time it's almost like

00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,199
over a period of time after

00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:55,520
going through many different career

00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,280
options you will tend yourself as

00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,240
somebody who has been in deaf

00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,199
many different um options or different

00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,039
career parts

00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,800
that you could think of yourself as a

00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:07,199
generalist right

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,960
and and so it depends it depends on the

00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,720
journey it depends on where you are

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,720
um in that journey so i really like this

00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,520
photo um i got it from essay people in

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,720
africa the

00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,639
um their blog um 2016 back in the day

00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,400
it's time to you know tested i am africa

00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,680
and africa is man there's a point with a

00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,720
whole poem around it

00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,880
um if you want to check that out um

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,479
let's let's just you know what if we

00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,880
look at things from a different

00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,880
angle where everything is connected so

00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,360
yeah i'm sure they're like technologists

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,960
listening to this um talk and you know

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,120
you're already familiar with the neural

00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,919
network's uh concept and how that

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,560
activity artificial neural network

00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,759
relates

00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:48,800
to um the like you know the

00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,400
human um neural uh network

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,080
now what if we look at things let's

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,520
let's let's just try and analyze

00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,599
i like analogies because i think that

00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,000
they help to drive

00:06:55,599 --> 00:07:00,160
the point home what if all what if we

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,199
think of our careers or our jobs our

00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,319
current goals as

00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:06,800
impedes right and in each of those

00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,840
um career options that you decide to go

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,280
into

00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:13,199
um you are learning different skills

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,479
right you're writing different skills

00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,479
that are going to be

00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,599
that their skills that he did you know

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,280
you're learning skills

00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,199
you're learning different tools and

00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,919
those ideas those are processing on the

00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,000
inside

00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:25,599
but guess what every skill and every

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,360
tool has a different weight

00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:29,199
but guess what all of these things start

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,360
to show you the skills that you

00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,240
amass the different career options that

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,880
you go through

00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,080
is all trying to lead you to a final

00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,840
place because as human beings are

00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,160
constantly learning like you could not

00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,759
be in any aspect of technology and say

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,599
you get one knowledge and that's it

00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,360
you constantly have to revenge

00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:47,599
constantly you have to learn so what if

00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:51,039
you look at our experiences

00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:52,160
as layers where or you know layers or

00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:55,840
nodes you know

00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:58,879
neurons people are all part of a bigger

00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,879
um network and we're taking learnings

00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,919
um from back propagations and we're

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,919
taking them and we're

00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,360
you know bringing them forward to get a

00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:07,840
desired um

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,440
output right so i like another analogy

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,240
and i hope um this makes

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,120
a bit of sense now when people talk

00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,160
about

00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,039
these um when we look at these things

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,039
right

00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:21,199
it's easy to just say oh you can do this

00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:23,120
or you can do that oh anyone learning

00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,479
a language should be going through you

00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,039
know this path yeah you know what

00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,039
developer

00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,720
you know like you know it's almost like

00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,120
everything is cookie cutter but we're

00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,719
not

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,479
human beings are complex like even

00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:37,440
within a family like that yet

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,719
two different kids from the same parents

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,279
you know they couldn't be any more

00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,560
different

00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,560
right even though they're brought up the

00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,279
same way so i think like when we're

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,920
looking at

00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:47,519
you know our construct or sorry when

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,000
we're looking at our journey as a whole

00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,080
it's always i like to think of of things

00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,279
from a depth

00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:58,480
breath or from a passion perspective

00:08:55,279 --> 00:09:01,040
so you could classify depths as you know

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,800
someone who's going you know in in depth

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,560
like especially so it comes like

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,480
you know develop really good expertise

00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,200
and they just dive in and keep diving in

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,800
and become

00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,279
you know an expert which is amazing

00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:14,640
which is great um or you can go

00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:16,959
a breath option where um this is

00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:19,120
called the generalist right where they

00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,839
have an idea about many different things

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,360
and you find them probably in

00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:26,080
architectural um

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,519
type roles or product type roles where

00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,120
they know a bit about everything and

00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,560
they can bring all of that

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,480
they could be they could bring the

00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,519
diversity in their experiences and their

00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,080
career options

00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,839
to the table to give some sort of richer

00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,839
perspective versus just looking at

00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,600
things from a laser focus

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,360
point of view and then you find that

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,040
people move careers just because they're

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,920
passionate about something else right

00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,200
so i like i i i divide this into three

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,120
different things so it's either

00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,640
you want to be a spell specialist or you

00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,560
want to be a generalist or you

00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,399
pursue something you're pushing

00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,200
something completely different out of

00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,560
passion

00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:03,120
which is also valid so but like when you

00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:05,120
are trying to decide on which way to go

00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,279
you want to start with your why we all

00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,200
need to you always want to know

00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:11,360
know your why it's okay to want more

00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,160
it's okay to want what's best for you

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,160
but what is your why like if you can sit

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,200
down and define your why is it passion

00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,760
that's driving you

00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,279
oh are you so passionate or are you so

00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,399
interested in the setting field that

00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,560
you'd rather go and

00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,320
dive into that field oh do you like to

00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,839
you know like me do you like a bit of

00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,959
everything like you know you want the

00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,040
buffet you don't want

00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,160
the one customer you want the entire

00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,680
buffet you want to

00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,880
choose you know bring your place you

00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,040
know when you go to like some people in

00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,680
nigeria i'll call one day parties maybe

00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,959
they have like

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,040
you know different options you can't put

00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:43,200
a little bit a lot of fries

00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,079
a little bit of egg veggie like just

00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,920
play with that

00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,920
apple friday just put everything on your

00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,079
plate just looking colorful you know

00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,200
i eaten wonderfully you know that by the

00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,040
end of the day your stomach

00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,880
might tell you something else but you

00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,920
always want to start

00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,760
with your why like you want like why why

00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,000
am i doing this or why am i interested

00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,920
in

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,680
doing this and what you the one

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,240
different for everybody like

00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,079
you you cannot you cannot use somebody

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,360
else's wife to define

00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:13,440
what you want or what your why is right

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,279
and when you you figure out like okay

00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,440
when you decided what's

00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,480
what's your why you know why am i doing

00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,399
this yo

00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,480
or why i want to make this change and

00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,560
why i want to move from here to here

00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,079
you want to figure out your how you know

00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,680
your heart could be a bunch of many

00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:30,000
things how will be different

00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,000
your heart could be as somebody's wow

00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,600
how could be as simple as

00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
switching departments within the same

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,519
company or taking on more responsibility

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
another person is how i might be

00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:42,480
completely overhauling what they're

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,079
doing and completely moving ship

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,680
to a different um career um

00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,440
part like you know you want to figure

00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,560
out your how like what is my selling

00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,560
point like everybody has

00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,320
everybody has everybody has something

00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,000
unique that they bring to the table like

00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,440
you know because at the end of the day

00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,440
even trying to figure out like who

00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,440
who you should be you are also trying to

00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,639
make sure that you are differentiating

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,519
yourself from the class so what are

00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,200
those extra

00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,880
things you bring to the table that many

00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,279
people don't already have like that is

00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,279
your

00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:13,120
that is your unique selling point right

00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,800
and once you figure out like your how

00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,240
then you now like sit down and discover

00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,200
okay what are my transferable skills

00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,880
because guess what

00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:23,440
no skill is wasted like i went from

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,079
going deep going you know trying to

00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,200
learn

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:29,600
do web with jungle their data science

00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,600
and then going to completely like being

00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,639
a network engineer like on premises type

00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,240
infrastructure

00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,839
where it's like it's almost like it

00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,560
wouldn't say it's unrelated but it's

00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,920
almost like

00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,519
you can think of me that there are

00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,040
skills that are transferable from one

00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,399
place you know no matter how many

00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,399
there might be different ways you know

00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,279
if you go back to the neural um network

00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,560
i saw earlier

00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,560
different skills might have different

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:51,040
weights but it doesn't make it

00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:53,440
any less valuable um and it is

00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:56,480
transferable depending on

00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,800
um depending on where um you're

00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,240
you're going to go and again like i know

00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,839
we can speak all the english that we

00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,000
want but money is important

00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,680
right some of us have um

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,360
responsibilities we have financial

00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,200
responsibilities and obligations

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,720
some of us can afford we don't some of

00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,600
us don't have that support system

00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,959
because when people

00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,800
try to look at the richest people in the

00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,480
world and you don't you don't understand

00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,880
that some of them had a very good

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,639
support system to be able to you know

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,240
bring that idea that he had that was

00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,839
crazy that nobody believed in right they

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,120
had it they had the support system but

00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,000
some people don't have the luxury of the

00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,480
support system

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,760
and still have to support a family so

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,480
you also want to think about financial

00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,240
applications

00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,079
this is going to be different for

00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,240
everybody so if that means that

00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,320
you maybe have to plan six months ahead

00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,160
to sort of like save towards

00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,079
that time maybe transitioning careers

00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,600
and just because for you to transition

00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,120
to a new career you might not need to go

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,360
back and take a junior role

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,519
and working your way up to see your role

00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,160
um or maybe you have to take an unpaid

00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,920
interest

00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,440
internship so if you have to plan that

00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,160
you also have to take that into

00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,160
cognizant

00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,959
i'm not going to claim to be like a an

00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,440
expensive perspire to desire or acquire

00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,680
to

00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,120
once i want a motivational type speaker

00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,320
but i'm these are these are the things

00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,519
that i've thought about in my own

00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,920
journey that i feel like

00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,120
they're very important that people who

00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,880
don't tend to

00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,720
to look at right and it's okay to switch

00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:15,680
characters for the money like oh

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,279
i i was a big developer because yeah

00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,480
they're well paid like that's actually

00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,959
very valid as well

00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,639
right um so just looking at going

00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:25,440
forward looking at things from a depth

00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,880
breath and a passion perspective um will

00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,279
sort of like help you

00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:31,120
you know articulate and write down what

00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,560
your why is like your plan like your

00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,160
plan include your why

00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,760
your how like i don't want to say your

00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,600
vision or your mission assessment like

00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,519
just something very practical and simple

00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,120
like why am i doing this how am i going

00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,079
to get to where i want to go what are

00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,920
the skills that i can

00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,839
that are transferrable and what are the

00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,920
financial implications like if you

00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,360
get these key things like it's a lot

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,480
easier to make that switch

00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:54,639
or submit that transition now i want to

00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,639
give examples i have three examples

00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,320
that i want to give of people who i know

00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,040
who have made this switch to drive my

00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,600
point home

00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,760
just to give that idea that the journeys

00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,760
would be different so meet allowing me

00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,040
along with me um you know that's

00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:10,000
actually studied electric

00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,399
electrical engineering um and but she

00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,720
went

00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,760
on i worked for eric erickson for like

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,040
13 years

00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,040
and i thought that i think for another

00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,639
four years she worked for andela and she

00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,399
and she led um i think she was the

00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:22,320
people's manager um

00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,800
and she learned a team of you know

00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:27,920
developers and product managers

00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,279
um and then this year she decided you

00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,160
know what i want to go and pursue my

00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,800
passion

00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,320
right and it's very valid because she's

00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,279
passionate about art like

00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:39,040
and so for her in her own words right at

00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:40,399
his her first love so even if

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,480
she had to go through different

00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,600
engineering stages and software

00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,680
development stages

00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,120
she still ended up finding her way back

00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,880
home i guess

00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,959
you never don't even know what to expect

00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:53,759
from allowing me

00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:55,199
um and so she she says is very profound

00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,880
and i really like like you can read the

00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,880
entire thing this is very professional

00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,639
everything you truly seek is on the

00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,639
other side of your fear

00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,079
the day you can get up to do what you

00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,399
love without

00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,680
monetary gratification being the key

00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,959
motivation

00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:12,720
is the day you have found true freedom

00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:14,480
so you know you can reach out to allow

00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,800
me on twitter you can see she has

00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,240
amazing art pieces like actually she

00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,040
tells me like you know we had like a

00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,199
very brief

00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,120
you know chat and she said like

00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:25,360
definitely our skills

00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,440
you know you know being in engineering

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,240
and going into software development

00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:32,240
really helped her to become the talented

00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,800
fine artist that she is today

00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,959
and because of that knowledge um she's

00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,639
able to like transition that's

00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,920
what she's currently doing that she

00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,399
paints amazing pieces you should check

00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,920
it out

00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:46,399
on instagram at um love me arts um

00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,759
so the next one i want to say is my very

00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:49,440
good friend lady

00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,279
um i knew lady when he was still a

00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,240
software developer at della

00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:56,160
um and then he moved um into product

00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,480
management and to him this was his why

00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,560
like

00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,160
he was became more interested in getting

00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,240
closer to users

00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,360
um and representing them in the products

00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,559
they built you know that people who

00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,679
don't want to be on the back end who

00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:08,000
wants to be

00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,880
involved in the decision making on how

00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,919
the products

00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:15,120
go um and and guess what

00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:17,520
his experience as a software developer

00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,799
cannot be more valued in his current

00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,039
role as a product

00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:22,640
um manager so you can reach out to lady

00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,280
as well if you have any questions about

00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,120
making

00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,880
that switch because everybody i'm giving

00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,799
here are like open to you know

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,559
interactions whether you're connecting

00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:32,000
to them on linkedin or twitter to ask

00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,880
them questions if it's something you're

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,400
also

00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,840
currently looking at just know that

00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,720
you're not alone and you will not be the

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,760
first

00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:41,919
um i have had another friend hola

00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:44,880
um she transitioned from software

00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:47,360
development and now she's in it business

00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,080
and for her why is that she made the

00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,240
switch

00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,200
to gain more skills in it business i

00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,960
mean all these

00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,679
new skills like odd deeds risk

00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:58,400
compliance my head is like what what

00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:00,160
um um and now you know it's you know

00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,080
it's helping out in our current

00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,240
goal as i see management so it doesn't

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,000
really matter where you start from

00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,000
it matters what really matters is

00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,039
actually the journey as much as

00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,559
you know the the the destination so this

00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,520
is just you know another my friend as

00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:16,799
well that

00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:18,400
has made that career um transition

00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,919
and so i wanted to bring it back home

00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:23,039
and talk about myself like

00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:25,200
okay what was my journey timeline

00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,160
um like like i said earlier i started

00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,600
out like

00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:31,760
not just what my journey is but also

00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,440
how i would say i've transferred

00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:36,480
relevant skills

00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:39,280
um across boards literally

00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,720
and how python has been there with me in

00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,480
that journey which is one

00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,640
of you know how people say oh i came for

00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,080
the language the state for the community

00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,240
practically is one of those languages

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,520
that you you can come and continue to

00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,039
stay for both the language

00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,600
and the community because it's one of

00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:55,440
the widely you know the most widely used

00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,200
um languages that is not just even

00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,520
specific to a domain

00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,240
like you would be surprised the accents

00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,720
of which

00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,760
python libraries exist and the ways in

00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,080
which python is

00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,960
applied in different industries any

00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,600
different like

00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,120
uh you know career options so this is me

00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,760
giving you an example when i was

00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,160
when i i started out my python journey

00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,760
um

00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,360
you know with jungle girls letting

00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,960
jungle um

00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,480
and you know that was like something

00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,240
that was like oh wow i've never known

00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,640
about python like this is so much easier

00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,000
than

00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,200
trying to hit my head on the wall and

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,600
figure out um java like yo

00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,200
where you beat all my life you know and

00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,840
then i

00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,919
so i would say but i still had an innate

00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,600
love for data science because then i'd

00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:40,480
done a project where

00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,760
i was trying to use um fuzzy logic and

00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,880
um

00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,840
clustering algorithms to predict a

00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,120
criminal

00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:52,240
from a crime scene in the absence of

00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,840
like weaknesses to the crime so you

00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:57,360
actually i was literally using

00:19:53,840 --> 00:20:00,480
um characteristics like motorcycle randy

00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:02,960
um you know time or time the time a day

00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,919
you know the crime was committed using

00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,960
that

00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:09,039
to like a database of pre-exi uh

00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,159
pre-existing like criminals like

00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:12,480
offenders

00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:14,000
um and like the crimes are connected and

00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,039
using that to predict

00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,840
in the absence of um you know

00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:21,600
like a an eyewitness a pretty two would

00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,559
be like a criminal that committed that

00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,960
crime like i just

00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:26,559
loved how we data science i could almost

00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,280
like it was like magic i could predict

00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,960
the future

00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,360
and the possibilities were endless and

00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,440
so i was like you know what i'm going to

00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,120
focus on becoming a data specialist and

00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,760
then i got my first job

00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,120
um you know post university as a data

00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,880
specialist for a company and we did

00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,679
amazing projects trying to

00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:45,360
um actually very practically where i was

00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:48,640
working with like a power

00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:51,200
generating um sorry an electric this

00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,000
electricity distribution company to

00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,400
discover

00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,600
you know that the areas of geographic

00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,400
location that we covered

00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,840
and to discover which places did not

00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,919
have meters

00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:04,799
and we had this map it was beautiful i

00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:05,280
used data tools sorry python data tools

00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:08,320
like

00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:10,240
pandas bokeh for visualization

00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,440
um and to do that project so it was it

00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,400
was very interesting

00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,200
but guess what in the heat of all that

00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,320
going on

00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:21,600
i got poached um and i transitioned into

00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:24,400
networking um and i would say my

00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,679
my motivating factor was not was not

00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,880
depth or breadth

00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:32,240
it was uh no sorry it was not a

00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:34,320
passion it was money it was

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,919
a more lucrative deal that had that it

00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,919
was going to expose me to

00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:39,360
a different place a different

00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,679
opportunity

00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,200
and it was just better then and you know

00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,600
it's also valid and then

00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,799
i found out that python was relevant so

00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,200
i still think you know

00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:50,799
there are many tools that you can use in

00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,600
the networking space called

00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:54,480
um infrastructure space like you know

00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,120
like pie charts

00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,559
analyze network packets uh sorry like i

00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,360
said five shots pie shop

00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:03,280
so analyze the top uh packets you have

00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,799
libraries like sockets like

00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,080
you know not talk about requests like

00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:07,679
you know press reviews everywhere but

00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,240
they're like libraries that are relevant

00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,799
really

00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:13,280
even in the infrastructure um space and

00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:15,440
so for me um i went from being

00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,640
a network engineer to getting into the

00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,240
data centers

00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,400
and now i'm in the cloud i don't even

00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,640
know if pi cloud is a concept

00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,240
that actually exists but if it doesn't i

00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,840
i'll call it pi cloud which probably

00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,440
it's probably not a movement you guys

00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,840
don't just say cloud hits me which is

00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,039
not a python cloudy movement you know

00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,679
something like that i

00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:34,960
like the sound of like cloud um so so

00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,600
right now i do infrastructure it's

00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,799
called the python

00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:41,360
is relevant right in for example um in

00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:44,880
gcp you can use python to write

00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:47,440
um templates uh to deploy you know with

00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,480
with the ammo um to define what your

00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,600
infrastructure what you want your

00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,679
infrastructure

00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,360
um to look like and to manage and you

00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:55,840
can do version control

00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,799
and manage your infrastructure just via

00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,840
code without

00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:01,440
having to like you know ssh and do

00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,520
all of those things so there are many

00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,280
different aspects of like

00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,919
of you know the cloud this is not even

00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:10,000
going to platform as a service or

00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:13,360
writing functions in python

00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,799
um for event driven um type responses

00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,799
and you know when you go to functions

00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:17,440
and serverless like deposit you know

00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:19,200
talk about

00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,880
the possibilities are just simply

00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,080
endless and even in security so

00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,080
regardless of where you go

00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,159
python is one of those languages that

00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,760
will stick with you to the very end

00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,679
and for now i don't know what's next

00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,640
like right now i'm in class i'm hoping

00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:32,880
to build

00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,919
uh more around cloud and maybe you know

00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,760
diversify

00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:37,520
the different focus areas because class

00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,600
is huge many different aspects

00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,039
um so i don't know what's next who knows

00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,760
and i'm very sure that python will

00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:44,559
follow me

00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,440
on that journey it's as relevant as it

00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:49,120
was it's

00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:51,600
still relevant now let's talk about

00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,840
how would you possibly proceed so giving

00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,919
you all of these previous examples and

00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:58,000
also talking a little bit about my story

00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,520
how would you say that you know you

00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,400
would like to

00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,039
um proceed so these are just steps like

00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,679
this is an

00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:06,320
example that anyone making the switch

00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:08,720
could say

00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,520
that these are examples and it's

00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,640
different for

00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:14,080
everybody think of us as a maze

00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,480
and everybody would find their whole

00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,159
path and go to their own journey so it

00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,039
could be different for you so maybe that

00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,120
next step for you

00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:22,799
looks like taking like you need to take

00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,159
an online course maybe it means that you

00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:25,039
have to study for a certification if

00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,559
it's really bad

00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:28,559
maybe it means that you have to save

00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:28,880
money or maybe it means that you have to

00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:30,480
find

00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,720
that you want to find a mentor or a

00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:35,039
coach to help and guide you

00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,640
so attracting a part is different for

00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:38,400
everyone and i really

00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,400
what the point i really want to drive

00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,159
home is that

00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,600
your part is going to be different

00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:45,200
there's no one that's ever going to know

00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,880
you more than you know yourself

00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,320
and so as much as you try to listen to

00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,840
advice um

00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,840
and listen to what's going on in the

00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:54,720
industry from me oh

00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:56,480
um this is the next big thing oh this is

00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,919
the next big thing it's almost like you

00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,159
need to decide for yourself

00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:02,720
look inward and decide for yourself what

00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:06,000
it is that you want right

00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:07,039
um and just because this is packed from

00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,440
africa

00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:10,720
we cannot finish without giving you

00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,039
without

00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,080
giving you proverbs from the ancestors

00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:17,760
table

00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:19,600
amen yes so if i looked at

00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,039
if i looked at like african proverbs

00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,159
this is something that i i thought was

00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:24,240
going to be interesting so

00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:25,279
i was taking i'm going to round up my

00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,520
talk

00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:29,039
focusing on african proverbs to drive

00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:31,440
some of my points home

00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:32,799
so i'm going to use my my try with my

00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,640
nigerian accent

00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:36,720
do you have many roles that leads to the

00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,240
markets who has never had this one

00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,760
before so it's almost like

00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,440
there is a market with a different

00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,320
different roads you know i could be

00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,840
going to

00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,840
you know live in missouri so i keep

00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,840
going to square one where i could take

00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,799
like dondas i could take confederation

00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,159
parkway

00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:52,159
but i can't i don't know they will

00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:53,919
arrive at the markets it's not a race

00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:56,000
why not there's no competition

00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,120
as long as you arrive at the market

00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,799
that's that's what

00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,720
eventually like as long as you are on

00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:01,840
the right path and you're on the journey

00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,840
and you arrive at the market

00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,200
that's what really matters not everyone

00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,960
having to take the same rules so there

00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,240
are many roads

00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,320
that leads to the market so whether you

00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:13,200
decide to be a musician

00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:14,080
or you just you develop a turn artist

00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,840
just so that there are

00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,600
many blues rules at least in the market

00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,679
and market is specific

00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,960
um to you because which whichever part

00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:23,279
you take however

00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,000
long bends or narrow the road is as long

00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:25,919
as you find your

00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,200
way to the market the real story is in

00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:29,520
the journey um

00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,279
and in your learnings along the way

00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,679
right so to their own self

00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:35,360
be true and sometimes it's not always

00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:36,880
like immediately apparent that you might

00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,200
have to go through different rules and

00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,960
take

00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,960
a few wrong turns but at the end of the

00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,960
day it's a lot of growth it's a lot of

00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:46,159
learning knowledge is wasted

00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:49,760
um and that's what i wanted to say

00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:52,240
um the next one is

00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:54,240
if you listen to the voice no let me say

00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,600
that if you listen to the voice of

00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,880
people in the markets

00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:00,640
you won't buy i said again if you listen

00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,840
to the voice of people in the market

00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,880
you won't buy this is talking about the

00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,559
noise right

00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,919
there's this next there's always a next

00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:10,000
big thing there's always the latest

00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:11,919
library of latest tools

00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,520
that you should learn and sometimes you

00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:15,520
can end up being in a loop

00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:17,039
a never-ending loop of learning new

00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:19,120
libraries and youtube

00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:20,159
and never really getting to implement

00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,799
them right or

00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,360
actively use them um so one of the

00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:25,039
things

00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:27,039
and you know that i'd like to add here

00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:31,200
is saying that it's okay

00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:31,760
um you know to decide what you want you

00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,440
know

00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,120
study the market right because you want

00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,640
to know what where you want to go which

00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:39,440
is your market like what

00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,880
what is the um what is the thing that

00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,960
you want

00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:45,120
um no let me put it let me let me put it

00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:47,840
differently like if you decide on your

00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:50,000
destination right it's okay to listen to

00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:52,000
your destination market to decide what

00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,279
is relevant whether this is relevant

00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,840
right like what are the things that are

00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:58,480
required for that field for you to know

00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,760
but at the same time it's also good to

00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,039
not listen to everyone because everybody

00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,080
say come on bye come on back come on

00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:03,440
back if you ever go to

00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,880
you know you have a market for example

00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,240
everybody will try to pull you come on

00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,679
back from me come on back for me come on

00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,360
back but if you know this store you're

00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:11,520
going to where you want to buy just head

00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:13,120
there and avoid the noise of the people

00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,760
in the market if not but everybody's

00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,080
pulling you

00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,760
left tricep eventually like you know

00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:20,480
getting to the market would be

00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:22,480
a much more daunting time right and the

00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:25,600
third one

00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:27,760
by crawling a child learns

00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,520
to stand by doing all of these african

00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,120
programs like an opportunity there

00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,480
but all of these are african programs

00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,159
they know i can't progress we just know

00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,679
that this is our parents and our

00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:37,440
grandparents said we don't really know

00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:37,919
the originator like who the actual

00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,000
author

00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:41,279
is right uh but by crawling a child

00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,760
learns to

00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:44,799
um stand so if we think about this right

00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:49,120
it's okay

00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:52,640
if you um seek out

00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:54,320
uh internships right if you seek out um

00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,760
you know if you have to go and start

00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,279
from scratch like if you're

00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,039
moving careers differently and you have

00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:01,919
to start from the junior role

00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:02,240
it's okay because guess what by crawling

00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:05,360
you

00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:08,240
learn to stand and when you stand you

00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:09,679
run and in running you eventually fly

00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:12,240
and you soar

00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:12,880
like an ego so i just i just felt like

00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,200
that

00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,399
that felt good right you just add that

00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,919
there

00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:19,760
so this is one this one's very popular

00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:22,799
we have we have an adrenaline alcohol

00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:24,480
which is sit down that's the sorry pizza

00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:26,320
is an actor in hollywood

00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,480
he likes to say this a lot he said what

00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:31,279
had old man see sitting down

00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,840
a young man cannot see standing up even

00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:34,720
if he

00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:35,760
climbs to the top of the rocker tree he

00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,640
will not see it

00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,200
he will not see it like so this is just

00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,880
saying

00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:44,240
like um if we think about mentorships

00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,480
and sponsorship like

00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,919
this cannot be over emphasized in every

00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,399
journey it's always very important that

00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:50,080
you

00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:52,320
so you know where you want to go you

00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:54,159
look for somebody who is already there

00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,520
that could probably give you advice on

00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,960
how to get there like

00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,960
who's already at that destination that

00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:02,080
you're aiming to get to and could

00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:03,679
mentor or coach you on how to

00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,279
to get there so this cannot be

00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,480
overemphasized because guess what people

00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,360
who are already in the field that you

00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,840
want to go

00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,720
have this industry knowledge that is it

00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,799
always apparent

00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,960
when you read blogs or you watch your

00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:16,720
videos it's you know they they

00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,480
kind of like know what's going on and

00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,840
they know where the industry is going

00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:23,600
and they're able to advise um

00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:25,520
appropriately and the final one it is

00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:28,559
from a small seed

00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:30,640
that jazz a rocco tree has its beginning

00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:32,159
and this is just to say even if your

00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,360
contribution is open source

00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:35,039
and you know this is how you start

00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,960
yourself your journey and contribute to

00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:39,279
open source maybe it's documentation

00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,320
or you know in any way shape or form or

00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:40,960
you know just contribute to the

00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,840
community

00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:45,919
guess what it is even if it's one

00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,640
semicolon this is from that semicolon

00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:49,760
you go to

00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,240
you know changing and sorry updating and

00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:53,120
adding

00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:55,120
more in terms of like um you know

00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:57,919
contributions right so it's okay to

00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:59,039
have all the beginnings and go um from

00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:00,799
