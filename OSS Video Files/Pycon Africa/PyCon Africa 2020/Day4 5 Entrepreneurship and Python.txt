00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:30,080
session

00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:32,719
um this was an idea that ruben had

00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,160
very very last minute it was super

00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,200
sudden

00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:40,640
and um a good idea

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:43,520
for figuring out how we can get more

00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,960
uh more people to be successful in

00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,399
business with python

00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,000
and you know obviously because this is

00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,719

00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,799
okay my name is money young and

00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,760

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,320
in africa and

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,680
community builder and python ghana and

00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,320
it's actually an honor to share this

00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,600
stage with you all

00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,200
yay awesome so we're gonna

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,799
uh we don't have much time and we'd like

00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,640
to have a lot of time for

00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,799
question and answer for people in the

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,200
comments to ask us questions

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,040
so i'm going to go around and ask the

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,920
panelists that have joined us the very

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,600
cool people

00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:40,400
to uh just introduce yourself briefly

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,079
and you have about three minutes to talk

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,200
about yourself and to talk about

00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,240
how you what you do with python how

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,439
that's related to

00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,720
entrepreneurship or business um so if

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,360
you could share that really quickly so

00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,360
i'm gonna go

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,119
in the order that's on my screen so the

00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,560
first person is trey

00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:01,840
so trey i know you're wrong from the psa

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,960
but you can go ahead and start wow i was

00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,799
thinking introduction

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,240
i could use three seconds why do i need

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,440
three minutes

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,480
i do i teach people python code

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,800
uh in terms of entrepreneurship uh

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,599
first thing i do is i go on site to

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,040
teach teams

00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,560
obviously right now i'm not going on

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,920
site anywhere so doing everything

00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,040
remotely

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:26,400
um i got into that

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:29,360
from doing uh web programming

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,120
on kind of on a for higher basis i saw

00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,080
myself as a freelancer kind of a hand

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,360
for hire

00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,720
eventually realized i should probably

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,879
call myself a consultant because it

00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:40,400
sounds fancier

00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:41,920
and did web programming

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,519
kind of making sure that i was talking

00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,480
to the person who owned the company the

00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,000
higher you are to the

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,920
you know going up to the top of the

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,519
company talking to the ceo the closer

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,720
you are to solving business problems as

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,080
opposed to solving

00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:57,440
who knows what problem um and

00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,640
doing web uh or doing training now in

00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,560
python

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,000
it's a different ballpark i really love

00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,360
the fact that i can go in and teach

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,879
people to do the things that i was

00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,400
previously doing i don't have to do them

00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,000
myself

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,959
i'd much rather teach someone how to do

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,319
the thing i was doing do it myself

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,360
and now i'm trying to make my own kind

00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,200
of online

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,760
business making money from individuals

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,239
as opposed to companies

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,760
which is interesting because i don't

00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,360
want to charge individuals since

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,799
charging companies feels a lot easier

00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,480
for me

00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:31,200
but of course charging individuals you

00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,640
need to somehow make money

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,640
and that's that's something i've been

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,920
kind of trying to figure out how to

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,319
grapple with how you know how do you

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,400
charge individuals in an ethical way

00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,080
and uh i know ruben has ideas on that

00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,040
i've still i discount ideas from you as

00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,920
well

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,440
um but that's kind of my background is

00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,840
originally freelance

00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,959
doing web consulting for people in in

00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,760
python

00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,840
i was really grateful to be able to

00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,720
learn python on the job

00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,239
in my first freelancing job so i do want

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,480
to have a big caveat here

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,519
most of us probably would agree that

00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,720
there's a huge

00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:09,120
huge factor of luck in many parts of our

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,720
careers probably to get to where we are

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,799
figuring out how to make that luck

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,000
actually happen and increase the chance

00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,000
of that luck happening for

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,359
you i feel like is one of the biggest

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,799
factors in

00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:22,400
working for yourself because uh

00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:24,400
you know if you can increase that luck

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,680
factor somehow artificially

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,880
you're really going to be able to help

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,240
yourself because there's a lot of things

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,360
that end up resulting in

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:35,280
you being gainfully employed

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,800
that uh you know are out of your control

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,680
but even if they're in your control

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,440
really shouldn't

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:44,080
matter like who you know and uh

00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,759
you know who they know and whether those

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,320
people happen to have money and they

00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:51,759
happen to also need things that you need

00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,560
so um that's that i guess big caveat

00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,000
there that

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,639
figuring out how to increase those

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,800
artificial things

00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,840
that will result in your success that's

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,840
the thing i would try to do

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,160
very cool thank you trey that's really

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,560
that was really insane insightful and

00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,440
it's great to hear your journey

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,680
um that's a good tip cage from calling

00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:18,720
yourself a freelancer to a consultant

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:22,960
let's just change to that now

00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,960
um reuben you're next on my tweet

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,639
hi everyone so um i

00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,080
have had my own consulting business for

00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,280
about 25 years now

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,759
shocking as that is for me to say uh but

00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,520
you know

00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,600
we've paid the mortgage we went vacation

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:41,120
so so so far so good

00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:43,039
um and i started out like um

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,880
like a lot of freelancers basically

00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:47,280
saying i will do anything

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,199
you have a problem i'll do it oh you're

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,400
using technology x of course i know

00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,880
technology x

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,080
next day buy the book on technology x go

00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,639
in two days from them

00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,759
yes i could use technology x and most of

00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,560
the time it's actually fooled them

00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,240
pretty well

00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,120
um if you're one of my former clients by

00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:06,639
the way i did not fool you at all

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:21,840
in any event um over a year

00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:21,840
i learned in many ways um

00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:37,039
i'm not sure what it is actually it

00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,039
disappeared earlier

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:49,840
coming from um

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,069
[Music]

00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:19,840
in any event over the last over uh

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,120
no i don't have another tab good good

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,960
thought though i'll just like close a

00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,240
ton of other stuff but i don't think so

00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,759
any event i went from doing oh

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,479
lots of programming yay lots of

00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:32,400
programming in lots of ways um

00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,800
to basically about 10 years ago 15 years

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,800
ago deciding you know what maybe i just

00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,800
do training and then you shoot down even

00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,360
more to just doing python training

00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,000
so nowadays i do i would say that most

00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,680
days

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,599
i'm doing corporate training as trey

00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,319
said no longer flying around the world

00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,400
but rather

00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,759
now doing it from home online um and

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,319
i've also been building up a product

00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,680
business

00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,680
over the last few years where i have a

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,800
whole bunch of online video courses

00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:59,440
some email courses and i uh i guess

00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,120
three weeks ago my python book python

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,240
workout is actually a physical book

00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,759
remember those folks

00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,080
yes i know it's like the museum piece

00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:08,400
now um and so

00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,360
i've been having a fun time actually

00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,039
building up my business

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,440
and learning what people want it's like

00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:15,280
find out what people want by asking them

00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,639
provide them with that when you know

00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,080
they buy it and then you can ask them

00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,599
again what would you like to buy next

00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,759
and so that's my strategy for the last

00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:27,199
number of months and continue to go in

00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:29,280
that direction

00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,400
here and that's really exciting and

00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:34,159
really good i know

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:36,320
actually that manning has given our

00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:38,320
uh discounts to everyone at the

00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,959
conference if you want ruben's books so

00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:45,200
feel free to grab that if you would like

00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:45,200
um paul is actually next on my screen

00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:52,880
can you hear me okay all right cool yeah

00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,560
uh i am so excited to be

00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,480
at pycon africa i've been thinking about

00:08:54,560 --> 00:09:02,640
this all week and i decided to

00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:02,640
roll out the t-shirt from the 1994

00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:09,600
first pycon in maryland

00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,040
um is a way to celebrate me finally

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,000
getting a chance to participate with

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,880
people in uh

00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
in africa uh hopefully the first of many

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,040
um

00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,640
i got started a little bit in an earlier

00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,480
age of python

00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,800
i was co-founder of something called

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,760
zope and we went through

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,720
three rounds of financing 14 million

00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,279
bucks

00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,120
instead of big life lessons i'll tell a

00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,760
funny story

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,480
which has almost no entrepreneur value

00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:41,519
at all

00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:44,399
in 1996 we were selling a 25 000

00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,839
application server to the us government

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,320
problem was

00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,120
it fit on a floppy a three and a half

00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,680
inch disk

00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:54,240
and that included python that doesn't

00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:58,000
feel like 25 000

00:09:54,240 --> 00:10:01,440
so we decided to put it on a cd

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,560
because that feels like 25 000

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:08,240
the problem is the cd was 99.9

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:10,880
empty which didn't feel like 25 000

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,760
so the way i remember it which might be

00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,440
true

00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,640
is we put it through z minus nine we did

00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,120
it plus nine

00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,240
to inflate it and we ran it several

00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,000
different times

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:27,120
and eventually it felt like 25 000

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,519
um if i will give one piece of advice

00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,839
it's something from chris mcdonough the

00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,399
creator of pyramid and supervisor who

00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,200
was

00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:37,680
uh an employee of mine at the time when

00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,160
we did the last round of investment

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,720
he said uh because we it was a 12

00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,800
million

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,000
dollar round and he said things will

00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,519
never be the same

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,680
and i remember looking at him and

00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,279
thinking i've got 12 million reasons

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,760
you're wrong

00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:53,519
well he was right if you go down the

00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:57,120
path of venture capital

00:10:53,519 --> 00:11:02,240
as part of entrepreneurship taking on

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:02,240
investment things change be forewarned

00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:10,959
that's great thank you paul

00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:13,680
uh i'm not sure if that's the end of the

00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:15,600
story is that the end of the story

00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,480
there is never an end to any of these

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:21,680
stories okay

00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:24,399
great thank you uh you

00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,360
the first part you have a shirt that is

00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,680
one year old

00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,880
well yeah one year younger than me which

00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:33,440
is i really didn't

00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:36,959
hear that that's okay

00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:40,839
um matt is is nyx

00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:43,839
on my screen paul thank you for your

00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:43,839
story

00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,320
mute myself so paul i'm curious if

00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:52,480
people ever uh

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,480
unzipped or zipped up your application

00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:59,760
um yeah i met her in the navy

00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:03,120
you can imagine i i'm matt harrison

00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:06,160
and i i guess i'm

00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:09,360
pretty similar to trey and reuben

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:11,920
i i

00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,720
group i i guess i paid for school

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,120
through

00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,959
tutoring and so i've always helped

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,160
people and taught people and i've

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:23,600
found it pretty interesting that

00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,160
from my view you can take someone who's

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,120
getting

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:29,360
like a c or a d in math which is

00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:32,720
considered a hard

00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,800
subject for many people and if they're

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,639
given the right opportunities and the

00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:41,839
right practice

00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:41,839
most of them can get an a and um

00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:47,600
and just as i've continued i mean i

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,880
still occasionally do tutoring

00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:54,240
and it's pretty amazing like a lot of

00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,519
people who have access to

00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,839
someone who can walk them through

00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:00,000
something are so much more

00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,279
advantaged and it tends to be people

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,680
with money

00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,880
because they can pay people to do things

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,320
for them and

00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:11,440
and so anyway

00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:14,800
a long story short i i i guess

00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:18,480
back in 2005 or six i started

00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:21,519
teaching uh python courses at

00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:25,279
pycon in other places local conferences

00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:28,560
and did tutorials and

00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:29,680
about seven years ago and then started

00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:33,680
writing books

00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:36,160
and so i mean this is probably

00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,680
my most popular book but i recently did

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,440
one for o'reilly

00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,959
machine learning pocket reference and i

00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,079
have

00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:46,480
um one that i just

00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:47,920
did panda's cookbook and i have another

00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,279
one that i've done with michael kennedy

00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,920
and i've got other books but

00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,880
i just started writing books and um at

00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,279
that point

00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:57,920
seven maybe eight years ago now there's

00:13:55,279 --> 00:14:02,480
just demand for people who wanted

00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,480
help and so i started my company to

00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,240
do consulting and have sort of

00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,720
transitioned

00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:11,760
mostly into training similar to trey and

00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,760
reuben at this point

00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:18,959
and uh yeah it's

00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,480
it's good to have the worst boss and the

00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:22,959
best boss in the world

00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,079
um whether that's me or my wife and i

00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:28,079
guess depends

00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:30,959
on the day but um the

00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:32,639
i i guess you know trey was talking

00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:35,360
about a little bit of luck

00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,560
and and i i've given talks before on

00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,320
like

00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:43,839
how to be a consultant as uh

00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,920
i guess the um introvert

00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:47,120
i mean most people who are working with

00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,199
computers tend to

00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,959
work with computers because they don't

00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,800
want to they'd rather work with

00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:55,440
something that's consistent and

00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:57,600
gives sort of logical responses rather

00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,360
than people who tend to be inconsistent

00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,560
and illogical

00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:07,040
but my experiences is

00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:09,600
that being successful in business

00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,720
requires uh putting yourself out there

00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,600
and i think it's

00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,120
it's more about who you know sort of and

00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,480
to reuben's point about

00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:20,399
what you know i mean i mean oh

00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,680
you can go out and buy a book and and

00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,800
learn

00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,920
most things but um

00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,920
you know if you have the right

00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,720
connections with the right people uh you

00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,759
can

00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,600
uh be quite successful so i guess

00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:35,600
the point is how do you how do you get

00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:39,199
connections and how do you get out there

00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:41,920
and um you know it

00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,720
right now it's sort of a networking in

00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,920
the web

00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,600
thing and my advice would be expose

00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,399
yourself

00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,440
you know talks like conferences like

00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:55,120
this

00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:58,480
blog posts are very useful as well

00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:00,320
um i found that linkedin and twitter

00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,759
are useful as well though your mileage

00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:05,920
may vary there can be

00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:09,360
a lot of toxicity around as well and

00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:10,399
i i come from i guess a privileged white

00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,079
male point of view

00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,000
so i don't deal with a lot of stuff that

00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:17,920
other people deal with

00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:21,199
but um just realize that like

00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,000
even and i don't claim to understand

00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,399
things that other people

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,079
are going through but even when i post

00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,800
stuff in some of these platforms there's

00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:29,680
immediately

00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:31,279
pushback and toxicity and negativity

00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,440
about that there seem to be

00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,720
a lot of people whose goal in life is

00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,279
just to tear others down

00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,839
and blow out other people's candles

00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:40,880
because

00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:41,920
i think that makes them feel better and

00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:45,199
so

00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,680
if if you want i i think right now we're

00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:48,720
in a

00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,440
virtual world the internet's how we

00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,279
leverage

00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,480
one another you just have to be aware

00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:54,800
that um

00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,240
there are going to be dogs out there and

00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:59,040
put on your tough show

00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,600
and uh sort of mute them or or ignore

00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,320
them

00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:05,839
i'm i don't know that's my pro in over

00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,839
three minutes but

00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,799
thank you matt that's really good advice

00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,839
twitter

00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:16,000
is just a dangerous place sometimes

00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:17,280
and yeah i've been really enjoying all

00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,880
of your

00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,559
all of your books like all of your

00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,439
online material the pycharm humble

00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:24,160
bundle

00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:26,079
is fantastic i just i had it i bought it

00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:29,280
a couple weeks ago and that's been

00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:31,440
really helpful um

00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:34,400

00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,760
opposite side of the planet almost

00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,480
exactly and um yeah i'm an entrepreneur

00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,160

00:17:52,480 --> 00:18:00,160
my best mate who is to my right

00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:05,120
whatever way um and we have a

00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,559
sort of unique story so i won't steal

00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,400
all the thunder because he'll finish it

00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,679
off this is like a song and dance sort

00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,440
of gag act

00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:14,080
um and we're pretty new to the whole

00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,280
entrepreneur

00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:20,400
scene we only started off maybe 2016 and

00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,799
it was purely by chance and we're sort

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,000
of

00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,320
the story of we just started putting our

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,799
stuff

00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:31,360
out there so um you know in in general

00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,640
we started posting on our blog but we

00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,919
did that because

00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:37,280
we wanted to just document what we were

00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,400
learning we thought we were best mates

00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,640
were on the other side of the planet

00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,520
bob's in spain i'm here in australia

00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,880
and we thought let's um just learn

00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,360
python together

00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,039
and that was it and we started writing a

00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,640
blog about it we started challenging

00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:52,640
each other with code

00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,760
with actual code challenges on the blog

00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,000
and um

00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,600
it just grew we community formed around

00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,960
it people loved it they started coding

00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,720
with us and now that's

00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,559
spawned our um you know our

00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,600
entrepreneurial sort of

00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:07,919
venture and um we have a code challenge

00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,120
platform we do all sorts of other stuff

00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:09,679
which i'll let bob talk about in a

00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,720
minute

00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:14,720
sorry bob um but yeah it's for us i

00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,799
guess the lesson is just um

00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,880
and i know this is we'll leave it for

00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,679
the q a and stuff but the lesson for us

00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,600
is just

00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,760
get out there just get out there and

00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:27,039
start writing there's no time like now

00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,039
so i'll leave it there

00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,960
doing myself and then forgetting um

00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:37,039
that's amazing julian

00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,240
thank you uh and thank you for joining

00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:40,320
us from australia

00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,919
i know anthony shaw was here yesterday

00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,440
i'm not sure if he's still here but he's

00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:45,600
also from australia

00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,679
so it's nice to have a really broad

00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:51,919
community here which is

00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:56,080
fun um bob is is next on my screen

00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:59,360
yeah yeah can you can you hear me

00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:01,840
okay um yeah very excited to to be here

00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,679
thanks for the invitation um julian

00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,320
already uh

00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:08,240
did quite some introduction on pybytes

00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:11,280
so i will start with

00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,559
i'm a software developer since 10-15

00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,200
years

00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:17,840
have a financial background but became

00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,960
passionate about building websites and

00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:24,000
building tools to automate work and

00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:27,280
partly automate my job and then

00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,080
um long time friend with julian you just

00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,200
heard and

00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:32,720
we always were passionate about this

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,520
entrepreneurial venture we were

00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:38,799
listening to the tim ferriss for our

00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,919
work week the podcast and we came at

00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:42,080
this point where

00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,280
we were also passionate about python and

00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,480
programming and

00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:49,679
that intersected back in 2016 and we

00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,240
we just started with a blog and i think

00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:54,080
that

00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,559
um matt highlighted like just get out

00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,840
there

00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:59,440
and i want to put on top of it like you

00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,520
don't have the answers when you start

00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,280
because we were just a block

00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,120
and then we started doing stuff and

00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,039
sharing and writing document

00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:09,280
our learning as julian said and that

00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:11,760
actually then turned into courses

00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:13,039
a coding platform and more recently

00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,799
coaching so

00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:17,120
you don't have all the answers but the

00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:19,360
only way to get the direction is to put

00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:22,720
yourself out there

00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:24,640
not being afraid of making mistakes

00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,840
iterate quickly learn from those

00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,400
mistakes and

00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:30,400
also build up a community and that's one

00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:33,760
of the things we're most proud of that

00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,960
we involved the community and got a lot

00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,760
of interaction going

00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,360
and as we got feedback we we build out

00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:43,039
the business

00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:44,960
and um yeah there's i was working

00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:46,720
as a software developer up until last

00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,280
month and uh this month

00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,840
i became full-time dedicated to pie

00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,880
bites

00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:55,120
actually so yeah that's

00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,960
uh entrepreneur a dream come true and i

00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:59,919
share not to brag but just like

00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,760
to to show that something you build up

00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:04,080
over time

00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,600
will compound right so i think the

00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,960
content creation in that is also

00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,679
essential that you

00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,240
keep going and you don't the first of

00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,640
your list

00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,760
you will have 10 subscribers and maybe

00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,760
your mom or dad will be

00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,440
five of them right i mean don't let that

00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:20,240
discourage you right i mean

00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:22,080
that's that first email that somebody

00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,559
starts to respond like

00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,640
i really enjoyed this article i really

00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:29,280
got something away from this

00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,480
and that then fuels the fire so don't

00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,840
expect

00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,559
i build it and they will come that will

00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:37,520
not happen right you have to kind of

00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:37,520
believe in it first

00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,120
that's

00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,240
great that moms are supporting people

00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:49,120
everywhere

00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,080
and so cool uh such a cool story

00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,400
actually

00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,520
i didn't know that about pride bites so

00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,640
really really

00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,520
a very cool story um nani i think is

00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,640
gonna ask us

00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:03,280
the next question yeah

00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:05,120
um okay so looking at the current

00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,840
situation we find ourselves in the

00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:10,240
pandemic and all

00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:12,320
um most developers

00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,520
like people who are now coming people in

00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,440
the tech space

00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,440
um would have this question of if for

00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:20,960
example i want to start a business

00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:23,760
with python how do i start and when do i

00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,799
that so it's a general question so

00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,520
anyone can

00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:29,120
um pick it up and start from there i

00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:32,080
have something that's been told to me

00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:33,360
that's kind of very general the best

00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,520
time to start

00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,799
a freelancing consulting business you

00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:40,000
know working for yourself

00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:41,760
is uh years before you started so this

00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,799
is not actually good advice but

00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:46,080
the the trick here is that you probably

00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,720
don't want to quit your day job

00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,840
immediately

00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,679
because you're not going to be

00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,320
successful overnight or whether you

00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,400
could be

00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,520
but it's really really unlikely and i

00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,360
will say that

00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,559
you know of all the risks that i have

00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,880
taken

00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:00,640
they were slow going risks and many of

00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,919
them didn't pan out and it's okay that

00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,679
they didn't pan out because it wasn't

00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,679
the only risk i had at the time

00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:07,600
so you know whatever everyone else might

00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:09,120
say if you're starting something try

00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,400
not to make it the only thing you're

00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,080
putting all your you know your eggs in

00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,520
that one basket

00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,279
unless you think it's going to be a

00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:17,279
really successful basket but you often

00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:20,799
don't know

00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:24,559
yeah okay

00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:26,960
that's i i'll just i should

00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:29,200
one one book that i found useful and

00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,520
it's somewhat u.s centric and that has

00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,320
like

00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:33,679
tax stuff or whatever that's us centric

00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,120
is this weird book that has this weird

00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:38,000
name the coder's path to

00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:39,679
wealth and independence but it's it's

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,799
sort of

00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:43,919
takes on that topic head-on and talks

00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:46,320
about

00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:48,080
uh choosing what to focus on and

00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:51,279
building a company

00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:52,000
and doing things that are uh profitable

00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:55,279
i i

00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,159
echo trey's point about like one thing

00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:59,279
you'll find

00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:02,720
is that everything is like a funnel

00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:04,880
and things that you think might happen

00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,799
there's probabilities that they won't so

00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,159
you need to like have more things that

00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:10,400
you think will happen

00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:13,039
because a lot of them won't happen and

00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:16,000
so like not quitting your day job

00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:17,520
um i mean i think bob's an example of

00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:22,240
that as well right

00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:24,799
until you have things going on uh

00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:27,039
echoing reuben's earlier point like sort

00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:28,880
of niching down he was sort of doing

00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:31,679
everything and then decided hey if i

00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:33,919
focus on one thing

00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:35,760
it's going to be easier for me but it's

00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,600
it's probably more profitable as well

00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:41,120
because you can be known for that

00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:42,240
thing but getting started can be hard

00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,000
right and so

00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,840
i think a lot of us started off as

00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,960
freelancers or doing that sort of thing

00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,640
but a lot

00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,960
i guess julian and bob are the exception

00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:53,919
where they started sort of doing content

00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,880
so i think those freelancing and doing

00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,960
content

00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,960
there's there's no stopping anyone from

00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,600
doing content these days it's all up to

00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,640
you

00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,039
so if someone says how do i get started

00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,679
at

00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:06,960
you know making a blog that's all on you

00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:09,120
um freelancing

00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,799
might be a little bit harder and

00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,679
initially that's getting your foot in

00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:14,799
the door so

00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:17,120
like trey said having friends having

00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:17,440
friends who have money or want something

00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,360
done

00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,679
is a good thing but there are platforms

00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:24,000
as well and

00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:26,720
initially you just need to sort of like

00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,760
i might even do something for free

00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,600
but what i can do at that point is i can

00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,279
put on linkedin then i'm a consultant

00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,480
and so another piece of advice i would

00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:36,080
say is like

00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,360
as soon as you've done something for

00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,960
someone else it's sort of like

00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,880
moonlighting and you're not violating

00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,279
any company agreement or whatever that

00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,480
you

00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:46,880
won't do that i would put on your on

00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,799
either your blog or on linkedin

00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:52,159
especially on linkedin i don't know how

00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:55,840
linkedin is in africa but for

00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:58,480
us people or people

00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:00,320
who where linkedin is a platform just

00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,400
put there that like

00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,799
you have this consulting company if it

00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:07,200
has a name rather than like

00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:08,400
random consultant uh probably a little

00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,559
bit better but

00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,320
at least it's establishing that hey i

00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:14,320
have done this and when people come and

00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:16,720
look at your profile they see that

00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,000
yeah you have your like day job but

00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,399
you're also

00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,760
doing other things on the side and so it

00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:25,200
it establishes

00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:27,360
like this is something that i do and

00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,760
i'm a legitimate person doing this i'm

00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:32,840
not some shady one-off thing i

00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:35,279
i do consulting or moonlighting on the

00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:36,880
side

00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:39,440
two follow-ups real quick on what matt

00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,840
said uh matt to note about ruben niching

00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,679
down

00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,600
uh i i love this that if you told me

00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:45,440
like you're a python django developer

00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,799
i know a few people to refer you to you

00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,520
know quickly

00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:50,880
versus if you tell me do python stuff i

00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,679
wouldn't necessarily think of those

00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,360
people

00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:55,120
so i think that was that's really great

00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,799
advice and i do think a lot of our

00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,320
you know comments probably wreak of

00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:59,039
privilege a little bit especially given

00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,480
that

00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:02,240
if you don't have a day job right now

00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,520
because the pandemic a lot of this

00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,360
probably isn't relevant yet

00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:07,520
so you might want to wait on some of

00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:10,799
this advice

00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,360
okay so i'll jump in even even saying

00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:13,120
that

00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:15,279
sorry julian even saying that i would

00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:17,520
say that a lot of this advice

00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:19,039
is not just advice for people who want

00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,960
to

00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:22,799
do their own thing it's also great

00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,360
advice for someone who wants to get a

00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:26,960
job

00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:29,679
like putting yourself out there and like

00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,720
getting your first like coding job with

00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:33,039
someone else

00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,840
is a way to get a foot in the door great

00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:36,880
point

00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:38,480
yep um so i was going to just say you

00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,840
know we're talking about entrepreneurism

00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,520
here right so

00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:44,720
i think the hardest step for anyone to

00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:46,640
start is where do i start right and and

00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,360
you might have that idea you might have

00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,880
that

00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,799
oh one day i'd love to build this

00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,399
amazing app that does x y and z and

00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:55,360
changes the world right

00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:57,279
um the catch is and i think we've all

00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,960
been there where we start to develop

00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:59,279
things like that and as bob said build

00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,880
it

00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,720
it's not a case of build it and they

00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,679
will come so

00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:07,679
my encouragement to stop to try and

00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:09,360
encourage people not to waste time

00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:11,120
if you're really pushing down this path

00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,880
and you're dedicated to it is

00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,399
you know have the field that you're

00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,559
passionate about that you're interested

00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:18,880
in that you feel you can contribute to

00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:20,159
and just do the research you know it may

00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:23,120
be kind of boring

00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:24,720
it may you know be tough to do it after

00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,600
you work all day or you do whatever it

00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,919
is you're doing

00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:30,080
today and you get home 5 p.m and you're

00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:31,279
exhausted you just want to watch tv

00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,360
you're gonna have to sit there and do

00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:34,960
your market research right

00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,799
but what you want to find out is the

00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,679
pain of the people that you want to

00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:40,000
serve

00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:42,000
in the field that you're interested in

00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,200
so if you're interested in say

00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,039
data science nice buzzword right so if

00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,760
there's so many pieces of it as

00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:51,520
matt matt will know um but if you're

00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:55,039
interested in that space

00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:56,880
right well go and spend time

00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:59,039
with the people who want to learn data

00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,279
science who who spend their time in it

00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:01,200
and

00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:02,880
learn what their pain points are and see

00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,159
if there's something you can build to

00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:07,120
solve that problem

00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:08,080
and then go help the leather and jump

00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,679
straight in there and

00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,200
go i'm going to build that for you and

00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:13,600
start your cycles and

00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,039
as the the gents are saying you know so

00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,720
i'm still in my day job

00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:18,240
you know i'm not ready to jump out of

00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,600
that yet sydney is a very expensive

00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:23,840
place to live so

00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:26,960
um yeah that's my two cents

00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:29,120
right so far i'll make it quick

00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:31,120
in addition to discussing what you can

00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:34,880
do i'm going to steal from

00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:38,720
reuben who really planted this idea

00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,720
what can we do for you

00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:44,559
um we had a conversation about this

00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:46,080
uh as part of the humble bundle

00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:48,799
beforehand

00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:50,000
and probably all of us could do

00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:54,559
something to help

00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:57,120
one of you get a little bit of attention

00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:57,760
and so for example i'm the luckiest guy

00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,519
in the world

00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,039
pycharm actually pays me to be a

00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:03,519
developer advocate i should pay them

00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:07,519
don't tell them i said that

00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:10,320
but if one of you in ghana or elsewhere

00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:12,960
are doing something cool and want to get

00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:15,440
a little bit of reputation

00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,080
drop me a line if you're willing to suck

00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,200
it up and

00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:21,200
and do it in pycharm then

00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,880
we'll do a blog interview with you maybe

00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,320
we'll do a webinar with you we'll do

00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:28,320
some way to talk with you

00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:28,320
to help you get yourself established

00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:37,039
right

00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:40,799
okay i mean you heard

00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:44,000
paul so dm him or something

00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:45,760
uh if you can't i mean i i

00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,600
i'm sure you can dm him on twitter or

00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:51,039
you can uh drop on a line

00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:53,039
uh here in the people tab i will i will

00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:56,640
probably create something inviting

00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:59,039
myself and take that opportunity myself

00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,039
as well

00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:06,080
but so we have we would love to hear

00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:09,120
from the people who are watching um oh

00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:10,559
email is good trey is saying so if

00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:13,519
there's a preferred way that

00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:15,440
any of us can reach out to you um just

00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:17,120
also let us know in the comments what

00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:19,360
would be best for you

00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,960
um so we do want to have some time where

00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:24,240
people can ask questions

00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:25,919
and i i would like to ask everyone if

00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,360
you have a question please put it in the

00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:29,279
comments section

00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:31,279
while people are writing their questions

00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:32,080
so we can start to kind of compile those

00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:34,720
questions

00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:35,600
i would like to give like 30 seconds to

00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,159
a minute

00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:39,120
uh to each panelist to talk a little bit

00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:42,159
about so i

00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:43,440
i was gonna say you know all of you are

00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:46,480
pretty established

00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:48,559
and uh you most of you live in

00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,880
in great countries that are like doing

00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:54,480
state that are stable countries

00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:57,519
um relatively i would say uh

00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,480
but what would you say have you ever

00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:01,600
experienced like

00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,159
imposter syndrome i know for myself i

00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:05,039
feel

00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:05,840
all the time like you know like i feel

00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:08,480
like people

00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:10,320
don't believe me if i'm saying something

00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,760
even if i feel like i know what i'm

00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:15,679
talking about i feel like

00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:17,120
this fear of uh putting myself out there

00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:19,360
and and trying to be

00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,159
uh you know proactive about what i'm

00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:23,279
doing

00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:26,159
and so if you haven't faced

00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:26,799
impostor syndrome uh what would be your

00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:29,120
advice

00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:30,640
to people on how to get over that what

00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:33,519
to do in that situation

00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:35,279
if you're feeling afraid of um maybe

00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:37,919
putting yourself out there and have you

00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:41,279
actually felt that before

00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:43,440
even yourself so yes i see raven's hand

00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:46,559
up yeah

00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:49,440
yes a lot so

00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:49,760
basically i mean i now offer what about

00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,120
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:55,919
15 different courses and the first

00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,480
few times that i teach any of those it's

00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,559
after

00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,720
usually months of research and some

00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:02,159
all-nighters and sweating through it

00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,080
and then i get to a company to teach it

00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:05,360
and i'm sure they are going to see

00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,640
through me they're going to see this is

00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,760
the first time i'm teaching it

00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,879
and it's going to be terrible and

00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,320
they're going to ask me the question i'm

00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:10,720
not going to know the answer and it's

00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:21,839
going to be

00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:21,839
i'm going to cry on and on um

00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:43,309
[Music]

00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:49,839
um

00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:12,560
oh that's awesome um yes there's a bit

00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,520
of feedback

00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:16,480
uh was a bit of feedback in ruben's uh

00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,480
voice but

00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,520
that was a fantastic answer and i'm glad

00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,000
to know that you

00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,960
also have imposter syndrome i don't know

00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,960
if anyone else

00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:30,160
uh i saw matt's hand up actually as well

00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:31,680
yeah i'll just be quick um

00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,960
someone just said recently and it sort

00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,400
of stood out to me they said the

00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:38,320
smartest people i know

00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:41,280
say i don't know a lot and

00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:42,960
um yeah i think it's just natural to

00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:46,720
have imposter syndrome

00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:48,640
and like i said if i guarantee if you

00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:51,680
put stuff out on the internet

00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:54,079
there are going to be haters so you

00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:55,680
i realize that like for some people that

00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:56,320
just impacts their mental health or

00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:59,200
whatnot

00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:00,400
but it kind of is what it is as much as

00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:04,079
much as it's horrible

00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:06,640
so i i mean it sounds kind of trite to

00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:09,839
say suck it up but it might be a case of

00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:10,400
ignoring it and muting those and but you

00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:14,960
know

00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:17,200
realize that yeah um

00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,200
you

00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,119
there's probably always someone who's

00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:23,200
smarter than you there's probably always

00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:25,839
someone who's better than you

00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:26,640
but not comparing yourself and and you

00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:30,560
know

00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:30,560
doing the best you can so

00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:38,560
um who else wants polo i don't know

00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:40,320
either one i have uh not on my own

00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:42,079
i mean i have had imposter syndrome but

00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,760
i want to give advice on imposter center

00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:46,880
in general

00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:48,880
um it's been pointed out to me more than

00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:51,200
a couple times before probably that

00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,320
uh whenever i have imposter syndrome

00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,960
it's usually not

00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:56,240
that bad in the sense that i get it i

00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,839
feel that i'm comparing myself to

00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:01,920
someone else but

00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:03,359
i am also a white cis heterosexual man

00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,599
who lives in california

00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:06,640
like i don't have people telling me very

00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:08,079
often

00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:10,400
you don't know that thing or that's not

00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:12,000
a thing you know like i'm assumed

00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,760
to know things when i walk in a room

00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,440
sometimes that i don't know

00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,920
like i walk in people assume that i know

00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:20,079
things i do not know at a tech meetup

00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:22,000
because i i happen to be friends with an

00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:23,200
organizer or something or i i

00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,320
don't know look like i belong there

00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:29,200
somehow so the imposter syndrome i get

00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:31,520
isn't reinforced as badly as it could be

00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,720
so i do want to note that you know some

00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:36,079
of the advice we may give

00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:37,440
may not apply to your situation and you

00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:39,680
if you need to get over imposter

00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,599
syndrome that is from outside

00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,960
that's that's something i don't know how

00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:45,280
to deal with i know how to deal with the

00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:48,000
imposter syndrome inside which is

00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:49,760
uh just keep pushing through you know

00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,800
trying to to tell yourself that you are

00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:54,000
good enough for this

00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,560
and um you can keep going i do want to

00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,800
note

00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,240
though that if you see someone who seems

00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,240
successful

00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:01,440
they're probably also faking it or they

00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,119
were faking it

00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,560
or they were faking it and they're still

00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:06,160
faking it but they're really good at

00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:08,079
telling themselves they're not faking it

00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,680
because that's how we all work i mean

00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:11,599
you know when i got into training when i

00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:13,520
got into consulting all of this

00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:14,960
i didn't know what i was doing and i

00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,720
still don't really know what i was doing

00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,240
but i found a particular formula that

00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:21,680
seems like it's working

00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,680
and i just keep doing that thing

00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,920
i say always next and then we'll go to

00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,000
bob

00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,960
i will try to make everybody feel better

00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,079
with the

00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:41,200
worst imposter syndrome story of all

00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:44,720
time

00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:48,480
for three years we employed guido

00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:50,640
barry warsaw tim peters jeremy hilton

00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:54,079
and fredrik

00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:57,200
you want to feel like an imposter

00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:58,320
um but when i learned very er actually

00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:01,280
at this thing

00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:03,440
what i learned was my role in the drama

00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:06,079
was not to be smart my role in the drama

00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:09,119
was to bring coffee to the smart people

00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:11,280
um we all have something we can do

00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:12,560
i'm decent at organizing so that's my

00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,880
lane

00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:16,240
and you know who's i almost said shitty

00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,079
but i can't say shitty

00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:19,680
uh you know who's bad at organizing

00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:22,800
programmers so

00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:24,160
i have a lane and i stay in my lane

00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,839
and that's why i don't feel like an

00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:29,839
imposter because i acknowledge my

00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:29,839
inadequacy

00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:35,920
thank you paul for that amazing piece of

00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:39,839
that life

00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:44,000
that i truly relate so that's awesome

00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:46,160
um bob is is next

00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,599
yeah that's really awesome advice we can

00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,160
always bring something to the table

00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:51,280
right

00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:52,800
how however small it is yeah um yeah i

00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:55,599
know i just want to add on

00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:57,760
quickly julian myself realized that

00:39:55,599 --> 00:40:00,960
ambassador cinder never really goes away

00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:02,480
i mean we still face it every day and

00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,480
especially when we take on bigger

00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,960
challenges but

00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,960
we just became to embrace it because

00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:11,200
every time we do something major

00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:13,359
you get this nagging feeling or somebody

00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:15,440
just destroys a tweet or if it can be

00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:18,960
nasty

00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:20,960
don't go and read it um and

00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:23,040
it can hurt you know can hit your

00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:25,440
confidence but

00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:28,079
we kind of try to hack the mindset as

00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:30,240
well by saying

00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:31,119
whatever they say actually if we get

00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,160
critique

00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:34,319
that means we're doing something

00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,920
meaningful because there will

00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:38,079
always be somebody that is going to

00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:40,480
disagree and we kind of

00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:41,200
we enjoy it now i mean that's it still

00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,920
hurts but

00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:46,720
we that means that because if you don't

00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:48,960
polarize it to a certain extent then

00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:51,520
it's kind of meaningless right so you

00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:54,880
want to create a little bit of um

00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:55,599
yeah i think it's a it's a good feedback

00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:58,160
loop

00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:59,520
as well that's that's awesome i'm

00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:02,960
terrified i've read it

00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:06,079
myself so i don't have a rated account

00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:09,440
um so that's good if i spawn

00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:11,200
um julian uh to wrap this up

00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:13,599
yes no i was gonna say do you mind if i

00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:17,200
answer vince's question from the chat

00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:17,200
uh yeah sure yeah

00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:22,079
cool no cool um vince i just want to

00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:24,960
because i did type in there for a second

00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:26,319
um so vince is talking about your how do

00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,520
you balance it all how do you stay

00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:29,200
motivated how you

00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:31,760
how do you get this done when you have

00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:33,599
all of these other responsibilities and

00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:35,280
this hits home for me is a very big one

00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:37,359
for me because

00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:39,200
i've got health issues in my family i

00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:41,200
work full time job nine to five

00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:43,520
i have a one and a half hour commute

00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:46,640
every day two kids under seven

00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:50,079
and a third child on the way um

00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:51,119
you know so it's insane but it's not

00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:53,599
impossible

00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:54,160
right and it the catch is it's about

00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:57,040
what

00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:58,400
drives you you have to think of that

00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,280
goal you have to think about what you

00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,280
want and then

00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:03,920
it doesn't come down to time management

00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:06,000
it comes down to priority management

00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:07,440
so believe me my house is not the

00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,240
cleanest place on the planet with

00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:12,400
regards to the kids clutter everywhere

00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:13,440
but that's because you know i choose on

00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,359
a week night to

00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,640
sit there after they go to bed at seven

00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:18,880
o'clock

00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:20,640
to call bob and start working on content

00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:22,960
start working on

00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,839
fulfillment working with our community

00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:26,319
and

00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:27,440
and all of that stuff but the only thing

00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:30,720
that keeps me going

00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:32,720
is that goal it does help having bob my

00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:35,119
best friend as an accountability partner

00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:37,839
as well so there's a tip for you as well

00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:40,319
so we hold each other accountable

00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:40,880
but also i give myself that dedicated

00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:43,440
break

00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:44,400
of my weekend is sacred there is no work

00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:47,119
on the weekend

00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,000
but that means monday to friday it's get

00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:50,720
it done

00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,599
saturday and sunday it's kids family

00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:55,839
netflix

00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:58,079
video games you name it um go nuts but

00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:58,960
when you come up with that sort of a

00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:02,160
disciplined

00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:03,680
almost routine i want to say then that's

00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,960
what you can do to try and get yourself

00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:08,480
through it but remember

00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:10,960
mix the crazy crazy work with

00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,560
the fun and you'll find a balance and

00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:14,079
jurgen with regards to getting the kids

00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:16,480
to bed at 7 pm

00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:18,160
um pretty sure it's not legal in most

00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:19,760
countries i'm kidding

00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:21,280
i just read them a story they fall

00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:23,760
asleep done and dusted

00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,760
there you go

00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:29,280
manny do you want to go ahead thank you

00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:33,200
for that good night

00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:35,599
amazing you can go ahead yeah yeah so he

00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:37,520
he took the first question um the second

00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:38,800
question i can pick here from michael

00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:41,359
he's saying um

00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:42,400
how can you if it um efficiently drive

00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:45,359
innovation

00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:47,280
and new product cycles especially in an

00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:48,640
economic market that is now freezing

00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:51,119
into technology

00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:55,839
he's trying to emphasize it is mostly

00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:55,839
the case in some african countries

00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:01,760
yeah so it's an old big question anyone

00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:05,280
can go for it

00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:06,839
i feel like uh i'm not qualified to

00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:09,200
answer this question solving this to

00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:10,480
others

00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,920
can you just restate the question i'm

00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:14,319
sorry i think i got it by just one

00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,319
double check

00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,280
yeah um how can you efficiently drive

00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:22,319
innovation

00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:23,760
and new product cycles especially in an

00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:26,800
economy market

00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:27,200
that is now phasing into technology yeah

00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,520
i

00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:30,319
i mean i i don't live in africa i live

00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:34,160
in the us

00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:36,240
i do have a friend who tries to put

00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:37,280
who's african of african descent who's

00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,640
my neighbor and

00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:40,319
has repeated like when i've been

00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:42,079
involved with stars he's like okay how

00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:43,200
can i take this and adopt this for the

00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:45,599
african market

00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:46,319
we're five years or however many behind

00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:48,960
you

00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:51,200
and i mean this has been done in germany

00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:52,640
as well there's a company that basically

00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:54,800
takes every big

00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:55,839
technology in the u.s or whatever and

00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,160
just

00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:59,520
basically copies it and makes a german

00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:03,280
version of it

00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:06,319
um i want to try and

00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:08,319
make some something you know innovative

00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:11,839
necessarily i would try and say

00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:15,280
hey what what what is out there and

00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:18,720
can i adapt something to

00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:21,920
to bring it to an african you know

00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:25,200
maybe slightly to to the local audience

00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:27,119
having said that you know i think i and

00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:29,280
most everyone here is sort of more in

00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:33,040
the small

00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:34,400
sort of sort of solopreneur

00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:37,520
market i mean paul's sort of an

00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:39,280
exception and so

00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:41,119
i mean a lot of you know if you're

00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,440
looking for big technology that might be

00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:44,880
like

00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:48,079
vc sort of funding things versus

00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:51,359
um you know making a

00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:53,440
product or an offering that's small but

00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:55,280
you can support it with yourself

00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:57,040
initially and then you know once it gets

00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:59,839
profitable uh

00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:00,400
bootstrapping it pump it out to others

00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:03,760
to

00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:03,760
sort of help you grow that

00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:10,000
very good um uh maybe

00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:15,839
look at the end of the day technology is

00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:18,560
a way

00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:19,359
to solve problems and wherever they're

00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:21,839
going to be people

00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:23,760
they're going to be problems and so

00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:24,800
having a business that uses technology

00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:26,160
to solve them is just a matter of

00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:29,280
connecting the dots

00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:30,640
so wherever you live even if it's not

00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:32,319
super technological

00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:34,000
and even if people don't know

00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:35,520
necessarily about python they are having

00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,400
problems and you can almost certainly

00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:39,119
help them

00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,920
um how you help them is well that's

00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:41,359
where your

00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,640
knowledge your local knowledge your

00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:44,000
understanding your ability to speak the

00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:45,040
language and i don't mean like speak

00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,720
that human language

00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:48,800
like be on their same wavelength and

00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:50,800
connect with them and ask them questions

00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:53,040
that's where you have an advantage over

00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:54,560
all these huge companies and even those

00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:57,680
of us in other places

00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:59,280
so use your advantage to improve

00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:00,880
people's lives and build a business out

00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:02,880
of it and you'll probably find

00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:04,720
that there's a slice of problems that

00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,480
you can solve that no one has any

00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:08,079
understanding of and those people when

00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:09,040
they realize it will refer more and more

00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:11,839
people to you

00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:13,119
and that's how you have success

00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:16,640
definitely

00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:18,160
thank you and um paul uh can i answer

00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:22,839
with a story

00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:24,559
yeah sure unlike my other stories it's

00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:28,160
true

00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:32,640
so it's november 1998 picon

00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:35,359
is in texas and we have a commercial

00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:38,079
application server called zoe

00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:40,079
it's not really selling that well um

00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:42,720
written totally in python

00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:44,160
and our competitors are billion dollar

00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:46,079
companies netscape at the time was

00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:47,680
selling an application server microsoft

00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:49,280
etc

00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:51,440
eric raymond is there to give the

00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:53,680
keynote and there's a washington post

00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:55,920
journalist following him around for a

00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:56,319
week to write a story on this new thing

00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:59,280
called

00:47:56,319 --> 00:48:00,640
open source so i called back to virginia

00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:03,119
i talked to the vc

00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:04,400
and the other founders i was like dude

00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:06,079
if we're going to do it

00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:08,559
if we're going to open source this damn

00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:09,520
thing we're doing it now

00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:11,200
because we're going to make an

00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:13,440
announcement and it's going to be in the

00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:16,880
washington post

00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:18,400
so the so we did and it get and it got

00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:20,160
in the washington post

00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:22,000
and as soon as the words came out of my

00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:24,640
mouth i knew that was the thing that the

00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:27,440
reporter was going to print

00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:28,160
and the lesson in that story is you can

00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,720
row

00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:32,240
across the atlantic ocean but that's

00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:33,839
pretty hard

00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:35,920
there's this thing called the wind and

00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:37,119
if you just put up a sail the wind will

00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:40,240
do all the work

00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:41,839
and take you across the ocean so find

00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:43,760
something that you can ride the

00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:46,800
coattails of

00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:48,800
that is still unique enough that you can

00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:50,319
add value to it and let it do all the

00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:52,480
work

00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:53,920
oh that's that's really good advice i

00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,480
think that's also something i was

00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:56,720
thinking

00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:57,760
about in terms of you know how do you

00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:01,040
get started

00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:02,000
in marketing and getting yourself first

00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:06,079
going and that's

00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:08,160
great advice great people um trey

00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:09,119
yeah i i do think great advice as well

00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:10,720
that you know you don't want to be

00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:12,160
fighting against the flow if you can go

00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:14,800
with the times but

00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:16,079
um i i realized you know earlier i was

00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:17,839
kind of joking when i said i don't feel

00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:19,599
qualified to answer this i don't feel

00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:22,160
qualified to answer it but

00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:23,200
i do feel like the best advice i can

00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:26,240
give is

00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:28,559
if you can think of other people

00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:30,240
online or elsewhere who have been there

00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:32,800
before and not necessarily they're in

00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:34,960
the same situation but for example

00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:37,119
i can think of a few friends who are in

00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:38,000
u.s towns that are not known for their

00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:40,559
technology

00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:42,000
who are starting tech hubs and so it's a

00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:43,839
new thing they're bringing in

00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,040
but it is with the times it's it's a

00:49:43,839 --> 00:49:46,720
trend that's kind of

00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:48,079
you know coming in and so if you can

00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,640
find other people who've been in a

00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:51,680
similar

00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:53,760
kind of situation in terms of you know

00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:56,880
going with the times going with the flow

00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:58,640
and contact them learn from them

00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:00,240
that's the biggest advice i can give

00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:01,520
because i feel like all of us pretty

00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:03,440
much are where we are

00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:05,760
because of reaching out to someone or

00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:08,240
having someone introduced to us

00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:08,800
or some sort of networking event which

00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,240
is

00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:12,880
really just making friends as i said in

00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:15,599
the chat earlier

00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:17,040
yeah that's great i think uh networking

00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:17,760
has really stood out as well as

00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:20,960
something

00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:22,960
pretty consistent for us to do um

00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:25,359
so thank you i don't know maybe maddie

00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:26,000
let's take one or two questions or a

00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:30,880
little over

00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:30,880
but anyone or two more questions

00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:34,640
here um

00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:40,319
okay i'll i'll i'll take the question

00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:42,319
i'm saying now it says um

00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:43,920
what do you think is the best method for

00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:46,240
integrating with

00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:47,119
other business communities that may not

00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:50,480
directly be

00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:51,599
in the tech space do them as your

00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:53,119
clients if you can

00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:54,559
i feel like that's the your clients and

00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:56,480
your peers because if you show up to

00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:58,319
where your potential clients are

00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:59,680
and you can speak their language be

00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:01,920
friends with them

00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:03,040
you know they see you as a peer you show

00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:06,480
up and you're

00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:08,559
like i met a lawyer at a tech meetup uh

00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:10,160
she was there to meet tech people who

00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:11,760
might want legal services

00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:13,119
she didn't say that but she just kept

00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:16,079
showing up to the tech meetup making

00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:16,079
friends with tech people

00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:23,839
that's a good idea great everything

00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:23,839
yeah and okay oh sorry

00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:28,880
so i would say yeah exactly that there's

00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:31,280
so

00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:32,079
many developers who say i don't

00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:34,240
understand

00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:36,079
i go on all the technical forums and i

00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:38,319
tell them that i'm a developer

00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:39,520
and they're not hiring me right those

00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:41,520
are your peers

00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:42,960
those are not your clients or your

00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:45,280
potential clients

00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:47,839
right and in fact i would say from my

00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:49,520
experience maybe the others would agree

00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:51,359
technical companies are the worst

00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:52,800
clients it's the non-technical companies

00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:54,000
who are in all of what you're doing

00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,119
aren't going to nitpick on what you're

00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,040
saying and doing

00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:58,319
and they'll be like whoa you did such

00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:00,400
great stuff come back

00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:02,559
so find those non-technical clients

00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:03,680
solve their problems they will love you

00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:07,040
and they'll thank you their super

00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:07,040
technical wizard and keep paying you

00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:15,200
great advice so let's look for non-tick

00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:16,400
places as well to hang out a little

00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:20,160
scary but

00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:22,160
reasonable i guess um i don't know

00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:24,240
uh manny do we want to take one more

00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:26,720
question and then we're gonna

00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:28,160
yeah i think the last question i can see

00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:30,240
is um

00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:32,000
what helps you to be consistent

00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:33,599
especially when you have been running

00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,119
your business for a while

00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:38,720
and it is not growing in the way you

00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:38,720
expect it or you expect

00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,760
can i go with that one okay yeah julian

00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:47,119
i got in quick

00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:50,880
um so that one is 110

00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:52,240
a mindset issue um you sometimes have to

00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:55,280
find that balance

00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:57,680
before uh between um

00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:58,800
do you just give up and try something

00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:02,240
new or do you

00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:04,640
keep hammering away at it so my

00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:06,640
recommendation there is one don't just

00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:08,559
give up straight away because we all hit

00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:09,359
those hurdles we all have to climb that

00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:11,520
mountain

00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:13,040
um we'll all have rough days sometimes

00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:14,720
rough weeks or a rough month where it

00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:16,400
would just be like what have i done

00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:19,040
what am i doing with my life you know

00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:21,520
and at the end of the day

00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:24,000
talk to people my favorite thing to do

00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:25,359
is to just talk to people i've spoken to

00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,440
every one of these people that's on this

00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:29,040
panel right now and had

00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:30,559
different levels of conversations with

00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:31,119
them about stuff that's been on my mind

00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:33,599
before

00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:34,880
and um you know this is one of my

00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:36,400
favorite things is when you talk to

00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:37,760
people you get stuff off your chest

00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,960
and it doesn't even have to be someone

00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,760
in the industry could be one of your

00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:41,440
best mates

00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:43,200
stranger down the street at the bus stop

00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:44,880
doesn't matter um

00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:46,960
you know get it off your chest and just

00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:49,040
keep working away just keep trying and

00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:50,880
every little chip away that is going to

00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:52,960
get you closer to your goal

00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:57,359
but it's it's all up here right you just

00:53:52,960 --> 00:54:01,760
got to keep pushing

00:53:57,359 --> 00:54:06,000
well uh can i tell a funny story

00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:07,760
yeah yeah um so it's 1996

00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,359
and we have a few employees my

00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:12,800
co-founder and i rob page

00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:14,400
and you know commitment

00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:16,400
when you don't have enough money for

00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:18,160
payroll

00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:20,160
that's when things get real and we

00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:21,839
didn't have enough money for payroll

00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:23,280
and we said we're going to go into the

00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:25,040
office on sunday

00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:27,599
and we're going to put xyz in the

00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:29,119
spreadsheet and if it comes out pdq

00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:30,960
we're going to announce the next day

00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:33,119
that we're closing the company

00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:34,160
because it's just not fair so we put in

00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:37,520
xyz

00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:38,000
it came out pdq and we're like damn

00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:40,880
we're going to

00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,920
close the company i called my wife i

00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:43,280
said we're going to have to close the

00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:47,920
company and she said you

00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:50,160
will i can't believe you after all that

00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:52,000
and sure and we didn't close the company

00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:55,359
and sure enough five days later

00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:57,599
the check from the navy came in

00:54:55,359 --> 00:54:57,599
wow

00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:03,280
yeah that's right real quick um i

00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:06,480
wouldn't see it

00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:08,240
as closing shop necessarily as pivoting

00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:09,280
which is a fancy business word for not

00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:11,200
doing the thing you thought you were

00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:14,240
going to do previously

00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:15,440
because i've pivoted many times in the

00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:17,440
sense of

00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:19,119
i was doing one thing i wasn't getting

00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:19,760
work well maybe i'll go look at this

00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:21,839
other thing

00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:23,359
instead you know kind of eyeing into

00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:23,839
this other thing that's how i got into

00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:25,599
training

00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:27,280
was pivoting into training that's how i

00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:28,400
started making python marshals online

00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:30,240
pivoting into that

00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:32,400
that's how i keep changing what exactly

00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:34,000
i'm doing with this online thing is

00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:36,400
realizing my customers want something

00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:39,200
different than i'm giving them

00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:40,079
sometimes so even and pivoting may mean

00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:42,240
pivoting into

00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:43,920
getting a job not working for yourself

00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:45,280
anymore you're pivoting in your career

00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:47,040
and that's that's okay

00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:48,160
you're going with whatever the flow

00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:51,359
tends to be taking you wherever that

00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:51,359
opportunity is at the moment

00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:56,960
yeah okay yep okay i just said that one

00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:59,200
of the advantages

00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:00,640
of being a small operation in my case a

00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:04,240
one-person operation

00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:05,680
is that i can make those changes i don't

00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:07,359
have to have big meetings

00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:08,880
and organizational discussions we're

00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:09,280
going to have to hire we're going to lay

00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:11,200
off

00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:12,799
right it means the illness is on me so

00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:16,799
like i i have the good parts

00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:18,480
the bad parts um and so barely a year

00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:20,000
has gone by a few years have gone by and

00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:23,200
having my business but i haven't said

00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:24,720
hmm the landscape is changing and uh now

00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,760
of course the landscape around the world

00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:28,640
is changing

00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:29,599
and organizations are panicked what are
