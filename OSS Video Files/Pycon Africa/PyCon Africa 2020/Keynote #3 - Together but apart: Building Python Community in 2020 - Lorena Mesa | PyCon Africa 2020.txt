opening up a year uh i started kind of

00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,920
looking at this year and taking some

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,040
time to think a little bit about

00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,320
reflection

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,799
so what i'm going to be talking a little

00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,799
bit about today is going to be

00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,560
looking at building python community in

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,680
the here and now particularly

00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,280
in the year 2020. so the title of this

00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:04,079
talk is together but apart

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,079
building python community in 2020.

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,080
so last weekend the speakers of picon

00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,239
africa

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,280
were invited to participate in a virtual

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,520
social

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,480
speakers from north america south

00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,400
america

00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,000
africa and more were present in this

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,720
call all of us

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,520
were there together sharing our joy of

00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,200
this uh

00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,560
lovely programming language which you

00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,400
may know the name of

00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,640
uh this little programming language that

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,920
we call a python

00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,599
yes i do have a python plush so you know

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,160
it wasn't strange to see

00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:38,000
everyone in the virtual hangout so much

00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,599
as it was strange to think about how it

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,360
was that we were all sharing this moment

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:44,080
in 2020

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,200
2020 the year social distancing where

00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,760
the social norm

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,800
means isolating ourselves and practice

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,160
and practicing

00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,239
six feet of distancing measures 2020

00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:58,000
where i'm pretty sure today is now

00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,440
march day 161. uh i double checked that

00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,879
because there's this great website

00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,000
called

00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:03,760
eternalmarch.com and it tells you what

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,239
day of march it is

00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,720
2020 where the sense of time is just so

00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,560
warped

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,319
the thing however that didn't feel

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,760
strange during our speaker chat

00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,920
was some of the discussions we were

00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,760
having and one of the things that we

00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,560
were talking about on that call

00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,840
was food and let's be real i think

00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,959
that's something that all of us can

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,799
connect to

00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,200
i'm a really really really big food

00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,200
person

00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,879
you know talking about peppered snails

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,159
fufu

00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:37,760
jola casaba smoked fish you know

00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:40,080
some of these dishes were discussed in

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,680
our virtual hangout and

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,200
as food is something that's universal

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,480
and something beloved by all

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,159
it that was actually something in our

00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,920
conversation that made me feel like okay

00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,840
yes 2020 is a bit weird

00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,440
but you know it's still the same we may

00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,000
be we may be a part but we're still

00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,959
together

00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,080
just in a different way actually i

00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,000
couldn't help but

00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,120
find myself laughing when the topic did

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,760
turn to fell off

00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,080
since it was actually at pycon africa

00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:08,319
2019 that i was schooled in this

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:10,560
infamous nigeria vs ghana jola feud

00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,439
i kept getting asked to decide which of

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,400
the two

00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:16,079
i found better however as a smart food

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,759
lover and as someone who has been

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,239
thought well by my abuela to never

00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,560
offend

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,320
anyone's cooking i basically said you

00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,919
know i'm neutral i need to continue to

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,320
eat more to figure it out

00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,199
also it's a really great way to get more

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,240
food if you

00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,240
if you're always a little bit in the

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,280
neutral space so why not

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,720
why say no when you can enjoy them all

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,880
there was you know actually there's a

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,120
lot of commonalities in west african

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:43,040
food in some of the food that i found

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:45,040
that i've enjoyed growing up

00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,759
see in the caribbean and the nations

00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:50,479
with populations of west african origin

00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,960
such as cuba the dominican republic

00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,680
haiti

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,520
and puerto rico plantains or yams are

00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,040
often mashed and then other ingredients

00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,040
are added to a dish

00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,400
in the dominican republic the dish is

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,320
known as mangu

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,720
whereas in puerto rico and in cuba this

00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:07,280
dish is often known as mofongo

00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,039
the difference between west african fufu

00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,120
and caribbean fufu

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,320
is noted both in the texture and the

00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,440
flavorings

00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:18,960
caribbean fufu and mofongo

00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:21,759
being less of a dough-like and more of a

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,680
food that has a firm consistency another

00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,199
difference that can be seen in mofongo

00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,680
unlike

00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,280
caribbean uh fufu and west african fufu

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,400
is that puerto rican moffongo

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,960
is fried then mashed with broth and

00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,720
olive oil

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,240
now you're probably wondering why i'm

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,120
talking about food and why i'm

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,440
spending so much time talking about such

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,560
things

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,000
such things as mofongo or fufu and this

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,800
actually kind of comes back to a bit

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,960
about who i

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,360
am and where i'm from see i'm a

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,280
pythonista that hails from a stellar

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,360
city known as chicago

00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,960
home of the first skyscraper the home

00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:01,360
insurance building built

00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:03,280
in 1884 the first ferris wheel

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,720
and the craters of the deep dish which

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,880
i'm sorry to tell you

00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,479
any true chicagoan will inform you that

00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,039
no we do not eat deep dish

00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,800
i think that's just like a tourist thing

00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,680
but the thing about chicago that i love

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,400
so much and

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,600
specifically when i talk about chicago i

00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,800
grew up in this neighborhood called

00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,319
humble park

00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,720
and actually these are some photos i

00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:25,840
took just of running

00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,520
two days ago from humble park where

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,759
as you can see in the image on the left

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,720
hand side this is a neighborhood that is

00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,240
infamous for the puerto rican flags

00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,319
marking division

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,919
which is also locally known as paseo

00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,639
boricua

00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,600
have you um have you ever uh you know if

00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,960
you're ever looking for

00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:47,120
finding food such as mofongo or other

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,639
great cuban puerto rican delicacies

00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,160
humble park's going to be a place you're

00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,560
going to want to go

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,240
as a child of cuban and mexican parents

00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,039
the flavors of spice

00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,680
plantain maniac these are all flavors

00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,360
that i know

00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,680
that are punched into the dishes that i

00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,479
love these are things that actually are

00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,599
cornerstone

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,560
of my of my taste palette you know

00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,520
another thing that i thought that was

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,520
super interesting

00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,039
in hearing the discussion about food and

00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:14,080
it did actually come up again

00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,720
in the speaker hangout last weekend was

00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,080
to hear

00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:20,960
the takes that africans have uh amongst

00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,160
other african cuisines particularly

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,680
hearing how some

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,080
folks that aren't from west africa

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,440
saying that you know west african food

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,639
is just too spicy

00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,800
see for me i very much enjoy the spicy

00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,639
element in west african food i think it

00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,160
is quite excellent

00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,360
i tend to cook you know with a few

00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:42,000
jalapenos habaneros and all the chiles

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,400
uh i do love those chili peppers very

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,479
much

00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,840
for me i love spice both in terms of

00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,479
heat index

00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:51,039
and just the actual spice variant itself

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:54,479
so these commonalities and foods

00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:57,039
are not lost at me so hi

00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,720
my name is lorena mesa so before i

00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,800
digress too much into food let me tell

00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,800
you a little bit about myself

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,560
i do a few things in technology

00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,680
including helping organize pi lady

00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,479
chicago

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,840
i am the python software foundation

00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:12,720
chairperson and a

00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,680
director i also work at github and i'm a

00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,639
huge

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,800
proponent of responsible technology you

00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:22,319
can find me on most places in the web

00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:26,400
as nicole and yes that is

00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:27,599
l four o's to begin and then the fifo in

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,599
the nickel

00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:34,080
i i'm always very happy to chat

00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:36,159
and as perhaps what i may describe

00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,000
myself as a python mega fan

00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,000
i have been fortunate enough to be able

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,640
to travel to participate in many of the

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,640
global

00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,919
in many of the global python events

00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,040
around the world including

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:48,399
picon africa 2019

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,399
actually when i was speaking with

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:53,279
marlene last year

00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,480
about a trip i had planned going to

00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,640
nigeria

00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,640
for a friend's birthday it was marlene

00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,080
who pointed out that it's only an hour

00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,320
flight from lagos to

00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,959
accra and that i really ought to make

00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,519
the effort to attend the inaugural pycon

00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,720
africa

00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:12,560
2019 and i'm so thankful that

00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,279
i did one of the largest themes that i

00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,880
took away

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:17,839
from pycon africa 2019 focused on the

00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,560
interconnected

00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,800
the interconnectivity of us all how our

00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,640
community is a broader representation of

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,440
the subset of relationships

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:29,279
that we as people have with one another

00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,720
in 2019

00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:34,000
kino uh kojo who's here in the chat

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,800
today

00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,640
really i found that message talking

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,720
about his lived experience as a black

00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,360
man from the united states returning to

00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,680
africa during the year of return

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,440
a symbolic 400 year anniversary talking

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,399
about diaspora and the movement of

00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,399
peoples

00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,600
to be very very compelling and something

00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,519
that helps set the stage

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:57,040
in thinking about what was going to be

00:09:53,519 --> 00:10:00,399
the cornerstone of pycon africa

00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:03,200
additionally another speaker felipe

00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:05,440
a pythonista from brazil continued this

00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,440
dialogue around homecoming this dialogue

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,480
about identity this dialogue about

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,640
diaspora

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,120
highlighting the role of african

00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:16,079
identity in building community in brazil

00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,760
specifically for afro-brazilians in his

00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:20,440
work with afro-python

00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:23,440
a python community specifically for

00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,440
afropythonistas

00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,959
the theme of homecoming and connectivity

00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,000
all of this has invited i think within

00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:33,279
me

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
a lot of reflection the lessons from

00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:37,279
pycon

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,360
africa 2019 stay strong and top of mind

00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:42,000
for me particularly as we navigate the

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,680
world that we live in

00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,399
as many of you are aware another

00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:48,800
worldwide movement has taken hold

00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,399
throughout 2020 no longer is it that

00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,560
we're just living in a pandemic

00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,160
but we're also living through the the

00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,959
reawakening of what it means

00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,480
to talk about equity in the here and now

00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:01,120
of those issues

00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:03,040
around equity racial equity is at the

00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,839
forefront of that movement

00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,519
it's really impossible for us to ignore

00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,480
in fact this is actually a mural that

00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,920
was taken

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,640
in my neighborhood just around the

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:16,399
corner uh prominently saying

00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,839
all in this together this dialogue this

00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,279
narrative of what it means to be

00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,680
separated but together

00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,399
of having these worldwide movements of

00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,440
really

00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:27,279
trying to reflect and apply learnings to

00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,800
help us navigate the current moment and

00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:31,200
build a better future

00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,640
these are all things that are very top

00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,839
of mind for me and actually i

00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:37,440
felt very much where the cornerstone of

00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:41,120
some of the things that i saw present

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:43,440
at pycon africa 2019.

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,240
so alongside my alongside this this

00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,880
worldwide

00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,760
dialogue and moment i can't help but

00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,519
also just

00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,440
point out that even within the space of

00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,040
chicago where i talk about

00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,360
you know how we talk about food and the

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,360
connectivity of people through food

00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,360
you know within chicago we're having our

00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,440
own hyper local discussion of what it

00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:05,760
means to build community

00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:09,600
chicago if you ever were to look up the

00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:11,760
the landscape of a chica of chicago and

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,000
how chicago has evolved over time

00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,920
it is very difficult not to notice the

00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,800
pronounced

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,639
segregation within the city in fact

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:24,000
chicago over the last 40 years

00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:25,519
has had a few trends that are not unique

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,519
to just chicago but is definitely

00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:30,399
something that i think we see

00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:32,000
in in many urban spaces and actually in

00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:35,040
many spaces around the world

00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,480
the wealthier getting wealthier the

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:40,000
erasure of middle class hypertension

00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,720
kind of between those that have and

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,120
those that do not have

00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,079
again the idea of what it means to live

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,880
in chicago is

00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,680
is it is a city of t of more than one

00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,560
tail

00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:54,320
in fact it's a city of of very

00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,360
fundamentally

00:12:54,320 --> 00:13:00,480
divergent ide of divergent

00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,360
tales looking at this map on the of the

00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,000
chicago

00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,279
landscape what you can see is that there

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
is quite a pronounced

00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:09,120
racial breakdown of chicago with the

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,680
northwest

00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,560
sides having more of the white

00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,320
population

00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,560
the south side having more of the black

00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,839
population and then the

00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:21,519
um what i identify as latinx or

00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:23,760
is commonly referred to as hispanic

00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:27,519
being in other pockets along the

00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,519
southwest and northwest sides

00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,560
see my work as a technologist began not

00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,040
as someone in computer science but

00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,800
actually as someone who's very very

00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,320
intrigued and interested in what it

00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,720
means to build community and how we

00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,639
build community better together

00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,000
my roots actually come back from

00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:48,160
starting my

00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:51,279
work as someone in political science a

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,399
a not yet very widely known uh

00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:55,600
individual

00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:57,920
then senator barack obama had kicked off

00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:01,519
a campaign which i actually ended up

00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:03,519
working on the message of that came

00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,839
campaign change we can believe in was

00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,880
something that is highly empowering and

00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:08,959
something that i think

00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:12,160
really speaks to the court values and

00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,160
identities that i have

00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:18,800
so in in the work from working on

00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,639
thinking about how we can use political

00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,360
spaces to build to build better

00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,959
community

00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,680
it's then actually working in the

00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:27,199
hyperlocal space of chicago

00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,199
one of the other areas that i found

00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:33,360
myself working was actually looking

00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:36,399
at uh policing technologies in chicago

00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,880
chicago given that we understand it has

00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,000
this

00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,839
this duality this idea that the

00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
experience of one person

00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,360
is can be fundamentally different than

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,480
another person

00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,399
and that can have a very real reflection

00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,560
on the identity of who that person is

00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,079
based on where they live

00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,079
this can also be seen in policing

00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:57,680
patterns in chicago

00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:00,160
in fact this whole idea of like how do

00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:02,560
police and what does policing look like

00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:04,720
one of the strategies that has often

00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,639
been dialogued about in chicago has been

00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,199
the idea of predictive policing

00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,320
that is you know using technology and

00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:13,519
strategies

00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:17,040
informed by technology to quote unquote

00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:19,600
be smarter and do things better

00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:21,600
of some policing some predictive

00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,560
policing strategy suggested

00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,920
some of them indicated trying to come up

00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,480
with strategies where you can

00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,920
identify potential offenders before they

00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,480
actually offend

00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,839
what exactly that means i don't know but

00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,199
the presumption is

00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:39,360
that the details and

00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,320
the details in the data can help us come

00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,920
up with these

00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,759
ideas of how we can do predictive

00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:46,000
analytics however

00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,360
as we've seen in this moment and as we

00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,120
talk about these things

00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,800
there's a lot of bias in that work and

00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,639
what that what that actually means can

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,639
be very much informed by

00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,079
variances in one socioeconomic

00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:59,120
background variances

00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:01,040
in one's identity variances of

00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,160
many things that you were born into and

00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,759
are

00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:09,839
a broader systemic uh

00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,839
systemic power structure

00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:15,199
so the movement from thinking about how

00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:16,320
to build community with a very positive

00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:19,680
spin

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:21,839
of a political campaign to moving into

00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,600
understanding how in my backyard the

00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:26,240
hyperlocal is very important when he

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,720
talks about how we build community

00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:31,040
and thinking about how it is we we do we

00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:34,320
have harm mitigation rather than

00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:36,320
increasing harm through uh policing

00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,360
it was a bit inevitable but i found

00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,199
myself

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,399
taking a bit more and more steps into

00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,639
doing work that was

00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,920
questioning why some of these strategies

00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,639
were being used

00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,680
in chicago and how it is that we have

00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,399
come to accept

00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,360
that certain technology answers that are

00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:54,000
used

00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,600
to to not build community but break

00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,279
community down

00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,600
are actually the techniques and tools

00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:01,519
that we use

00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,839
particularly in chicago there was a

00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,039
dialogue that kicked off again in 2018

00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:07,600
when looking at

00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:08,959
the disappearances of peoples within the

00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,120
chicago police department

00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,400
overwhelmingly these peoples being

00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,559
people of color

00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,799
and how it was that their legal rights

00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:18,799
were being upheld how it was that

00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:20,240
these people were essentially being

00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:21,919
disappeared within the system and why

00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,720
that was okay

00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:25,199
asking questions and actually then using

00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,199
my

00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,559
technical skill set alongside many

00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,120
others in

00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:33,600
a few civic tech projects in chicago

00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:36,960
again when you ask the right questions

00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:39,120
and you think about harm mitigation

00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,960
and you think about how it is we build

00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,080
community better together

00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,160
there's definitely a space for

00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:47,840
technology to help us in that

00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,840
pursuit of better equity

00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,760
so the dialogue around predictive

00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,039
policing is not one that's only unique

00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,679
to chicago

00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:56,960
there has been a lot of dialogue about

00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,480
policing

00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,559
within the space of the united states of

00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:04,080
america there's been a lot of that from

00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:06,559
larger tech organizations such as amazon

00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,799
and their recognition product and what

00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:12,000
it means to use facial recognition

00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:12,400
in predictive policing just because we

00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
can

00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:17,919
do we do we use these strategies

00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,440
are we asking the right questions are we

00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,679
thinking of

00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,280
that if the tech we build is not

00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:24,720
actually including the community that

00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,120
it's supposed to protect and

00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,080
and empower do these technol do these

00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,000
technology tools

00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,360
actually allow us to do what we need to

00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:37,440
or instead is it

00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:37,440
increasing bias and promoting inequity

00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,000
the really big struggle for me came when

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,480
i found

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,360
that actually a piece of technology i

00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,280
was working on

00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:50,160
in 2018 for a social media management

00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,840
software

00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,520
firm that i worked for was actually

00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,640
being sold to the chicago police

00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,880
department

00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:59,039
and that piece of technology

00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,679
unfortunately was being used in such a

00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,320
way

00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:04,880
as to encourage policing patterns to

00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,880
continue to be responsive to continue to

00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,640
promote harm rather than thinking about

00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,320
restorative measures

00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,880
specifically the organization i had

00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,440
worked for a group that resold us was

00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,559
named

00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:18,400
in a lawsuit brought by the aclu

00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:20,240
a group within the united states of

00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,960
america that is kind of a

00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:25,200
a watchdog someone who observes to make

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,640
sure that the fundamental rights of

00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,480
folks living within the united states of

00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,480
america aren't violated

00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,160
so that journey of thinking about

00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,760
community building

00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,600
and knowing that community building is

00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:40,080
something that has always been a driving

00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,919
part of the work that i do

00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,440
really came full circle from the time of

00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:46,559
2009 i graduated

00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:48,799
university to the time of 2018 where i

00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,080
was actually finding myself

00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,000
being at the at the heart of a

00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,480
conversation where

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,240
the technology i was building wasn't

00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,600
building better communities but instead

00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:01,280
was encouraging

00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:03,600
the continued

00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,039
harm of others and was not actually

00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,720
taking a critical lens and thinking

00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:09,919
about how we influence

00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,559
the world around us i often point to

00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,880
this image

00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:15,360
and talking about uh what accountability

00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,880
means for us as individual technologists

00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:20,240
but also for us

00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:22,320
in technology itself with one another

00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,240
mark zuckerberg here being seated in

00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:27,039
front of the us the united states

00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,080
uh senate intelligence committee was

00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,760
being asked

00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:32,960
basically about his sense of

00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:35,360
accountability for facebook's

00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,440
for facebook's conduct during the 2016

00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:40,559
united states of america's presidential

00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,360
elections and really this right here

00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:44,480
this moment

00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:47,600
i think is a moment where many of us

00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,400
can can see the look here of someone who

00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,120
perhaps

00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,400
is maybe getting it or maybe is not but

00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,080
instead of saying that it's just mark

00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,440
zuckerberg i like to encourage people to

00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:58,559
think about what happens if you're the

00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,559
person who's in that seat

00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,840
so the the current moment that we're

00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:06,799
that we're navigating

00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,080
the the moment of social accountability

00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,320
from the perspective uh

00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,159
from the perspective of making sure that

00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,960
we have responsible practices

00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,440
for how we interact with one another for

00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,159
how it

00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,840
is we are educating ourselves and

00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:21,679
holding ourselves accountable for

00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,039
from the work we do to how we work

00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,880
alongside others

00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:26,080
there's many people who've done research

00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,200
in this field

00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:31,520
and have really i think been influential

00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,400
in helping me navigate some of this

00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:36,240
from weapons of math destruction looking

00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:39,600
at cathy o'neil's work

00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,400
highlighting how basically data

00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,880
practices

00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,840
and how the presumption of data as

00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,520
neutral

00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,120
in technology has been highly

00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,280
problematic and leads to

00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,600
us building tools that continue to to

00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:55,840
bring harm into the world

00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:57,919
alongside the work of uh dr safiya noble

00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,039
with algorithms of oppressions

00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:01,280
understanding kind of

00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:02,240
the way that even search engines and the

00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:05,120
way that

00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,000
users interact in search engines and how

00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,880
it is that we

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,120
make our own biases into how information

00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,440
is

00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,880
indexed and surfaced these are very

00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,000
interesting ways to kind of think about

00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,000
accountability because

00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,280
again community building is not only

00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,440
just about

00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,960
thinking about the in-person experience

00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,640
but it's also about the invisible

00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:25,200
influence and what happens

00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:27,840
when what happens when we don't talk

00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,840
about accountability

00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,320
so another way that i think we can think

00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,919
about um community building or even just

00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:38,720
about accountability itself is

00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:40,960
we can start thinking about you know the

00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:44,080
python community specifically you know

00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:45,679
equity or who is like what does equity

00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,880
mean in technology

00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:48,799
if we're thinking about it from a

00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:51,039
community perspective

00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:52,880
we can think about it as people who have

00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:55,120
different disciplines so maybe

00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:57,520
folks who are full stack engineers

00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:00,400
perhaps folks who are data scientists

00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:03,120
folks who are computer science educators

00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,799
or another way we can think about it as

00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:07,280
folks that belong within similar

00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:08,000
communities of uh of belongings so in

00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,960
this case

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,400
or all folks that love python and one of

00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,760
the really interesting things about

00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,960
python and i'm sure

00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:19,840
is not at all lost to all of us is that

00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:21,280
python has been a place of rampant

00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:24,559
growth

00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:27,600
from the stack overflow 2017

00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:31,679
uh survey basically it was seen that

00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:33,280
in 2017 alone python had grown 27

00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:34,960
some of the reasons why we find that

00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,600
python has been so successful and

00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,919
growing

00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:40,080
is many of the reasons why we love

00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:41,039
python and it has been the topics of

00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,320
many of the

00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:47,120
things here at pike africa 2020

00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,400
such as why python is great well it's

00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:52,159
easy to use

00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:53,919
it's open source it has really broad use

00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:57,039
cases from scientific

00:23:53,919 --> 00:24:00,400
scientific computing to web development

00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:02,559
to devops additionally

00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,080
what has been interesting to observe

00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:06,240
within the python community

00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,480
has been us having better understanding

00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:12,159
the ways in which people use python

00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:14,559
each year there is the there is a

00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:16,080
python development survey that has been

00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:18,559
done so from the 28th

00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,279
from the 2018 jetbrains python developer

00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,720
survey

00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:22,400
some of the interesting trends we see

00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,039
within python has been

00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,480
the the continued upward trajectory of

00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:28,799
people using python

00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,080
for data analysis as its primary use

00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:33,039
case so 58

00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:34,240
in this context from the 2018 survey

00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:36,080
with 52

00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,840
using python primarily for web

00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,919
development

00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,840
all of these things and us understanding

00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:42,960
who our community is and how it is we

00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:45,440
use python

00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,000
allows us to have a very focused

00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,559
dialogue

00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,159
of how it is we can talk about better

00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:54,400
informed community building

00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:54,400
and have initiatives on the books

00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:59,360
and one way that we do this has been

00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:01,120
through some of the work with the python

00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,559
software foundation

00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,240
so i find that when i speak about the

00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:05,520
python software foundation there are

00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,360
some people who know what it is

00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:09,520
and some people who do not and i am here

00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,799
to tell you that is completely okay

00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,400
if you're looking to learn more about

00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:15,440
the python software foundation you can

00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:18,799
go to python.org forward slash psf

00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:21,440
and actually what the psf is it is an

00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:21,840
organization that is set up to oversee

00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,640
this

00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:26,240
specific mandate uh the mission

00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,559
specifically here is to

00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,600
promote protect and advance the python

00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,679
programming language

00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,520
which should be no surprise as well as

00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,559
to support and facilitate the growth of

00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,480
a diverse and

00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:39,120
international community of python

00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,120
programmers

00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,200
so when it comes to who or when it comes

00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,039
to not just

00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,840
what is the mission of the psf but

00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:51,120
really what is the entity of the psf

00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:53,919
the psf is a non-profit that is

00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:55,600
based in the united states of america

00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,000
that has the intellectual property

00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,000
rights

00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
behind python allowing us to keep it

00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,520
free and open for all to use

00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,440
as well as also offering

00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,760
underwriting for sponsoring conferences

00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:11,360
funding grants and special projects and

00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:14,000
leading volunteer efforts

00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,600
so when it comes to the psf and and when

00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,880
it comes to python and the ways in which

00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,400
we can empower

00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,320
our community and think about the work

00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,080
that we do

00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,760
it's really quite it's really quite

00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,520
interestingly set up such that

00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,840
we're able to make sure that the range

00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:29,520
of activities that we are supporting and

00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:32,320
that we're putting on our roadmap

00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,840
can truly have a global impact so if

00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,720
we're looking at the grants program

00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,840
alone

00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:39,440
as one example of this impact from the

00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,679
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,919
annual report which again you can find

00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:45,600
at python.org if you look at the psf

00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,520
section there's an annual report which

00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,200
is published if you're ever curious

00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:51,279
you can look at the grants program and

00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,960
see just the distribution of funds

00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:54,640
what has been really interesting to see

00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:57,279
is the

00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,320
diversification of funds for activity

00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:00,480
around the world

00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,320
so not just in north america but in

00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,120
other parts of the world

00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,799
as you can see here 26 for africa in

00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,720
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:10,480
again these these grants go to support

00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,000
our community in a variety of ways

00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:15,360
ranging from

00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,520
supporting meet-up fees to helping fund

00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,200
developer sprints be them in person or

00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,000
remote because again we're doing things

00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,200
from a remote

00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:26,159
lens obviously for the current moment

00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,960
as well as helping fund events such as

00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:29,200
pycons

00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,320
which are fantastic opportunities so

00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,240
when you think about

00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:34,640
you know the way that the psf can truly

00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,679
have or rather the way that we as a

00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,480
community can have

00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:40,000
true kind of impact one way we can think

00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:43,360
through that is through the lens of the

00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,360
python software foundation

00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:47,440
in terms of overall uh in terms of

00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:49,760
overall capital

00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:52,000
what that looks like was in 2018

00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:54,960
approximately 324 000

00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,240
dollars was gifted in which that was

00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:01,039
about a 22

00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:02,480
in 22.6 increase from 2017 alone

00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:03,919
obviously right now those numbers will

00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,360
be different as we think about building

00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:07,039
community in the here and now

00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,559
and so when i ask us to think about

00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:11,520
building python community

00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:12,799
in the here and now it may not be that

00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,840
it's grants but instead i'm going to

00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:16,960
encourage you to think about some other

00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:18,880
opportunities

00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,480
so specifically one of the things that

00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:25,039
has come up recently

00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:26,799
has been a dialogue around the

00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:29,360
python software foundation board of

00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:31,919
directors election reform

00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:34,399
specifically there was a dialogue opened

00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:38,159
at discuss.python.org

00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:40,320
in which some feedback was captured

00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:42,159
and a dialogue was kicked off to try to

00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:45,120
invite people to think about

00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:47,679
what would the broader python community

00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:49,600
like to see when it comes to

00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:51,520
evolving the practices of the python

00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:54,559
software foundation

00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:57,360
again this this this staff this

00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:58,399
staff and non-profit founded and based

00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,320
in the united states

00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:02,000
has a voted on board of directors of

00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,360
which i am a member and marlene is a

00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,600
member

00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:07,360
and if these folks are to represent the

00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,120
broader collective interests of the

00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,399
python community

00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,760
we want to make sure that we're doing

00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:13,360
this work well and doing it

00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:15,279
intentionally

00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:17,360
some of the things that were brought up

00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:18,799
in this dialogue ranged from regional

00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,520
representation

00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:22,640
to having term limits to thinking about

00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:26,159
what does it mean

00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:27,679
about the makeup of the board itself you

00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:29,279
do we need to think about having

00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:32,480
different kind of balance

00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:34,399
checks in place for example if a certain

00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,480
population of folks are coming from

00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:40,960
the same employer do we need to have

00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:42,960
something to safeguard against that

00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,360
more specifically one of the topics that

00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:48,640
came up was actually raised by a

00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:49,919
community member who had wrote this very

00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,679
very detailed write-up called

00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:54,000
diversification is the future for the

00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:56,320
python software foundation by iqbal

00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,039
abdullah who's base who's a pythonista

00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:00,320
from the apac

00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:02,480
community and specifically some of the

00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:06,720
things that were called out here

00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:09,279
looked at thinking about not not just

00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,159
that the election itself ought to be

00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:12,240
something to

00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:13,520
have some safeguards in it but instead

00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,440
to think about how it is

00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,720
where we can meet pythonistas where they

00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,039
are at

00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,640
meet them in their local community the

00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:22,480
reason i shared some of the work i've

00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,480
done in chicago is because again i think

00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,480
when it comes to accountability and it

00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,880
comes to impact the hyperlocal is very

00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:32,799
important as we are the experts

00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:35,760
in the communities in which we are most

00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:37,120
connected to and we're most involved in

00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:39,120
some of the things here

00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:41,039
highlighted included having a

00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,960
diversification of the

00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:45,760
of the python software foundation

00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,760
membership base

00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,480
and additionally on the other side of

00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,720
this year's elections

00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,240
um ernest who's director of

00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,760
infrastructure for the python software

00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,080
foundation

00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,519
has this write-up specifically talking

00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,200
about some of the ways

00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:02,720
in which we can continue to do better

00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,399
work in making sure that we're

00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,919
fulfilling that mandate of the python

00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:09,039
software foundation mission

00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:12,880
explicitly to build a community

00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:15,760
that reflects the global diverse

00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:17,039
range of pythonistas that we all love to

00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:19,919
work with

00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:21,919
some of which have a short medium and

00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:24,480
long-term scope so in the short term

00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:27,679
thinking about improving membership

00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:29,519
profiles and demographic data

00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:31,679
in the medium term thinking about

00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:34,159
consolidating membership class

00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:35,760
as registering as a member sometimes can

00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:38,000
be a little complicated that

00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,679
people find since there's a few options

00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,080
and people don't know exactly which one

00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:43,120
they

00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:45,120
ought to register for and then lastly

00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:47,279
just reconsidering membership itself and

00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:49,600
the benefits that come with it

00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:50,960
there are there is a membership uh

00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,600
called a psf fellow

00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,640
which by the way psf fellows are

00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,279
nominated

00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,559
from the the broader community of

00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:00,640
pythonistas

00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:01,919
and i encourage you all go check out

00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,440
python.org

00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:05,120
to read about the fellows if there's

00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,240
someone that you think really

00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:09,279
exemplifies

00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:12,000
the spirit of python be it they

00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:14,240
are a big contributor to a prominent to

00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,559
a python open source product they're

00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,600
pro they really are just someone who is

00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:20,799
doing a lot of

00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:23,519
python community work or some

00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:25,919
some blend in between nominating that

00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:28,399
person as a psf fellow

00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:29,200
if accepted actually gets them a

00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:31,200
lifelong

00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,519
status as a voting member hence the

00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,880
fellow and i find that's actually a

00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:37,120
membership benefit that many people

00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,960
aren't aware of

00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,960
so in thinking also about other ways in

00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:43,039
which we can continue to

00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,880
reform and better do this work of

00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:48,080
meeting our pythonistas where they are

00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:49,600
at beyond just saying that we have this

00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:52,720
community of belonging

00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:53,519
where we can reform membership around if

00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,840
you're a

00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:57,840
supporting member someone who pays an

00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,640
annual fee to vote or someone who's

00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,240
managing

00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,720
or contributing where you're doing some

00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:05,440
number of hours supporting python

00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,399
open source or community or you are a

00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,519
python

00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:11,200
fellow there's also then the idea of

00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:12,080
these other spaces for community of

00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,679
belonging

00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:16,240
so i've ran friends at the start of this

00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:19,120
talk

00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:20,240
how afro python is a unique community

00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:23,360
within brazil

00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:26,080
a space for afropythonistas there is

00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:27,840
as we may know a group called pi ladies

00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:30,480
a group for folks that

00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:32,159
identify as women that participate

00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,559
within the python space

00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:35,360
and up to now being a member of pi

00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:36,720
ladies

00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,880
was not really something that had ever

00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,559
been codified and there's been a lot of

00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,760
work in thinking about how we can bring

00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:44,399
pi ladies in

00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:46,640
more explicitly to make sure that

00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:49,559
there's a membership class there

00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:51,519
so i'm excited to share that

00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:52,880
members.pyladies.com exists

00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:54,960
we have a work in progress for the

00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:56,000
membership portal there but if

00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,840
registering as a

00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,399
as a pi ladies member it does actually

00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:02,000
get you a python software foundation

00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:03,519
membership as well and there's two

00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,679
opportunities there's a basic

00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:07,679
and then there's a voting pie ladies as

00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:09,520
pi ladies itself also now is

00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:11,760
moving towards having a global

00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,040
leadership model akin to

00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:16,000
the way that the python software

00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:18,639
foundation or the core python developers

00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,599
have a leadership group that is selected

00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:23,280
to help

00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:23,280
be the vanguard leading the mission

00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,919
in fact beyond just saying how we do

00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,280
some of this diversification of

00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:31,599
membership work

00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,520
i do want to make up an intentional plug

00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:34,159
here of saying when it comes to thinking

00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,760
about

00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:37,200
the work that we do with community

00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:40,399
building

00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:42,399
pilates itself actually has an inaugural

00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:45,599
election that is happening that is open

00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:47,679
right now for calls for folks to

00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:49,760
sign up to participate in the election

00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:53,679
or they can apply for

00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:55,679
a seat through a nomination process

00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:57,839
the election getting two years the

00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:00,560
nomination process getting one year

00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:02,240
but again all this to say that within

00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,359
thinking about community building in

00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,599
python

00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:07,119
and the broader python community we've

00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:08,240
got a lot of these conversations that

00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:10,400
are unfolding

00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:13,200
and the part that is most instrumental

00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:16,079
in making this work happen

00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:18,960
is us coming together to talk about the

00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:21,920
work that needs to be done

00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,480
so when i talk about python community

00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,440
building

00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:27,359
in 2020 i really want to encourage

00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:31,280
people to think about

00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:33,040
having those conversations with your psf

00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,960
directors having those conversations

00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:37,119
within your hyper local community

00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,880
or having those within other communities

00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:40,960
of belonging within the python space

00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:44,240
that you identify with

00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,720
it that work begins with us starts with

00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,839
us

00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,839
and it ends with us

00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,839
so i think as technologists it's our

00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,079
duty to stay

00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:56,160
informed and that means educating

00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:59,359
ourselves not only on bias and tech

00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:01,200
but how tech impacts us all and how that

00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:01,839
impact can have a real negative or real

00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,560
positive

00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:05,040
impact i've actually started a reading

00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,560
list

00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,400
if anyone is curious about some of these

00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:11,760
broader issues

00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:14,560
i call bias in dot tech that's

00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:15,839
an open github repository but on the

00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,680
more specific

00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:20,079
level when it comes to community

00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:22,079
building and pipe for python 2020

00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:23,839
this work is going to be happening in

00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:25,359
the virtual space and so i think a lot

00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:28,240
of this is going to be happening

00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:29,839
in us thinking about how we approach the

00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,520
systemic

00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:34,000
foundations in which how we build

00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:35,839
community so i really would love

00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,280
to continue to have this dialogue with

00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:39,599
you all i would

00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,480
i have my calendar open for anyone who

00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:44,240
would like to have

00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:44,240
more of these dialogues at

00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:48,240
lorenamesa.comabout.html

00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:50,720
and really i would just love to hear

00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:53,040
what does reform look like to you

00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:54,320
so reform you know maybe it's the

00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:57,119
membership opportunity

00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:58,720
maybe it is thinking about outreach

00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:59,520
maybe it's thinking about how we do more

00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:02,720
intentional

00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:04,640
uh outreach in the virtual space

00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,000
there's a lot of this dialogue that is

00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,800
happening now and

00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,880
i think since we're all in this real

00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:13,200
interesting and unique moment

00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,640
of 2020 many of us are very open to

00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:17,359
having that dialogue

00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:18,960
and i would i have to say it's because

00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:21,359
of communities like

00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,560
the one i met at pycon africa where at

00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:24,560
the forefront

00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,599
of all the work i've seen with pycon

00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,920
africa

00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:29,760
the vulnerability the openness of

00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:33,359
talking about what it means to build

00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:36,079
community how you need to be intentional

00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:37,200
how you need to be not only intentional

00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:39,680
but consistent

00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,720
and engaged i think that's the kind of

00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:43,520
model that

00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:45,599
inspires me to do the work that i do so

00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:48,800
this snapshot from python

00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:52,160
africa 2019 i really love it everyone's

00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:55,119
just fantastic and all smiles but i

00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:57,440
i just want to say that the opportunity

00:37:55,119 --> 00:38:00,480
to be able to work alongside you all

00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:02,480
is it is second to none

00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,000
and i'm so thankful to be able to share

00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,720
a little bit about the ways that

00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,200
i see python community building work can

00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,960
happen

00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,960
in the here and now and ways we can take

00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:13,359
steps to move forward together

00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,400
so without further ado i would just like

00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:16,880
to say

00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:19,280
if anyone does have any questions i

00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:21,599
would be super happy to take some now

00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,040
or because i understand this this topic

00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:24,800
is a bit of a broader one

00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:26,720
and you would like to ruminate on it a

00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,680
little bit please do feel free to reach

00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:30,960
out to me

00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:32,079
me at lorenameza.com and again my social

00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,960
on pretty much all

00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:35,440
corners of the internet lorena nicole

00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,400
with

00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:39,839
four o's at the start because why not

00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,520
thank you everyone for the opportunity

00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:45,040
to speak with you today

00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:47,760
and with that that's the end of my talk

00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:49,520
great okay so i'm just gonna hang out in

00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:52,240
the stage area see if there's anyone who

00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,240
has questions

00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:56,320
thank you i appreciate you all

00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:02,560
that's a great question you know you

00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:05,119
have a fantastic organizing team here

00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,599
and i think that the organizing team

00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:09,040
here

00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:12,160
is a very very proactive group

00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:14,240
so i imagine that if you're looking for

00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:16,000
folks like widow to come speak they

00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:18,720
would be very open to that feedback

00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,119
i know that event planning starts early

00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:22,880
so maybe not right now

00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:24,880
maybe give them a few weeks when they or

00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:27,839
a few months let's say like that

00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:29,119
but uh definitely i know the outreach

00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:31,920
team

00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:33,040
is fantastic for the python africa group

00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,880
excellent

00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:36,400
okay well i don't think there's anyone

00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:39,920
that has any questions

00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:41,839
so i definitely

00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:44,000
so i definitely want to say thank you

00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:46,160
again everyone for

00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,760
allowing me the opportunity to talk a

00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:49,440
little bit about what

00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,440
community building i think looks like

00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:54,720
and how we've done such a great

00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:56,320
great uh set of work here in our space

00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,760
so i'm going to go ahead and pass it

00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,000
back to our or

00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:02,400
to our fantastic picon africa organizing

00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,359
team and again i want to thank you

00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,319
from the bottom of my heart uh what do

00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:07,920
you think the piece

00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:10,000
oh actually there is one question from

00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,880
danielle what do you think the psf will

00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,040
look like in say

00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:14,800
five years time after those efforts and

00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:16,480
initiatives

00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:19,839
i believe that's a great question

00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:22,160
danielle i think there's

00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:23,200
to me i think what would be really

00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,280
really interesting

00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,560
is one of the things that has come up a

00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,160
lot has been

00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:30,720
more movement and having more

00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:33,760
intentional spaces for

00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,560
regional kind of leadership spaces so i

00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,240
imagine

00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,920
you know i don't know if it's going to

00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:39,440
be a model like what we have with the

00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:42,400
european python

00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:43,119
society but i imagine for example the

00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,200
grants work

00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:46,720
group so for those of you who are

00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:49,200
curious about how

00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:50,880
some of the volunteer initiatives are

00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,520
done with the python software foundation

00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,440
we have work

00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:54,800
groups you can read about them at

00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,480
python.org

00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,160
and these are all volunteer driven so

00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,839
for example for a grants work group

00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:02,319
what is really important is to make sure

00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:05,359
we have folks that are from

00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:07,280
all the different regional areas

00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:09,920
that can provide us in context of how we

00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,640
evaluate what a grant looks like and how

00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:14,079
to best

00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:17,440
uh review a grant and that it

00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:19,440
has basically regional requirements so

00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:21,760
in making that more effective we've had

00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:24,960
to be more intentional about saying what

00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:27,520
expectations are for who ought to be

00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:29,040
participating in the conversation so i

00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,640
think that idea

00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:32,400
is something that is kind of kick

00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:34,319
getting more and more attraction

00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:36,160
as we think about more ways that we do

00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:37,359
this kind of this this work within the

00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,640
python community

00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:40,480
so i don't know if it means that we're

00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:43,119
going to have maybe

00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,920
other like other european python

00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:46,079
societies

00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:48,400
focus on the continent space but with

00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:51,040
more of these regional uh

00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:53,119
continent specific pycons i don't see

00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:56,480
why not i actually think that

00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:59,280
that leads to more hyper local focus

00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:00,960
and empowerment and i definitely think

00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:03,839
that's something i'm seeing people

00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:05,680
much more interested in additionally i

00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:08,640
think the other thing to think about

00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:10,480
is you know with python software

00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:12,800
foundation we are just one part of

00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:14,400
the broader python space so there's

00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,400
people who have like more niche

00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,520
interests maybe you're very interested

00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,599
in scientific

00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:21,760
python only or you're more specifically

00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:23,599
interested in core python development

00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:25,119
these are there there's leadership

00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:25,680
models that exist in those spaces as

00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:27,839
well

00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:29,200
so i would say if that is something you

00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:30,640
want to follow as well

00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:34,000
definitely make sure you follow those

00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:34,000
conversations in those spaces

00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:37,599
great okay and i think that is actually

00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,560
then

00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:45,839
the end of my session thank you everyone

00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:45,839
