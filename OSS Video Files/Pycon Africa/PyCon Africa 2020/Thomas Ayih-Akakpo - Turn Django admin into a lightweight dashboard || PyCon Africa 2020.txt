Description: 
	This talk is about crafting a very simple tool for data insights in Django-admin.
Without dependencies, and with super tricks using the Django's ORM, you will be able to create useful summary tables and a few charts.
I will try as much as possible to share my journey in this exploration, the obstacles I stumbled upon and how I overcame them.
