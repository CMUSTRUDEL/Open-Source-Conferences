Publication date: 2020-08-28
Playlist: PyCon Africa 2020
Description: 
	Machine Learning algorithms are shaping several industries and playing a main role in production systems in several businesses. However one discussion that receives less attention it’s related to vulnerabilities and attack surfaces in those ML Algorithms. As we have some security frameworks being developed this talk will focus on the attack surfaces of those models and some countermeasures to reduce the exposure of the attack surface. A demo using some known vulnerability of Scikit-Learn regarding white-box attacks will be provided.


This talk will discuss some adversarial attacks, their risks and chain of consequences and some simple countermeasures to avoid those attacks.
