00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,000
hands-on about contributing to some

00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,120
libraries and you learn a lot of things

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,239
so

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,920
um and also traveling and the best part

00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,680
of it is that whenever you travel

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,040
you learn a lot of things about the

00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,879
culture at that place

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,160
that's why i love to go to all the of

00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,959
the different conferences around the

00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,360
world

00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,879
last time you know i went to namibia and

00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,599
like we had a trip there we

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:53,360
like we met all the organizers there and

00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,040
people there lovely i really opened my

00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,120
eyes that was my first time going to

00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,959
africa and i totally love it i

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:04,000
i really like i want more i just yeah so

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,519
we love conferences but what the

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,680
problem is like there's always a

00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,400
downside it will make you very tired

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,239
because

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,840
you have to wake up early you travel

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,239
like when you travel you have like jet

00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,400
lag

00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,280
you don't sleep a lot and then you every

00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,200
day you have to wake up

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,280
early to go to the conference and then

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,080
you socialize till verily

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,440
and then also you know traveling can be

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,560
expensive you know

00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,640
you have to um pay for like get

00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,239
the ticket go there you know you have to

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,000
you know spend a lot of money

00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,319
and conferences some conference you know

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,560
you have to pay for you know quite a

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,920
big amount of money to to attend uh if

00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,239
your company is not paying then

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,080
well it's quite expensive and also it's

00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,840
just like not possible this year uh

00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,319
because of kovak sadly i

00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,319
i really want to visit ghana but like

00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,640
maybe next year but uh yeah sometimes

00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,040
just

00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,879
impossible because of you know un

00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:56,159
understand circumstances

00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:57,840
so um yeah that's why we are thinking

00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:00,080
maybe we should have a conference

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,280
that like we can enjoy the experience

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,599
that we have

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,000
uh but you know we we can be in our

00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:08,640
pajamas we can be very comfortable

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,760
