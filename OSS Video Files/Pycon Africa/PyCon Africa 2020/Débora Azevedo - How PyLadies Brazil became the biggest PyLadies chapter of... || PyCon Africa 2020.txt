Title: DÃ©bora Azevedo - How PyLadies Brazil became the biggest PyLadies chapter of... || PyCon Africa 2020
Publication date: 2020-08-30
Playlist: PyCon Africa 2020
Description: 
	Initiatives concerned about gender disparity have been gaining strength internationally in recent years, and the Brazilian open-source community has stood out in the quantity and effectiveness of actions aimed at these projects, changing the scenario of our regional and national conferences and events.
Here in Brazil, the largest country in South America, we also have the biggest PyLadies community of the world (in number of chapters), with about 30 chapters around the country. But how did we get here?
How do we manage to have such a huge  group of people working together and specially learning from each other to run our activities so organically?

In this lecture we will  talk about our experience with PyLadies in different regions in Brazil, where we will summarize some of the history of the creation of PyLadies Brazil, how everything started and the path we follow to this day. During the talk, we'll learn more about how do we get ladies (and gentlemen) to work together for these changes to happen, also how the organizers of the chapters and workshops communicate in order to improve their routines and activities and finally the annual experience sharing meeting we have to gather people who represent the groups to brainstorm ideas of how to make our community better.
It will be mentioned the construction and exchange that takes place within our community and with the diverse communities that support us in the most various corners of the country, their particularities, difficulties and results.

good afternoon

00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,960
everyone who's here i'm really glad to

00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,400
be here with you all

00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,480
and the title of my talk is how pi

00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,439
ladies brazil became the biggest pie

00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:33,840
ladies chapter of the world

00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:37,200
and a little bit about me hi i'm deborah

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,520
i am a master's student in innovation

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,360
with

00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:44,399
educational technologies here in brazil

00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,800
so i've been developing a research

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,760
about the development of an educational

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,600
software

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:54,719
to help deaf children to have their

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,840
literacy process improved in a bilingual

00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,680
perspective

00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,239
considering that here in brazil they

00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:03,039
have our brazilian sign language

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:05,199
and they also have portuguese written

00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:07,600
portuguese as a second language

00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,799
i'm a high school english teacher at my

00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,159
state public

00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,640
education network one of my ladies

00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,520
brazil

00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,080
co-founders and i'm also part of the

00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,439
pilot

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:22,080
global entering group which is a group

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:24,640
who is trying to picture what the future

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:27,200
of pi ladies global is going to be like

00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,240
and we are working on that for a while

00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,560
uh and

00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,520
also i was a community service award

00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,799
winner

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,159
last year from the psf and you can find

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,520
me on twitter

00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,320
um my user is there but mostly i tweet

00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,840
in portuguese

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:47,680
so if you don't mind and

00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:50,000
well you may be asking yourselves

00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,840
about the title of this talk how pilates

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,079
brazil became the biggest pie ladies

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,200
chapter of the world what does it really

00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:59,439
mean and well if there is

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,719
anyone here that hasn't heard about pi

00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:03,439
ladies before

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,479
we are an international mentorship group

00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,439
with a focus

00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,560
on helping more women to become active

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,720
participants

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,599
and leaders in the python open source

00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,640
community

00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:17,360
so our mission is to promote educate

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,440
and advance a diverse python community

00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:23,360
and we do that through outreach

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:26,800
educational education conferences events

00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:29,120
and so on and we also aim to provide

00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,080
this friendly support this friendly

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,800
network

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,280
for women as a bridge to the larger

00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,360
python world

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,319
so that's pretty much the definition of

00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,680
pi ladies

00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:43,680
and well if you go to pi ladies.com

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,879
locations you're going to see this

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,239
beautiful map

00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,879
and well it portraits how we are is

00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,239
cuddled

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:55,120
all around the world we have pie ladies

00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:57,920
all over and it's really great to be

00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,920
part of that

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,360
but if you see that map you can see that

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,400
there are

00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,000
lots of chapters in brazil but there are

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,800
some things that we should consider

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,680
consider like brazil is a huge country

00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,120
the fifth

00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:16,400
largest country in the world and

00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:19,360
well as a huge country we must know

00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,239
how to encourage people that live

00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,560
especially

00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,680
far from the capitals far from the city

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,360
centers

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,000
to raise themselves and be part of the

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,280
community

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,799
and create new chapters and create new

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,319
python user groups

00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:38,959
so the python word is spread all over

00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:40,319
so the experience that we've been having

00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,760
here in brazil

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,640
it shows uh how the growth of python

00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,680
user groups

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:50,720
in general all over brazil it was

00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:53,200
kind of irresponsible to create a safe

00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,120
and a receptive environment to create

00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:58,560
the beautiful community that we see in

00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,560
our country nowadays

00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,040
and in this little map it's just a cut

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,920
of the big one

00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,840
um you can see all the pie ladies the

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:11,920
brazilian pilot is chapters

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:15,280
it's a lot um well we have

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,959
about 30 active pilot instructors in

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,000
brazil

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,880
register we have more so we are doing a

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,880
task force

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,560
to figure out who's active who's not

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:28,560
active

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,840
and this map doesn't show only the work

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,520
that has been done

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:36,240
since the birth cell

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,199
but there there was a lot of work that

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,680
has been done

00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,960
before us before the creation of pi

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,280
ladies brazil

00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,360
and i want to talk about that work

00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:48,800
because it was fundamental to

00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,800
have what we have now

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,400
well uh this feeling this thought of

00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,639
creating this

00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,160
environment the safe environment for the

00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,840
people who attend events in the

00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,400
brazilian python community

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,960
it was built it was it started to be

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,520
built

00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,440
a long time ago way before pi ladies

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,479
brazil started

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:13,199
so together with the wheel of sharing

00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:16,720
knowledge of working on new projects

00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:18,960
we had the creation of python brazil

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,160
association in portuguese we call it a

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,280
pb

00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,240
and well this association is a

00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,639
non-profit

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,680
entity that is responsible for legal and

00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,759
accountant part

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,680
for the organizers of national and

00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,800
regional events

00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,360
so in 2007 this group of people got

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,320
together

00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,560
got united with this vision of helping

00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:43,840
to spread the python world around

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:47,039
around brazil and also to try to

00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:50,080
pave the way for us and this

00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:52,639
is really a milestone because well

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,680
i have a question for you now have you

00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,960
ever tried

00:05:53,680 --> 00:06:00,319
to organize a medium or a larger

00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:03,360
or a large event for like 100 people

00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:06,639
500 people 800 people

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,800
well it's pretty much like this gif so

00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:11,360
in order to prevent people from going

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,160
crazy with accounting and leo contract

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,240
issues

00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,520
a preview was created and well it

00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,080
started to solve

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,160
loads of problems for us curse is not

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:23,360
perfect but it was a great association

00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:26,160
that was created pre-piloties

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,400
and it still has an impact on how we do

00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,919
things

00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,039
and well even before pilot is brazil

00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:36,639
creation

00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:40,080
people were talking about diversity

00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:42,720
and difference so

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,680
brazil is a huge country and it's one

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,360
with

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:50,080
loads of socio-economic disparities

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,759
but in general if you're in the python

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,400
brazil community

00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,360
you're going to hear from us at this

00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,479
feeling

00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:01,039
that we want to have this impact

00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,000
we want to take action and you can only

00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:05,440
do that

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,680
by talking about difference that's

00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:10,000
well i think this picture is it's real

00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,520
pretty and it's written in portuguese

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,160
there but the translation

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,840
to uh english is there which means that

00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,240
our

00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:21,840
differences make the difference

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:25,680
and well us human beings

00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:28,240
would refer in so many ways

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,680
but we cannot focus only on gender

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,720
because we only we don't defer

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:36,000
only on that but we refer on

00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,720
gender race ethnicity religion gender

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,800
identity

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,400
sexuality nationality we are from

00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,599
different countries

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:47,039
socioeconomic status neurodiversity

00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:50,160
physical ability and much much more

00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:53,039
so how do we get all these different

00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,160
human beings all these people to be in

00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:57,759
the same place

00:07:54,160 --> 00:08:01,039
and feel and in a way feel safe

00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:03,440
how do we do that and

00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,720
there is a great talk about

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,520
anti-patterns for

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,800
diversity which naomi cedar gave like

00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,160
five years ago

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:15,039
and it is still so current we

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:17,039
are still talking about the same things

00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:19,840
and she shows empty patterns

00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:21,759
uh being our ways of doing things that

00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,440
can be curve established

00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,879
they can be considered good but they are

00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,360
not helpful for

00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:29,680
what they are supposed to do so you

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,159
should check out this talk

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,360
because it really portrays how it differ

00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:36,240
in so many ways

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,159
and what should we do what are we doing

00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:42,000
that is not working like properly and

00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:45,279
how we need to reflect about that

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,440
and coming back to brazil now um

00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:49,279
even before pi ladies one more time

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,560
before pi ladies we had a lot of

00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:54,560
effort that was done and one of these

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:57,200
efforts was the

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,080
code of conduct effort which was written

00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,600
collectively

00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:04,160
so there was a concern about this topic

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,720
about building the safe environment

00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,399
before

00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:10,720
uh pie ladies in brazil and

00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,959
we also call have what i like to call

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:16,560
like the pioneers

00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:18,000
um so before the creation of pi ladies

00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,279
here in brazil

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,880
we had some special women who paved the

00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,880
way for us

00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,720
women that were there in the

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:30,160
organization of events

00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:33,920
in the front line doing so much for us

00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:37,040
so we have tiana tania rafaela

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:39,519
and they were literally paving the way

00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,399
for us they've been doing so much work

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:44,480
before us

00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:47,760
and they should be remembered for that

00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:50,800
and it's impossible to think about

00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:54,560
pilates brazil disassociated with the

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:58,560
figure of fernando so fernando masanori

00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:01,920
it's like our official ambassador

00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:03,279
and the story of how he is related to pi

00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,120
ladies brazil is very

00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:07,600
it's pretty interesting it's pretty

00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,519
interesting because in 2013

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,000
some friends they came to pi canyon last

00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:14,079
and then they found out about pi ladies

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,640
and fernando was one of these people and

00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:19,200
he was like oh my god this is great

00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,279
right and then he started to encourage

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,839
girls from the python community he's a

00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,800
student

00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:28,240
because he is a professor to create

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:31,519
their own pie ladies chapters

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:34,560
and he was

00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,920
very necessary well one year later in

00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,240
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:41,360
we had our pi ladies brazil launching

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:44,959
event in a cow which is

00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:48,720
from well we had more than

00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:51,360
100 participants and it's funny

00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,000
to think what happened six years ago

00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,480
because

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,440
when we were organizing this event

00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,839
people would say

00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,880
that we wouldn't even have like 20 women

00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:04,320
interested

00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,320
and we got

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:11,760
around the fif are around 100

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:15,519
women in the event so it was

00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:18,880
a great lunch a great start for us

00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:21,279
and this is the staff team for the

00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,279
piloted brazil launching event

00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,519
and these people in this picture they

00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,480
were responsible for creating this

00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:30,480
environment

00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:33,440
to all the women who are there

00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,680
so when we look back and we think of all

00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:39,279
the work that has been done

00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:42,640
it really comes back to people who are

00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:46,480
in the front line which is great

00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:49,120
but pie ladies brazil was the first

00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,600
piloty shepherd in latin america but

00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:54,959
it's not only that

00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,079
we also have we had the first gender

00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,800
girls workshop

00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:00,000
in western america as well so brazil is

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,959
full of firsts

00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,480
right so if there is anyone here who

00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:07,360
doesn't know what jenga girls

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,800
is is a one-day workshop in which you

00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,519
can deploy a

00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,959
django web application it's blog they

00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,279
have a tutorial it's

00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:17,920
very well written and it's it's pretty

00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:20,399
famous worldwide

00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,839
and just like pie ladies we have jenga

00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:25,440
girls workshops

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:28,959
all over so you can see in this map

00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:31,519
how many workshops we have done so far

00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:32,560
and in brazil we also have loads of

00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:36,160
jenga girls

00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:39,519
workshops and this impacts a lot

00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:42,079
in fact and

00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,440
um we have lots of pi ladies chapters

00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:45,279
that are involved

00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,720
in the organization of jega girls as

00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:49,920
well

00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,519
so we have the stories of people in our

00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,600
local chapters in our local

00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,360
ladies chapters who were studying

00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,880
something else

00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:01,680
and they went to a jenga girls workshop

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,600
learned how to code and the django girls

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,639
workshop was a turning point in the life

00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,880
of this woman

00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,920
so we have women who transitioned

00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,920
careers

00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,160
went to programming to software

00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,200
development after a gender girls

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,480
tutorial

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:20,959
so it's amazing to see how it impacts

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:22,480
these lives and another thing that i'm

00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:25,519
really proud of

00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:28,959
thinking about what pilot is brazil has

00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:32,000
done was the creation

00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:33,839
of the pie ladies brazil conference this

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,360
image that you can see is the same that

00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:38,560
i'm wearing in my t-shirt

00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,480
and it's very symbolic because

00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,959
this conference we thought about this

00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:46,240
conference in 2017

00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:49,279
and then we had the first one in 2018

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:52,320
and the pi ladies brazil conference was

00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:56,000
thought to be like prior our

00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:59,120
pycon brazil so we had

00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,519
the first one in 2018

00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,560
and these events specifically i was the

00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,199
chair of this event

00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,800
so we thought about this event uh for

00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:09,760
200 women

00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,639
and we only had women attending women

00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,839
organizing

00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,160
women speaking in this event and thanks

00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,839
to

00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,639
ap and also to the psf who provided fun

00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,800
for us

00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,000
we could provide meals and we could

00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,040
provide swag

00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,720
and a comfortable venue and everything

00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,680
for this women

00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:33,199
so it really hits a soft spot when i

00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:35,839
talk about five ladies brazil conference

00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:36,639
and we also have a second edition last

00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:40,399
year

00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:41,519
in 2019 it was in sao paulo the same

00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,959
state that we had

00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,680
uh icon brazil last year and it is

00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,560
extremely

00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,279
like it's rewarding it's fulfilling to

00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,440
see

00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:53,360
the things that are started and they

00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,880
have they have a continuation

00:14:53,360 --> 00:15:00,240
the work keeps being done

00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:02,959
and it's amazing to see that

00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,240
and one of the facts that really paved

00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:07,839
the way for us

00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:09,440
is the fact well brazil was a huge

00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,040
country this i think this is the third

00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,240
time i'm saying this

00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:17,600
but because we are a huge country

00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:20,880
we have this culture of having

00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:23,279
regional events so we have

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,880
taiko amazonia in the north of brazil we

00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:27,920
have python northeast

00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,120
the northeast of brazil python south by

00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,160
from southeast

00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:34,720
and python which is in midwest

00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,360
here in brazil and we also have our

00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,480
national

00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,440
uh conference and one thing that i would

00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,759
like to point out

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,279
is the fact that the pie ladies are in

00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:46,639
the organizations

00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:49,600
of lots of these events and

00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,079
knowing that there is a this is space to

00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,199
be

00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:54,079
in the organization to have a voice and

00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:57,120
to know that we

00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:58,720
can occupy these spaces this is one of

00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,360
the main things that has

00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,639
been changing the scenario in our

00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:06,880
regional conferences

00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,880
and also in our national conferences

00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,720
and yeah well it's just like rihanna

00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,920
says it's like

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:17,360
work work work work work and we have

00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:19,120
so many people who are working in order

00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,839
to provide this environment

00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,959
in order to pay attention to the

00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:26,720
necessities

00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:30,000
so yeah it's loads of works

00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:32,320
and one of the main things about pi

00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,160
ladies that really hits me in a soft

00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:38,320
spot

00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:41,680
is the fact that we have a feeling

00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:44,880
of trust and being worthy to be there

00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:48,480
for me especially i don't work with

00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,680
programming and even though i don't work

00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,519
with programming

00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,880
it doesn't invalidate what i do for the

00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:56,320
community

00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:58,720
and in our first pilotis event over six

00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,800
years ago

00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,320
the girls they were trying to recruit

00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:05,360
women who knew python

00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:08,480
to be coaches in this first

00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,760
event and well back then i was doing

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,120
computer networking

00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,439
a technical course in computer

00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:15,520
networking and

00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:17,120
well i knew python i learned python in

00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:20,480
that course and then

00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:23,360
why wouldn't i help then i

00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,079
applied to be a coach and then

00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,839
everything

00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:31,360
started in this very famous

00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:33,360
saying for brad cannon comfort language

00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,039
stay for the community is one of the

00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,520
biggest truths

00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:38,320
in the python community in my point of

00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,880
view

00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,160
well you can go to the community most of

00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,080
the times

00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,600
for what the language for the language

00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:49,360
for something technical

00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:51,520
that the community has to offer us then

00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,880
when we get to know the community we see

00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:56,080
beyond that

00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:59,280
we make friends really dear friends

00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:02,320
and well thinking about brazil

00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:04,640
and our regional conferences and our

00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,960
national conferences

00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,840
with the community we make those friends

00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,840
that we see once a year

00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,679
we have those friends that we know that

00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:16,559
in october we are going

00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:18,320
to be very anxious to see each other

00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:20,720
because it's the time that we can get

00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:24,320
together in our national conference so

00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:27,679
it's really heartwarming to be part

00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:30,799
of this community

00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:34,080
and uh mariara she brings

00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:36,480
us um this in this tweet and she says

00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,679
that python is the largest community-run

00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,360
programming language

00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:42,880
on the planet which is both a blessing

00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:45,600
and a curse

00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,880
because due to that because of that we

00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,760
can keep the language

00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,039
freely available and well since the

00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:54,080
language is really

00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:56,720
available we can see lots of resources

00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:58,240
and materials and tutorials they're also

00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,600
free

00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,240
but on the other hand um all of this

00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:07,039
rely

00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:10,320
mostly on efforts by volunteers

00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:13,039
so i just want to say thank you

00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,600
for all the organizers of icon africa of

00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,600
all the

00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,600
python user groups or conference

00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:20,320
organizers

00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,799
well i'm really thankful for all your

00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,840
job

00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:24,400
and you're doing a great one thank you

00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:28,240
very

00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:29,760
very much and we started to talk about

00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,799
community

00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:37,039
but what is community

00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:40,160
what do you see as a community

00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:42,960
well i went to google and

00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,320
i go through the definition of community

00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,919
and this is what google

00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:50,080
told me it tells me that a community

00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:50,960
is a group of people that are living in

00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,280
the same place

00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,880
or having a particular characteristic in

00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:58,080
common

00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:00,240
but well i would go more

00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,360
to the second definition and the second

00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,840
definition

00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:07,039
we have a feeling of fellowship with

00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:10,559
others and it comes

00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:13,919
as a result of sharing common attitudes

00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:14,960
interests and goals and i think that

00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,200
this definition

00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,640
really portrays what the python

00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,919
community is about

00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:24,559
with pi ladies as well

00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,600
and if you think about the brother

00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:28,799
python community

00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:31,840
it has lots of different channels

00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:32,799
for you to get in we have the python

00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,679
user groups

00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:36,799
we have the local conferences we have pi

00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:39,520
ladies we have

00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:42,320
here in brazil we have afro python we

00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:45,600
have so many channels

00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:50,640
but well personally none of them

00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:50,640
as important as pi ladies is for me

00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,159
well in this picture you can see me and

00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,360
the other

00:20:54,159 --> 00:21:00,720
three pilots brazil co-founders briella

00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:03,280
clara and cathy and

00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,919
well i really love this picture because

00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:10,000
it shows us together one more time

00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:13,039
and by ladies brazil was created in 2014

00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,919
and there was a space in time where

00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:17,520
gabriella

00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:19,520
traveled to france to study but i needed

00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,799
to take some time away from the

00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:25,440
communities

00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:26,799
and kathy traveled to germany and

00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:30,000
one of the most beautiful things about

00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:31,520
pie ladies is that the group doesn't die

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,280
because the co-founders are not there

00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:38,880
anymore so in our local chapter in natal

00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:41,679
i kept the chapter going and

00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,960
it happened the same thing all over

00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:46,400
brazil

00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:48,960
so the organicity of pilot is one of the

00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:51,360
most beautiful things to have this

00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,840
horizontally to know that anyone can

00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,360
step

00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:59,520
up help you don't see that

00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:02,159
in all organizations so this picture is

00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,559
our fourth year anniversary and it was

00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,120
really

00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:06,960
funny to see that because we got all the

00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:10,480
co-founders

00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,480
reunited once more

00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:17,360
and well thinking about community

00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:18,640
and diversity and everything that comes

00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:22,240
with it

00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:24,720
one thing that uh we should be aware

00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,559
is that well if we have if we are in a

00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,440
community and we share

00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:31,679
um the same vision and we have interests

00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:34,559
and we have the same goals

00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:35,039
we need to be aware that maybe it can

00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:38,080
cause

00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:38,880
issues and we can struggle maybe to

00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,080
share

00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:45,360
at the same vision of what's good

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:48,559
so it is extremely important to

00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:49,760
keep this contact with people in the

00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:52,799
community

00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,520
and ask them do the members of your

00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:56,559
community

00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:59,440
feel like their perspective or what's

00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:00,960
good has a representation is it being

00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,440
represented

00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,320
do they feel like they're being hurt do

00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,520
they feel like they

00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:09,919
have a voice do

00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,799
they feel like they belong do they feel

00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,840
welcome

00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:15,919
in the same space that the community is

00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,200
so i bring this quote from you from

00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:20,240
marlene

00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:24,320
and in her picon uk talk

00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,320
she says that diversity

00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:30,880
inclusion is a sense of

00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:33,280
belonging it's a sense of

00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,280
knowing that you belong there

00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:38,400
independent of your background

00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:40,320
independent of what you do for levy if

00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,720
you feel like you belong

00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,720
you do

00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,679
and well i had to do some digging to

00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,520
find out

00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:54,880
were the paladies chapters in brazil

00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:58,080
so as you could see in the map we had

00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,279
chapters all over the place in this list

00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:03,120
i think you have almost

00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:05,120
40 of them some of them are inactive

00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:07,440
and as i said previously we are trying

00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:10,000
to do like this task force to to get in

00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:13,600
touch with people

00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:16,400
but it's really a sense of belonging

00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,960
that being part of by ladies brazil

00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:21,840
brings

00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:24,720
to us and when we look back

00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,679
and go back to six years ago in our

00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,679
first event

00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:29,200
when people would tell us that we

00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:32,480
wouldn't get

00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:34,720
women to participate and i'll tell you

00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:37,360
it was a surprise for us it was really a

00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,000
surprise for us to know that in our city

00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:41,360
we had

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,799
a hundred women who were interested

00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:45,440
in programming it was really awesome for

00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:48,559
us

00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:50,559
and when we go back and

00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:52,320
especially in the experience i had with

00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:54,320
this first event

00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,440
the feeling that i have it's really the

00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,880
feeling of being

00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:01,360
welcome and being worthy it's just like

00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,520
bringing thor's hammer

00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,880
it really like being worthy of being

00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:08,640
part of that

00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:11,840
and for the first event that

00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:15,039
we had in brazil six years ago

00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:18,559
it was thought to be a morning of talks

00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:20,000
in the morning with a flask tutorial

00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:22,799
so the girls who were in the

00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,919
organization they recruited this

00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:29,440
coaches and i was included

00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:30,320
they provided us training to feel safe

00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,240
and

00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,679
forgo and have confidence to help these

00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,279
other women who are going to be

00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:37,919
attending the event

00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:39,279
to do the class tutorial and in the

00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:43,120
morning

00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:46,400
we had uh some talks and

00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:50,559
when i look back that's me um

00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:54,480
giving a talk about how to use python

00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:57,840
and well it when i did that

00:25:54,480 --> 00:26:01,039
i didn't even know what i was gonna say

00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:04,080
because in the in the morning we had

00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:06,320
lots of amazing women giving talks

00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:08,400
uh we had people from the university we

00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:11,600
had professors from the university

00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,400
we had uh developers from well-known

00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,400
companies

00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,919
so when the girls invited me to give

00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,640
this talk on

00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:20,960
how to how to use python why to use

00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:24,080
python

00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:26,480
i felt like they trusted me

00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,440
because well i i come from a different

00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,840
background

00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,120
i major english at the university and

00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,919
they knew it

00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:35,120
and even though they knew it they gave

00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:39,279
me the opportunity

00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:41,120
to give this talk and it was a milestone

00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:44,799
for me it was the first time that i

00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:47,520
ever have spoken about python

00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:49,200
so knowing that there were people

00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:52,400
trusting me

00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:54,159
they felt like i was a boy i could do

00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,640
that

00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:57,200
it is it is heartwarming and it feels

00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,400
like

00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,400
you can do anything

00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:07,360
so um we are really changing

00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:10,880
the face of our conferences

00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:12,880
here in brazil so well

00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,080
and i want to tell you why it's so

00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:17,360
important to have

00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:18,320
initiatives like pie ladies because when

00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,799
we look back

00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,720
to the pictures in our national

00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:24,799
conferences or even in our regional

00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:28,159
conferences

00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:29,679
we can see the development and we can

00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:32,000
see

00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:33,279
it is explicit the work that has been

00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,640
done

00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:39,360
in this in this moment so well i'll show

00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:43,120
you this picture this picture is from

00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:46,559
our picon brazilian 2016.

00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:48,640
this is these are the pilots the picture

00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:52,799
with all the women in the event

00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,799
uh that was in 2017

00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:57,679
and this one was in 2018

00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,520
and this one is really special for me

00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:00,720
because i was in the organization of

00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:04,720
business pacific

00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:10,159
uh pike reserve and that was from

00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:13,279
last year from python brazil in 2019

00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:13,279
and well it's clear

00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:20,640
they don't lie it shows us

00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:23,600
a development it shows us the difference

00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:26,000
and you may be asking yourselves how is

00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:29,279
that possible

00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,200
so one of the main things that helped us

00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:34,559
to

00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:38,559
totally change this scenario was the

00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:42,000
creation of our crowdfunding campaigns

00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:44,480
so since 2016

00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,320
we started to make crowdfunding

00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:49,360
campaigns to try to bring

00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,399
the ladies who live like the farthest

00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:54,480
from the

00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:57,120
city that icon brazil was going to be

00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,000
they had like talks accepted but

00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,919
sometimes they

00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,200
didn't have they needed the financial

00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:04,320
aid to be

00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:07,440
part of the event

00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:08,159
so you can see how this is it's another

00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,640
sign of

00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:11,840
how the brother python community in

00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,960
brazil

00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:17,279
supports pi ladies so

00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,000
we had this crowdfunding campaigns and

00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:21,520
they were

00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,520
all very successful

00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:26,000
this is the total picture of bike in

00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:28,960
brazil in 2018

00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,799
and the people in the picture they are

00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,480
doing the sign of python in sign

00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:35,919
language

00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:37,200
and well with time the brazilian python

00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:39,679
community has been

00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,279
thinking in a lot of different

00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:44,640
strategies and a lot of different

00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:47,919
aspects of what is being diverse and

00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:50,000
what is being inclusive and

00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,279
going back to the context that i'm

00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,120
inserted with uh

00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:58,720
just for you to to get a picture

00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:02,000
in 2017 we had 98

00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:05,679
women registered out of 572

00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:08,880
we had 40 percent of women speakers

00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:11,440
and a bike in so we had 17

00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,799
activities that were offered by women if

00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:16,000
we go to 2018

00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:20,840
well we have an improvement of a hundred

00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:23,200
we go from 98 registered women to

00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:26,320
153 we had

00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:28,480
a smaller number in the percentage of

00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,720
women speaking but if you see the number

00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,720
of

00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:34,880
talks by women it grew

00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,320
and then from last year by from brazil

00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,960
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,840
we still tried to keep up the number of

00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,640
women that

00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,360
registered for the event and we had the

00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,080
largest

00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,799
percentage of women speaking in the

00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:50,240
event

00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:53,360
we had 26 talks by women out of

00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:55,600
60 if i'm not mistaken which is

00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,559
like huge and we are not talking in

00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:00,399
these numbers

00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:02,840
about tutorials and the keynote speakers

00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:04,159
these are just the talks in the main

00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:07,519
conference

00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:08,399
so every year we have a different

00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:10,640
milestone

00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:12,000
every year is is a conqueror to have

00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:14,559
that

00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,399
and it happens mostly because of this

00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:20,159
effort of both by ladies and the

00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:22,799
brazilian python community together

00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:24,640
and another thing that happens during

00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:28,159
life in brazil

00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:31,039
and is our the moment

00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:32,320
that we get together to discuss what is

00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:36,080
going to be done

00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:37,519
for next year and because of the

00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:40,320
crowdfunding campaign

00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:40,640
we can get together at icon brazil at

00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,840
this

00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,960
assembly ladies from all the five

00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:47,120
regions of brazil

00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,320
and we can have different perspectives

00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:51,279
we can think about

00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:53,519
um on strategic planning for the next

00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:56,320
year's crowdfunding campaign

00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:58,320
how can we work how can we get the word

00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:01,679
smoother

00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:03,840
because it is a huge work

00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:06,960
and well this is a picture of last

00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:10,880
year's our pilot designer meeting

00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:14,159
so we can see people from all over

00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:15,440
who have a lot to say to have to

00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:18,480
contribute

00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:21,840
and it's really a moment for us

00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:24,159
and from us a moment that we can learn

00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:26,640
with the experience of people from

00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:28,480
different chapters that we can hear

00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,320
the things that worked the things that

00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:33,919
didn't work what did we

00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:36,080
learn during the year and what can we do

00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:38,320
to improve and do better for the next

00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,320
year

00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:43,279
and well the last

00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:45,360
thing that i want to show you that pilot

00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:48,240
is brazil has been doing this year

00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:49,679
that really portrays the sense of

00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:52,880
belonging

00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:56,399
is uh it's it's like a series

00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:59,279
and it's called pathway through pyladies

00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:01,600
and public violates is a project that

00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:02,399
was developed by pilots brazil in order

00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,559
to promote

00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:07,760
the exchange of knowledge between pi

00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:10,799
ladies from different chapters in brazil

00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:14,799
so since we have this huge number

00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:16,640
of chapters we sometimes we don't know

00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:18,080
everyone we don't know what the other

00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:21,360
chapters are doing

00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:24,559
and this series of interviews

00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:28,399
they started to try to fill this gap

00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:30,000
and it is as i said interviews involving

00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:31,519
two different chapters and one

00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,640
interviewee

00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:35,760
so in the first part we had ladies from

00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,240
two chapters

00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:39,360
interviewing uh two other ladies from

00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:42,000
one chapter

00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,960
so in the first part we have the this

00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,840
interview

00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,640
with stories and curiosities about the

00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,799
interviewed

00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,960
chapter and then the second one we have

00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:53,200
a lecture on a topic from the interview

00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:56,640
chapter knowledge area

00:33:53,200 --> 00:34:00,240
so we created this model and

00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:03,440
it's been it's been so wonderful to see

00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:06,159
to know what other chapters are doing to

00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:08,159
learn from them well especially in this

00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:09,280
time that we cannot get physically

00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:12,800
together

00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:16,159
pop into pi ladies is a project

00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:19,040
that really brings

00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:19,040
us together

00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:24,399
and well we don't see pi ladies as a

00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:26,159
different community

00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:28,079
when we think about the brother

00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:30,159
brazilian python community

00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:31,440
we don't see pie ladies as a different

00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:34,240
thing

00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:36,399
actually pie ladies is an open door to

00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:39,599
the brother of python community

00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:40,480
it's a space that would make people feel

00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:43,839
comfortable

00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:47,040
with the support that we provide

00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:49,119
and well you can be asking you're not a

00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:52,720
pie lady you're not a lady and

00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:54,240
how can i help and the first thing that

00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:58,160
comes to my mind is

00:34:54,240 --> 00:35:01,760
um buy a t-shirt help us financially

00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:04,880
give a talk with a pie ladies t-shirt

00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:06,720
it really shows the movement and how the

00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:09,760
community is engaged

00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:12,640
and wants to help with with this

00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,280
you help us financially you help us like

00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,440
buy

00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,119
food and provide meals for the attendees

00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:20,560
of our events

00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:23,839
and it's it's really it really impacts

00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:24,720
lots of lives when you acquire a ladies

00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:30,000
t-shirt

00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:34,079
or a sticker or a pen

00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:36,640
and i have a question for you all

00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:39,520
well when you look back and we see all

00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:42,640
the work that has been done

00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:43,200
we know that a lot has been done and a

00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:47,440
lot

00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:50,480
more is institute to be done

00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:54,240
and well how do you see the future

00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:56,640
of our community in the next 10 years

00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,440
do you feel like the things that we have

00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:01,200
been doing

00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:02,800
are enough to keep the diversity to keep

00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,560
the inclusion

00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:07,119
what else should we do what else do we

00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,119
have to do

00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:16,160
and now to actually finish

00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:17,280
i stay with this quote by maya angelou

00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,440
and she says

00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,960
i've learned that people will forget

00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:24,079
what you did you said

00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:27,359
people will forget what you did

00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:29,920
but people will never forget how you

00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:33,760
made them feel

00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:36,320
and this is a big truth

00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:38,400
the fact that i'm here talking about pie

00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:40,240
ladies brazil and talking about the

00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:43,040
experience that i have

00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:44,640
to be one of the people that takes care

00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:47,839
of my ladies brazil

00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:48,160
it's because six years ago there was a

00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:51,599
group

00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:52,640
of women who trusted me who knew

00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:56,240
something in me

00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:59,680
that i didn't even know that was there

00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:03,839
and well this thing you just

00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:07,680
can't erase the way people make you feel

00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:11,680
it's truly unforgettable

00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:14,800
and well that's it thank you very much

00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:17,359
if you have any doubts questions um

00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,920
you can tweet to me you can write me an

00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:19,839
email

00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:23,839
and well feel free to ask questions if

00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:23,839
you have any thank you

00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,920
thank you thank you so much for being

00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:30,720
here

00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:33,359
are there any questions anything that

00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:37,839
you want to ask

00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:37,839
great you liked it really glad

00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:44,880
okay so i see a question there um

00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:46,079
karna virus has affected communities all

00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:49,359
around the world

00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:52,400
how has pilot is brazil responded well

00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:53,280
um i think that the local chapters each

00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,359
local chapter

00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,960
because we have lots of local chapters

00:37:55,359 --> 00:38:00,160
but each local chapter

00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:02,800
is responding in a different way

00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:04,320
we have some chapters that have been

00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:07,680
doing lives on

00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:09,839
youtube on instagram

00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:12,240
and there are some other groups that the

00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:14,560
ladies are feeling like

00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:16,000
reclusive and they are talking in their

00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,680
private groups

00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,160
but they are not doing for example a

00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:22,480
tutorial or something like that

00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:24,160
but they keep the bond because they have

00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,920
these internal groups in which they can

00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:28,320
communicate to one another

00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,760
and then they can talk about the hard

00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:32,320
times they are having

00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:33,200
and share tips on how to organize your

00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:36,079
time

00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,560
doing quarantine and these kind of

00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:38,320
things

00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:40,400
so each group has a different

00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,520
perspective on how to deal with the

00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,400
pandemic

00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:47,119
but well with the pandemic we had

00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:51,040
papanter pilot this started

00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:55,200
so uh this was like a national

00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:58,720
uh event so we meet every thursday night

00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:01,920
8 00 pm to learn more about

00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:03,599
um a different chapter so i think that

00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,400
was the way that pi ladies brazil

00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:07,119
responded

00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:08,640
to the fact that we cannot be together

00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:11,680
physically

00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:13,599
but every thursday with papu and

00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,960
ladies we have this get together and

00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:17,839
it's awesome

00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,560
well if there aren't any more questions

00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:22,480
well i'll be

00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:26,400
here and feel free to send me an email

00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:29,680

pleasure to it is always a pleasure to

00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,800

and for the world to know the work that

00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,240
has been done

00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:48,000
especially here in brazil so i'm really

00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:49,119
thankful for the opportunity thank you

00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,440
very much

00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:53,680
organizers and thank you all for being

00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,680
here

00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,839
hi abigail

00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:02,640
so good to have other pie ladies here

00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,640
too

00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:08,720
i'm inspired as well abigail for

00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,520
everything that every one of us

00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:12,000
do for the community really when we see

00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,800
when we

00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,720
look to different chapters not even here

00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:19,440
in brazil but when we look

00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:21,280
to the chapters that are like scattered

00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,160
all around the world each one has its

00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:25,280
history

00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:26,160
and it's so particular and all the work

00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:29,119
that we all do

00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:32,000
it's it's an inspiration it's an

00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:32,000
inspiration really

00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:39,040
how do we intend to activate in the

00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:42,240
inactive chapters well

00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:43,280
we are we are making like as i said a

00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,839
task force

00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:46,640
to see which chapters are inactive and

00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:48,960
which are

00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:51,280
actives uh especially because in brazil

00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:54,640
it's such a huge country and

00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:56,640
there are some chapters that are active

00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:58,480
but they are not registered as an

00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:01,599
official pilot dischapter

00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:04,319
so we have been working on that as well

00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:05,359
like trying to take these women who are

00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:08,720
already doing

00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:10,960
an awesome work to get in touch with

00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:12,240
pilot is global in order to have like an

00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:15,440
official email

00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:18,240
and all these kind of things and

00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:19,040
well we tweet a lot and we are all over

00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,839
the internet

00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:23,280
so when a person knows about uh pi

00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:25,280
ladies brazil

00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,640
they can like when they talk to us on

00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:29,599
facebook on instagram

00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:32,160
on twitter and we try to tell them how

00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:35,760
to create a chapter if there is a place

00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:39,119
um that it doesn't have

00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:42,160
but about activating inactive chapters

00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:43,440
it really happens when uh these people

00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:46,480
from the same city

00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:49,839
of this chapter that is inactive

00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:52,960
they reaches out and then

00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:53,599
uh well we can help them to get the

00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:56,720
check

00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:59,040
get a chapter active again but the

00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:02,480
chapters that are inactive they

00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:04,480
get activated when another girl that

00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,839
lives in the same area shows some

00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:08,079
interest

00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:09,119
i don't know if i answered your question

00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:11,200
