Description: 
	In today's Information Age large volumes of information are available in English â€“ whether it be information for competitive exams or general reading. However, many people whose primary language is Hindi or any other Indian language (or, any African language, too) are unable to access information in English. Anusaaraka (we) aims to bridge this language barrier by allowing a user to enter an English text into Anusaaraka and read it in an Indian language (or, any African language) of their choice.


I'll be talking about computer software (Anusaaraka) which renders text from one Indian language into another, and this can be applied for the African language, as well. We'll be looking briefly into the task of building an MT (machine translation) system. The core Anusaaraka output is in a language close to the target language and can be understood by the human reader after some training.
