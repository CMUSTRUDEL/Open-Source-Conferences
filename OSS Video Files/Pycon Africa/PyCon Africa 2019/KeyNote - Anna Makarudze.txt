00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:52,890
truly honored to be here

00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:57,239
I am also excited to be here

00:00:52,890 --> 00:01:00,120
just a little about myself I'm a

00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:02,850
software engineer its a bright home so

00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:05,250
I'm pretty grateful to my employer for

00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:09,900
sundar you need to be here as well as

00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:13,010
for Qatar in the events which is always

00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:16,350
I organised like a number of events

00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:19,500
Africa to Python to Bob with conference

00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:21,240
in 2016 in 2017 as well as enough of

00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,430
younger girls event and I know how

00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,439
because it is to find a hotel

00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,630
when you're organizing an event so I

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:31,259
don't take it like that right foot sided

00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:34,799
responder penguin Africa ago as change a

00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:36,990
huge number of attendees like I think

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,570
we're the biggest group coming from one

00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:43,130
company difficult rain so I'd like to

00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:43,130
thank my employer for that

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,960
I over said before you are wearing many

00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:53,850
hats one of them is being the vice

00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:58,909
president of the geography foundation

00:01:53,850 --> 00:02:02,880
and the other is being a coordinator for

00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:04,470
jumbo girls they said so I thought I

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,610
should I've been involved in the

00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:11,760
community since 2016 in various roles

00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:14,190
there's a lot of experience right that

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,349
that either is an attendee in

00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:19,170
international conference or anything

00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:22,200
organizer local international conference

00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:26,040
for my pleasure of being a fundraising

00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:29,730
coordinator for Jang bogos our 5004 by

00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:32,459
being a member of the board of directors

00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:34,470
for the jungles of the foundation so I

00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:36,870
decided to combine everything that

00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:40,769
happened during my involvement with the

00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:42,840
community and about diversity and talk

00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:46,530
about this at least our conference

00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:49,049
which is why I titled my talk diversity

00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:51,560
in text an African prospective so this

00:02:49,049 --> 00:02:51,560
is my perspective

00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:02,910
all right

00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:11,519
okay so I was saying my involvement in

00:03:09,069 --> 00:03:15,459
the various capacities gave me like

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:20,139
experience that in some instances you

00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:23,200
are teaching writing to hold that asking

00:03:20,139 --> 00:03:26,849
for money in an aside when you address

00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:31,139
Kanta you are you doing request for

00:03:26,849 --> 00:03:35,739
possession so I decided to share my

00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:38,260
experience in it in a talk entitled the

00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:40,000
hasty intake in African perspective so

00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,799
if you don't agree with what I'm going

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,409
to say it's okay it's my perspective

00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:46,510
it's not yours anyway but I think you

00:03:44,409 --> 00:03:47,260
can benefit from what I have been over

00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:49,659
the edge

00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,349
I just ang ating I am right you know

00:03:49,659 --> 00:03:53,919
what I'm saying

00:03:50,349 --> 00:03:54,639
I know we are African it's a very

00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:58,299
patriotic

00:03:54,639 --> 00:04:02,500
our nation and to our continent so I

00:03:58,299 --> 00:04:04,750
don't need to look down upon Africa or

00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:07,299
anything but I'm just sharing things

00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:10,090
that I've been and that'll also help me

00:04:07,299 --> 00:04:14,859
and help shipment area in the Python

00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:18,789
community so the open sea of my talk I'm

00:04:14,859 --> 00:04:21,280
going to give you like the motivation

00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:23,949
for my job why I said it come up with

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:26,740
this topic as well as give you a full

00:04:23,949 --> 00:04:29,199
disclosure then I also talked about the

00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:34,930
situation and the innovations that are

00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:37,690
being that you take then I'll also talk

00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:42,389
about your role as an African developer

00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:42,389
to get you to increase diversity in Ted

00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:53,650
so my motivation comes from the

00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:56,250
international conference okay I said as

00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:59,440
much mission that I've gone through I

00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:02,400
all in all this is my fate in here

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:06,910
conference conference that I attended

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:10,480
two of which way - it's bubble I wish I

00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:12,669
organized then all other eventually

00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:17,470
either in Africa or they were in Europe

00:05:12,669 --> 00:05:19,900
or the US so I also organize demo

00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:22,650
continue of last year so I also got to

00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:25,840
be involved in organizing like a

00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:29,139
European conference so I was in Africa

00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:31,229
so I left something from that experience

00:05:29,139 --> 00:05:33,280
organizing every conference like that

00:05:31,229 --> 00:05:36,100
then the other experience that I'm

00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:39,490
sharing is my interaction with the

00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:41,770
jungle partners and their diversity

00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:44,169
efforts like one of the apartments that

00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:47,470
I interact who can sleep right for their

00:05:44,169 --> 00:05:50,560
also Punta de vacas Foundation and I

00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:53,560
also interact with other partners who

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:56,200
also look who sponsor jungle adios

00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:59,140
foundation and they have their motives

00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:01,240
for doing life then the other motivation

00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:03,160
that I have is my time on the jungle for

00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,830
the Foundation Board of Directors and

00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:09,010
then otherwise all employers diversity

00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:13,180
efforts within rightful outside the

00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:17,710
computer community then are the other

00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:20,950
the major driving also a false for me is

00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:22,840
having up with this topic while the

00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:25,539
unemployment statistics we have in

00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:28,510
Africa which is the percentage of people

00:06:25,539 --> 00:06:30,130
with no jobs I don't know about your

00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:30,820
country but where I come from in

00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:34,180
Zimbabwe

00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:36,100
our unemployment rate is over 90% at

00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:38,979
most of our youth that is don't find

00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:41,080
folks within sebab so we have people who

00:06:38,979 --> 00:06:43,470
go to the university they graduate they

00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:47,560
can't be hired in their own country so

00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:50,289
we that gives me a fashion that if only

00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:53,220
Africans would know Israel if you are a

00:06:50,289 --> 00:06:55,450
developer what a gem you are

00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:57,580
irrespective of where you are not having

00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:59,969
opportunities you look for those

00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:02,610
opportunities elsewhere then the other

00:06:59,969 --> 00:07:04,439
think that right also this is - the

00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:05,039
unemployment statistics in developing

00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:08,489
panties

00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:11,249
so when I was doing my master to study

00:07:08,489 --> 00:07:14,429
management I learned some theory in

00:07:11,249 --> 00:07:17,369
economics which I didn't know existed so

00:07:14,429 --> 00:07:20,610
an employment can be described in terms

00:07:17,369 --> 00:07:22,739
of people without jobs but it can also

00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:25,110
be described in terms of jobs without

00:07:22,739 --> 00:07:27,779
people so any fears people without jobs

00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:30,719
in Africa developed nations and jobs

00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:32,879
without people so if we can work

00:07:30,719 --> 00:07:34,709
together with those nations we can

00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:37,349
actually clear test energy where our

00:07:34,709 --> 00:07:40,949
unemployment our people who are

00:07:37,349 --> 00:07:44,999
unemployed can get those jobs we don't

00:07:40,949 --> 00:07:48,749
help people so this is one one of the

00:07:44,999 --> 00:07:52,619
major reasons why I came up with the

00:07:48,749 --> 00:07:54,749
title for my talk so I'll give you a

00:07:52,619 --> 00:07:59,389
full disclosure now so the aim of my

00:07:54,749 --> 00:08:04,079
talk is not X to explore the everybody

00:07:59,389 --> 00:08:06,929
initiated is good blessed or enough so

00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:09,449
now let's look at how we judge whether

00:08:06,929 --> 00:08:12,059
the DSS is doing enough the PSS is doing

00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:14,429
enough the tech tech community is doing

00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:18,149
enough or all the employers are doing

00:08:14,429 --> 00:08:22,309
enough so my aim is to talk to them to

00:08:18,149 --> 00:08:25,469
share up my perspective and then

00:08:22,309 --> 00:08:27,209
increase thanks to the African developer

00:08:25,469 --> 00:08:29,849
so that they can do something to

00:08:27,209 --> 00:08:33,839
increase the NSC intech either for

00:08:29,849 --> 00:08:36,269
yourself or for others around you so I

00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:39,629
will not be judging whether what is

00:08:36,269 --> 00:08:41,459
being done is enough for all forever I'm

00:08:39,629 --> 00:08:45,860
just looking at you as an individual

00:08:41,459 --> 00:08:45,860
what can you do about your own situation

00:08:47,209 --> 00:08:54,420
so I like this moment when I was growing

00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:56,790
up Allah Allah is a British sitcom and

00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:59,519
there was a woman named Michelle every

00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:01,470
time she came she would say listen

00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:05,579
listen very carefully I shall say this

00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:07,589
only one so and maybe this might be the

00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:10,400
only opportunity that our gate to speak

00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:11,780
to you as a kid or figure or baby

00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:14,000
let them that I'll be speaking out be

00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:15,890
speaking on another subject so you might

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,230
be nice if you said I kept it what I'm

00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:26,600
saying because I'm only going to say is

00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:30,520
only one okay so digest you if you look

00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,520
at the picture that is it shows

00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:37,610
different angles for those who follow

00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:40,040
sign fine it's just a different angle

00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:47,090
because right they are different how

00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:49,460
they look the attention even anything

00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:50,830
about them different and when I define

00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:54,470
diversity

00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:57,020
the Oxford Dictionary defines it

00:09:54,470 --> 00:10:01,970
accountable or accounted for each body

00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:03,920
since Allah or a range of many people or

00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:04,490
things that are very different from each

00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,890
other

00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:08,780
so when we are looking at diversity in

00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:13,520
the workforce we are say we were looking

00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:18,380
at how many men or women out within an

00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:20,630
organization how many like register with

00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:21,200
it in an organization for where did they

00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:23,830
come from

00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:28,070
like here locations and stuff like that

00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:31,250
the also defines it as intelligible or

00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:34,130
the quality of or effect of including a

00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:36,050
range of many people or things like you

00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:38,570
could look at this conference how the

00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:41,870
basis it is in terms of maybe the

00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:44,180
percentage of female to note available

00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:47,330
one year of look at the diversity from

00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:49,700
tiny representations or we could look at

00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:52,790
the diversity from right areas or look

00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:55,790
at the density in terms of the positions

00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:58,520
that we have a unit hello cocina de

00:10:55,790 --> 00:11:01,690
xalapa oh are you in a managerial host

00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:05,540
so those are other ways of looking at

00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:08,960
diversity so looking at normally when

00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:12,620
people talk of the HEVC intake they look

00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:17,840
at the ratio of women combat men and the

00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:20,900
UNDP such as 2018 short does the of the

00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:23,269
global workforce they were only 28%

00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:25,730
women all over the world

00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:28,790
and when they complete that sample in

00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:32,800
Africa there were only 30 percent women

00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:32,800
so the resonance is quite low

00:11:33,699 --> 00:11:39,019
what are people in tech doing to

00:11:36,259 --> 00:11:41,029
increase diversity one of the things

00:11:39,019 --> 00:11:43,339
that people do is they offer financial

00:11:41,029 --> 00:11:45,800
aid for opportunity grants for

00:11:43,339 --> 00:11:47,749
conferences like this I told you guys

00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,819
this is my teaching aid conference that

00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:51,619
I attended and this is the first

00:11:49,819 --> 00:11:54,579
conference today I think that our things

00:11:51,619 --> 00:11:57,290
from that by my employer all the other

00:11:54,579 --> 00:12:00,829
change that I've attended outside see

00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:03,290
Bob with my agenda them on financial aid

00:12:00,829 --> 00:12:05,230
so if you want a change jump up on us

00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:08,089
you can access that constraint

00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:10,069
differently if only the only concern

00:12:08,089 --> 00:12:12,379
that you need to meet is you apply for

00:12:10,069 --> 00:12:14,720
financial aid inside you can also attend

00:12:12,379 --> 00:12:16,519
jungle from Europe on financial aid in

00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,559
Glen Watts 1/2 then you can also add

00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:21,379
things like pythons all over the world

00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:23,540
if you just applied for financial aid I

00:12:21,379 --> 00:12:27,439
struggled I know many people who have

00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:28,910
also did like Jessica for example she

00:12:27,439 --> 00:12:31,519
has conceived any constraints like me

00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:33,920
and we have all been going on those

00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,339
unfair in your age no I was in jungle

00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,920
corner

00:12:34,339 --> 00:12:39,379
I didn't jungle corner appreciate you

00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:42,049
will be attending jump up on us again so

00:12:39,379 --> 00:12:44,899
it's one way of conferences inspiring

00:12:42,049 --> 00:12:47,540
that people from underrepresented

00:12:44,899 --> 00:12:49,490
communities can attain those conferences

00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:51,139
and Lane and take something back to

00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:54,019
their community and she does our

00:12:51,139 --> 00:12:56,749
facilities that we can all take

00:12:54,019 --> 00:12:59,199
advantage of and use them to advance our

00:12:56,749 --> 00:12:59,199
carriers

00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:12,540
okay the other thing that conferences do

00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:14,850
is they offer with a mentorship to

00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:17,910
encourage like first time speakers so if

00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:20,490
you want to get your cat fights any

00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:22,560
Python don't be like people who can

00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:26,520
mentor you how can you doubt you trust

00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:28,500
your proposal how do you how do you come

00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:32,430
up with your slides and you can take it

00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:34,860
may take advantage of those not take

00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:38,160
advantage but you can make use of the

00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:39,990
availability of those mentors to submit

00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,960
a proposal and also take part in a

00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:45,690
conference there are also people who are

00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:48,510
like Davis to advocate these people are

00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:52,290
pushing like footprints organization or

00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:57,120
they are hired by organizations simply

00:13:52,290 --> 00:14:01,380
to be the Advocate well what they do is

00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:03,720
they identified talents or speakers who

00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:05,850
come from other issues and underserved

00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:10,100
communities to be either part of a

00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:10,100
community or to join the action body

00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:16,140
then the Python community itself here

00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:19,350
for many organizations who are doing a

00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:21,750
lot to increase diversity the burdens of

00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:24,600
the foundation the jungle social

00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:27,900
foundation jungle tells in silence

00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:30,660
these are organization we promote

00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:32,490
diversity in many ways for jackal super

00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:34,380
for anything to support a conference be

00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:36,510
nice you know what you are going to do

00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:38,820
to make sure that to your conference is

00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:40,340
accessible to another two populations

00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:43,080
from and as you stated

00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:44,970
population so you need to show them we

00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:47,100
are going to reach out to them offer

00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:50,880
financial aid then they can support your

00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:52,980
constraint and that we have assessments

00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:55,050
on the Jumbos of the foundation website

00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:58,770
Jabberjaw is an organization that

00:14:55,050 --> 00:15:00,930
empowers women to organize 303 one-day

00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:03,720
workshops to introduce women to

00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:08,130
programming and then pilot is a

00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:11,430
mentorship group for ladies who got with

00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:13,890
python which helped them grow in their

00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:16,320
are in their programming Jenny mainly

00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:19,170
was talking about religious beliefs it's

00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:21,899
a chapter of pilots so already

00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:27,839
if so many initiatives that are being

00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:31,519
done to increase diversity in fact then

00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:34,110
the tech community this refers to

00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,940
everyone will gather here you're part of

00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:38,699
a tech community there's a tech

00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:41,610
community on Twitter or on LinkedIn and

00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:43,889
some of them they resent like which fell

00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:46,860
apart or friends if you post on Twitter

00:15:43,889 --> 00:15:49,260
that I am looking for for a job and here

00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:52,800
people they can actually modify your

00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:55,410
tweet and retreatants tell people that

00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:58,079
you are looking there are people who

00:15:55,410 --> 00:16:00,329
actually market opportunities to their

00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:04,829
friends and network I learned about

00:16:00,329 --> 00:16:06,449
right go from Danielle but we already

00:16:04,829 --> 00:16:08,699
knew each other on pizza

00:16:06,449 --> 00:16:11,760
so this is the tech community that

00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:14,279
actually people are advocating ray

00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:16,290
Daniels are forgetting for days anything

00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:18,779
in price for he reached out to need to

00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:21,230
find University Zimbabwe in other parts

00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:22,920
of the world so and you also cheated I

00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:26,010
speaking to

00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:27,480
I was speaking to someone being afraid

00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:32,880
family it's my fault

00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:35,010
oh it's Mila who responded to a tweet

00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:40,709
from Daniel that we are hiring

00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:45,750
oh it's my polite yes so if you can find

00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:50,550
a job on Pizza if you electric go in a

00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:52,410
tech community and then I they also like

00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:55,260
people would spread good word about

00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:57,060
speakers or a developers from minority

00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:58,800
communities that people who can tell

00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:00,480
they I'm coming up with a list of goods

00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:04,020
because from Africa do you know anyone

00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,760
and he was a third person name and from

00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:07,620
there you can actually be invited

00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:10,799
because iPhone friends and stuff like

00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:12,809
that so there's a lot of things going on

00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:18,000
within detector minnici to increase

00:17:12,809 --> 00:17:22,679
diversity then I take companies who

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:25,679
sponsor events or all nonprofits as you

00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:28,370
can see a path - Africa is Persico

00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:32,120
because of responders that we have i

00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:35,120
temperatures running well being run by

00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:36,860
if from money that comes from Japanese

00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:40,910
work on that in a nonprofit like jungle

00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:44,380
girls then they come and sometimes they

00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:47,540
hire like a city or a developer advocate

00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:49,910
or a talent acquisition manager and they

00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:56,750
are all used to find like talent from

00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:59,900
all divers who then there are people who

00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:01,970
are also like a headhunting salad via

00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:03,590
social media such as Lincoln I

00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:05,390
personally have been approached by many

00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:07,940
companies through LinkedIn so this is

00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:10,520
what is happening we still they take

00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:13,970
community and being done by tech tamales

00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:17,150
I think I should just share like

00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:19,070
diversity because in bright folk we are

00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:22,240
not happy about our figures but at least

00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:25,160
we are doing something to increase like

00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:29,780
diversity within the combine so right

00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:32,179
for as many employees but the most one

00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:35,900
thing the fun takes for me that if you

00:18:32,179 --> 00:18:38,300
like employees from 29 29 countries in

00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:39,890
five continents and the only continent

00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:42,920
you have been hired from so far is

00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:46,990
Australia and then in Africa we have

00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:50,120
employees from Tamara will be ships Pina

00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:53,179
Nigeria South Africa in Ghana in

00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:54,520
Zimbabwe then 33 percent of our staff

00:18:53,179 --> 00:18:58,330
are women

00:18:54,520 --> 00:19:03,020
43 percent of our leadership stuff women

00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:06,080
58 percent of 90 crows chicken by women

00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:09,200
and then only 23 percent of our tech

00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:11,750
roles acute by women so this is an area

00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:14,690
that we need to improve on and if you

00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:17,330
are a woman you joined watch the opacity

00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:21,470
Zuider a significant price point is

00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:28,280
higher probably you can help us reach

00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:31,370
our excited then we are local Python

00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:33,500
communities many African countries now

00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:36,650
if I actually fight on communities and

00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:40,550
event like Jungle Girl credit be charted

00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:43,880
pipe of GCC when he said it organizing -

00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:45,670
Zimbabwe we can't reach our main our

00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:48,290
major focus was

00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:49,880
providing for Piper very fast because

00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:54,560
there were no jobs for asking see Bob

00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:57,190
would and that was our main goal and I

00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:59,480
am happy that he changed most of the

00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:01,970
developers that I know that we studied

00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:04,130
when we organize payments Bob I know how

00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:07,040
much workers and if you saw the chimp

00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:09,470
that introduced associate y mae'r or the

00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:12,050
other about yeah they are waiting for

00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:13,670
something much combined we might not

00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:17,150
ever get anything directly to do with

00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:19,940
they are being hired but that we are

00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:22,730
happy to say that our goal was made to

00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:26,630
provide employment for our community

00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:29,390
through introducing them through the

00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:33,470
global community so adding an African

00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:35,840
developer Jew to increase diversity in

00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:39,530
tech I've already spoken of what others

00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:41,710
are doing everybody else around us we

00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:45,140
are making an effort to include Africa

00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:50,420
in the intake but what are we doing as

00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:52,850
an individual in case you wonder you do

00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:56,180
I mean when I say an African developer

00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:58,310
I just mean everyone who is here if you

00:20:56,180 --> 00:21:01,610
know anyone who is 14 you an African

00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:06,920
developer this water is of jungle juice

00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:09,290
Kumasi from from the a Donna so anyone

00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:12,560
with Jada an African developer and you

00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:18,010
can do something about your about

00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:22,430
diversity in sex in general so ideally

00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:25,160
what would happen local meetups like

00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:29,930
while ages younger girls to be helping

00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:33,410
us like I get improve our you could join

00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:37,070
like wailing this in the local in in a

00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:39,650
niche now first talk about mainly that

00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:42,890
you can join conferences like this and

00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:44,780
also like help us improve our skills we

00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:47,540
can also be developing you on you

00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:50,210
learning at your own time and then

00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:55,210
ultimately you become a software

00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:58,160
engineer so this is I do write and

00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:59,090
ideally we should all be waiting for our

00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,519
local combined

00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:04,940
or in the end up renewal in our own

00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:06,889
country that's an ideal situation but if

00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:09,019
you are coming from my background that

00:22:06,889 --> 00:22:10,730
might not be possible because it's not

00:22:09,019 --> 00:22:13,159
easy to be dominant up to you is you

00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:15,679
don't have money that you only and it's

00:22:13,159 --> 00:22:17,600
difficult for you to top of it I stopped

00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:19,580
you seen your own company if you can

00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:23,179
even you cannot pray transferred for you

00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:26,240
to get into town so why did he want to

00:22:23,179 --> 00:22:28,070
be working for our own companies or

00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,350
working for local companies in our own

00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:37,580
country probably it's might not be

00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:39,980
possible so what should we do in 2016 a

00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:42,230
jungle go straight you said quote and in

00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:44,210
fact report in which they measure the

00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:48,830
impact that the jungle could help in

00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:53,360
doing business in certain in 26 in 2014

00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:56,480
and the interesting figures are on the

00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:58,940
survey that was done of 600 we know that

00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:02,450
21 percent of participants we're now

00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:04,970
working in tech and 79 percent of the

00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:08,840
women that person in this survey who is

00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:11,809
to lainey support after attending I

00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:14,659
think we jungle dose petrol so if we

00:23:11,809 --> 00:23:17,960
fight fight on communities in Africa

00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:19,340
could be a more like to Vasia the in

00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:23,450
fact that you are making

00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:25,909
yes I hate to see after may be organized

00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:29,240
in size jungle goes bike shop after

00:23:25,909 --> 00:23:30,679
meandering women women AO any other

00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:33,440
developer in silage

00:23:30,679 --> 00:23:35,720
fight through pilots how many of those

00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:38,299
developers actually getting to be

00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:39,830
employed this would be exactly what you

00:23:38,299 --> 00:23:42,590
should not be just about getting

00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:45,619
sponsorship money from organizations to

00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:47,990
help a flamboyant event and then as end

00:23:45,619 --> 00:23:50,960
of the day no developers are being

00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:53,960
change out for the community you know

00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:56,659
what what you end up happening is that

00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:59,330
we might define this difficult to find

00:23:56,659 --> 00:24:02,240
sponsors for our event in Africa before

00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:06,679
not going to target producing developers

00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:10,389
that can actually be hired meaning to

00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:12,350
say our adult way to go as a community

00:24:10,389 --> 00:24:16,170
even else

00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:18,180
where after attending a Python getting

00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:20,220
exposed to or everything that's not oh

00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:23,220
they took that's not going through your

00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:25,560
goal should be to become a software

00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:27,030
developer all right you take up maybe a

00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:29,010
related protein shake

00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:32,370
so that we increase diversity you take

00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:36,000
this is not we are just a Mitch out

00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:38,220
where we come we meet we talk we eat in

00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,470
Zimbabwe if you are colliding event age

00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:43,950
there is no food it's courageous people

00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:47,580
from coming and you have like a no

00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:50,130
channel and my mind is it's my desire

00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:52,320
and my wish if we put like take it

00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:56,160
seriously this event and develop our

00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:59,040
skills so that by the end in five years

00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:01,020
then our developers will help me please

00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:04,080
and some of the stories would be saying

00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:06,870
I first lens to coach at PyCon Africa in

00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:08,670
a jungle dose workshop or I think it did

00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:10,920
not stay in our introduces I was

00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:12,420
introduced to quote back on Africa and

00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:15,600
I've been learning through the local

00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:18,870
communities man where you meet now I'm

00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:20,370
waiting ever got has done that of course

00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:22,860
the women are coming from different

00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:24,570
backgrounds but it's possible for a

00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:26,760
fraction of the people that we

00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:29,070
introduced to programming to actually

00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:35,570
end up laying up there waiting in check

00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:38,760
and that should be our ultimate spoke so

00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:40,830
in case you think that I'm just saying

00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:43,970
this because now I'm working for

00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:48,060
rightful and things are good for me I

00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:50,640
say this you effortlessly for an African

00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:52,560
developer because it's not a boy I was

00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,030
just waiting for breakfast on basically

00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:57,060
everything the same challenges that you

00:25:54,030 --> 00:26:01,740
are facing so if you're in our state we

00:25:57,060 --> 00:26:04,290
have a in Africa one thing that we have

00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:07,730
in Africa that we are growing a growing

00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:10,740
population the moment we get married

00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:14,580
it's like it's automatic that you have

00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:16,710
children right we reproduce with another

00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:19,950
children may be different in myself one

00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:21,780
or two but this difference from

00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:24,059
developed nations if I can get married

00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:25,710
inside that not me

00:26:24,059 --> 00:26:28,529
and you are not going to adopt either

00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:32,460
and they make that to say in Africa is a

00:26:28,529 --> 00:26:34,200
growing population the better morning

00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:37,919
keynote speaker says we are a growing

00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:40,080
population I like that but it's really

00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:43,080
erasing the strength that I thought we

00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:45,210
have we have growing population and it's

00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:48,239
a strength in that we have human

00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:49,830
resources available and if you checked

00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:50,519
in the morning when people are actually

00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:55,080
dying

00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:58,139
most of us are diversified so we have a

00:26:55,080 --> 00:27:00,450
population that can be higher so humans

00:26:58,139 --> 00:27:04,169
versus Jane Africa and most of us are

00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:06,629
educated and we have we are either a do

00:27:04,169 --> 00:27:08,700
the way we are raised that you are you

00:27:06,629 --> 00:27:10,469
go through a primary school high school

00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:12,599
you go to university you get a degree

00:27:10,469 --> 00:27:15,809
and then you look for it so we already

00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:18,389
have and I am slow we have like Kavita

00:27:15,809 --> 00:27:21,539
says for me the size student in this

00:27:18,389 --> 00:27:23,789
conference from the midst of bad because

00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:25,979
that's how are we arranged and other

00:27:23,789 --> 00:27:29,190
things is we are not very hard making

00:27:25,979 --> 00:27:30,419
our difficult environment means for us

00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:33,299
to be hard way guys

00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:35,129
whether it's manual or just being

00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:38,039
focused on your way because you know I

00:27:35,129 --> 00:27:41,580
have a need that I need to meet if I got

00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:43,349
work hard and fail my my studies my

00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:45,659
parents and about sending it back to

00:27:43,349 --> 00:27:47,159
school and if you notice both of us one

00:27:45,659 --> 00:27:49,739
left option which when you are sent

00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:52,320
through University why because we never

00:27:49,739 --> 00:27:53,879
saw this to beg that's kind I so

00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:59,580
naturally were hard work on anything

00:27:53,879 --> 00:28:03,450
change that the other thing is we are

00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:05,059
good at hustling you know trying to make

00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:08,309
ends meet

00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:11,580
that's something that we can do and it's

00:28:08,309 --> 00:28:14,429
a strength that makes us good wake up if

00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:18,330
we get the opportunity to wake but what

00:28:14,429 --> 00:28:22,649
now our weakness is one of our mega lack

00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:26,999
of exposure nobody we are defined by

00:28:22,649 --> 00:28:29,339
what we see because we we grow up we go

00:28:26,999 --> 00:28:32,249
to through primary education high school

00:28:29,339 --> 00:28:33,210
and university and what we see can

00:28:32,249 --> 00:28:36,690
actually to find

00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:42,240
well if you are in the back with the

00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:43,230
current situation after people graduate

00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,660
they are no jobs

00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:49,050
so everybody is telling something either

00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:51,180
you go into Baba right now and Industry

00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:53,550
somebody will be selling that it's that

00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:56,130
I tell you that somebody's telling a

00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:58,350
time for selling a car charger is a

00:28:56,130 --> 00:29:01,800
great person there's either that the

00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:05,220
driver was writing a poem or ohx is a

00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:12,480
great present why because things are

00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:15,030
difficult and because we are because we

00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:18,150
like exposure we are yet them just

00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:21,960
limited by what he sees and we identify

00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:24,660
for our second thing we also have are

00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:27,780
things that threaten us all so when one

00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:30,990
of them is provides its my like a

00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:33,660
typical state saying that when you are

00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:36,180
running the epic events for the past few

00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:38,940
days here in finding those event so I

00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:41,700
did miss the funicular suiting for

00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:43,680
people to attend like local Mitchum so

00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:45,750
that was my choice attend a local meetup

00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:48,120
but they don't watch but because they

00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:49,980
can't afford to then other challenge

00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:54,000
made depending on where you are it might

00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:56,070
be Internet connectivity English may not

00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,190
be stable or if you are coming from

00:29:56,070 --> 00:30:01,860
suburban power outage and probably I

00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:16,100
think now with Nigeria lastly there is

00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:17,430
an issue eh of power outages it happened

00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:19,950
anyway

00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:22,050
but Oh despite all that they are also

00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:25,230
opportunities that are facing us and one

00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:29,070
of them is we can make this a global

00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:32,040
network like I already said or India

00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:33,930
drop opportunities while we great job in

00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:36,210
our own countries they are companies

00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:38,460
which are higher because they have jobs

00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:42,240
but no people who can take off those

00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:44,040
jobs in the economy they they are also

00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,450
like local energy ownership

00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:48,000
opportunities

00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:50,280
with your ideas most of the things that

00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,750
might be soft we have many problems in

00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:54,510
Africa which we can actually address

00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:57,950
using tech and it's up to you to choose

00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:57,950
a beverage that you are going to take

00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:12,330
but despite all these you can still use

00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:16,050
your own bridges what do I mean by using

00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:17,670
this dude in your own bridges the first

00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:19,650
thing that you can do is conference

00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:22,080
participation and most of us already

the Joseph means memberships you can

00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:31,930
either nominate yourself or nominate

jungle community and he also gets to

00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:46,690
contribute to the jungle projects but

00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:48,940
when you nominate yourself gonna

00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:53,460
nominate somebody you know you need help

00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:55,510
you have to say something that you think

00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:58,540
qualifies him to become a member

00:33:55,510 --> 00:34:00,520
birthdays of membership he says is

00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:02,530
something which comes by your

00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:05,140
contribution I to the jungle community

00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:10,899
either through code or through advancing

00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:13,690
a true advancing face of jungle in the

00:34:10,899 --> 00:34:16,240
community so you need to kind of put a

00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:18,070
motivation for why you think you should

00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:24,399
join the mailing list or why that person

00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:27,159
is doing then after using your profile

00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:30,250
you can then decide on whether do you

00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:32,560
want too much weight or relocation for

00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:35,110
me the location is complex I don't want

00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:37,389
to do with the visa and a work permit

00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:40,120
process but if you are willing to do

00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:43,480
that then you you can also apply for

00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:45,850
jobs that a free location for remote is

00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:48,280
much easier because it only requires the

00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:50,859
conduct in you and organisation in

00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:53,109
setting up your remote office

00:34:50,859 --> 00:34:56,609
you can work from home or you can rent

00:34:53,109 --> 00:34:56,609
an office it's entirely up to you

00:34:57,239 --> 00:35:06,459
then apply you can apply by responding

00:35:02,049 --> 00:35:08,410
to online job postings but we say we

00:35:06,459 --> 00:35:13,539
can't send either via Facebook Twitter

00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:17,079
link or can be sent via mailing list and

00:35:13,539 --> 00:35:19,209
if you see a job posting this response

00:35:17,079 --> 00:35:23,279
to recruit us or a challenge our

00:35:19,209 --> 00:35:23,279
completion manager if they approach you

00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:30,249
you can also a response to postings by

00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:32,890
friends or network then if a job is sent

00:35:30,249 --> 00:35:34,839
on the mailing list please do not

00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:39,039
respond to the person who sent it

00:35:34,839 --> 00:35:41,380
especially if they gave you an email

00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:43,299
address you as you respond to and if you

00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:45,999
are not ready to interview yet you can

00:35:43,299 --> 00:35:47,859
please don't respond viewed on your

00:35:45,999 --> 00:35:52,809
skills and then when you are ready to

00:35:47,859 --> 00:35:56,079
respond respond to pay today to the

00:35:52,809 --> 00:35:58,809
interview then interviewing the

00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:00,219
interview body's process varies with

00:35:58,809 --> 00:36:02,529
time but with the comment that you are

00:36:00,219 --> 00:36:06,249
applied with you but you should be

00:36:02,529 --> 00:36:09,729
prepared for a phone or phone interview

00:36:06,249 --> 00:36:13,839
or a video call which can be before or

00:36:09,729 --> 00:36:21,130
after the coaching person so anything

00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:23,019
can happen then some companies may ask

00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:25,329
you technical questions during that

00:36:23,019 --> 00:36:27,910
appointing them so you need to prepare

00:36:25,329 --> 00:36:31,079
Erica lastly for your either depending

00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:35,380
on the job that you are applying for

00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:38,259
then in the quadric industry do your

00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:40,119
best to complete for the tech project

00:36:38,259 --> 00:36:43,690
just and ensure that you meet our

00:36:40,119 --> 00:36:47,709
requirement then practice you're likely

00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:50,319
to get a project that should aim to

00:36:47,709 --> 00:36:52,359
submit your own time this is less

00:36:50,319 --> 00:36:55,140
stressful than whiteboard coding

00:36:52,359 --> 00:36:59,739
industries of a default so if you can

00:36:55,140 --> 00:37:01,390
get an employer who who says she came to

00:36:59,739 --> 00:37:03,519
the protein and there is a video on time

00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:04,310
those are better to taco than the ones

00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:08,810
that you

00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:10,970
toggle imitates on the phone if you and

00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:14,600
then is supposed to intervene channel

00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:16,880
successful do not display just continue

00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:19,490
working on your questions and I'll

00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:22,430
continue of using your bridges continue

00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:25,040
I apply for either position and even if

00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:28,040
you say you an interview that is no yet

00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:30,110
you can say again after six months or or

00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:34,280
after a a when you feel you have

00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:37,490
improved your skills or if if it's a

00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:40,970
fudging project like bright brows

00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:42,560
talking to other engine yet they can

00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:44,960
actually allow you to they give you

00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:50,000
feedback and if you can fix you your

00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:52,130
error and responsibility feedback you

00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:57,170
see you can still reapplied so it's best

00:37:52,130 --> 00:38:00,620
a company that is hiring you then if you

00:37:57,170 --> 00:38:03,020
are successful negotiate and accept the

00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:05,540
offer then you work out they fired

00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:07,940
paperwork and then you need to also like

00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:09,530
figure out you're waiting environments

00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:11,990
because it's critical for your success

00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:14,750
so if you're coming from a country's

00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:16,040
very poor that like me you need to find

00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:19,190
how you are going to take up the

00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:21,710
conference that you need to figure out

00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:24,350
like you are waiting hours what time are

00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:26,270
you going to wait for us in brightful

00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:30,320
there's a certain time that we have to

00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:34,280
be like online at the time so we are

00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:38,570
just depending on your client or you

00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:41,420
might be to be online pin 7 in 11 p.m.

00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:44,570
for some teams my time and some people

00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:46,520
okay may find them be online maybe after

00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:48,710
coffee midnight it's something that you

00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:50,660
have to figure out and if you have good

00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:52,580
for it so you need to figure out you're

00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:58,790
waiting environment nobody Utica alter

00:38:52,580 --> 00:39:00,770
for you then when you start working

00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:04,460
mostly one of these that you need to be

00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:06,560
prepared for is to be open to diversity

00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:08,210
need to accept your colleagues because

00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:10,870
we are coming from different backgrounds

00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:12,980
right for a 29 people from 29 countries

00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:16,060
we have different religious backgrounds

00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:18,020
we have different social backgrounds and

00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:19,970
the way we see things are

00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:22,640
so steadiness only means that's my

00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:24,860
perspective is right or that the other

00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:27,440
person is wrong and we need to be able

00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:30,380
to accommodate the other and you also

00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:33,350
needs to be like very plenty to be

00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:35,360
flexible and some dancer is flexible so

00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:37,730
that you can be able to fit in a team

00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:41,420
I've already mentioned the time the time

00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:43,850
differences that we have care for and it

00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:45,920
requires someone with flexible and you

00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:47,720
also need to be able to select this

00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:50,180
means that you can also be corrected

00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:53,540
when you are wrong and stop and take

00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:55,790
criticism in a positive manner instead

00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:58,460
of searching the better we ask you to

00:39:55,790 --> 00:40:00,020
awake somebody's doing your egg and

00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:01,760
saying you need to polish up doesn't

00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:03,230
mean that they don't like you it's just

00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:05,330
the fact that we need to correct

00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:07,190
something before that before we can be

00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:09,500
accepted so you need to be very very

00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:11,630
flexible in terms of that and then you

00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:14,930
need to find a way to overcome your

00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:17,540
barriers like I already said the

00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:20,150
incident bias that we have like one of

00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:23,240
the things that I I see that most of us

00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:25,010
okay I struggle with it and I was

00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:27,920
talking to other people telling most

00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:31,630
people don't think they as much enough

00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:34,580
or I'm not confident I I realize that

00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:36,950
most people both times I wonder why

00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:39,109
people respect me so much first I don't

00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:41,510
see the achievements that they think I

00:40:39,109 --> 00:40:44,180
have made in the way they're I may cry

00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:46,970
sometimes I wonder if his humility or if

00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:49,010
it's actually a so festive issue and

00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:49,850
it's something that we have to like get

00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:51,890
off of me

00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:54,470
what people actually are approaching you

00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:57,859
and you do they really mean it are they

00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:59,600
genuine or you know and determining that

00:40:57,859 --> 00:41:01,070
sometimes people actually mean

00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:03,320
meaningful they say good things about

00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:06,650
you any something that he like needs to

00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:13,460
get to adjust to when you work with

00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:15,109
other people then my personal experience

00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:17,510
with remote working I started working

00:41:15,109 --> 00:41:20,200
remotely for younger girls foundation

00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:22,670
and I found that I I love the

00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:26,780
flexibility that comes with remote

00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:28,250
working I choose the hours that I want

00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:31,210
to make and then I communicate with my

00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:31,210
team and

00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:36,670
and yet I also miss tupola requires a

00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:39,790
balance between work and family and that

00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:42,790
that is my responsibility so I need to

00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:44,920
plan my my tastes in such a way that I

00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:50,079
still live like a social life after

00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:52,890
working but it removes also they needs

00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:56,829
to community to commute to the office I

00:41:52,890 --> 00:42:01,240
love and I've done especially in

00:41:56,829 --> 00:42:02,950
Zimbabwe in Windham so filling the

00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:04,810
coldest days people would complain that

00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:07,329
it's very cold going in the mornings and

00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:11,770
evenings I didn't do that because I work

00:42:07,329 --> 00:42:14,380
from home I have a visa so I like that I

00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:16,510
just like the need for not having to pay

00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:19,839
transferred money to get away and I

00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:21,339
don't need to get into an office and I

00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:23,349
don't need to dress up you know for the

00:42:21,339 --> 00:42:26,020
office because I'm reading the office so

00:42:23,349 --> 00:42:28,150
I can check it I want a job that makes

00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:30,040
like that when I ever get your cold

00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:36,069
drink I send out which is the best

00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:38,920
people see is like okay so I like I love

00:42:36,069 --> 00:42:41,859
that flexibility then I also love that

00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:45,700
he pays well I call it the most paint

00:42:41,859 --> 00:42:48,819
job that I get see I graduated in 2009

00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:51,250
and I still have raided my chance yeah

00:42:48,819 --> 00:42:56,130
waiting experienced escape and great

00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:56,130
quite diverse range of the raf yet and

00:42:57,930 --> 00:43:03,790
they're paying me in a global using club

00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:06,880
all red while this I'm living in

00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:09,040
Zimbabwe we had a weaker currency and

00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:11,290
there is an advantage so my man actually

00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:17,430
buys more than somebody who's living in

00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:20,260
the US and I appreciate that and then

00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:20,829
whenever things remotely like I am doing

00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:22,569
now

00:43:20,829 --> 00:43:25,890
they were think that we need to be sure

00:43:22,569 --> 00:43:30,910
of is that you don't burn your bridges

00:43:25,890 --> 00:43:33,329
what do I mean by that when I I got

00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:37,839
hired in five right back in December

00:43:33,329 --> 00:43:39,819
2018 studied genuine 2019 I have given a

00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:42,190
jungle girl foundation noticed that out

00:43:39,819 --> 00:43:44,280
I think out I thought out believing them

00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:47,490
somewhere on a broom a

00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:51,420
if the fundraising quoted but I got

00:43:47,490 --> 00:43:53,130
hired before that so or now or laughing

00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:54,720
that's I was very used to wind out in

00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:57,300
vitro any price quote because city

00:43:54,720 --> 00:44:00,660
4minute grateful other company but i was

00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:03,180
not using me and I considered them what

00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:05,520
all eyes are my friend and I couldn't

00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:08,460
just like both of them so what I did in

00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:11,400
presenting my bath my bridge is need my

00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:13,380
instead of saying well okay I was

00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:15,300
waiting for you first time for two hours

00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:17,670
per month now I have a full-time job I

00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:19,590
no longer need you find what you can do

00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:21,570
it your fund or anything I decided to

00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:26,030
stay only as a volunteer the other thing

00:44:21,570 --> 00:44:28,620
that I did when I was before I got

00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:31,440
foundation I was volunteering with the

00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:33,540
jsf and when I got hired by Junko so

00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:35,280
they said I didn't sleep my person in

00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:37,650
the theater because now I got a paying

00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:39,950
job you might take this lightly but I

00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:43,280
was it like this like five years ago or

00:44:39,950 --> 00:44:49,130
ten years ago and I started working I

00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:51,650
worked for several companies and were in

00:44:49,130 --> 00:44:55,050
2014-2015 after I finished my masters

00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:57,180
and I was thinking I wish someone can I

00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:59,250
join what can I do without my failure I

00:44:57,180 --> 00:45:03,270
found such none of the comments that I

00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:05,970
wait for between 2009 and 2013 I was

00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:07,860
afraid to go to them one of the reasons

00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:09,660
was I knew that those who checked me

00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:12,540
because I was one person we had a

00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:15,120
prejudice hope if I get both I get

00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:18,030
another job and I probably give you

00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:22,110
three days but if I did and most people

00:45:18,030 --> 00:45:26,430
do that I did that if most of the jobs

00:45:22,110 --> 00:45:28,410
that I work for if I resign maybe I give

00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:30,600
you one one X notice or I will resign

00:45:28,410 --> 00:45:34,320
after already studied another job so

00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:36,390
he's doing that is in my Chua

00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:39,000
you are bearing your bridges you will

00:45:36,390 --> 00:45:41,370
need them later is doing that later in

00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:43,620
life and if you are working in the local

00:45:41,370 --> 00:45:46,050
community you don't want to burn your

00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:48,390
bridges because the East Peter you can

00:45:46,050 --> 00:45:51,620
just charge for PETA end up at one time

00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:54,300
so you need to be very careful about

00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:54,750
your bridges when you start working and

00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:57,960
teasy

00:45:54,750 --> 00:46:02,190
waiting are well for you

00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:04,650
then in conclusion if this is my

00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:07,170
perspective I feel Africans are equally

00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:08,940
responsible for anything scientific as

00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:10,859
you take by making sure that they are

00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:13,950
not and are represented in the tech

00:46:10,859 --> 00:46:16,619
space be the next diversity attendees

00:46:13,950 --> 00:46:18,989
speaker or oh hi whether it's a

00:46:16,619 --> 00:46:21,329
conference you can I be the next day

00:46:18,989 --> 00:46:24,809
basically I change your speaker people

00:46:21,329 --> 00:46:27,690
except not because it's bad but they are

00:46:24,809 --> 00:46:29,549
willing to accept today I said you're

00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:31,440
choked because they want you have an

00:46:29,549 --> 00:46:32,759
African speaker at that conference and

00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:35,099
they are willing to pay those expenses

00:46:32,759 --> 00:46:38,160
for you to come to that explain that

00:46:35,099 --> 00:46:41,039
country he said it's a good thing you

00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:42,479
make sure you wait together with the

00:46:41,039 --> 00:46:44,009
conference organizers on one of the

00:46:42,479 --> 00:46:46,079
things that I realized when we were

00:46:44,009 --> 00:46:48,269
organizing Django could you not feel 18

00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:51,119
what they've always a complain that

00:46:48,269 --> 00:46:53,969
their future Africans because the jump

00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:55,410
on us and jump on you know but it

00:46:53,969 --> 00:46:57,839
certainly certainly the fault of the

00:46:55,410 --> 00:47:00,390
organizers but sometimes when you are

00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:05,989
looking for that is because and you have

00:47:00,390 --> 00:47:09,469
115 proposals and from the six of them

00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:12,390
from Africa and Asia you cannot really

00:47:09,469 --> 00:47:15,150
expect to find Pacifica's from Africa

00:47:12,390 --> 00:47:18,450
invest because from Asia when they when

00:47:15,150 --> 00:47:21,359
the submissions are also low so we need

00:47:18,450 --> 00:47:23,849
to work together with Dhokla organizes

00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:27,359
both French and submit proposals we need

00:47:23,849 --> 00:47:29,579
to like work together with companies

00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:31,799
that are willing to increase the

00:47:29,579 --> 00:47:36,569
identities and become the next diversity

00:47:31,799 --> 00:47:38,819
high and then before I end my talk I

00:47:36,569 --> 00:47:42,569
don't we should know that price for

00:47:38,819 --> 00:47:45,119
desiring our motto is research in higher

00:47:42,569 --> 00:47:47,160
global so we don't care where you're

00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:51,499
from we are hiring if you are looking

00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:51,499
for your next watch job consider right

00:47:53,440 --> 00:48:02,340
I see everyone have time for questions

00:47:58,510 --> 00:48:02,340
but yes we are

00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:15,870
okay so I think we actually are going to

00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:19,440
have time for one or two very short

00:48:15,870 --> 00:48:28,310
questions not comments question does

00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:28,310
anyone have a question yeah very short

00:48:37,970 --> 00:48:47,110
thanks for amazing because in that I

00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,110
wanted to ask is

00:48:52,359 --> 00:48:56,740
one could you speak up a little bit

00:48:58,089 --> 00:49:05,300
hello

00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:10,960
okay I'll say and waiting for mom does

00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:15,220
that not affect you environment like

00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:19,760
doesn't sometimes working for mommy feel

00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:23,089
through it end up not feeling like yeah

00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:25,220
yeah hope anymore because of that tends

00:49:23,089 --> 00:49:27,490
environment I don't know if you get what

00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:34,819
I'm asking

00:49:27,490 --> 00:49:37,430
okay I think I do but okay

00:49:34,819 --> 00:49:38,150
were you for rightful for waiting for

00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:41,839
home

00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:45,550
the one thing that right for emphasize

00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:48,740
that you see take it like outside

00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:51,890
rightful so many applicants video files

00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:55,220
and I much anything like reprimanded

00:49:51,890 --> 00:49:57,440
awaiting more time fifty hour because

00:49:55,220 --> 00:50:00,740
right for a message that is quick like

00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:04,960
40 hours so if we talk about 40 hours

00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:08,000
for that week I think it removes that

00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:10,369
feeling that we have like working from

00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,260
home can give tension but it's a matter

00:50:10,369 --> 00:50:14,420
of finding a dress that you call your

00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:16,609
office you wake when you are done with

00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:21,400
your eight hours per day you move out of

00:50:16,609 --> 00:50:21,400
that coffees in you go to other means

00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:27,339
one question

00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:40,330
so I asked this every once in a while

00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:44,099
but ask it again publicly what

00:50:40,330 --> 00:50:47,630
due to increase our diversity members

00:50:44,099 --> 00:50:47,630
we're trying to checkboxes

00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:19,660
okay okay I okay I buy I feel we need to

00:51:13,290 --> 00:51:21,640
probably result more all problem publish

00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:23,530
a diversity statement that we are

00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:28,650
working towards increasing biodiversity

00:51:23,530 --> 00:51:32,260
in brightful we are getting too high

00:51:28,650 --> 00:51:35,050
relief populations that if you

00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:37,780
underrepresented like in our instance we

00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:40,060
want I am or women I think that public

00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:44,060
statement you actually I can encourage

00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:55,380
more people to join our team

00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:55,380
