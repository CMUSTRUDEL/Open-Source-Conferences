Description: 
	We run several crowd-funding platforms where youngsters from across the continent fund their start-ups. There is not a pan-African solution yet so we had to connected multiple payment service providers. We connected five different ones and tried out a at least a dozen more. All used different check-out flows and API specifications. Sometimes Python libraries where available, often not. How do you connect multiple PSP's to one system? How do you manage payouts?
