Title: Make 'em pay: Connecting multiple African payment service providers - Loek van Gent
Publication date: 2019-11-23
Playlist: PyCon Africa 2019
Description: 
	We run several crowd-funding platforms where youngsters from across the continent fund their start-ups. There is not a pan-African solution yet so we had to connected multiple payment service providers. We connected five different ones and tried out a at least a dozen more. All used different check-out flows and API specifications. Sometimes Python libraries where available, often not. How do you connect multiple PSP's to one system? How do you manage payouts?

00:00:03,799 --> 00:00:11,940
so make him pay I will be talking about

00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:14,040
some payment service performance that we

00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:22,910
conducted our connectors our platform

00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:24,750
too but first I want to say hello really

00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:28,140
great to meet you all

00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:32,219
it's such a diverse community I try to

00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:36,120
find hello in as many African languages

00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:39,270
as possible but I it's really wonderful

00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:41,579
to be I already spoke to many people and

00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:47,039
it's so lovely to hear all your stories

00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:52,760
and your relation to Python and the

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:57,210
passion that we share so my name is Luc

00:00:52,760 --> 00:01:00,449
you can remind it memorizes by just

00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:03,750
saying look it's look so no lo AK or

00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:08,520
whatever that's just a weird Dutch way

00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:09,030
of writing a goose and you can find me

00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,070
on Twitter

00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:16,729
that's just my full name Luke Vaughn

00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:20,659
10th oh and I'm on get up to 2 so I

00:01:16,729 --> 00:01:24,960
currently work for a company got good up

00:01:20,659 --> 00:01:30,270
it's a fairly small company with 25

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:35,070
people this is in Amsterdam where my

00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:38,549
work is and this is actually it used to

00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:42,649
be the headquarters of the West Indian

00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:46,170
trading company that's one of our

00:01:42,649 --> 00:01:50,490
darkest pages in Dutch history that's

00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:56,280
basically when we were very wealthy over

00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:58,259
the backs of Africans so but now we're

00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:02,250
doing different business that we're

00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:05,430
located here and good up you might

00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:11,760
already know by the word good that we

00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:13,680
want to do good and we try to do so by

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,590
saying we want

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,769
we're here too for connecting people

00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:23,909
with smart ideas to people with time

00:02:19,769 --> 00:02:26,969
money or skills so someone might have a

00:02:23,909 --> 00:02:29,939
smart idea to make the world a better

00:02:26,969 --> 00:02:32,700
place for instance they might want to

00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:36,269
store start a Python conference in

00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:40,439
Zimbabwe sorry here's someone you

00:02:36,269 --> 00:02:43,409
probably know Anna and together with

00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:47,459
Humphrey they wanted to start the first

00:02:43,409 --> 00:02:49,019
bank on in Zimbabwe but yeah they need

00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:52,500
some money for that and they started a

00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:56,840
crowdfunding complain compain on one of

00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:59,459
our platforms and what happened then is

00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:02,069
something that I'm very proud of because

00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:05,870
it's what will happen in a Python

00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:11,129
community all over the world Dinesh's

00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:15,719
were made to this project so us Brazil

00:03:11,129 --> 00:03:18,540
of course from Zimbabwe - well you can

00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:21,659
see and they raised even more than they

00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:24,810
bargained for and it was a wonderful

00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:28,400
success I think I wasn't there that year

00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:31,400
but I joined them the year after and

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:34,709
yeah we all know what a wonderful

00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:39,510
community the Zimbabwean Python

00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:44,699
community is but so that's one smart

00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:48,329
idea but we extended that a bit and we

00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:53,310
now something that we call a purpose

00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:55,879
engagement program so we have different

00:03:53,310 --> 00:04:00,030
platforms that run on the same bit of

00:03:55,879 --> 00:04:04,109
software and it's all about projects and

00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:13,919
my people either donating money or their

00:04:04,109 --> 00:04:18,209
time and we have a dream it's what they

00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:24,570
call a big hairy audacious goal or Abby

00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:27,360
hack and what we aim for is by 2030 we

00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:29,490
want to engage 1 billion people to make

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:37,740
a positive impact using our technology

00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:44,310
so that's pretty ambitious we will do

00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:45,870
that in 3 different ways so we have some

00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:48,479
big corporates that we work together

00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:51,060
with that allow their employees to spend

00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:54,889
one or two days a year doing voluntary

00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:59,400
work or even longer sometimes they say

00:04:54,889 --> 00:05:02,310
someone can spend two months helping a

00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:05,639
social startup or charity to run their

00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:08,250
programs things like that so that's what

00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:10,800
we do for the big corporates then we

00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:15,020
have some civic programs that might

00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:18,630
something it's like the park on Zimbabwe

00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:22,169
a project that was running on 1% Club

00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:27,570
but also some municipalities so cities

00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:29,490
that are looking for ways how to spend

00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:31,110
their money and they say if you want a

00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:36,089
new playground in your neighborhood

00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:38,669
maybe you can crowd funds like 50

00:05:36,089 --> 00:05:42,479
percent yourself and we will add the

00:05:38,669 --> 00:05:44,370
other 50% and then that way the the city

00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,469
will know that people in that

00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:48,449
neighborhood really want that playground

00:05:46,469 --> 00:05:52,440
and they will look after it because they

00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:57,650
paid for themselves - so it works really

00:05:52,440 --> 00:06:00,659
well here it's the smallest column but

00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:04,909
to me the most interesting well that's

00:06:00,659 --> 00:06:07,770
some programs that we run they are

00:06:04,909 --> 00:06:13,159
partly funded by the Dutch government

00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:19,279
and I will talk a bit later about that

00:06:13,159 --> 00:06:22,489
but it's for startups in Africa

00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:26,419
but here is an example of booking.com

00:06:22,489 --> 00:06:29,389
the hotel booking website that has

00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:32,239
offices all over the world and every

00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:35,689
employee is allowed one day a year to do

00:06:32,239 --> 00:06:40,159
some good and this is the team from atre

00:06:35,689 --> 00:06:44,119
and it's only nine people but they went

00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:47,089
for day with the entire office to clean

00:06:44,119 --> 00:06:52,279
up some part of the beach there's enough

00:06:47,089 --> 00:06:54,619
to be cleaned up here in Accra but it it

00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:57,259
is getting involved in the local

00:06:54,619 --> 00:06:59,599
community and trying to make a

00:06:57,259 --> 00:07:02,299
difference so say the part of the

00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:05,839
program was that they just did a cleanup

00:07:02,299 --> 00:07:14,769
but they also are setting up a center

00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:14,769
where people living around the the most

00:07:14,829 --> 00:07:21,979
areas with most rubbish and they say if

00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:25,549
you hand over a big bag of rubbish you

00:07:21,979 --> 00:07:28,759
get food in return so so they are

00:07:25,549 --> 00:07:34,369
thinking about how to skill this cleanup

00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:36,110
further up and here is one of the

00:07:34,369 --> 00:07:40,719
programs that we run it's called the

00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:43,129
next economy and it is aimed at

00:07:40,719 --> 00:07:49,099
youngsters that want to start up their

00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:52,399
own business and they do so but to kick

00:07:49,099 --> 00:07:55,639
started they are looking for a fund to

00:07:52,399 --> 00:08:00,199
start off with and they are asked to

00:07:55,639 --> 00:08:02,719
crowdfund half of it themselves so it'll

00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:04,849
be something around five hundred US

00:08:02,719 --> 00:08:07,659
dollars that will crowd fund themselves

00:08:04,849 --> 00:08:11,269
and I have a matching fund of another

00:08:07,659 --> 00:08:13,969
$500 and then with that thousand dollars

00:08:11,269 --> 00:08:18,019
they will start their business and they

00:08:13,969 --> 00:08:21,939
also get some coaching from another

00:08:18,019 --> 00:08:26,419
partner that we work together with and

00:08:21,939 --> 00:08:31,500
in that way they will have their own

00:08:26,419 --> 00:08:37,089
business here's an example from

00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:40,779
Nigeria it's not readable but it's

00:08:37,089 --> 00:08:42,700
someone who wants to make 3d

00:08:40,779 --> 00:08:45,790
presentations for companies that's his

00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:49,570
business and he needs some gear for that

00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:57,490
and then he will start finding clients

00:08:49,570 --> 00:09:01,360
to make 360 virtual tools so that's all

00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:04,029
very nice but um we're here to talk

00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:09,100
about payment service providers or make

00:09:04,029 --> 00:09:13,420
them pay how a payment or donation

00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:15,790
typically works is you user will make a

00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:18,930
donation say 50 dollars and that will

00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:23,140
have to go to the project so the in

00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:25,450
Django you would then create a donation

00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:30,940
object and then a payment that's

00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:34,270
connected to it but it's not only in

00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:37,720
dollars dollars won't make any sense

00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:40,860
here in Ghana for instance so you might

00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:43,959
have donations in dollars and then a

00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:47,700
payment or the donation in naira

00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:51,820
if you're in Nigeria so how would you

00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:56,260
solve that in is there any jungle people

00:09:51,820 --> 00:10:01,120
around quite some got some so you might

00:09:56,260 --> 00:10:02,890
think let's just add a currency feel to

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:06,870
that donation object and and you're done

00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:10,450
but there's a neater way to do that with

00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:13,209
library called Jenga money so what it

00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:19,660
looks like is you will have a money

00:10:13,209 --> 00:10:21,279
field and here's the donation and there

00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:24,610
you have the money field and that money

00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:29,020
field would store both the currency and

00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:31,270
the amount and then you can have a list

00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:33,490
with different donations to one project

00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:39,730
and some of the donations would be in

00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:42,730
naira and some in dollars but yeah if

00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:44,710
you have doors and IRAs in that same

00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:49,750
list how we

00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:52,990
you add those up you have to convert it

00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:56,650
to a currency probably in Nara if it's a

00:10:52,990 --> 00:11:03,370
Nigerian project so maybe at some

00:10:56,650 --> 00:11:07,870
conversion rates to your settings now

00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:11,200
conversion rates do change so luckily

00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:17,530
there's another nice library to do that

00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:21,970
it's called Django money rates what you

00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:26,950
can do there is import this conferred

00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:29,200
money it will have a database with the

00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:32,320
latest currencies and in your

00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:36,370
configuration you can set up how often

00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:39,670
this will get updated and what you do is

00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:41,560
convert money amount and curse you from

00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:43,480
and then the currency too so for

00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:45,220
instance if you have five fifteen

00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:47,620
thousand seven hundred neurons and you

00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:50,080
want to convert it to euros it will

00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:53,230
print out something like this and this

00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:55,480
is this is Django money that knows how

00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:57,040
to print it with the Euro sign and

00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:59,680
things like that that there's lots of

00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:05,020
magic in those libraries that you don't

00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:07,840
want to write yourself now let's try to

00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:10,090
add Apollo that donations so we are the

00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:12,640
list of the nation's we want to have the

00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:16,870
values well the amount of currency and

00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:20,680
then annotate the total of it so what

00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:24,010
this will do it will group all donations

00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:26,310
by currency and then have the total

00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:26,310
amount

00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:35,720
and here is what you would end up with

00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:40,070
so that's 5,000 euros some naira and

00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:43,700
some Kenyan chilling and that you could

00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:48,350
run that again with the convert money

00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:51,770
and loop through all those totals that

00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:56,740
you got here and some it and then well

00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:56,740
in this case I have converted it to SETI

00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:08,210
so what way of payment that you are

00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:11,210
interested in differs on where you are

00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:13,670
so we are based in the Netherlands most

00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:17,300
of our customers are either EU or US

00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:20,750
based so there is a wonderful payment

00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:24,740
service provider called stripe and

00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:28,430
stripe works quite neatly because you

00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:30,830
have a stripe j/s I'm a bit cheating

00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:34,160
here a bit here talking about JavaScript

00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:36,440
on the Python conference but what is

00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:39,430
nice about stripe is so this is

00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,430
JavaScript code

00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:53,420
but what the neat thing about this is

00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:57,139
stripe will handle the payment method so

00:13:53,420 --> 00:14:00,470
the credit card or the debit card in the

00:13:57,139 --> 00:14:02,749
front end all those card details that

00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:05,540
you don't want to be dealing with in

00:14:02,749 --> 00:14:08,949
your code you you are not allowed to see

00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:11,269
those card details it will all be in

00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:13,759
JavaScript and just in their browser and

00:14:11,269 --> 00:14:17,149
sent off to stripe who is qualified to

00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:19,430
another and in the end you just send the

00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:21,939
token token to your back end and it will

00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:26,149
be fine

00:14:21,939 --> 00:14:28,249
but hey it was to be this was to be

00:14:26,149 --> 00:14:31,329
about African payment service providers

00:14:28,249 --> 00:14:38,660
and right now let's have a look at what

00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:41,600
stripe supports it's a black hole there

00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:47,629
of course in Africa you have other means

00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:51,220
of payment so this used to be do payment

00:14:47,629 --> 00:14:53,509
method in Zimbabwe for some time luckily

00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:57,459
now I don't know if it's gotten better

00:14:53,509 --> 00:15:04,370
but this is some countries that we were

00:14:57,459 --> 00:15:07,100
investigating how to use them but then

00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:10,160
you have really a bunch of payment

00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:12,680
service providers how would you connect

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,839
different payment service providers so

00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:17,750
you can have a donation in naira

00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:19,579
that will be handled by one type of

00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:21,800
payment and under donation handled by

00:15:19,579 --> 00:15:26,209
another payment and all those payments

00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:30,079
are quite different so maybe you can use

00:15:26,209 --> 00:15:33,370
abstract models and extend those but

00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:36,679
there of course is another Django

00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:40,040
library way nicer called Django

00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:42,980
polymorphic so what you do there is you

00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:44,839
have a base model just like with

00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:47,209
abstract models where you have a payment

00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:49,699
and that's connected to your donation

00:15:47,209 --> 00:15:52,459
you might have a user and then here you

00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:56,779
have to pay the payment service provider

00:15:52,459 --> 00:15:58,699
a specific payment on top of that where

00:15:56,779 --> 00:15:59,139
you can if it's an ambassador payment

00:15:58,699 --> 00:16:01,660
maybe you

00:15:59,139 --> 00:16:03,480
to certain account number or something

00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:06,819
like that and the nice thing about

00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:10,749
polymorphic models is that in the back

00:16:06,819 --> 00:16:13,809
office you can generate a list with all

00:16:10,749 --> 00:16:19,230
the payments with what what it would say

00:16:13,809 --> 00:16:24,489
here is the different payment providers

00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:26,529
so another thing about payments is that

00:16:24,489 --> 00:16:29,319
you have to make sure that you get the

00:16:26,529 --> 00:16:33,699
status right you don't want a payment to

00:16:29,319 --> 00:16:38,470
be set to field or new or success if

00:16:33,699 --> 00:16:41,199
it's not so what how our payment flow

00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:43,839
would typically typically work is it

00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:45,970
will get authorized and then settled but

00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:49,449
sometimes it will get cancelled or

00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:54,669
failed and you want a donation to turns

00:16:49,449 --> 00:16:58,480
to either success or fill so you could

00:16:54,669 --> 00:17:01,329
do that in the safe routine in your

00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,429
model or maybe post signals but there's

00:17:01,329 --> 00:17:07,329
again and now as a way of doing that

00:17:03,429 --> 00:17:11,169
that's called Jango FSM finite state

00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:15,309
machine and how that works is in your

00:17:11,169 --> 00:17:18,490
model you can set a transition that's

00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:21,730
called settle and if you could call that

00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:27,299
the status of your payment will change

00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:31,419
this settled you specify this here and

00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:34,120
in that method you can do all sorts of

00:17:31,419 --> 00:17:36,159
things maybe so

00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,980
this is the payment if the payment is

00:17:36,159 --> 00:17:40,510
settled you want a donation to be

00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:43,630
success but you probably also want to

00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:45,309
send a thank-you email or update the

00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:49,570
wall of that project and things like

00:17:45,309 --> 00:17:52,269
that and if you use this finite state

00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:55,120
machine you have control over what's

00:17:52,269 --> 00:17:58,450
happening when and you can also later on

00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:00,700
say only certain users are allowed to do

00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:03,600
make that transition or only the system

00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:03,600
is allowed to do so

00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:15,690
I'm gonna look at some countries so we

00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:18,720
have done implementations in quite some

00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:25,890
countries I'm only going to show you a

00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:28,380
smaller few so Nigeria Nigeria mostly

00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:30,660
pays with credit cards right and then

00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:34,140
there's MasterCard Visa and Verve the

00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:36,770
what's worth I never heard about first

00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:39,480
before I've never Verve Records but

00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:41,730
apparently there's a big company called

00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:43,470
in to switch that has their own yeah

00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:45,600
there are the owner of God

00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:47,910
Dale's also are a payment service

00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,840
provider but it's lots of paperwork

00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:55,040
really a lot of paperwork anyone from

00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:56,310
Nigeria that did enter switch

00:18:55,040 --> 00:19:01,260
congratulations

00:18:56,310 --> 00:19:03,120
really you have to pay $200 to even

00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:07,050
submit the paperwork at least that was

00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:11,190
the case in 2016 and you have to be an

00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:13,140
idea and based company we weren't so in

00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:15,990
the end we gave up on in to switch and

00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:19,020
found something called flutter wave it

00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:21,930
was a new start at the back in 2016 and

00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:24,000
the documentation was limited they did

00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:28,200
it have any Python examples we took a

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:31,680
PHP example they had and through many

00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:36,000
pipe Skype chats we made it work but

00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:38,100
only I think it was three months ago we

00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,650
wanted to start a new batch of projects

00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:43,920
but payments were failing we got a bug

00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:46,410
report and we thought what's happening

00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:52,080
and we got in contact with Fred away to

00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:55,140
say oh you're still using your API they

00:19:52,080 --> 00:20:00,210
had a brand new API which I have to

00:19:55,140 --> 00:20:03,930
admit is really nice they have had a big

00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:06,780
funding of 20 million u.s. and now they

00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:10,370
have a JavaScript solution like stripe

00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:16,040
has and it's now really well documented

00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:16,040
documented Kenya

00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:22,890
of course m-pesa is the most used

00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:26,540
payment method daya Safaricom

00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:29,730
come the owner and they have an API to

00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:32,100
again lots of pain paperwork you have to

00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:36,690
be a Kenyan based company and to connect

00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:38,760
to the API back in 2016 at least he had

00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:40,890
to have internet explorer running on

00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:44,520
Windows 7 and make a connection

00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:46,530
it was wait to possible this is a 15

00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:49,049
page manual just to set up the

00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:52,919
connection even before you start using

00:20:49,049 --> 00:20:58,530
their API luckily enough there's Leticia

00:20:52,919 --> 00:21:01,590
who helped us out out there we did have

00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:04,230
some problems there too I'm gonna skip a

00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:06,960
bit here I'm gonna skip Mali because

00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:13,530
there's no know informally Uganda's

00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:15,750
Irene if you're in sorry one more

00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:19,290
there's no one from Somaliland

00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:21,870
but this is this was a fun one there are

00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:25,890
no no online documentation we had to

00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:28,290
port from a code example in PHP we were

00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:34,980
the first international user of their

00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:38,280
API no acid SSL whatsoever it's not very

00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:42,150
secure and the other awesome 1990s

00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:46,270
website I'm gonna show it don't be

00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:49,280
afraid look at this

00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:55,520
I'm not a graphical designer but this is

00:21:49,280 --> 00:22:01,490
awesome but so it was very simple setup

00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:05,120
but still it ran really well no field

00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:06,710
donations whatsoever only at some time

00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,950
they had to switch it off because the

00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:12,980
government didn't allow US dollar ten

00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:15,170
transactions anymore and that was the

00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:19,460
only currency that they had for their

00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:21,820
API so the conclusion we had twin more

00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:25,540
than twenty payment service provider

00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:25,540
implementations that we tried out

00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:31,640
imported is to describe the specific use

00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:34,790
case well so the nations in Kenya work

00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:36,860
in a real different way than with car

00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:42,110
payments so people are used to get out

00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:43,240
their phone Genk in a number and then be

00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:46,990
done with it

00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:51,470
leaf attack to the tech companies so

00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:56,510
example with Safaricom and into switch

00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:59,210
they didn't do a very good job but maybe

00:22:56,510 --> 00:23:01,910
trucks can correct me on that one at

00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:05,180
some point and sometimes simpler is

00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:07,550
better ask for the latest documentation

00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:09,530
the times that we implemented added

00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:11,750
documentation that was online and it

00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:14,560
wasn't working and we got in touch with

00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:17,180
them and they say you're using the

00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:19,490
documentation that's online of course

00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:24,770
that's not up to date and they would

00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:29,440
email us the latest documentation and be

00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:32,540
aware things change all the time a lot

00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:36,080
so make sure you stay up to date if if

00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:40,250
there's API changes do lots of logging

00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:43,160
in your system error reporting make sure

00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:47,720
you get notified if something goes wrong

00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:50,120
and then learn important for us for my

00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:53,150
company maybe we should have local

00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:57,500
developers that already know how to

00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:59,330
implement stuff so I'm trying to quickly

00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:02,950
wrap this up

00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:10,430
I'm gonna go want to show some results

00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:12,500
okay okay so this is the results of the

00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:16,390
different Youth Employment programs that

00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:22,700
starting up creating their own business

00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:25,580
what we achieved is thirty four thousand

00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:32,780
US dollars that was in mainly in

00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:39,280
Somaliland 52 million in ira 37 million

00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:44,059
in sefa helped me in in Kenyan and 61 in

00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:47,240
Ugandan shilling go look it up I'm not

00:24:44,059 --> 00:24:49,809
gonna spoil you with telling what the

00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:52,340
grand total is because this money to me

00:24:49,809 --> 00:24:55,790
was not the most important thing the

00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:58,550
most important thing is it was in so

00:24:55,790 --> 00:25:03,860
many different places there was 600

00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:07,250
businesses that started and we're not

00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:09,470
that much later yet so we are not sure

00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:12,170
how many will survive but the first

00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:16,700
batch that ran three years ago I believe

00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:19,780
that the over 70% of those businesses

00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:23,809
are still active and there's even

00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:29,360
startups that are employing other people

00:25:23,809 --> 00:25:34,429
now so I I'm really proud of that so

00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:36,710
what's next so there are some plans that

00:25:34,429 --> 00:25:43,309
we might extend the program to the

00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:45,170
Gambia and to Zimbabwe please follow me

00:25:43,309 --> 00:25:49,280
on Twitter to stay updated or I'll get

00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:53,210
you please do get in touch but more

00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:59,450
interesting might be will there ever be

00:25:53,210 --> 00:26:02,030
a pan-african payment solution I don't

00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:05,000
know I've been waiting for that for a

00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:07,460
long time maybe it's gonna be PayPal but

00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:11,750
I don't think they fell adoption is very

00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:12,980
strong here maybe those Chinese will

00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:16,040
come along with a leap a

00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:20,660
and you will all be or maybe it's that

00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:22,160
zugerberg guy waiteth is Libra I'm not

00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:24,890
entirely sure

00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:28,730
or maybe it's cryptocurrencies or maybe

00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:32,570
stripe or again another big payment

00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:34,910
service provider from Europe might

00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:39,910
finally adopt local payment services I

00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:44,809
can just started offering m-pesa but I

00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:48,740
think it would more be a company like

00:26:44,809 --> 00:26:52,070
far away for Sullivant from Kenya that

00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:59,780
they might implement all the local

00:26:52,070 --> 00:27:04,580
payment service methods what about a

00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:09,200
dream that I had or our company 1

00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:11,120
billion that's quite a lot but remember

00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,820
this the corporates and the civic and

00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:18,740
the programs all in their little

00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:22,520
containers we believe it should be more

00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:27,200
like this with corporates getting in

00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:30,410
touch with local partners with charities

00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:34,280
NGOs social startups but also

00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:38,690
individuals if we could have one big

00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:40,700
platform of doing good and not only a

00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:42,880
startup would raise money and get some

00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:47,120
coaching but get them in contact with

00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:50,030
Accenture or another big corporates that

00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:54,770
will help them out write a really good

00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:59,450
business plan and then we might get to

00:27:54,770 --> 00:28:01,870
our dream that's all I had to say maybe

00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:01,870
some questions

00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:13,070
I wasn't very clear there's way too many

00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:14,750
questions for that sorry it's a little

00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:16,670
bit technical but I was wondering how do

00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:22,250
polymorphic models get represented in

00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:25,270
the database itself a bit like abstract

00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:30,620
models would be so you get one table for

00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:32,510
the base model and then a table for for

00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:35,000
all the extra field that's are in the

00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:39,910
extended that polymorphic child has it's

00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:42,710
called so what's the you talked about

00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:44,870
the convert model and being able to

00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:47,120
convert currencies from from Django read

00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:50,120
directly what is the benefit of doing

00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:52,310
that compared to just using whatever

00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:54,230
conversion rate the payment met like the

00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:56,090
payment services are using has like if

00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:57,470
you do submit a payment in whatever

00:28:56,090 --> 00:28:59,360
currency and the payment service

00:28:57,470 --> 00:29:01,160
converts it and gives you some amount

00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,690
back but it's a benefit of doing the

00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:05,270
conversion yourself rather than just

00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:10,460
using whatever it is services yeah so so

00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:14,510
in some cases the the payment service

00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:16,880
would convert it and and if you raise it

00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:19,340
in naira it will eventually pay it out

00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:22,730
in u.s. dollars for instance but what we

00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:25,450
also do for some projects is connect to

00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:28,190
payment service providers so if it's

00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:31,520
because with the Youth Employment

00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:36,020
programs a lot of funding also comes

00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:38,750
from the diaspora so then there's people

00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:40,460
from the US that will pay through stripe

00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:42,860
and that would be paid out in u.s.

00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:44,570
dollars and then others in for instance

00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:46,880
flood wave and that will be paid out in

00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:48,680
Nara and still you want to show grand

00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:53,750
totals so then you have to do to cover

00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:56,030
yourself hey I'm asking this question on

00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:57,950
behalf Jeff here he asked me since he

00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:59,360
speaks French and he saw you pass up the

00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:02,630
slide about Molly

00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:04,580
he's from Cameroon we mostly use mobile

00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:06,530
money for our payments did you

00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:08,750
successfully implement a solution for

00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:11,030
Mobile Money payment provider in the

00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:12,740
money yes yes we did

00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:15,530
so the

00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:22,550
in Mali it's orange money I think that's

00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:26,870
the most used payment method and we the

00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:30,170
company's called VTA that it's it's part

00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:33,770
of a long Linea all longer in EO if I

00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:37,220
pronounced it correctly but the payment

00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:39,950
the payments work only pay out don't so

00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:44,990
I wanted to now I can tell the story

00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:47,420
after all so they don't do bank payouts

00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:49,520
in the end so what we do is our local

00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:52,160
partner would hope only his bicycle

00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:54,260
Drive to the head office of that payment

00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:58,610
certified and he will get a check and

00:30:54,260 --> 00:31:01,400
then disburse that to all the projects

00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:04,250
so it's not a fully fledged penguin

00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:10,520
service provider yet but we do manage to

00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:15,860
collect donation staff we still have

00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:18,920
time for yes thank you anyone else

00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:21,650
waiting for the excellent for the talk

00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:25,640
and I really would like to have your

00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:29,770
take on Libra and I think that we are

00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:33,080
roasting sometimes implementing that

00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:36,320
well all that little the smaller payment

00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:38,900
because once Libra will be out of the

00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:43,880
current trouble I mean everybody is

00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:45,890
using Facebook so in some way everybody

00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:49,630
will just use libera like do you think

00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:54,500
huh and I'm not totally convinced and

00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:57,290
personally I would not wish that yeah

00:31:54,500 --> 00:32:02,480
Facebook would become a bank and have

00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:04,580
that information on me too but who knows

00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:07,970
we don't know how how things will change

00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:09,800
but I think for I don't think in Kenya

00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:13,160
they would switch from ampacity

00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:15,410
something else shortly but for the

00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:17,870
countries where there's not so much a

00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:21,980
mobile solution yet it might might

00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:23,420
change I don't know but who knows so

00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:25,970
that's that's what I'm saying

00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:28,880
keep your eyes open if you run

00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:33,650
projects like that or even if you do it

00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:35,480
locally things might change I think a

00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:37,850
couple of weeks ago there was an outage

00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:40,100
on m-pesa and the people weren't able to

00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:42,980
use it for some time and people got

00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:48,380
angry so maybe they will look for

00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:51,710
something else who knows anymore and

00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:55,790
otherwise catch me I really love to talk

00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:58,970
to people who can correct me if I'm not

00:32:55,790 --> 00:33:02,420
using the right things and to hear about

00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:04,190
what payment methods are available or

00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:08,150
use in your country because that's very

00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:16,070
hard to find out if you're all a far

00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:19,000
away in the Netherlands thank you very

00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:19,000
