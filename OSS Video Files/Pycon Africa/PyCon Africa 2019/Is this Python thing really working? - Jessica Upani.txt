Title: Is this Python thing really working? - Jessica Upani
Publication date: 2019-11-23
Playlist: PyCon Africa 2019
Description: 
	Efforts of community engagement and coding events are on a rise in Namibia. We have been doing this since 2015. Now with the challenge of barely any Python jobs existing in the country, are all these efforts really working? Are they worth it? How do we keep going, how do we keep the community motivated to learn more and more Python?

is welcome Jessica afternoon everyone

00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:14,950
it doesn't matter how many times I speak

00:00:13,299 --> 00:00:17,740
I still feel nervous coming on this

00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:20,770
stage and in this instance I'm very

00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:23,460
privileged that I met back on Africa so

00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:26,590
I'm glad to have you guys here with me I

00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:29,590
will be talking about Python communities

00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:32,110
especially Python in a media and the

00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:35,590
question still is is this Python thing

00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:37,149
working so I want to make your own I

00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:40,930
want you to make your own conclusions at

00:00:37,149 --> 00:00:44,160
the end of my talk but yeah let me share

00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:47,590
my experience with you I am Jessica

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:53,410
opening or miss open as my kids call me

00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:57,280
but not for you yes so finally on three

00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:59,859
time I'm Jessica bunny and also you can

00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,239
email me don't ask me about the email I

00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:07,000
did it back then when I was still in

00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:09,280
high school right so I would like to go

00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,900
over a little bit about what my cousin's

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:17,350
have been doing in the past few years

00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:20,259
especially in Africa now if we look at

00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:22,900
2010 between 2010 and 2014 we had only

00:01:20,259 --> 00:01:27,030
one ficon in Africa that was bicorn

00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:29,619
South Africa and during that time of

00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:31,960
2014-2015 there was some activity of

00:01:29,619 --> 00:01:34,270
pecans in Cameroon but I don't know what

00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:36,009
happened I need to talk to my brothers

00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:38,680
in Cameroon and find out exactly what

00:01:36,009 --> 00:01:40,479
happened but between those years there

00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:44,560
was a lot of activity in South Africa

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:46,299
only maybe also in some African

00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,240
countries but it was in popular and I

00:01:46,299 --> 00:01:50,470
got into DSF there were no requests for

00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:54,280
funding during that period of time

00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:57,490
except for my South Africa and then

00:01:54,280 --> 00:02:00,390
between 2015 and 2016 in 2015 we had

00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:04,740
Python Namibia for the first time and

00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:09,819
then in 2016 there was Pike on Zimbabwe

00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:11,650
led by Anna McCurry GL Humphrey in the

00:02:09,819 --> 00:02:14,230
rest of the pecan team

00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:18,430
a group we have a lot of them here as

00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:20,799
well then in 2017 and 2018 we saw back

00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:26,049
on Nigeria we saw bicorn Ghana

00:02:20,799 --> 00:02:29,379
we also saw taekwondo kenya and then

00:02:26,049 --> 00:02:36,129
finally we are here at - africa so

00:02:29,379 --> 00:02:39,099
congratulations to everyone right so

00:02:36,129 --> 00:02:42,430
let's talk about my baby I want to share

00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:44,680
this experience with you but this is

00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:46,989
also to show you that every community is

00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:50,319
unique in its own way we are one of the

00:02:46,989 --> 00:02:52,209
oldest communities in in Africa but if

00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:55,030
you look at Pepin Ghana if you look at

00:02:52,209 --> 00:02:57,310
or by phone Nigeria these guys are going

00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:59,829
at a very fast pace so I want to share

00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:02,560
my experience with you and show you that

00:02:59,829 --> 00:03:04,150
whatever your situation is in your

00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,889
country it's unique and it's going to be

00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:11,430
special and you should be happy about it

00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:15,760
right so in 2015 we had 80 participants

00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:19,780
we had 10 talks and 9 workshops half of

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:22,030
these was university students and then

00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:24,480
in 2016 we had handwritten and Tim

00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:27,040
participants 15 talks and 10 workshops

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,199
but as you can see the numbers are now

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,750
going down in 2017 he had 93

00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:36,180
participants only 20 talks and six

00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:39,400
workshops 2018 we again experience less

00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:42,310
participants 82 participants 21 talks 13

00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:44,019
workshops and this year we even

00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:48,599
experienced the worst attendance which

00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:52,120
was 75 15 talks and 12 workshops

00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:57,010
hopefully I'll have more workshops from

00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:59,079
Togo been in Kenya but Swarna I need

00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:02,909
more these my list is getting down and

00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:05,560
also I need help from you guys as well

00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:09,310
these numbers are just to encourage us

00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:10,900
to do more work on the ground when it

00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:12,489
comes to Python events or Python

00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:14,199
conferences it's not about just the

00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:16,269
conference itself it's a body engaging

00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:17,739
the community so after the conference so

00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:19,690
these low numbers shows us that

00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:25,030
you do a lot more work locally and have

00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:26,319
more events for people right now now I

00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:29,849
want to talk about the Python

00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:32,680
communities that we have in my country

00:04:29,849 --> 00:04:34,509
we have panels furnace finance colleges

00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:37,210
our baby this is one of the things that

00:04:34,509 --> 00:04:38,710
we did when we created the society at

00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:40,210
that time we still do you know what we

00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:42,039
are doing but we are passionate about

00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:46,389
high school learners and in getting them

00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:48,699
involved in coding and so we this is our

00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:50,979
pride this is something that we work on

00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:53,979
almost every day more than any other

00:04:50,979 --> 00:04:55,270
event in my country but here where my

00:04:53,979 --> 00:04:58,090
colleague is going to talk more in

00:04:55,270 --> 00:05:00,009
detail on how we how we made it

00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:02,380
successful right now we are working with

00:05:00,009 --> 00:05:04,330
eight schools and we have three more

00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:07,300
schools that are coming up very soon

00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:09,729
that we are partnering with yes open

00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:11,919
arms college is basically coding clubs -

00:05:09,729 --> 00:05:13,720
coding clubs in high schools and they

00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:16,180
have been quite a successful because we

00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:18,550
have had one of our schools also winning

00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:21,759
their national programming competition

00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:23,710
so this is going really well his talk

00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:27,820
will now go into detail on how we make

00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:30,099
it happen and how we engage teachers we

00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:33,190
also have Jamaa girls so far we have

00:05:30,099 --> 00:05:35,020
only had it in Windhoek right now I'm

00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:36,849
going to be looking for girls to kind of

00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:40,000
lead this and also take it outside of

00:05:36,849 --> 00:05:42,669
then took because so far we have only

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,190
had it you invent took we also have

00:05:42,669 --> 00:05:46,990
Python for data science this one's

00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:48,669
correct this year and it started as pi

00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:51,190
ladies the lady who's leading it

00:05:48,669 --> 00:05:53,650
serratus pi ladies but in the group we

00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:55,900
saw that there was a huge interest of

00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:57,849
guys as well we wanted to join in length

00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:01,030
Python and so she changed the name from

00:05:57,849 --> 00:06:03,039
to Python for data science so now we are

00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:04,690
left with starting all over and looking

00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:08,979
for someone to lead the PI ladies in

00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:11,590
Namibia we also have German Olivia which

00:06:08,979 --> 00:06:14,020
is led by mujer he studied this year he

00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:16,930
has a lot of plans towards the end of

00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:19,630
this year but this is also something new

00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:21,350
and it's our baby

00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:24,110
and then PI ladies so

00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:25,700
the community doesn't exist right now we

00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:29,420
are working on getting more girls to

00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:31,490
lead it then we also have carpenter

00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:34,910
workshops these are workshops that are

00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:39,160
mainly focusing on research software we

00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:41,870
also have them in my country right so

00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:43,220
when we organize all these events one of

00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:45,470
the things that we struggle with in my

00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:48,950
country is sort of motivating the people

00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:50,990
to keep learning fighting right so the

00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:53,180
way our job market is right now is that

00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:55,310
it's dominated by Java it's dominated by

00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:57,980
PHP and people don't really see the need

00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:59,540
of using Python right so how do you get

00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:01,400
people to come to your events learn

00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:03,110
Python and be able to implement it in

00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:05,450
your workspace because there are no jobs

00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:07,730
in my country that requires phrasing so

00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:09,560
one of the challenges that we have in my

00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:10,940
country is sort of motivating people to

00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,590
keep coming to your workshops even if

00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:15,250
you don't have any job to offer them

00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:18,860
okay

00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:20,810
now what we do is that we most of the

00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:23,300
programmers that are good in icons we go

00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:25,940
for international jobs so now our job is

00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:27,860
a community is to say okay fine we can't

00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:30,710
necessarily or find jobs right now in

00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:33,740
the country that are Python related but

00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:35,750
look for jobs outside the country so we

00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:37,490
give them for example links or direction

00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:39,980
on the way to get jobs so if we see them

00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:42,200
we'll share them in our groups and then

00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:44,540
we also want to promote remote jobs them

00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:46,340
as well we have a training coming up in

00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:47,870
August now and we have talks that are

00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:50,360
specifically going to focus on how to

00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:52,460
get remote jobs for example so these are

00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:54,200
things that we are actively doing to try

00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:58,960
and engage the community and keep them

00:07:54,200 --> 00:08:02,870
there and show them hope yeah so we also

00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:05,150
have talks on how to start a business

00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:06,710
especially in my country so we have some

00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:09,020
people who have started their companies

00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:12,860
who would be coming to discuss how one

00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:15,590
can start their own against a company or

00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:18,260
anything like that so we are kind of now

00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:20,270
looking for other ways to compensate for

00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:24,050
not being able to offer jobs to our

00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:26,180
community all right so python in

00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:29,090
academia in my country is in such a way

00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:29,820
that in schools right now we don't have

00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:31,560
a

00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:33,350
language that that is recommended by the

00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,400
government so if you are a teacher

00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:37,020
depending on whatever skills you have

00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,430
any programming language you choose that

00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:42,360
language and you teach your kids in that

00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:44,820
language and it's more like extra

00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,500
curricular type of event because kids

00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:48,060
are only required to do programming when

00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:50,310
they are in their final year where they

00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:51,750
have to create projects and so forth so

00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:54,180
if you are in a junior grade you're not

00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:56,820
required to know any programming but as

00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:59,130
I teach I it's your own choice kind of

00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:01,160
engage the kids into programming and as

00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:04,560
a society we decided that we needed to

00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:06,900
go into the schools and engage the kids

00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,910
into programming even though the school

00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:11,640
system doesn't force the kids to know

00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:13,500
programming I am myself came to

00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,850
university wanting to do computer

00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:17,340
science but didn't know anything about

00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:19,620
computer science or programming until I

00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:21,480
came to university so it was just a

00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:23,610
dream because I had it some way I don't

00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:26,760
know even way and then I came to

00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:30,420
University I met Java and then I wanted

00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:32,760
to quit so I needed to rectify that

00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:34,220
mistake because it it wasn't going to

00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:37,710
happen on my watch

00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:39,000
right so Python in universities is now

00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:42,300
at a good stage we have three

00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,160
universities in my country so at the

00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:46,350
University of Namibia it's in a diploma

00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:50,340
level and at the other two universities

00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:52,320
it's in a undergrad degrees so it's

00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,940
quite good in a universities but at the

00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,910
school level it's not there yet so what

00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:58,320
we are trying to do now is okay fine the

00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:00,180
government maybe doesn't want to adopt

00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,340
Western as the main language but we are

00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:04,200
going to teach the most high school

00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:07,560
teachers we are going to have the most

00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:09,390
active scholars groups in a country in

00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,920
such a way that we dominate the system

00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:14,060
even though it's not adopted by

00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:16,740
recommand it's the mines right so

00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:18,750
because in in most cases if you if you

00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:20,610
if you if you have been a teacher we

00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:21,810
have worked with teachers you understand

00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:25,470
that most teachers don't know how to

00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:26,940
program okay so if you come in and you

00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:28,560
come in with a community and you are

00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,870
able to train these people you will get

00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,580
there

00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:32,020
your science so whether we are doing it

00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:34,000
there or you want to do it in your

00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:36,310
country you have to know that these guys

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,410
don't have supports and most of them

00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:40,000
don't even know how to program so if you

00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:41,890
give them a community where they can

00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,750
learn and be comfortable in the language

00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:45,580
they might be able to cultivate and come

00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:47,890
to your language so that's what we are

00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:51,730
working on right now in my country and

00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:54,310
hopefully maybe it will be adopted in

00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:56,740
the school system by the government all

00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:58,360
right so let's talk about the challenges

00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:01,210
that we have been experiencing in my

00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:05,140
country one of them is commitment and

00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:07,690
commitment is not only by participants

00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:09,910
not coming to your events it's also the

00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:11,410
executive members not wanting to do they

00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:13,150
work or not committing to coming to

00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:15,910
meetings or completing their testing

00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:19,960
time and also they teachers themselves

00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:22,150
sometimes we have to really go on their

00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:25,390
case to be able to get the work done but

00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:27,820
every one you will experience these in

00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:30,660
everything whether it's people signing

00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:35,140
up for your events and not showing up or

00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:36,490
maybe your executive members not wanting

00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:38,890
to do a job or something

00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:40,720
so as an executive or is their leader a

00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:42,660
community leader you have to know that

00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,820
you are going to be dealing with

00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:48,490
commitment issues so you need a lot of

00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:51,100
patience right so one of the other

00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:53,200
things that we deal with is not being

00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:56,830
taken seriously so what happens is the

00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:58,990
following we offer buses for university

00:11:56,830 --> 00:12:00,910
students to come to pack on a media and

00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:03,430
what they do is they don't sign up for

00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:06,370
tickets they don't buy a ticket they

00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:08,890
want free tickets you give them they

00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:11,140
don't show up or they don't even ask for

00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:13,029
a free ticket when they see a bus coming

00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:13,750
during their lunch hour time they can

00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:15,190
get on it

00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:18,310
they come to their conference and then

00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:23,650
they go away University students don't

00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:25,480
do that so or sometimes you are having a

00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:27,339
workshop training you you put out

00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,540
applications they don't apply but they

00:12:27,339 --> 00:12:30,810
will write after you close the

00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:32,980
applications that they are interested

00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:33,779
okay so people don't take you seriously

00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:36,800
and

00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:41,430
is something that you have to deal with

00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:44,670
lack of resources as well this is a very

00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:48,660
big issue in my country we have computer

00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:50,550
systems that still use XP Windows XP so

00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:53,670
you have to go into Python and go to

00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:55,019
maybe the one version 2014 or whatever

00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:58,259
that's the only one that will rake in

00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:59,879
the assistance and if you install it it

00:12:58,259 --> 00:13:01,110
doesn't allow a lot of learners to log

00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:03,569
into the computer so you have 20

00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:05,399
computers only three or six are going to

00:13:03,569 --> 00:13:08,189
log in at once there is they are not

00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:09,329
working you don't know what's wrong so

00:13:08,189 --> 00:13:11,759
that's that's challenge that you are

00:13:09,329 --> 00:13:14,579
having right now but again this is not

00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:17,339
something that you told you big what I

00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:18,660
do right now is I take the keeps if I

00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:21,029
have a school that is interested in

00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:22,920
programming I will take it to a

00:13:21,029 --> 00:13:25,439
university I'll talk to a university

00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:28,559
Saturday morning from 10 to 12 I give

00:13:25,439 --> 00:13:35,069
them lessons whenever I'm available but

00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:37,680
we don't give excuses in some countries

00:13:35,069 --> 00:13:39,300
as well some lenez have laptops so in

00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,519
such a case if you have a group of

00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:43,410
learners some have laptop some don't

00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,480
then you come together those who have

00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:51,480
laptops you share you pair program any

00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:53,730
2x it does really weak language delivery

00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:56,160
this is not something that I experience

00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:58,079
in my country most of my people speak

00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,029
English so it's not a big barrier even

00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:02,069
though we have so many native languages

00:14:00,029 --> 00:14:05,189
we all are able to speak English and

00:14:02,069 --> 00:14:07,589
it's not a problem but in language and

00:14:05,189 --> 00:14:09,540
in countries like Mozambique for example

00:14:07,589 --> 00:14:11,399
or in Cameroon where you have one part

00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:14,670
of the country speaking French and the

00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:16,800
other part speaking English and not they

00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:18,540
don't speak one of the of the other

00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:21,000
languages this is something that you may

00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:23,189
come across and now we have to think of

00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,199
ways to overcome that if you are a

00:14:23,189 --> 00:14:26,670
french-speaking part of Cameroon and you

00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:30,300
want to interact with the English people

00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:31,800
learn English or vice versa ok be the

00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,720
first even if your community doesn't

00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:36,809
want you to do it or whatever the case

00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:38,519
may be and then we have Mozambique for

00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:41,220
example Mozambique

00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:42,779
I think they speak Portuguese and then

00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,620
maybe they want to have a conference and

00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:45,960
international

00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:48,089
where we speak English for example and

00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:49,710
we don't understand their language so we

00:14:48,089 --> 00:14:53,000
have to think of ways on how to work

00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:55,080
around that whether looking at other

00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,420
conferences that have done it before or

00:14:55,080 --> 00:15:00,089
just understanding our community and

00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:01,650
seeing can bring translators or what is

00:15:00,089 --> 00:15:04,170
it that you can do to compensate for

00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:07,950
that one other thing you struggle with

00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:12,860
is also funding since 2015

00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:16,050
my team has operated with zero budget

00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:17,520
until now only this year were we able to

00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:19,440
have a little bit of funding to do

00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:21,930
anything everything else that we did

00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,300
before we did it on a zero budget that

00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:25,950
means that we had to dig out of our own

00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:29,160
pockets to get things done if we needed

00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:30,960
them every meeting you go to every when

00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,339
you go to to represent the society you

00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:34,350
are doing it out of your own pockets

00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:36,000
every t-shirt of the society you want

00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:37,620
way to any event you have to do it out

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,970
of your own pockets you have the

00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:43,920
workshop it cost you maybe 1,000 to 500

00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:47,520
maybe a million dollars one thousand

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:49,470
five hundred grand maybe two it's easier

00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:51,690
to translate or to collect your currency

00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:54,839
that's you have to raise within the

00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:57,959
society so we operated without funding

00:15:54,839 --> 00:16:00,540
so that might be also a problem that you

00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:04,290
will experience now what are the lessons

00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:06,900
that we have learnt you do not need a

00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:10,320
lot of people to start in the beginning

00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:13,050
we would have a workshop we advertise it

00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:15,029
as much as we can only two people from

00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:17,279
the community shows up so we made sure

00:16:15,029 --> 00:16:23,779
that all the exactly just show up so

00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:23,779
that we attend our homework every day we

00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:36,110
right so whatever challenges and they

00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:38,600
refuse to let them push you down what I

00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:40,579
don't care what challenge it is make

00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:46,070
sure that you find a way out of it

00:16:40,579 --> 00:16:46,850
because the way exists okay and run your

00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:51,200
own race

00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:53,180
I see pather Nigeria I see pattern gun I

00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:56,089
all mentioned it as many times and I'm

00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:57,290
like how do these guys do this and it's

00:16:56,089 --> 00:17:00,110
throwing people like this in my

00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:03,140
community you understand but when you

00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:04,910
look at the people that are in my

00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:07,910
country we are 2 million only in the

00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:11,209
whole country and we we are not very

00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:13,370
competitive okay maybe Nigeria everyone

00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:17,949
has to go in my country people right

00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:19,699
shoot I have to understand my community

00:17:17,949 --> 00:17:24,100
you understand

00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:26,390
so we go at a very slow but steady pace

00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:29,179
we work with the community that we have

00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:31,340
I'm not going to be stressed about how

00:17:29,179 --> 00:17:33,320
Ghana is going on idea is going I'm

00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:35,540
going to work with my community and I

00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:37,640
stand hard awake and I work with that

00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:39,500
and make sure that we are moving forward

00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,330
so in your case you have to also

00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:43,280
understand your community what is it

00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:45,020
that they are struggling with how is

00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:49,940
your community how can you work around

00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:52,760
it I had to be I organized a meeting I

00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:54,950
remind them the day before the next

00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:56,750
meeting up the next day 20 minutes

00:17:54,950 --> 00:18:00,559
within the meeting time I'm calling them

00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:05,270
why are you oh yeah we had a meeting 30

00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:07,280
minutes after I have to be patient that

00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:10,220
time I'm very mad I'm very very very

00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:12,830
much but I had to grow the patience

00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:14,390
because otherwise if the community that

00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:20,419
you're working with you're understand it

00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:23,059
okay right you need a support system I

00:18:20,419 --> 00:18:26,799
always need a shoulder to cry on I

00:18:23,059 --> 00:18:29,840
always need someone to question my

00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:31,820
thinking I always need someone who can

00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:34,940
help me make the decisions alone you can

00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:35,730
never do this it's time-consuming and

00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:38,100
you've been

00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:41,100
very very fast whether it's someone

00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:44,220
close to you like an executive or a

00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:47,880
friend try to do that but not your

00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:50,700
partner you will drain them okay

00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:52,679
so always have a shoulder to cry on for

00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:54,659
example I look up to Daniella like I

00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:57,450
give all my complaints to him and he

00:18:54,659 --> 00:18:59,190
comes me down even when I want to quit

00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:06,269
he will always calm me down

00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:08,039
okay so find your shoulder to cry one

00:19:06,269 --> 00:19:10,200
more thing this is a voluntary thing

00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:11,580
it's not like it's a job for you so you

00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,919
have to make sure that if you are going

00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:15,450
into it you are going to spend your free

00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:21,750
time to do all the work

00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:23,610
there's no payment for it yes you might

00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:25,649
need to spend your own money we spend a

00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:27,809
lot of our own money in this society and

00:19:25,649 --> 00:19:29,070
today it's working so you have to know

00:19:27,809 --> 00:19:30,840
that even though you're going to spend

00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:34,139
some money of your own it will always

00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:35,610
work out or at least you have to make

00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:37,350
sure that one of the days it will work

00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:41,760
out because for us it did to account

00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:44,130
okay but be ready spends our money and

00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:46,139
it is a commitment you spend so many

00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:48,450
hours you spend so many hours I can only

00:19:46,139 --> 00:19:49,980
imagine how many sleepless nights the

00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:52,830
organizing team has been having these

00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:55,769
days to make it happen and for me myself

00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:57,269
I always came to a batch of being fired

00:19:55,769 --> 00:19:59,519
because of the time I had to spend

00:19:57,269 --> 00:20:02,669
organizing these events I remember one

00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:05,370
day ahead I'm mark scripts they were

00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:07,620
late and I had a two day workshop and

00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:10,190
then I worked that last day I wait until

00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:12,269
5:00 and the principal was so mad he

00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:14,039
wanted me to be at school the following

00:20:12,269 --> 00:20:17,880
morning and bring the scripts and and

00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:19,350
other marks and I said yes say the

00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:21,269
following morning I didn't show up

00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:24,120
because I had a workshop that was

00:20:21,269 --> 00:20:26,940
waiting for me and so I sent the scripts

00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:30,630
with my sister and he was very very much

00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:32,580
how I didn't get fired I don't know but

00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:34,919
from that day onward he knew that this

00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:37,200
was important to me in whatever trip I

00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:38,610
had to go to he just said I will allow

00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,859
you anyway because you will not listen

00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:44,259
to me

00:20:40,859 --> 00:20:46,989
so some some jobs could have been fired

00:20:44,259 --> 00:20:47,679
I could have been fired I can just work

00:20:46,989 --> 00:20:50,049
anyway

00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:53,139
I understand so it's a huge commitment

00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:58,749
you spend so many hours doing this it's

00:20:53,139 --> 00:21:01,239
not just easy and look for ways to

00:20:58,749 --> 00:21:02,799
contribute today UI participant next

00:21:01,239 --> 00:21:06,999
thing you are participating there after

00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:08,709
that we're participants why you're at

00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:11,169
least them this year someone else when

00:21:08,709 --> 00:21:13,539
they attempt to organize you go back you

00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:16,659
find a way to contribute okay don't just

00:21:13,539 --> 00:21:19,359
be a participant okay go back home and

00:21:16,659 --> 00:21:22,119
try to find ways to contribute back to

00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:23,919
the community now why should you start a

00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:28,119
present community in your countrywide

00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:29,919
duties you are here because someone else

00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:36,459
spend a lot of time organizing this

00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:38,950
isn't it why not why not organize this

00:21:36,459 --> 00:21:40,719
I'm sure you are going to be meeting a

00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:43,029
lot of people learning new things why

00:21:40,719 --> 00:21:47,940
not do the same for someone else to have

00:21:43,029 --> 00:21:47,940
the same experience why not

00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:54,099
by doing this you are also enhancing the

00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:55,749
local capacity so the developers in your

00:21:54,099 --> 00:21:57,489
country for example you'll be able to

00:21:55,749 --> 00:22:00,219
see what type of developers do I have

00:21:57,489 --> 00:22:02,499
what can we do to improve that capacity

00:22:00,219 --> 00:22:06,070
it's an organizer of such events you

00:22:02,499 --> 00:22:08,139
have that power to do that so this is

00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:10,929
also for the benefit of the community in

00:22:08,139 --> 00:22:13,809
your country you are also increasing

00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:15,519
your global visibility so people like

00:22:13,809 --> 00:22:17,859
Brad go for example they come from

00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:20,709
America and wherever they come in attend

00:22:17,859 --> 00:22:23,229
your own events here locally they pick

00:22:20,709 --> 00:22:24,789
up some good developers and you know you

00:22:23,229 --> 00:22:28,929
are creating job opportunities for your

00:22:24,789 --> 00:22:30,879
own people and then you also create a

00:22:28,929 --> 00:22:32,259
support system for the beginners if you

00:22:30,879 --> 00:22:34,629
look at the java language for example

00:22:32,259 --> 00:22:37,779
they don't have any support system I get

00:22:34,629 --> 00:22:39,729
that I go out because there's no one

00:22:37,779 --> 00:22:41,829
who's going to help me for example but

00:22:39,729 --> 00:22:43,899
by doing Python communities you know

00:22:41,829 --> 00:22:45,430
that all the newcomers they will be

00:22:43,899 --> 00:22:47,140
feeling comfortable learning person

00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:50,470
they know they have so many people to

00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:54,430
ask so these are great way for them to

00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:56,110
start you also are filling the gap so

00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:58,120
for example in our case with Pan Am

00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:59,680
scholars you know that scholars are

00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:02,200
disadvantaged when it comes to

00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:04,930
programming as a leader or a community

00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:06,520
leader you have that power to train

00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:11,290
these people so when they go to

00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:12,880
university they are skilled ok I said I

00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:16,420
was going to speak for 20 minutes nights

00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:17,830
25 so I'm running everything right

00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:20,680
so there are also other personal

00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:23,880
benefits like friendships in my case I

00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:27,520
made friends with the likes of Anna

00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:28,140
candy Irene and so forth in Milan as

00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,480
well

00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:33,930
- Africa Kim is an idea of or as a

00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:36,280
result of just ask missing each other

00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:38,260
instead of seeing each other once a year

00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:40,210
like why can we not just have an event

00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:41,890
for all of us where we just need you

00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:43,720
know we are excited to see each other

00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:46,570
every year every day we have back on

00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:49,150
Africa so you make so many friendships

00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:51,190
you also get your pop opportunities and

00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:52,660
you also have travel opportunities you

00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:54,040
don't necessarily want to organize these

00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:55,600
events because you want to travel around

00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:57,670
the world but this is something that

00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:01,390
also comes as an opportunity to you and

00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:04,990
we can't deny it okay right so how do

00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:07,210
you get started very quickly general

00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:09,520
guilt is a good initiative to start it's

00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:12,550
a way for you to even get a group of

00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:14,520
girls together for piyah ladies so you

00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:16,870
can start by organizing a workshop

00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:19,150
attend other conferences especially

00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:21,070
African conferences this gives you a

00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:22,780
realistic idea of what a conference can

00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:25,120
be in your own country especially if

00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:27,520
you're a beginner you go to Europe you

00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:29,290
are seeing 400 participants people are

00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:31,210
paying up buying their tickets and

00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:33,010
companies are interested in sponsoring

00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:35,200
they even reaching out to the conference

00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:37,300
team you can begin Africa

00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,920
you only have 75 people and companies

00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:41,590
don't want to sponsor you

00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:43,750
so when you attend local conferences in

00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:45,520
Africa you get a realistic idea of what

00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:47,680
is possible and you don't have high

00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:51,330
expectations that are never going to

00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:54,419
necessarily be the case if you

00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:58,450
you can also return to other communities

00:24:54,419 --> 00:25:00,789
and I remember in 2017 every girl wrote

00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:02,890
and emailed to me asking about LEDs in a

00:25:00,789 --> 00:25:06,130
media at that time we didn't have any

00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:08,409
but that's a nice way that she started

00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:10,659
and now today she's excelling and she's

00:25:08,409 --> 00:25:17,230
one of the best by ladies leaders in

00:25:10,659 --> 00:25:19,330
Africa and then follow other social

00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:21,460
media other other societies of social

00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:23,350
media watch what they are doing see the

00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:24,580
activities that they are doing see ways

00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:27,279
that they are engaging with the

00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:30,730
community and then you also learn

00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:33,850
something from that and then go back and

00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:36,549
plow in your community you have learned

00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:38,559
a lot now now for you to start your own

00:25:36,549 --> 00:25:40,149
community we just had a small event or

00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:44,260
general girls event or whatever

00:25:40,149 --> 00:25:47,620
something okay so what does the future

00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:49,360
look like this is something that I want

00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:51,010
to learn from you guys so maybe you can

00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:53,200
have a conversation with me lay down and

00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:56,710
tell me what you think we should do as

00:25:53,200 --> 00:26:00,549
community leaders in Africa okay now

00:25:56,710 --> 00:26:03,010
here are my ideas starting of ways to

00:26:00,549 --> 00:26:05,370
generate your own income I think for a

00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:07,899
long time we relies so much on

00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:10,960
international funding and so forth it's

00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:14,770
time for us to start thinking of ways to

00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:16,659
generate our own money I know we are

00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:20,620
used to being the big team and all this

00:26:16,659 --> 00:26:23,080
but we are capable all of us are great

00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:24,490
developers you wait for that big company

00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,809
that nice company that you want to

00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:27,730
mention to all your friends

00:26:25,809 --> 00:26:29,529
you could start a similar company that

00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:31,750
your fellow Africans can also be proud

00:26:29,529 --> 00:26:34,179
of and see I work for that company which

00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:37,440
you started and that would be a way to

00:26:34,179 --> 00:26:40,750
generate money for your own communities

00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:44,200
okay so we can start thinking of ways to

00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:45,820
make money with this money we can build

00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:50,020
community halves of our own we don't

00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:52,059
need to always ask we can find ways to

00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:53,890
find money to be able to build our own

00:26:52,059 --> 00:26:56,980
community hubs which we work hard for

00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:58,000
ourselves and also create jobs for the

00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:00,520
fellow communities

00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,100
just you're looking for jobs abroad and

00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:07,660
so forth start up something create jobs

00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:08,890
for the community partner with startups

00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:10,570
whether they are local or they are

00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:13,090
international and these are ways that

00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:16,180
one can also create jobs for your local

00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:18,580
communities and more importantly explose

00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:21,580
expose the scholars to technology

00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:23,590
whether it's working in with engineering

00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:26,350
maybe equipment I don't know engineering

00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:28,690
stuff don't ask but you could try

00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:31,840
something like that you could you know

00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:34,600
kids don't know what they don't know you

00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:36,670
understand so if you have some servers

00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:39,430
or some company that stores data

00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:40,780
whatever it does expose their kids to

00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:42,970
these things that they can start seeing

00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:44,230
while they're still young if they

00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:46,600
haven't seen these things they don't

00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:49,840
know these things so try to find ways to

00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:53,800
expose them as well and let's dominate

00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:55,510
the education system let's the minute

00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:57,760
the education system this is very very

00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:59,770
important because if these things are

00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,240
not taught in school kids are people are

00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:05,050
not the community is not familiar with

00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:06,220
this so the first point is to dominate

00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:09,490
the education system whether it's

00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:11,710
University or getting - adopted in high

00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:14,920
schools or whatever you have to think of

00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:18,940
ways to donate the education system and

00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:20,410
also international presence when people

00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:21,640
come from other countries to come in

00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:23,920
attend your local events for example

00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:26,170
your people feel proud they feel like

00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:28,690
they their events are important and so

00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:32,740
forth ok so let's try to do this for our

00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:36,700
community and then create new ideas it

00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:39,000
is now up to you to say so what do we do

00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:42,340
as young people in our own communities

00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:44,890
we have this pack on Africa so now what

00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:47,200
do we do moving forward from here how

00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:51,580
can we make this organization support or

00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:55,120
give back to our own countries what can

00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:58,390
we do with back on Africa can we one day

00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:00,970
maybe have a university - University

00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:04,330
that is free where our developers can go

00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:07,520
and lead intense programming can one day

00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:09,680
can we have our own programming language

00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:13,730
for example what does the future look

00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:16,640
like for us I want to learn from you

00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:20,300
guys who are young and fresh in college

00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:21,860
and finished and everything let's have

00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:25,340
this type of conversations with our

00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:30,000
Drita or even locally or something let's

00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:38,460
think beyond what we know now thank you

00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:38,460
[Applause]

00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:44,180
thank you very much Jessica

00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:45,560
while we're getting set up for the panel

00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:48,500
that's starting in a couple of minutes

00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:51,860
maybe you have some questions for

00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:53,570
Jessica he likes Christmas yes

00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:55,900
we'll try keep them short and sweet but

00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:55,900
please

00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:07,070
okay

00:30:04,419 --> 00:30:08,419
Jessica let me ask you a question where

00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:10,990
do you think your will be in five years

00:30:08,419 --> 00:30:10,990
from now

00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:25,240
right so the thinking right I don't have

00:30:22,179 --> 00:30:27,549
jobs right now in my country so what I

00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:30,990
want to do now is redefine the job

00:30:27,549 --> 00:30:33,610
market it's not our own company a

00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:35,620
company where my developers or the

00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:38,260
Python community developers are going to

00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:41,110
volunteer at and whatever projects we

00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:43,390
work on whatever funding we get from

00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:46,150
these projects is reinvested back in

00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:46,870
their community that's my dream right

00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:53,370
now

00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:53,370
[Applause]

00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:11,420
thanks a lot for the time I'd like to

00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:15,050
contribute quickly about the income box

00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:18,080
and I also like to dance well they

00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:21,440
talked before because the the presenter

00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:25,040
was talking about linking the industry

00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:26,900
to the developers etc etc and I have

00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:29,510
this trance feeling that nobody is

00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:32,560
talking about contributing to free and

00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:35,420
open-source software I'm not saying that

00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:38,690
contributing to open source will bring

00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:40,400
money directly but it is certainly a way

00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:44,510
for you to get some kind of exposure

00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:48,170
outside of your country and in some ways

00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:50,510
to build to be able to find jobs if I if

00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:54,260
I talk about myself and living in

00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:57,260
Senegal and most of the jobs most of the

00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:59,570
people I had the chance to work with it

00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:02,050
is actually because I'm contributing to

00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:06,320
some software for which are not

00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:08,930
mandatory paid but seeing the kind of

00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:11,450
contribution the contribution are making

00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:15,170
there is some people who have to be like

00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:18,920
ok can you work on this project this is

00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:22,240
what I want so yeah contributing to open

00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:22,240
source software is a way to

00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:36,520
thank you any other contribution or

00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:40,460
question thank you my sister for the

00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:42,410
beautiful presentation today's my first

00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:49,460
time coming to this community

00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:58,430
I actually learned of this community

00:32:49,460 --> 00:33:03,580
from my daughter she is also here the

00:32:58,430 --> 00:33:08,960
turn interesting to me is the ish God

00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:14,900
when somebody took statistics a Senapati

00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:16,910
above 35 or so so we are very few so I'm

00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:20,860
coming into the community also because I

00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:25,250
believe that we have two main knowledge

00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:29,630
in the industry so if we have the main

00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:34,310
knowledge we want to be the cup or the

00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:38,440
preach between the program and the

00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:42,770
industry so if one can fit into that

00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:45,170
bridge I'll be so glad to do that then

00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:49,520
get it to your contribution you also

00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:52,280
need to enter our government if you want

00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:54,620
funding for you for your conferences

00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:57,500
it's not a team that should come from

00:33:54,620 --> 00:34:00,970
your pocket so the marketing efforts

00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:04,700
would be very very very very very

00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:07,400
important to you so apart from God man

00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:08,960
you are so good to the industries if you

00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:11,450
don't sell what you are doing here to

00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:14,270
the industries you will not get anything

00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:17,330
because what we are also doing is like

00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:20,540
we adjust you know training people for

00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:21,650
foreign markets so if you train for

00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:24,470
foreign markets

00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:26,510
you know in Africa you know what's going

00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:28,970
on many industries when you are talking

00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:32,480
to them they don't even know what is the

00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:33,690
BI once they see Microsoft and Iza so

00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:36,990
please let's just do that

00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:38,879
thank you thank you if you have any

00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:40,560
questions you can reach out to me later

00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:41,719
on but now we have to start with the

00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:50,079
panel discussion

00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:50,079
