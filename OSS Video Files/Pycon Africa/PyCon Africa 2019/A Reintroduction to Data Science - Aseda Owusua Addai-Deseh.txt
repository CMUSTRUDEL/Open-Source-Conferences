	00:00:00,949 --> 00:00:33,000
good evening everyone okay so let's okay

00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:35,790
so you may have heard about you me even

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,040
be an expert at it I know some of us are

00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:41,460
experts at machine learning in some

00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:45,210
other crazy stuff already but no matter

00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:49,610
what we were here which attempt to give

00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:49,610
you a reintroduction sitting to a

00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:15,479
scientist in computer science company

00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:21,540
working as a data scientist with to

00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:27,720
analytics as most of you already know so

00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:30,150
I would go into science okay and before

00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,850
that I like to have you see this as such

00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:36,299
a different perspective to see data as

00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:40,259
crude oil to take it to the evolution of

00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:43,649
data science where it is now the future

00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:46,619
of it look at some use cases data

00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:50,220
science skills an opportunity available

00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:53,579
on that field and also some travel tools

00:01:50,220 --> 00:02:01,040
and the tremendous support that the

00:01:53,579 --> 00:02:07,229
Python community yes so the transfer oil

00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:09,479
in 2007 Ghana discovered crude oil in

00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:11,550
large commercial quantities

00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:14,760
and we're also quite excited yeah I've

00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:17,099
been to very rich and no and got some

00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:21,750
other countries like Nigeria I'm gonna

00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:24,810
Cameroon I also have a large quantities

00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:26,790
right so I'm just waiting and for my

00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:29,280
chief data scientist Thomas

00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:35,310
he tried to equate these are too crude

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:38,220
oil and he felt like when the way crude

00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:49,400
oil is if you begin to view data in that

00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:49,400
perspective so I agree with them because

00:02:53,420 --> 00:03:04,470
both of them senior Rusty's right cuz

00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:11,069
you're from the vendor's commercial

00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:15,530
banking I saw their mind okay and did

00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:18,810
you find ourselves in and potential

00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:23,880
asset for African government businesses

00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:27,060
to get really incidental science so

00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:30,690
Africa devolution of these and science

00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:32,669
so for anyone who is still wondering the

00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:35,910
worst particular to define digital

00:03:32,669 --> 00:03:38,700
science it's an interdisciplinary field

00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:50,870
and it's focused on finding actionable

00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:53,370
insights on large amounts of data data

00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:55,590
interpreting summarizing it's trying to

00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:59,150
get insights from me if something has

00:03:55,590 --> 00:04:02,400
been done long ago right

00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:10,950
for a very long time even in the 20th

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:15,030
century and to build a predictive model

00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:16,950
but on how to go by it back in the 20th

00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:27,890
centuries right on how to improve youth

00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:27,890
with body production and that's it

00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:37,920
though it's not enough statistics can't

00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:41,310
include so many disciplines such as

00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:44,390
computer programming at fish intelligent

00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:49,440
machine learning and even linguistics

00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:55,770
and I want to keep to the data science

00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:57,750
process how it so that's how we get into

00:04:55,770 --> 00:05:02,669
an environment right for people from

00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:05,810
things not happen when it is connected

00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:09,120
right it'll have to be processed

00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:11,700
remedies I like food oil you can't just

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,250
start making analysis on it you kind of

00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:18,240
start summarizing it you have to process

00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:20,790
it clean it put it in the right State to

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,370
get any major set then go to the

00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:26,550
expiratory stage but why you try to find

00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:28,290
hidden patterns in data and to see what

00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:31,620
you can use that data to solve your

00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:35,130
specific business problem then from

00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:36,570
there based on what you know what

00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:39,330
problem you're trying to solve mean how

00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:41,430
to go back to be person that you try to

00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:43,680
put it in the phone you eat it in to do

00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:48,870
more analysis right in order to have

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:51,479
accurate data analysis so from there and

00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:53,760
also I'll write after having a clean

00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:56,460
dataset you may want to go straight into

00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:59,190
the bottom part depending on what you

00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:01,470
want to build and usually we are either

00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:05,330
creating a data for that in the form of

00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:07,639
a predictive model for example right all

00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:10,550
we are trying to

00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:14,990
crater reports or coming Cape something

00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:16,909
to business leaders key so John Kincaid

00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:19,009
the inside game already touches business

00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:22,009
you get used to make strategic deficient

00:06:19,009 --> 00:06:23,930
and so got business problems so you

00:06:22,009 --> 00:06:26,210
should eyes an arrow pointing back to

00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:28,969
the actual a data product so that's when

00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:31,280
after taking the data to the whole

00:06:28,969 --> 00:06:35,659
process and create a predictive model

00:06:31,280 --> 00:07:05,029
okay you know look at new data in the in

00:06:35,659 --> 00:07:10,370
the environment okay - you can so but

00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:11,870
now this table because an explosion of

00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:14,029
data every second

00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:18,800
billions of tweets flying around

00:07:14,029 --> 00:07:21,529
polluting videos to YouTube and so many

00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:24,110
sorry so much little an hour and then

00:07:21,529 --> 00:07:26,089
there's there's also large cloud storage

00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:28,580
right now we do not limited to our

00:07:26,089 --> 00:07:32,509
physical devices or physical hard drives

00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:34,490
we can be in Africa and storing large

00:07:32,509 --> 00:07:38,629
amounts of data and some pizza center

00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:42,379
somewhere in the US on you and also it

00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:44,270
has been high computing power that had

00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:47,419
computing power that's and it was us

00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:50,089
analyze all these big data sets in

00:07:47,419 --> 00:07:51,729
almost real time to get our inside

00:07:50,089 --> 00:08:03,349
government

00:07:51,729 --> 00:08:08,300
so now we have having so much Dietrich

00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:12,310
coming in at super fast rates and giving

00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:14,560
you so much value we are able to

00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:15,759
there's also internet-of-things think

00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,090
someone mentioned in the previous

00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:21,430
session where now and not just our

00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:23,880
computers are online but you're having

00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:28,240
our physical devices like our fridges

00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:30,639
chairs when footballs right having

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:34,050
senses just used to collect data about

00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:38,409
the environment and transmit all these

00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:40,810
data to be processed right and because

00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:45,010
it's it's streaming in large quantities

00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:47,320
you need the super power to help you do

00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:49,480
all these things in almost real-time so

00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:51,459
I think we should be excited about the

00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:55,029
fighting that's work that about it hits

00:08:51,459 --> 00:08:57,790
us very soon they help us really process

00:08:55,029 --> 00:09:12,220
I feel topically and make sense out of

00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:16,360
all the data so it is just an image that

00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:19,089
I'm missing mention that it opens into

00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:21,339
budget you can also apply anywhere that

00:09:19,089 --> 00:09:24,070
data is generated anywhere in your

00:09:21,339 --> 00:09:27,520
office anywhere that you have the Intel

00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:29,589
you can perform dates and science okay

00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:32,709
so in healthcare it's all sighs no

00:09:29,589 --> 00:09:35,680
obsession any diagnosis and treatment of

00:09:32,709 --> 00:09:39,370
diseases you have medical imaging okay

00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:42,010
when we were two puzzles medical images

00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:43,870
two models and you also predict it's

00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:49,480
amazing to develop a certain kind of

00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:52,480
kind of cancer or it may be going to if

00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:54,820
they are going to measure super simply

00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:58,870
to be healthier also robotic-assisted

00:09:54,820 --> 00:10:02,110
surgery right so through and machine

00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:05,050
learning and deep learning which fall

00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:07,779
under the modeling part of data science

00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:10,839
where we want to have robots access to

00:10:07,779 --> 00:10:13,450
doctors even in surgeries and real-time

00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:16,630
health monitoring okay I spoke about

00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:18,400
sensors you could have sensors on a sick

00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:20,410
patient

00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,630
I had been monitoring everything that

00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:25,450
goes on in our body so that they are

00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:27,400
being able to select help a society but

00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:31,000
I kill them all so production of

00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:33,130
epidemics and diseases in general right

00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:38,140
so maybe based on data from the past

00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:39,670
about training in how these are the

00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:41,440
weather conditions we don't so many

00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:48,130
things are on we can come up with

00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:53,470
predictions so let's get ready to battle

00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:56,380
it so that we in our community so in

00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:59,230
business no matter how much business you

00:10:56,380 --> 00:11:06,339
are doing you can have you usually have

00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:10,960
customers okay and with what I do if you

00:11:06,339 --> 00:11:13,360
gather good data okay what's on it about

00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:16,120
your customers you are able to share

00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,160
them but I'll go to market things see

00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,770
them in a more personalized and she

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:23,050
chopped away you can't keep them coming

00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:24,580
back over over because you know what who

00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:26,560
would need our planting time and you

00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:31,270
might get to see them and if you like

00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:34,480
your genius also efficient business

00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:37,000
operations okay so if you want to reach

00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,880
out and through the party tonight you go

00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,709
to forecast your feels able to know what

00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:43,510
kind of products people and the sensing

00:11:41,709 --> 00:11:46,900
region will be needing at a certain time

00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:50,830
you have just got them covered and now

00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:52,810
mean more business for you I'm not sure

00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:55,529
institutions can make use of data

00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:58,750
science and risk management automation

00:11:55,529 --> 00:12:02,980
prediction of stock market behavior

00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:08,140
fraud detection and all that so if for

00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:12,430
example if you joining a group from

00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:14,529
Ghana or from Accra right usually know

00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:18,160
your password so you don't enter any

00:12:14,529 --> 00:12:21,190
more than once and ATM the banks are

00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:23,860
always collecting data about these

00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:27,730
actions I think okay so if one day you

00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:28,900
realize that and someone is straight or

00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:31,930
you are trying to

00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:35,560
take money or withdraw money for the cut

00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:39,520
in some very strange location that they

00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:41,200
never imagined right or maybe a child or

00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:43,750
maybe the person who had it trying to

00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:46,660
enter a password so many times they may

00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:49,960
be also link all these unusual behaviors

00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:52,570
about that action and flag it sodium

00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:55,270
even block the card and then get back to

00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:57,850
you to check if you were neither one try

00:12:55,270 --> 00:13:01,170
to make that transaction so that's what

00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:05,500
they taught that helps us to do also in

00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:08,620
detecting anomalies detected foot not

00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:21,490
financial institutions so it's not to

00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:25,779
agriculture to fish intelligence for

00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:30,370
pizza machine you know that we can know

00:13:25,779 --> 00:13:33,940
farmers to do position sensors measuring

00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:36,550
pH level water soil moisture contains

00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:39,600
new chains which parts of the crops need

00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:42,490
what kind of nutrients and all that and

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,200
even with the drones rice so it's

00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:48,220
communicated them to know which part of

00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:51,450
it of the piece of land to water with

00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:57,850
what amount of water and even the

00:13:51,450 --> 00:14:02,440
precise 20 of nutrients needed your

00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:04,779
crops you also know exactly what's

00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:09,959
happening and you ought to take exact

00:14:04,779 --> 00:14:09,959
actions that we needed increasing

00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:22,779
watching with the right 20 of what I

00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:24,790
know about you so let those skills and

00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:28,360
opportunities available in their field

00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:31,089
so we have my code so I'm here

00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:33,459
Python okay so you need to know some

00:14:31,089 --> 00:14:36,420
programming skills keep Python is all

00:14:33,459 --> 00:14:37,920
the languages that she can

00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:40,170
if you know you can't be a great

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:43,140
exercise okay I'm not talking about the

00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:46,290
others because today's Piper my toesies

00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:48,480
okay and also knowledge on how to store

00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:53,550
an extract from different sources it's

00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:56,700
very key probability yeah some month day

00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:59,160
also amount of calculus linear algebra

00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:02,940
depending on which area of it massage

00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:05,370
you specialize it also data wrangling

00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:08,580
that's another name for preparation of

00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:10,500
data or transforming data from its

00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:14,310
message state into an acceptable state

00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:15,900
for analysis so it does what they target

00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:18,480
annihilation of communication nobody

00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:21,860
wants to be able to to communicate what

00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:25,260
about inside you get from the data to

00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:28,050
show me cancer people who need insight

00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:30,570
on that data also machine learning that

00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:33,090
the modeling aspect I talked about and

00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:35,900
some social engineering skills don't

00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:43,350
depend on what you're doing

00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:45,180
you also need domain knowledge so for me

00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:51,720
I didn't know much about marketing and

00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:58,130
custom analytics so I know okay so we

00:15:51,720 --> 00:16:04,050
apply these models not also very potent

00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:06,270
so you could be engineering they are

00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:09,950
mostly involved with universe together

00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:13,170
these are storage and with the right

00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:17,540
phone to the analyzer data analysts also

00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:20,460
many focus on the analysis part and

00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:22,020
getting inside of Aviva the machine

00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:24,120
learning the deep learning engineers

00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:28,380
they usually focus on the modeling parts

00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:32,220
right where it was a book predictive

00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:38,790
model she about to they were

00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:41,460
classification models okay to not gain

00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:43,850
from knowledge from the path data that

00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:45,660
you have to be able to make room for

00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:50,280
watching happy

00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:52,620
and the data scientist who tries to do

00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:57,960
almost everything at me so usually

00:16:52,620 --> 00:17:01,080
people see their unicorns so when I

00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:02,970
skills I mentioned I said that you don't

00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:05,579
need to not expected all of them but you

00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:09,030
know what it's not be doing much so for

00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:12,120
example if you take data wrangling it's

00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:17,240
a fifth over they did our knowledge the

00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:17,240
machine learning engineers do not really

00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:23,400
have an ideal but if you work in a team

00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:26,550
with other people you may know that so

00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,900
you had to expect and that caused that

00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:30,390
theater engineers and the data

00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:37,020
scientists would be focusing more on

00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:40,010
that so finally Python tools and a

00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:40,010
community support

00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:46,580
we are also Python community very loving

00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:58,650
people have developed some packages so

00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:01,770
these are not a popular one on private

00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:03,480
satellite we provide the these are

00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:06,810
structures you know kind of light

00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:09,930
amounts of scientific data

00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:12,030
there's also pandas Daniels with

00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:16,110
detecting a preparation but it's almost

00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:19,710
like Microsoft Excel fighting okay and

00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:22,740
this for data visualization the numbers

00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:26,330
that map coordinates see porn Gigi plots

00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:31,350
for statistical analysis starts models

00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:34,970
for machine learning secondly path touch

00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:34,970
test a few in the race

00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:53,880
yes so you know about fifty four percent

00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:57,710
of all data scientists use Python writes

00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,710
it I should tell you that if you want to

00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:02,440
you have a larger community everything

00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:06,880
the piper not be so you should be part

00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:09,790
of life the committee also provided

00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:12,270
easy-to-follow tutorials Rambo's italian

00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:15,640
go online see people writing free

00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:17,680
tutorials for us to follow a name and

00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:22,210
then you also come up with the assets I

00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:23,740
can't no more not skills so a few of

00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:36,900
these coming to that with me already

00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:36,900
more like I did much capital community

00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:47,440
these are also things that you should

00:19:44,550 --> 00:20:11,470
belong to so that you can get in our

00:19:47,440 --> 00:20:13,660
units and also contributes we have so

00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:16,510
much oil rich advanced and here the

00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:18,760
potential to be rich so that even though

00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:21,760
we're not seeing much development from

00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:23,230
that ok let us take advantage Africa

00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,880
let's take advantage of the massive

00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:27,340
amounts of data rich and meeting each

00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:30,640
and every day to the power of data

00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:32,830
science and let's build something for

00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:35,470
ourselves because you keep up in the

00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:38,200
digital age we find ourselves in we have

00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:45,430
to get the charger and we have to get

00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:47,500
inside of my data and we have to yeah we

00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:51,610
have to harness the power of the Assizes

00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:56,080
or not stay relevant in this day of data

00:20:51,610 --> 00:21:01,260
and intelligence all around us so on

00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:01,260
that would I like to see me Bassam

00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:13,460
okay question our feeling you have so

00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,460
many questions

00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:51,180
he thank you very much my name is Philip

00:21:48,480 --> 00:22:02,940
Locke and I want to find out someone who

00:21:51,180 --> 00:22:07,830
is totally starting out at now starting

00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:09,660
out and it depends on who you are if

00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:11,510
you're someone who is able to learn on

00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:14,310
your own

00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:16,650
- breach I'm always not also puts it on

00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:17,780
your own that's also good so if you are

00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:23,190
someone who can

00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:25,650
okay you can start watching videos about

00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:27,930
it right you can start watching general

00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:30,480
videos you get a brought up picture of

00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:32,820
it to know do you know okay so this is

00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,990
where it doesn't fit okay so I'm I'm

00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:37,830
interested in this

00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:42,510
okay I'm interested in it then I command

00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:44,910
that you you take tutorials it gets your

00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:47,100
passing I'm gonna take online tutorials

00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:50,820
got a lot of free tutorials

00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:53,130
okay on okay so in in finding the

00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:55,380
general overview of what these are signs

00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:59,550
those values are you doing funny did you

00:22:55,380 --> 00:23:04,140
know about different parts of other

00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:06,930
steps right you like the the process I

00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:09,030
shoot okay so if you able to go through

00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:11,760
the whole presentation if it wasn't have

00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:12,930
that skills go to download process it

00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,760
means you've done the exact science

00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:17,220
right so I would break it down that way

00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,850
and then I say okay so how can I get

00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:20,250
Nita

00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:22,440
I've here a Python can be useful so how

00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:26,550
can I inspire on to get these nominee

00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:29,490
from an exhaustion to clean the data

00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:33,340
column head of data cleaning this

00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:35,650
analyze the data then those are models

00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:38,200
out of it can I create a data products

00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:40,570
can I create a visualization or a port

00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:43,030
right now I usually look at things then

00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:46,240
okay I see that there's a breakdown of

00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:47,640
its then I try to attack each and every

00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,500
one of them one by one

00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:51,370
right try and master each other one of

00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:56,799
them one by one

00:23:51,370 --> 00:24:01,480
even I work on the project but a project

00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:04,059
out now will touch on all these aspects

00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:06,580
and then I feel like okay I'm good so

00:24:04,059 --> 00:24:10,480
Connecticut cargo challenge or can I try

00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:13,600
something on Ziggy's right so that's for

00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:16,120
if you not to stand on your own keep

00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:18,549
adding it's also important to connect so

00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:20,980
I also recommend you to get a mentor

00:24:18,549 --> 00:24:22,809
someone that you think it's already the

00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:29,770
fuel and is good at it so that's why

00:24:22,809 --> 00:24:32,020
when you come to find people also

00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:45,880
consume that seem like you get some a

00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:47,770
tomato you even do your you get a mentor

00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:49,179
someone who we did get it to help you or

00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:51,460
you can't sign up for some that paid

00:24:49,179 --> 00:24:54,250
courses that you get on my Chinese

00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:58,770
community so that's what I would

00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:58,770
recommend thank you so much

00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:05,559
[Applause]
