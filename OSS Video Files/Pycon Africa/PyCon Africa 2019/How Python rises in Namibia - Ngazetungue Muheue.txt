what afternoon everyone I'm glad to be

00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,160
here

00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:13,759
my name is gathered to move away from

00:00:10,429 --> 00:00:13,759
Windhoek Namibia

00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:20,520
that's my Drita handle if you want to

00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:25,260
talk to me that's my email she want to

00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:28,590
ask more about Python of India okay I'm

00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:31,980
a person program of all days in net and

00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:35,820
do programming I started doing

00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:38,850
programming 2014 started west peasant

00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:43,700
and a new program in Python

00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:47,160
I mean jumbo community editor in Namibia

00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:50,190
in the my co-founder of Python Namibia

00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:52,829
and may computer science student at the

00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:54,930
University of Namibia and I'm a web

00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:58,379
developer a Python and Django instructor

00:00:54,930 --> 00:01:06,659
of personal view and I'm a connoisseur

00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:10,560
PyCon I mean pure since day one the

00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:15,420
brief history on board we as you can see

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:22,830
a morphine Kai accident that spinal cord

00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:25,290
injury c2 fracture on my neck and decide

00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:27,840
all these things I'm coming from the

00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:31,079
remote area of Crete colony and not from

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,600
the city I was raised in Greek colony

00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:35,549
canal region is the region sorry where

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:41,040
most of my tyrannize people coming from

00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:43,350
in Namibia and after this after kegs

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,470
Indian I've been in the hospital for

00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:49,619
nine months without moving and I had

00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:51,689
issue with all these things like doctor

00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:55,829
Nessa's tried to help me in doing things

00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:58,110
and these kind of things then I was

00:01:55,829 --> 00:02:00,570
telling them I hope one day I'll recover

00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:02,850
from this I feel like I have to do

00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:05,670
something that so that I can help myself

00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:08,069
if I found myself I'm not moving if I

00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:09,539
went myself I'm not talking at least I

00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:11,380
should come up with even application

00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:15,890
that will

00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:17,690
that's where the whole team studied and

00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:20,240
you talked to my mother luckily when I

00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:25,070
move in in then by the time I was

00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:26,780
I finished my high school I talked to my

00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:29,420
parents I tried to convince them it was

00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:31,070
hard you know in my community spelling

00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:34,280
within this MVT you are talking about

00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:35,600
schools these dead things you know who

00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,820
is going to help you is going to do

00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:41,480
these who is going to do what but I

00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:44,300
refused I went to a window

00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:49,070
I lied to my mom that I'm going to see

00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:51,350
my doctor for medication because I know

00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:53,240
the other year and it applied to the

00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:55,640
University when I mean via was accepted

00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:57,950
I was just talking to them like this

00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:01,420
only some few guys from the family knew

00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:07,310
about this but I went to the University

00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:08,810
when I came they had no money I went to

00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:11,990
the office of the Prime Minister I

00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:14,030
talked to them I say yes is my paper I

00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:17,960
got accepted at the University and I

00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:20,270
need money you know government budget

00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:22,310
story I told them I'm not going anyway

00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:27,470
what I need just money to go to the

00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:29,510
University finish like you they listen

00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:32,090
to me they gave me money arrange East at

00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:33,680
the University of Namibia and you

00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:36,730
studied there for adjustable computer

00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:39,410
science and what my first qualification

00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:42,350
from day and my first language was

00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:46,370
Python I'm going to pass on I'm not

00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:52,310
hating this that's where the whole thing

00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:54,130
studied this young background does not

00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:57,380
define who you are

00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:58,700
we all know where we came from when we

00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:02,410
have people who want to learn

00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:06,230
programming but they need your support

00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:08,690
our people need us we need to change

00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:11,810
them we need to change the way they

00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:16,360
think and we need to go back to our

00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:16,360
people and teach them Python

00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:26,539
complex code does exists but we do so of

00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:29,000
them we don't care the situation you can

00:04:26,539 --> 00:04:34,190
beam gonna bring your code we can solve

00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:38,960
it you am bikina don't meant you can

00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:42,259
solve it one day the best of Python in

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:45,830
Olympia I say thanks to Raven Software

00:04:42,259 --> 00:04:48,110
Foundation for this I say thanks to a

00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:51,110
Phoenix project of lattice University

00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:56,060
and the University of Namibia from

00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:58,850
painting Python into our country we know

00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:01,280
what we are but do not know what we may

00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:05,330
be all of us here we want to become a

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:10,810
programmer but we don't know what future

00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:14,630
hot for us some of us we have bikina

00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:16,780
but maybe what you are saying that I am

00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:20,800
going to become like a data scientist

00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:20,800
tomorrow you'll be a web developer

00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:29,599
Python Namibia started in 2015 was a

00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:34,330
collaboration of Cardiff University in

00:05:29,599 --> 00:05:37,150
UK and the University of Namibia and

00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:40,550
that's how the whole thing started

00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:44,630
during that conference we decided to

00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:48,500
come together to start the Society of

00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:50,840
the organization called panel panel

00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:54,620
visually it's a Python Namibia society

00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:56,990
the word panel tells python Namibia - so

00:05:54,620 --> 00:06:00,800
that we can organize and monitor or

00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:04,220
Python activity within a country we see

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:09,229
together we set up our own structure to

00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:13,099
suit everyone teacher Elena's parents

00:06:09,229 --> 00:06:19,720
and it's aside it's off we get our own

00:06:13,099 --> 00:06:19,720
executive member then everything started

00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:31,780
yes still we still have our own things

00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:34,900
our society started waking but we have

00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:37,630
my own name in fear when I actually

00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:41,620
managed by the community member in some

00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:43,360
international friends one thing I bought

00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:47,010
a peg when I'm Indian anyway is very

00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:49,660
small country surrounded paint is that

00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:54,190
we are to win five million people lives

00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:58,390
in Namibia I think yeah 400 or 500

00:06:54,190 --> 00:07:01,270
people lives in the city new in Duke can

00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:04,060
talk about remote area our conference

00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:07,870
it's mostly attended by women's 50% of

00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:10,690
our participants are women and young

00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:13,810
ones people from high school because in

00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:15,600
our curriculum we set up our him in such

00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:17,770
a way that it can accommodate everyone

00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:23,350
has cool enough people from the

00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:27,150
community parents and us it involves

00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:29,620
collars collars people from high school

00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:31,450
the cool thing about Nigel name is a

00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:35,970
beautiful holiday destinations

00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:40,570
that's way you find ocean meat desert

00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:42,850
that's where you find a second Kenyan in

00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:45,790
the world fish river canyon that's where

00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:51,160
you will find indeed very way everything

00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:54,150
ends these are the executives of our

00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:57,700
society and these are the people who run

00:07:54,150 --> 00:08:01,050
most of our activity only some some of

00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:06,240
them some of them they are not around

00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:10,120
they also connect up icon or Namibia and

00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:13,770
some other people from the community we

00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:17,980
are all volunteer and not paid for this

00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:21,030
less of person in Namibia talking about

00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:26,310
Python in Namibia

00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:29,010
okay when we set up our own plenum

00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:31,590
society or the group we decided it

00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:33,300
because when we studied we started

00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:35,760
teaching people the basic stuff

00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:39,599
then later on we realized that many

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:41,880
people all of us we have desire some

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,500
people want to become a developer some

00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,720
people want to become data scientists

00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:48,360
something they want to go to a

00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,580
machine-learning type of things then we

00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:53,490
decided to come up with in different

00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:55,980
crews and if we have our strongest group

00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:57,720
with called Panem Skouras this is our

00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:00,300
weapons that's why people saying that

00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:02,160
Namibia performing well in pythons these

00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:06,360
are the people that we use is that a

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:08,190
young one we believe that there's no

00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,740
engine there is no future without a

00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:13,860
young one in whatever you are doing you

00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:16,170
have to involve young people in this

00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:17,910
conference next next year or the other

00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:21,860
year we want to see young people from

00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:24,330
the high schools also want in the region

00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:28,440
we do have in Django and I mean yeah

00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:33,839
that was my I know we fell for this

00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:36,089
I talk to executives about this jungle

00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,740
maybe I think for two years trying to

00:09:36,089 --> 00:09:40,290
convince them so that we didn't have in

00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:44,810
Java community within our country and

00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:48,750
really accepted my request I run that

00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:50,850
django django Namibia jungles we won't

00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:53,760
talk about you know girls we know it's

00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:56,490
all over during our conference and we

00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:59,010
used to have our own meetup in workshop

00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:02,960
a software carpentry actually this one's

00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:06,650
for academic research mostly it read by

00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:09,810
Jessica in pipelines we have a polarity

00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:12,030
Panem attrition divisions in painted of

00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:15,720
the dumpee we set up those club next

00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:17,700
month Panem scholars panel scholars with

00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,040
asserted that data was strongest within

00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:22,290
that we have it's a subgroup annum

00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:24,620
society it was established 2016

00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:28,620
it managed by Penniman school Anna's

00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:32,720
it's Queen Wharf into into this more

00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:34,090
than 78 Lena register for Panem Skouras

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,310
it

00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:38,290
yep the venoms can have their own

00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:40,480
executive team it learned their own

00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:43,450
things they have their own structures

00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,710
what we do we just monitor them do this

00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:46,630
and do this and do this

00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:48,280
this people what didn't do is that they

00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:52,150
come up with a different project a

00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:54,190
different project then actually we

00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:56,320
introduced them to a dual life project

00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:58,750
we teaching them the basic we bring in

00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,360
like the real life project they work on

00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:05,680
net they've got got opportunity to see

00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:07,900
the new life project this is the editor

world and the University and also I talk

00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:00,880
about the programming competition here

00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:06,770
you serve the different project that

00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:09,410
some of this lena i waved one kind of

00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:13,970
like using a recipe by sending message

00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:17,090
to two people you think using someone of

00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:19,610
our service provider and you'll just

00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:24,520
work with a rust-free playing some real

00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:28,850
things it's just stuff just stuff okay

00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:31,520
it's not about Panem's Cora we do have a

00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:33,500
platform community outside our society

00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,380
when do we have other people from the

00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:39,800
community that runs their own stuff

00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:43,310
about patent mostly web development in

00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:46,880
data science academic research in hair

00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:49,130
school goes in some university they

00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:51,050
start teaching Python now you see all

00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:53,240
these people didn't know of us they

00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:57,400
always calling us to come forward and

00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:57,400
also help them to get

00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:06,089
and get them and we are willing to do

00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:07,980
that we don't really give up because we

00:14:06,089 --> 00:14:09,870
know this these people they come up with

00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:12,089
these groups some turn some they make

00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:14,459
money out of it but we don't man we want

00:14:12,089 --> 00:14:17,310
to group s on within a country we don't

00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:19,649
remind about it and these things led in

00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:21,540
case if you have your own society and

00:14:19,649 --> 00:14:23,910
these other people set your society that

00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:26,640
needs your help please go don't say that

00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:28,709
and you guys you don't belong to us what

00:14:28,709 --> 00:14:38,670
community please what make it possible

00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:40,410
teamwork this is one of the important

00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:44,250
things if you have a society if you want

00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:46,050
to start your society you can have five

00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:51,420
people people come with a different

00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:54,360
agenda and some people will be in your

00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:55,980
society and tell you that okay we want

00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,519
to make money we are not here to make

00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,860
money

00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:01,350
we are here to teach people you find

00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:03,990
some people saying that no because you

00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:07,260
want us to wait and teach people please

00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:11,160
let's try to charge people and bodies in

00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:13,260
Python Namibia when don't do that if we

00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:16,560
get money from people we make sure we

00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:18,980
use their money for their own good we

00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:21,660
impair things that would benefit to them

00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:24,720
trust one thing that when you are kind

00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:27,480
when you are dealing with a button

00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,490
community and a Panem Skouras you have

00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:32,970
to create that relationship between

00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:34,680
parents Lena and the school without

00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:37,290
balance you are not going to do anything

00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:40,260
without parents you never bring those

00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:41,790
kids to your events you need to create

00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:44,040
that relationship whether they didn't

00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:47,750
achieve you you will never wait to have

00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,750
a Panem score and also in your country

00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:55,860
commitment we committed for this we say

00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:59,490
yes to this and every time we are there

00:15:55,860 --> 00:16:03,269
for them workshop meet up in heck net

00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:05,160
thing this one is known international

00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:08,040
friends we need help we talk to them we

00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:10,380
call them and they helped us and we

00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:14,180
involve in this mailing list by the

00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:15,680
mailing list please do so

00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:18,440
to also help you to grow better in your

00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:20,800
community because you need you get

00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:23,960
address from other people from different

00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:27,140
country or background a school outreach

00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:28,970
programs it also helped us because there

00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:31,640
you go art and you talk to different

00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:34,460
schools and that's the only way that you

00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:36,800
are going to get people to come and join

00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:39,140
your society and that is the only way to

00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:44,020
go and talk to different schools so that

00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:44,020
they can start their own python skoura

00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:50,410
storage lack of resources

00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:53,570
actually this is everywhere in Africa

00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:56,990
you got you go to the schools these

00:16:53,570 --> 00:17:01,780
people have nothing then we end up using

00:16:56,990 --> 00:17:04,550
our own computer to teach them Python

00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:07,459
meant that our industry was dominated by

00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:12,490
in Java people they still have dead

00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:12,490
things in your mind what is person

00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:18,640
commitment

00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:22,190
wherever you go you can have 100

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:24,950
executive member maybe sometimes only

00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:26,839
two will show up to events if your

00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:28,720
people are not committed you will never

00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:32,900
go anyway

00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:35,570
lack of support if you don't have

00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:38,960
support from your own government you

00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:40,580
will suffer from this sometimes you need

00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,110
to manage like now we are going to have

00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:44,660
a Python week of code and we need

00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:46,550
transport our government is not enough

00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:48,170
we have to pay for this people are

00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:50,570
traveling from different town to come to

00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:52,610
the city and we have to get this from

00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:54,710
our own pocket and also we have to read

00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:58,040
to the peasant software foundation to

00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:59,960
get money for this because we are here

00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:04,760
for all our people and we can't leave

00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:06,380
people acted a way for what ability next

00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:09,410
two month when we will start a parity

00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:11,480
next month we we are planning to have a

00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:13,610
person hub in our country because

00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:17,330
currently now we are ending our activity

00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:20,660
the university we are using University

00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:22,430
venue and we don't like that we know

00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:23,960
sometimes you want to teach people were

00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:25,029
telling you no we have our own classes

00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,859
we have our own

00:18:25,029 --> 00:18:28,599
these kind of things and we feel like we

00:18:26,859 --> 00:18:30,759
might we should have our own person half

00:18:28,599 --> 00:18:32,769
whether it kind of like academic things

00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:34,119

00:18:32,769 --> 00:18:36,819
them will be same classes

00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:42,489

and it's an African thing however I

00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:44,720
noticed a thought of building a Python

00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:47,690
hub I wanna do that because you already

00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:50,570

00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:15,770
I talked about because you already

00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:18,350
mentioned about not getting the help of

00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:20,750
your government and then you talked

00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:23,150
about getting help from P yourself but

00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:26,630
then I know that building a hub which is

00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:29,390
a house and equipping it with some

00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:31,850
computers is a huge amount of fun

00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:34,820
involved how do you intend to go about

00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:40,760
getting such fun did you do that we have

00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:44,140
now we feel like um our aim we want to

00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:47,360
have like and off we have like kind of

00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:49,610
let me let me say put like a school

00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:52,850
whereby we are going to teach Python and

00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:54,140
for that matter like in that case if we

00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:56,750
are giving learning our own tutorial

00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:59,210
people I'm going to base for this and we

00:21:56,750 --> 00:22:02,230
are generating money out of this that's

00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:04,790
one thing that we are planing okay

00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:06,830
another thing is that when we are

00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:09,530
connecting like a person week of course

00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:11,870
a person week of code is it's kind of a

00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:14,420
conference for local people which means

00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:16,520
people buy ticket for this and when

00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:18,740
people buy a ticket the money that we

00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:21,230
are getting we are taking back to the

00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:24,020
community when don't cut like us we

00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:26,850
don't get paid for this we do these

00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:30,240
things for free since 2015

00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:33,630
and never get anything from person I

00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:35,700
mean yeah I spent my own money I have to

00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:38,400
go around and don't get paid for this

00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:40,950
and the treatment that we get we take it

00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:43,650
back to their society that's how we do

00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:47,550
well like we used to organize our own

00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:50,640
events without any money from even our

00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:53,430
own people but we get these people from

00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,770
other town and we pay for them to come

00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:59,040
in that in the event our meetup or walks

00:22:55,770 --> 00:23:05,880
walk our aims just to teach persons we

00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:15,740
don't care any other questions for Harry

00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:19,200
oh hey um I have a question for you yeah

00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:21,420
the capital city in in Namibia has only

00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,580
a few I think two or three hundred

00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:27,200
thousand people living in it and the

00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:31,200
population is spread over rural areas so

00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:33,390
how how can maybe have faced this

00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:36,660
challenge of having a very thinly

00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:40,650
distributed population when of course is

00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:43,680
much easier if everybody is together you

00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:46,430
know one things that we that's why we we

00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:49,380
decided to come up with a pen arm scorer

00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:52,920
because we know that there's no way that

00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:56,640
the school is moving from one turn to

00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:59,490
another which means that we used like a

00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:01,140
teachers we get a teacher from different

00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:03,660
schools these are the people who are

00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:05,700
behind all the scoring different schools

00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:08,430
which means that every time we want to

00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:10,940
communicate to them we go through

00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:10,940
teachers

00:24:13,029 --> 00:24:18,999
I think your question live I'm wondering

00:24:16,749 --> 00:24:21,809
about the the challenge is Namibia's

00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:24,909
geography make small your plans which

00:24:21,809 --> 00:24:28,749
here we must with huge distances between

00:24:24,909 --> 00:24:29,979
everything that is one of the biggest

00:24:28,749 --> 00:24:34,709
challenge that we have in our country

00:24:29,979 --> 00:24:38,979
because our country is kind of isolated

00:24:34,709 --> 00:24:41,829
let me say that it's very small but down

00:24:38,979 --> 00:24:44,019
are far from each other let me say if

00:24:41,829 --> 00:24:49,899
you are hosting like event in Windhoek

00:24:44,019 --> 00:24:54,339
people have to drive 8 100 kilometer 800

00:24:49,899 --> 00:24:57,069
kilometer and it's kind of a big

00:24:54,339 --> 00:25:00,609
challenge and you have to use money for

00:24:57,069 --> 00:25:02,939
this we need to them those guys we said

00:25:00,609 --> 00:25:05,499
that we wait we open a pen homescholar

00:25:02,939 --> 00:25:07,089
but you are the one who created their

00:25:05,499 --> 00:25:11,679
problems and we have to deal with that

00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:13,779
problem that is a big challenges money

00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:16,419
to bring these people to us is the main

00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:19,179
one of the problems that we face in our

00:25:16,419 --> 00:25:23,109
country and another problems in our

00:25:19,179 --> 00:25:26,139
country many of our and what people live

00:25:23,109 --> 00:25:28,869
in --mode areas we don't have access to

00:25:26,139 --> 00:25:31,719
electricity we only have access to the

00:25:28,869 --> 00:25:33,099
Internet and sometimes it's also hard to

00:25:31,719 --> 00:25:38,109
deal with these things people want to

00:25:33,099 --> 00:25:40,239
learn Python but they have nothing now

00:25:38,109 --> 00:25:42,669
you have to convince talk to parents and

00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:44,739
say can you train me this place looks

00:25:42,669 --> 00:25:47,499
very smart if you move him to turn and

00:25:44,739 --> 00:25:50,769
you know just to trying to make things

00:25:47,499 --> 00:25:52,209
work there to move people from this town

00:25:50,769 --> 00:25:53,859
to another turn so that way you are

00:25:52,209 --> 00:25:56,109
going to have access to the way you're

00:25:53,859 --> 00:26:02,249
going to be able to talk to them or use

00:25:56,109 --> 00:26:02,249
them thank you very much

00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:09,510
now although since I don't see any sign

00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:14,829
it could be arriving

00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:14,829
