Playlist: PyCon Africa 2019
Description: 
	One of the biggest challenge for most companies today is finding the right talents. Tech communities on the other hand are gradually becoming the incubation ground for developing tech talents. Kelvin's talk seeks to address the disconnection between both worlds & suggest ways to bridge the talent gap.

hi everyone I really enjoyed NICs

00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:10,530
session you know the interesting thing

00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:13,530
is sometimes you pick up your code you

00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:16,529
code your you've written for like three

00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:19,020
to three months ago and you're trying to

00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:21,029
figure out what is happening like you

00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:24,750
don't even know what's going on around

00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:27,960
the code so it's very important we know

00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:30,510
how to organize our code and make it

00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,489
more readable all right

00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:34,860
today I'll be talking about bridging the

00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:37,800
talent gap between Python communities

00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:42,530
and industry and I think this is really

00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:47,700
really important because I I think

00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:51,239
developers need money we all we all need

00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:55,530
money right well we wanted to get gigs

00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:57,449
we want needs to get jobs and after all

00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:00,719
your coding and every effort you put

00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:03,989
into coding it's also important that you

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,960
get the job get the gig and all that so

00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:10,080
and that's why I'm here today to talk

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:14,040
about bridging the gap the talent gap

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:18,270
between parent communities and the

00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:21,210
industry so my introduction my name is

00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:24,930
Calvin Calvin Anya a material scientist

00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:27,390
I I and also business intelligence

00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:29,720
person I have Co interest in data

00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:32,220
science and machine learning and

00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:35,009
everything around the AI space I

00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:41,159
currently hate the data analytics for

00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:43,140
one's resolutions okay so passionate

00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:45,720
about building tech communities I

00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:49,710
currently serve as the lead for Python

00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:53,280
Nigeria the Python Nigeria community and

00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:55,829
also very involved as a co organizer for

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:59,490
pilot a leaders a community of data

00:01:55,829 --> 00:02:03,000
scientist in Lagos Nigeria okay

00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:07,590
I'm a big fan of planting

00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:10,410
I love that in it interesting thing it

00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:12,480
becomes in different forms and you just

00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:15,180

you can tweet at me so I'm here to talk

00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:35,970
about that I mean talk about how we can

00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:40,110
bridge the gap between the developers

00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:42,360
community and the industry and while I'm

00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:45,780
here to network with you to talk about

00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:48,510
it I also have a second mission and a

00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:51,060
quick one you might want you might be

00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:53,430
wondering like what that mission is

00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:55,800
about like what is the second mission do

00:02:53,430 --> 00:03:00,050
you have come into my corn Africa and I

00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:05,700
think I it's interesting I talk about it

00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:07,530
did you love war so over time a whole

00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:11,610
lot have been going on over years

00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:13,680
there's been this thing about between my

00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:16,739
country Nigeria and Ghana who make the

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,900
best jollof rice and for for those who

00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:22,370
don't know jollof is actually delicacy

00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:26,250
of rice delicacy I'm in this side and

00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:28,980
it's been a whole lot of front and back

00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:32,489
who make the best door between my

00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:36,989
country and gana I'm not here to tell

00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:39,239
you that but then so over the years and

00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:41,910
when when Mark Zuckerberg came in to

00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:44,850
Nigeria in 2016 he made mention of the

00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:47,010
istead boots but Jalal fan he had some

00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:52,260
interesting things to say about boots

00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:55,950
but then then when Richard Quest

00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:57,630
it was CNN journalist came to Nigeria I

00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:00,360
said something like this said jollof

00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:02,970
rice he said the telogen delicious

00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:05,070
cannon antenna which is the best and a

00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:07,930
lot of conversations the whole world you

00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:09,640
who do love war started

00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:12,489
and everybody tried to defend his

00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:15,099
original and them and we have things

00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:17,829
like this and somebody say hey don't

00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:19,750
fall for that yellow fits hide gonadal

00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:22,320
or face the truth and the whole truth

00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:28,690
are nothing but the truth

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:32,470
we are gree with that okay but but then

00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:34,509
that's not all then recently Beyonce

00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:39,330
featured a few night if you African

00:04:34,509 --> 00:04:43,090
artiste and she had only one Canyon and

00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:45,550
this person said it's simply because we

00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:49,680
have the best girl off so since

00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:52,240
Nigerians featured and only one Canyon I

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,009
don't know about the whole the whole

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,590
world keep going and going front and

00:04:54,009 --> 00:05:00,280
back nobody seems to be winning but then

00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:02,410
and my mission second mission being here

00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:04,180
is to come and have a taste of that

00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:06,340
yellow because I believe the taste of

00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:09,160
the protein is in the eating

00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:11,500
right something like that so I need to

00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:13,330
be a gorge myself I can't sit back and

00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:15,550
we see on Twitter and somebody say I'm

00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:18,220
ganna jollof is the best or something so

00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:20,680
I want to have a taste of both worlds

00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:24,520
now so I can make a good judgment

00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:26,380
so Ghana is your time to show to me what

00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:30,460
it means like to eat the garnet your

00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:33,940
life I'm looking forward to that so the

00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:37,150
focus of my talk is on only week one so

00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:39,190
I want to examine the current disparity

00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:42,280
between the developers community and the

00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:43,900
industry both words are not really in

00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:46,860
tune they are not communicating in the

00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:50,530
same language the industries on its own

00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:53,500
developers community I I really look

00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:56,949
forward that we have hiring managers and

00:05:53,500 --> 00:06:01,419
HR persons in this conference I and I

00:05:56,949 --> 00:06:03,820
doubt if we have most of them here but I

00:06:01,419 --> 00:06:06,930
think this is the conversation that has

00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:10,870
always been where we have the people who

00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:12,880
we are intending to build solution

00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:15,760
the business guys the guys that would

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:18,460
hire you to do stuff for them we don't

00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:20,800
have them in our mist we just go ahead

00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:23,440
and talk about our code talk about how

00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,440
we can implement our code and these guys

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,210
are also on the other side they're

00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,780
trying to mean figure out things for

00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:32,080
themselves

00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:35,560
so I'll talk about how to identify the

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:38,740
missing link between both words because

00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:40,420
there's a missing link then our address

00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:42,970
the challenges and concerns of the

00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:45,160
companies of the industry when they are

00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:47,380
seeking tech talents and dealing with

00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:49,870
tech communities have been very active

00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:53,620
we take communities have had the

00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:56,530
opportunity of engaging companies and to

00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:59,740
support community initiatives or to get

00:06:56,530 --> 00:07:01,480
talent from my community I be sharing a

00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:02,670
few of that experience with you guys

00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:06,670
today

00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:08,980
okay then I'll talk about building the

00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:12,790
talent pipeline this is really really

00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:15,280
important because aside we just have in

00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:17,020
communities we have our meat hogs we

00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,780
have our boot camps we have a

00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:23,590
conferences I think it becomes

00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:26,050
imperative for us to start thinking how

00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:28,960
to become the incubation ground for

00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:31,890
talents and turn out the same to the

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:34,540
industry so the industry look up to us

00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:37,480
to put men for talent

00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:39,690
so we basically serve as the incubation

00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:43,320
branch our source talent to the industry

00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:45,970
so then I'll share if I turn and area

00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:50,080
experience then I address a few things

00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:55,090
about the Intel inter-community synergy

00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:56,980
I am aware a few of community leaders

00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:58,990
are also here that it's going to be

00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:03,010
something you'd be much interested so

00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:05,200
where are we the disparities between the

00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:09,700
developers community and the industry

00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:12,490
where we okay accomplished a is short

00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:14,860
story about my job hunting experience in

00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:17,460
2017 i I

00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:20,550
I was looking out for job position

00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:21,300
and if friend sent me link and I got

00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:23,460
that link

00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:26,250
I was so much interested it was a

00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:29,160
fainter company in my country so it was

00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:31,199
they have very interesting stuff and

00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:33,300
they were working on a financial

00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:36,120
inclusion absolutely like a bill a

00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:39,000
credit scoring algorithm to predict if

00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:43,339
huge if you are eligible to be to be

00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,540
back alone as a data scientist or arson

00:08:43,339 --> 00:08:47,070
somebody who is just getting into the

00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:50,240
data science but I find it very

00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:54,600
interesting I put out for that job and

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:58,260
good for me afterwards like two days

00:08:54,600 --> 00:09:02,279
afterwards I got a call from them we had

00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:04,260
a first interview on phone ask me about

00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:06,089
my background I told them my background

00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:09,480
in computer science and we talked about

00:09:06,089 --> 00:09:12,180
my experience as a data scientist what I

00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:14,790
intend to do and we discussed all that

00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:18,200
then we talked about my knowledge about

00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:20,520
the FinTech space and how do I think

00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,529
data science should be applicable in

00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:27,450
different tech space so we did all that

00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:29,690
so I had that first interview then I got

00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:31,500
an email

00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:33,870
congratulations you made it to the

00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:36,149
second round of the interview you you

00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:38,370
did wonderful the way we like what we

00:09:36,149 --> 00:09:41,480
see and we want to continue with you

00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:44,070
then we had the next one was a project

00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:47,370
sending a bunch of data to me I looked

00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:49,800
into those data I'm supposed to clean up

00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:52,470
that data basically I did exploratory

00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:55,440
data analysis on that on that bunch of

00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:59,640
data to come up with some insight I find

00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:02,399
in that data so I did that spend like 33

00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:06,690
days working on that project and I sent

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:08,880
it back to them so a few days afterwards

00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:10,589
I got another email we are interested in

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,959
what you're doing we like what you've

00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:15,630
done we fight we fight find it

00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:18,590
interesting want to have take you to the

00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:23,270
next round of interview so I quit I had

00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:26,210
in it Skype call to guys reached out and

00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:28,070
we did that interview in Skype he talked

00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:31,040
about my experience they talked about

00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:33,410
how I went about doing that and it was

00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:36,080
really really interesting talking to

00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:38,060
them that's the third interview then the

00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:40,970
final interview was be coming to the

00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:45,070
office so I had to go down to the office

00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:45,070
and I met them so we had this interview

00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:54,400
but the unfortunate thing after 40 years

00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:57,380
of interview I never got picked why

00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:59,000
these guys went into a boot camp they

00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:01,580
would see boot camp that came up so they

00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,200
went into it would come they believe the

00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:06,050
a bunch of data scientists in the boot

00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:09,680
camps who after that boot camp they had

00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:12,440
a project the to talk and they checked

00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:14,050
out the first five persons at the top of

00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:18,290
the lead but for those who are

00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:21,050
conversant with Cargill competition so

00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:23,470
so top of the lip board so they picked

00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:28,130
the first five persons on the lip but

00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:30,350
now my concern is is that just a perfect

00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:32,870
fit to pick your dear scientist or

00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:35,000
somebody to work with you and after all

00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:36,530
that interview process after all the

00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,280
first the second the third and the

00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:41,839
fourth interview process I'm here

00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:45,260
because I have not talked on the lip

00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:47,540
board amount so it's a challenging

00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:49,760
experience and that's why I'm here to be

00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:52,220
talking about how do we really bridge

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:55,280
this gap that's case one then secondly

00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:57,110
this case two you might not find

00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,970
something like this if it's not

00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:01,070
perfectly something like this maybe

00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:04,160
something related to what you've seen in

00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:08,930
some job descriptions so many crazy

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:11,780
stuff okay and you basically somebody

00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:14,690
trying to look for somebody we see

00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:16,339
jack-of-all-trades you know you put up

00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:18,589
something looking for a Python

00:12:16,339 --> 00:12:21,230
development basically he wants you to

00:12:18,589 --> 00:12:23,510
know other languages you want you to be

00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:25,940
you I us person we want you to have

00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:28,790
knowledge and divorce you also want you

00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:29,980
to be somebody who could do a whole lot

00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:32,800
when you

00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:35,860
testing and all that so basically we

00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:39,490
have the industry people who are over

00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:42,190
there who sit back and go to some blog

00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:43,870
go to some website and copy job

00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:46,960
descriptions because they think it's

00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:50,680
cool then top it there then they ask

00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:52,650
developers to apply for it and then when

00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:58,000
these guys put up this job description

00:12:52,650 --> 00:13:01,240
is out of you the feel cool they feel

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,850
like we've done that and like let's just

00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:06,940
get the applications coming in let's

00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:10,150
have these talents coming in because we

00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:13,390
already have a job description then but

00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:18,970
unfortunately on the other side of the

00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:22,530
device to develop rise let's focus I see

00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:26,380
that I grab some popcorn and I'm like

00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:32,500
what's this about I'm not interested

00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:35,410
okay so I just sit back and make do with

00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:38,640
my popcorn and I'm not interested if you

00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:42,220
want of a UI US person you go get one

00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:45,340
you want a deeper person go get one so

00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:47,830
why make me a jack of everything with so

00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:49,630
much expectation from me which I don't

00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:51,940
even know how much you're going to pay

00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:54,610
me thou comest rate with so much you're

00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:58,780
demanding from me I grab my popcorn i

00:13:54,610 --> 00:14:01,870
watch my TV I keep up coding okay so

00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:04,180
what's the result of both of this I gave

00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:08,320
you two scenarios my job hunting

00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:13,390
experience and a second case study about

00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:16,930
what the harkaman thr peasants what they

00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:19,920
really think a Python developer should

00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:23,560
be they come up with all that ridiculous

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:25,270
job description ten years experience you

00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:28,420
know somehow you wander like the same

00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:30,880
guy who is putting up that it's not even

00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:33,089
a venturi years experience which way it

00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:35,910
is but it was somebody

00:14:33,089 --> 00:14:39,259
experience as a Python developer okay

00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:43,920
then what is the result of both of these

00:14:39,259 --> 00:14:46,339
so so the result is this so we have

00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:49,829
candidates who are qualified for a role

00:14:46,339 --> 00:14:52,110
who are evaluated wrongly because

00:14:49,829 --> 00:14:55,139
meaning because of our realistic

00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:58,860
expectation from the industry or

00:14:55,139 --> 00:15:01,800
realistic expectation from HR peasants

00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:04,860
because the fact is they don't really

00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:06,649
know what is going on in and you see

00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:10,110
developments or spend time developing

00:15:06,649 --> 00:15:13,529
expertise I mean picking up different

00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:15,689
courses on udemy on Udacity and keep

00:15:13,529 --> 00:15:18,389
studying doing a lot of stuff or

00:15:15,689 --> 00:15:20,910
teaching a portfolio and these guys are

00:15:18,389 --> 00:15:23,759
just there to use a different

00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:27,360
methodology or different paradigm to

00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:29,790
judge you and I think that is not really

00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,249
cool and I think it because of the

00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:35,339
disparity between both worlds that we

00:15:32,249 --> 00:15:38,790
haven't something like this yes after a

00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:41,550
row remain on field so we see job this

00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:44,569
job pupas didn't keep coming over and

00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:48,449
over again because they didn't get that

00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:51,420
perfect rockhead person that would all

00:15:48,449 --> 00:15:54,420
day the rock star that would do all that

00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:57,149
job for them and I think it's a serious

00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:59,069
thing so new developers they are not

00:15:57,149 --> 00:16:01,589
giving up they are not given a chance to

00:15:59,069 --> 00:16:04,019
develop the expertise so we have people

00:16:01,589 --> 00:16:06,959
young persons who have that expertise

00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:09,720
they've learned some good stuff that

00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:12,569
should be integrated in a team so they

00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:15,240
pick up more experience along the line

00:16:12,569 --> 00:16:17,370
these guys are not given opportunity to

00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:20,610
do anything because they have been

00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:22,800
charged with some with some method with

00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:26,579
some approach that doesn't really

00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:29,759
support good words so then more

00:16:26,579 --> 00:16:33,120
potential talents are left unemployed so

00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:35,189
so I get this over and over in the

00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,540
pattern and your community good normal

00:16:35,189 --> 00:16:38,670
persons reach out to me I need

00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:43,829
internship I need internship

00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:44,750
okay but then when you say you you refer

00:16:43,829 --> 00:16:47,330
them

00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:49,640
you just true-true them out and feel

00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:51,980
like who you you are not your rock style

00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:55,610
it the rocks that were needed but then

00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:57,980
it's hard building those skills and you

00:16:55,610 --> 00:17:00,770
just need to give somebody leverage the

00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:02,810
opportunity to to be integrated and a

00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:05,300
team to learn a few stuff and sometimes

00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:08,390
in less than a few months some of these

00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:10,610
lessons can easily pickups disk use and

00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:13,850
become very good and comfortable at it

00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:16,360
and I think we should do something so

00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:16,360
who is to blame

00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:24,800
the hiring managers HR presence I was

00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:27,740
supposed to flip them for this for the

00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:29,870
Stanley talents then we have talents so

00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:31,970
heightened communities have talents and

00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:34,520
we have the HR we have the industry

00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:37,670
guides they have the leader this talent

00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:39,830
and now both words are not talking the

00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:43,370
same speaking the same language and the

00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:46,400
problem I just highlighted so who is to

00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:50,240
blame but the truth is just nobody to

00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:53,870
blame because I am into business to be

00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:56,060
to do to to make profits okay and so

00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:58,610
talent is very important to me but then

00:17:56,060 --> 00:18:00,800
if I don't know how best to get

00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:01,880
experienced or get those talents it

00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:04,580
becomes a challenge

00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:06,320
um I need talent but then I don't know

00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:08,480
how best to go about getting something

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,850
trust me one of the most difficult

00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:15,200
things we have today is hiring a tech

00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:17,540
talent okay especially it could one okay

00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:20,060
and a few ones who are extremely good

00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:22,430
I trust me you might have to pay

00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:26,690
everything from from your earnings to

00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:31,100
get them so so what's the missing link

00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:32,870
here now the missing link the missing

00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:35,150
link is basically the lack of synergy

00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:37,400
between the developers communities are

00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:40,040
the industries so we have Python

00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:43,370
communities here and I think we should

00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:45,860
start rethinking how do we engage the

00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:49,400
industry such that we on the same page

00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:52,190
when it comes to hiring talents and this

00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:55,070
is the reason why I'm giving this talk

00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:55,840
so we could have a way of immense

00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:59,200
energized

00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:02,440
we did with the industry and see how we

00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:04,360
can um develop talents and develop as

00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:06,580
communities and and the good thing is

00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:10,180
that they are supposed to be the bridge

00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:12,880
the bridge to foster the synergy okay so

00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:14,920
the developers community own they have

00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,080
those talents we have the people who are

00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:23,050
just coming in and we are supposed to be

00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:25,990
that building a bridge that gap to a few

00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:30,220
stats and maybe we understand what is

00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:32,740
going on so a company called conferee a

00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:34,960
leading talent management firm based in

00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:37,510
the u.s. predicted that there will be a

00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:41,460
global shortage of as much as 85 million

00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:44,260
tech talents by 22 in 2030

00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:49,180
that's approximately the size of the

00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:51,250
population of champion so we have so

00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:54,580
much job opportunities that are going to

00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:57,610
be available and can be filled and these

00:19:54,580 --> 00:20:00,040
are some of the things that we should be

00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:02,350
thinking about how do we want to apply

00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:04,420
the current talents we have within the

00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:06,790
community how do we bring in more

00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:09,640
persons which is really really important

00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:11,920
tourism now the communities to the

00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:14,590
rescue so while the demand for tech

00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:17,530
talents and oppai companies increases

00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:19,810
exponentially by the day communities on

00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:22,030
the other hand gradually become the

00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:25,200
incubation grant for developing tech

00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:27,910
talent and I'm very sure for most of the

00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:30,070
communities represented here you have

00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:31,900
people who are interested you're people

00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:33,730
who come for your me table and these

00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:36,790
persons are interested in learning some

00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:39,100
of these technologies okay so it's a

00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:42,760
proof of its a proof of concept the fact

00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:46,870
that the arming developers community can

00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:51,160
be that building ground for talent for

00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:54,310
the industry okay quickly take a quote

00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:58,300
from a McCarthy book is the head of

00:20:54,310 --> 00:21:00,220
development program at face book he

00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:02,890
wrote a very interesting article I don't

00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:06,190
know if anyone here read that is called

00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:08,070
boiling the ocean now boiling the ocean

00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:11,250
is talking about

00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:13,260
how do you get talents how do companies

00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:16,350
get talent when there are no talents

00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:18,660
okay so every company don't want to go

00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:20,610
pick up somebody and brush the person

00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:22,950
off and at the end of the day you lose

00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:24,600
that talent nobody wants to invest in

00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:26,700
training a talent and at the end of the

00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:29,040
day some of the company can poach that

00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:31,320
talent from you we are all in open

00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:33,870
reserve nobody want to go about

00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:36,150
developing talents nobody want to spend

00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:40,260
so much money in that and at the end of

00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:42,540
the day they don't know so then McAfee

00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:44,910
who said something very interesting in

00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:46,920
his article COBOL in the ocean you could

00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:48,780
google that is that reach out to

00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:51,330
developers in the community before they

00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:57,080
come to ask for job and I think this is

00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:59,610
very very important because hiring

00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:02,280
traditional we might be very difficult

00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:05,790
for some companies so you put out the

00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:08,250
job of a and you see massive noble

00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:08,580
peasants applied for it you spend two

00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:10,890
three

00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:13,440
I mean two three months trying to figure

00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:14,850
how the best person to fit in and at the

00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,730
end of it that you don't even get that

00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:20,880
talent to fit in now what if you go to

00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:24,030
the communities that these people are

00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:26,700
and you could take some time to interact

00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:28,890
and get your I mean your talent within

00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:30,930
that community instead of actually

00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:32,160
trying a job a main job opening out

00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:35,400
there for everybody

00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:37,290
mean to comment on and this is what he

00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:40,050
says and reach out to developers

00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:41,910
communities so the opportunities now

00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:44,430
communities are assessed to a large pool

00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:48,120
of potential talents to me required by

00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:50,700
companies said yes this is very true

00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:53,600
because we have ourselves to all the

00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:56,520
talents we have a sense to people put

00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:59,580
entry level both intermediate level both

00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:02,040
expert level and a good noble Falls are

00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:04,140
here today okay so the developers

00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:07,200
community actually have access to a pool

00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:09,720
of of talent now the knowledge sharing

00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,700
within communities first up rapid

00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:13,520
development of talent for example we

00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:16,390
just came in for Python Africa

00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:18,920
and I've met a few friends we've shared

00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:21,380
experiences we'll look at what you do

00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:25,520
have look at so there's a whole lot of

00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:28,040
you know brainstorming and sharing of

00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:31,610
knowledge which is not really present in

00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:34,760
the industry because it's not really a

00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:37,580
community thing a developer can only

00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:40,970
work with somebody who has aim and

00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:43,100
dusters within that space but in the in

00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:45,770
the developers community we have people

00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:47,390
who network you could interact you could

00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:50,420
bring up your code if you talked about

00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:53,570
what you do and somebody can reason and

00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:55,280
see how you can make get this working so

00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:58,100
communities can afford to invest time

00:23:55,280 --> 00:24:00,500
and resources to train talents and not

00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:02,750
even having to fear what I mean to lose

00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:05,179
such talents so one of the major

00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:08,000
problems these companies are and I have

00:24:05,179 --> 00:24:09,800
opportunity to be able to interact with

00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,929
these companies is that they don't want

00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:13,490
to spend so much money in training

00:24:11,929 --> 00:24:17,300
talents and at the end of the day they

00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:20,650
knew such talents okay so this is one of

00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:23,840
the fear but on your on the flipside

00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:26,900
developers community can afford to spend

00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:29,179
money and time to Train talents and they

00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:32,420
are not really afraid of if they will

00:24:29,179 --> 00:24:35,630
lose such talents okay and I think that

00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:36,860
is something we must look into so so

00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:39,679
what are the challenges for the industry

00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:41,720
in my experience now the challenges for

00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:44,410
the industry is lack of visibility and

00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:47,059
engagement so over time we've had

00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:49,700
developers community try to do stuff on

00:24:47,059 --> 00:24:52,880
their own they try to own their own game

00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:55,460
they have their own developers party

00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,110
they have their own things and they just

00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:59,990
walk around and I'm at the end of the

00:24:57,110 --> 00:25:03,080
day they are not connected to the

00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:06,470
industry okay so most developers don't

00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:08,780
go to regular business meetings and all

00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:11,450
that web business conferences where they

00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:13,610
tend to interact with the industry so

00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:15,830
the lack of talent growth measurement so

00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:18,530
companies feel like look you can't tell

00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:20,120
me how well your talents are you can't

00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:20,620
measure you're not measuring how well

00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:23,200
you

00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:25,900
talans are doing so you don't trust me

00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:28,930
that I can trust Italians you bring in

00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:31,620
for me so this is a Charlie so a lack of

00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:35,650
robust well structured training program

00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:39,730
to develop talents as it stuns me top is

00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:42,250
not enough anyone I agree with that me

00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:44,680
top is not enough we need we need boot

00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:46,960
camps we need like five minutes six feet

00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:49,780
boot camps we need ten weeks boot camp

00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,640
to get person me more talents integrated

00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:54,010
and this is what the industry is looking

00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:57,370
out for they want to be sure that there

00:25:54,010 --> 00:26:00,790
are programs beyond just four or five

00:25:57,370 --> 00:26:02,980
hours meter okay so the lack of veteran

00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:06,190
or proof of talents ability to deliver

00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:08,650
the job so as developers communities we

00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:11,290
are not really vetting talents we can't

00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:14,710
really say this is how well our talents

00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:17,140
can perform so we should look for a way

00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:19,179
of how we can start vetting our talents

00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:21,700
now give the confidence to the industry

00:26:19,179 --> 00:26:24,690
that when when they bring the talent in

00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:28,510
it will deliver on the job okay so

00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:34,240
bridging that gap now on bridging that

00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:37,540
gap I have using the the kids paradigm I

00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:39,760
came up with a way to build the talent

00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:42,790
pipeline so building the talent pipeline

00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:46,870
I have the stage they commit measure and

00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:49,030
you push so basically now staging is the

00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:52,179
process of engaging organizations and

00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:57,309
talent to create pipelines for them then

00:26:52,179 --> 00:27:00,090
commit so commit entails developing the

00:26:57,309 --> 00:27:03,760
robust programs as well as structured

00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:07,330
training that will help develop the

00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:09,340
talents then measure so we need to start

00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:11,710
measuring how when our talents are

00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:15,490
performing before we deploy them to the

00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:17,980
industry so then we push so when we push

00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:21,820
it entails placing those talents in the

00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:24,400
industry so just to do that Python idea

00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:26,930
story I just wanna share with us and in

00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:30,890
terms of visibility we engage in a few

00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:33,950
program non-developers training program

00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:37,700
so this just an example of that this

00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:39,710
digital right and inclusion forum a very

00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:42,590
big conference which we engage them now

00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:45,710
the essence of distance is to make our

00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:48,830
community to be visible to the industry

00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:51,140
so I went to somebody and he said I tell

00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:54,140
them I'm from Python Angela said what do

00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:56,000
you mean I don't even know well if there

00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:58,130
is a community exist in like that and

00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,280
these are some of the things we must

00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:04,250
look into so this is respond friends as

00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:08,150
part of efforts to showcase visibility

00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:10,610
this is a non developers conference so

00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:13,010
we put us out there so when we need

00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:14,540
partnership where we need to engage some

00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:18,190
of these companies they tend to listen

00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:20,930
to us and then engagement so we had a

00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:23,210
six-week bootcamp in partnership with a

00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:25,310
company called paradigm initiative in

00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:27,800
Lagos Nigeria these are some of the

00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:30,560
things I'm talking about and how we can

00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:33,190
really do most of this thing now into

00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:35,620
gopher we must learn to work together

00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:38,870
and this is talking about

00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:41,270
inter-community synergy because we can't

00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:44,030
afford to be doing things in silos

00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:46,220
communities must come together we must

00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:48,650
form that structure we must define new

00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:51,830
paradigms that will shape what the

00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:54,380
industry wants and tell them how to

00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:56,480
better hire talent what they need to

00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:59,380
factor in in the job description and

00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:02,660
this may not just be one community

00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:06,410
community's was a network to get this

00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:08,210
done okay in conclusion as communities

00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:09,920
and developers we must take up that

00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:12,380
challenge of making good knowledge and

00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:14,480
opportunities available to all so while

00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:16,880
we are trying trying to make persons to

00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:19,340
develop that talent and that knowledge

00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:23,690
we must also create the opportunity for

00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:26,180
them in the industry by following the

00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:29,480
pipeline the talent pipeline thing so we

00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:33,020
engage the industry we create a robust

00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:36,080
program to train them then we accurate

00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:38,410
infect those men their main talent that

00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:41,020
there are the benefits then we

00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:43,840
to the industry and trust me it could be

00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:47,710
a very strong business model to help me

00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:50,050
maybe break in revenue to communities so

00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:51,790
we must also become any conscious

00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:54,280
efforts to engage collaborate with

00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:57,430

00:29:57,430 --> 00:30:03,220
innovative ways of doing more to impact

00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:05,530
the larger community whichever way we

00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:08,200
have it because we're a microcosm of a

00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:11,320
larger community so this initiative

00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:13,900
engaging that industry and trying to see

00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:26,290
