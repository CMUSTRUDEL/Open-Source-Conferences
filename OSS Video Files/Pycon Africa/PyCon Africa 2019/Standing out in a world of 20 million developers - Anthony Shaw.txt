okay I'm ya privilege to be here in

00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:10,980
Ghana and thank you so much for inviting

00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:13,049
me and I have come quite a long way to

00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,780
get here unfortunately we went from

00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:22,710
Sydney to Tokyo to London and then down

00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:24,750
to Ghana so I think when I arrived last

00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,849
night I thought ah at least everyone

00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,769
here speaks English and people

00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:31,109
understand me because in Japan it's

00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:33,480
quite alienating because so few people

00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:36,180
speak English and in the taxi on the way

00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:38,280
to the hotel I said to the taxi driver I

00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:42,420
was like so is this summer and he said

00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:45,800
no this is the Marriott I thought okay

00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:48,870
maybe my accents still gonna be an issue

00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:51,539
but no welcome to my talk so I basically

00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:53,579
want to talk about there are 20 million

00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:55,890
developers in the world which is a lot

00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:57,809
so if you think about get putting

00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,539
yourself forward and getting ahead then

00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:02,789
what does that mean so the things I want

00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:04,909
to cover I basically find out why you

00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:07,260
would want to get to want to get ahead

00:01:04,909 --> 00:01:10,760
picking a skillset that you want to

00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:13,650
focus on setting some goals to yourself

00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:15,210
finding more time to actually learn and

00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,659
achieve the goals which is always the

00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:18,630
challenge

00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:21,689
and then lastly helps and nail

00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:23,430
interviews so hopefully there's going to

00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:24,810
be some sort of high level advice and

00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,880
some more practical advice towards the

00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:30,450
end and then if there's enough time

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,100
where we can break for questions so even

00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:35,220
if you're not a competitive person if

00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:38,610
you don't try and put yourself ahead you

00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:40,200
can fall behind and I don't know what

00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:42,240
the definitive number of developers in

00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,759
the world are but a reasonable estimate

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:48,149
is about 20 million which is a huge

00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:50,759
number and the majority of these are

00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:53,549
categorized as beginners which in itself

00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:56,189
is it doesn't make any sense but if you

00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:57,930
look at how most sites or jobs

00:01:56,189 --> 00:02:00,509
categorize developers they would say

00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:02,939
that 70% of them are beginners so

00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:05,670
basically what I'd like you to think

00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:06,990
about is that every week thousands tens

00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:09,679
of thousands and new people are learning

00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:12,439
to code and

00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,269
if you can find a way to put yourself

00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:16,640
ahead by focusing on your skill set and

00:02:14,269 --> 00:02:19,220
improving your skill set then you can

00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,439
accept fewer compromises when you're

00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:23,269
looking for work because there is no

00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:25,790
such thing as a perfect job you can find

00:02:23,269 --> 00:02:27,109
jobs and there'll be eight things that

00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:29,359
you really like about it maybe two

00:02:27,109 --> 00:02:30,530
things you're not so keen on but you

00:02:29,359 --> 00:02:33,760
want to put yourself in a position where

00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:37,489
you have to accept fewer compromises and

00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,840
then lastly miss fewer opportunities so

00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:41,720
if you see an opportunity to come around

00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:43,879
for a really cool company or in a really

00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:46,040
interesting place or for a really cool

00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:47,810
technology you don't want to miss that

00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:50,060
opportunity so if you can do the

00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:52,069
preparation in advance get yourself

00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:53,629
ahead get yourself prepared then you've

00:02:52,069 --> 00:03:00,470
got the best chances of getting that

00:02:53,629 --> 00:03:02,720
opportunity and so before we get into

00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:06,349
things I want to acknowledge something

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:09,049
probably quite obvious which is that I'm

00:03:06,349 --> 00:03:11,900
speaking about this and I'd probably

00:03:09,049 --> 00:03:14,769
come from the most privileged group in

00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:16,489
the development world so I've never had

00:03:14,769 --> 00:03:19,220
been turned away from an opportunity

00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:21,489
because of my gender my the fact that I

00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:25,220
speak English my race anything like that

00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:27,049
so whilst this is super important I

00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:29,060
there are people who may have a head

00:03:27,049 --> 00:03:31,129
start but that's not what this talk is

00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:32,900
about so I just want to acknowledge it

00:03:31,129 --> 00:03:35,810
first of all and say that I'm very much

00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:38,569
aware and even when putting this

00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:39,620
presentation together actually and I was

00:03:38,569 --> 00:03:41,959
trying to find images for the

00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:43,819
presentation and I was using those stock

00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:46,370
image sites looking at pictures of

00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:50,510
developers and all the ones that gave me

00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:52,639
look like me and I tried changing the

00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:55,669
search criteria a little bit and adding

00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:58,400
in if like developers Africa or and it

00:03:55,669 --> 00:04:00,470
would it immediately switch like this to

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,690
like pictures of people like poor people

00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:05,979
chasing after a camera or like and

00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:10,159
they're just nothing was more obvious

00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:13,190
how that kind of instinct I guess kind

00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:14,299
of makes itself prevalent so I just want

00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:16,639
to acknowledge it at the beginning the

00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:19,789
talk but this talk is not about me it's

00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,829
about you so I I just want to say let's

00:04:19,789 --> 00:04:23,150
move on this is not the talk and but

00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:25,150
there's lots of ways we could talk about

00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:27,800
that

00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:30,110
so next first thing I want to talk about

00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:33,470
is survivorship bias does anyone know

00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:35,630
what survivorship bias is okay a couple

00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:38,620
of year okay here's the perfect picture

00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:40,220
to describe what survivorship bias is um

00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:41,780
Alex Honnold

00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:44,090
who's like one of the best climbers in

00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:46,400
the world this was an article about him

00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:49,430
and how he climbs one of the hardest

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,200
walls in the world without a rope this

00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:54,140
is this is my anecdote for what

00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:56,390
survivorship bias is so basically when

00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:59,090
you're reading about either how to be

00:04:56,390 --> 00:05:01,160
successful or how this person achieved

00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:04,490
this there is so much survivorship bias

00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:08,090
in stories so the vibra ship bias means

00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:09,860
that if somebody is successful they will

00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:12,650
give you advice which is based on their

00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:15,500
success and their path but people don't

00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:16,790
know which the decisions they made were

00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:20,090
the ones that led them to where they are

00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:22,610
today so the fact that they've got there

00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:24,860
is this a survivorship bias so I like

00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:26,330
Donald is giving a talk about this but

00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:29,570
that's only because he didn't fall off

00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:31,810
so this is super important because

00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:34,790
you'll see a lot of books like this and

00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:36,790
which will be normally people with their

00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:39,950
arms crossed looking very confident and

00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:42,710
and they'll give you 12 steps 20 steps

00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:45,080
but those are the steps that work for

00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:47,450
them and they won't necessarily work for

00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:50,720
you so the advice I want to give is very

00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:52,220
general advice but it's not based on my

00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,300
experience it's based on people that

00:05:52,220 --> 00:06:00,680
I've worked with or people that I know

00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:02,150
so let's talk about goals and so that's

00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:06,320
the rest of my toxically Mario themed

00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:09,500
sorry so I've met plenty of developers

00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:12,910
and if you ask them if they're an expert

00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:15,470
the vast majority would say no and

00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:18,080
there's a great podcast called developer

00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:20,450
on fire and they interview all sorts of

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,880
different developers but even ones which

00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:24,440
are very very famous they ask the

00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,280
question do you feel like you've made it

00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:29,360
and the answer is overwhelmingly no and

00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:32,990
the reason I want to bring this up is

00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,610
because and when you think about what

00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:35,990
you would like to be in the future as a

00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:37,220
developer

00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:40,970
just saying that I want to be a

00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:43,280
successful developer as a goal is very

00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:44,870
vague and very very hard to achieve

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,690
because you haven't actually laid out

00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:50,360
what that means so this is basically not

00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:52,130
how things work you don't get to the end

00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,199
and you've achieved everything and now

00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:56,180
you're a successful developer it's

00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:58,430
actually more of a story in terms of

00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:01,850
small goals medium goals and big goals

00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:03,199
which I'm going to talk about now so I

00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:05,180
think the most important thing is that

00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,720
being a developer is about continuous

00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:12,650
learning and also sharing your skills

00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:15,020
with others so let's talk about goals so

00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:17,750
if you wanted to set a goal for yourself

00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:19,220
and the first thing you did it was to

00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:22,940
write down a goal and it's a whopping

00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:26,870
great big goal then that would be like

00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:28,310
playing Mario and enough basically

00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:31,060
nothing happens until you get to the

00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:33,530
boss and you have to defeat the boss and

00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:35,210
maybe you fail the first time the second

00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:37,599
time the third time and you're going to

00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:40,400
feel really defeated really quickly and

00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:43,310
the thing I want to advise people to do

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:47,210
is to first off start by setting small

00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:50,330
goals so set yourself a goal that you

00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:53,539
think is achievable because when you set

00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:54,620
small goals it feels good because you

00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:55,970
can achieve them and when you've

00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:59,090
accomplished something it gives you more

00:07:55,970 --> 00:08:01,669
confidence so in terms of your goal

00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:03,889
setting for your skills or your career

00:08:01,669 --> 00:08:07,520
your development my number one piece of

00:08:03,889 --> 00:08:10,460
advice is don't set big goals first set

00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,889
small goals first because even those

00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:15,940
goals helps you build confidence and

00:08:12,889 --> 00:08:18,710
work your way up to medium-size goals

00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:20,690
and once you've worked your way up to a

00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:22,970
medium-sized girl let me give you an

00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:25,460
example so a small goal might be

00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:27,530
learning a new way to use an API so

00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:29,750
you've been using I don't know the mock

00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:32,180
API for example and you want to learn

00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:35,120
how to use it differently or you want to

00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:37,039
learn how multiple inheritance works in

00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,839
Python so you could read a tutorial

00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:40,579
you've practiced it you've done it so

00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:42,440
that's a small that's a nice small goal

00:08:40,579 --> 00:08:44,630
that's something you can accomplish in a

00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:46,070
day or a couple of days and once you've

00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:47,810
done it you say great I've achieved

00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:49,370
something and then you can set yourself

00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:51,260
a medium goal

00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:53,779
and doing lots more of these basically

00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:56,960
just helps you build momentum and keep

00:08:53,779 --> 00:08:59,750
practicing and building your skillset if

00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:01,310
you play Mario a lot you'll recognise as

00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:04,940
well that you can use that medium goal

00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:07,490
to kill the big goal and so sometimes

00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:10,220
you learn things on the way which help

00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:12,529
you achieve the big goals so a

00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:14,510
medium-size goal might be learning a new

00:09:12,529 --> 00:09:17,930
language for example or learning a new

00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:21,110
framework and a big goal might be that

00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:22,910
job you've always wanted or to start off

00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:25,010
in a different career path there could

00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:29,450
be a number of things and but you need

00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:32,060
to do them in steps okay so when it

00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:34,300
comes to picking his skillset and some

00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:37,670
of you might have heard the expression

00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:42,020
jack of all trades master of none people

00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:45,170
heard that before okay cool so when it

00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:47,839
comes to this is very true with with

00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:51,050
developers if you think about your skill

00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:52,640
set and you list out your skills if you

00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:55,010
said I know a bit a bit of a bit about

00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,480
HTML a bit of CSS a bit of Python and a

00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:58,459
bit of testing and a bit of JavaScript

00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,980
this is this is the jack of all trades

00:09:58,459 --> 00:10:03,860
master of none and the recommendation

00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:07,070
has been to have one thing that you can

00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:08,089
focus on and specialize in so what I

00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:10,700
want to talk about is actually a

00:10:08,089 --> 00:10:12,770
slightly different approach and which is

00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:14,750
to have a combination of both and this

00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:17,240
looks like a letter T which is why it's

00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:19,850
called a t-shaped skill so the idea with

00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:22,610
a letter T is that you know a little bit

00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:23,779
about HTML a little bit about CSS they

00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:24,589
could be this could be anything at the

00:10:23,779 --> 00:10:26,930
top doesn't have to be these

00:10:24,589 --> 00:10:29,750
technologies but there's something that

00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:32,209
you specialize in and that one thing

00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:35,209
your goal is to go deep on that thing

00:10:32,209 --> 00:10:38,330
and build your skills in that area so if

00:10:35,209 --> 00:10:40,400
it is Python and then maybe if you're a

00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:43,430
web developer that it could be Django PI

00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:45,650
tests a request framework and the

00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:48,110
advantage of being a t-shaped skill is

00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:50,480
that as you work as you look at

00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:52,339
different job opportunities they will

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,950
know you as an expert in different areas

00:10:52,339 --> 00:10:57,650
so if you say I'm a web developer but

00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:59,300
primarily I'm a Python developer then

00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:00,950
when you go an interview for a company

00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:02,450
and they're looking for Python web

00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:03,070
developers you're going to get

00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:04,540
prioritize

00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:10,540
/ someone who just says I'm a web

00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:12,640
developer so this is the t-shape so the

00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:15,520
important thing about the tee is that a

00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,830
lot of these things change frequently so

00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:19,990
knowing a little bit about HTML HTML

00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:23,230
does change not very often but it does

00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:26,230
mmm CSS the same Python changes

00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:28,270
frequently and the testing world I guess

00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:32,950
changes frequently and JavaScript seems

00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:35,800
to change every week so if you think

00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:37,990
about your your skill sets then you're

00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:40,810
also going to need to refresh all these

00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:42,730
boxes often so Django this Django -

00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:45,970
which is very different to Django 1 and

00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:47,260
PI 2 3 I think it was request 2 which

00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:51,250
hasn't come out yet but it will do

00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:53,770
eventually hopefully and so basically

00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:55,210
this idea is that you think about and

00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:57,730
you can even draw this if you want to

00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:59,830
draw it out what your T looks like and

00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:01,990
just make sure that you're refreshing

00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:06,010
those boxes so that you're keeping up

00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:09,280
today ok now I want to introduce

00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:13,450
something else if you are a t-shape

00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:16,390
developer then you've put your basically

00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:19,780
standing on one leg because you've put

00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:22,090
your focus and expertise into one place

00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:26,080
now you might either come across

00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:27,610
opportunities or jobs or platforms that

00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:29,980
you need to work on or maybe you get

00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:33,250
seconded in to a project where people

00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:34,810
need a second pillar so my

00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:36,910
recommendation as you build up your

00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:39,730
skillset is to actually think about

00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:42,370
having two specialties if your web

00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:44,500
developer then that would be Python and

00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:46,090
JavaScript for example and if you wanted

00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:48,160
to focus on JavaScript you'd probably

00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:50,800
want to learn react to angular or

00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:53,950
something like that and ec6 and

00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,900
typescript so it would be to have two

00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:58,270
things that you can specialize in this

00:12:55,900 --> 00:13:00,220
is not about having a two-dimensional

00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:02,380
grid of every technology because it's

00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:04,450
completely unfeasible it's about having

00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:08,380
one area specialty and then building on

00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:11,020
a second so some people call this a pie

00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:15,220
shaped skillset and but I think it looks

00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:16,779
more like an 8080 from Star Wars and so

00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:18,819
I'll cover this to the end

00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:20,980
think about this kind of model when

00:13:18,819 --> 00:13:22,240
you're going so when it comes to

00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:25,300
expanding your skillset

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:27,670
you've got your 8080 and you've got your

00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:29,350
broad set of skills that you've learnt

00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:31,060
if there are in web development for

00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:34,569
example and then you've got your your

00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:38,019
your depth either in back-end for Python

00:13:34,569 --> 00:13:40,709
or fronting for JavaScript and then your

00:13:38,019 --> 00:13:44,110
goal should be to go in two directions

00:13:40,709 --> 00:13:47,019
one should be to go broad but narrow and

00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:48,519
the other one should be to go deep so if

00:13:47,019 --> 00:13:51,129
you're going broad and narrow it would

00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:54,220
be to learn new things whether there

00:13:51,129 --> 00:13:56,560
were technologies or soft skills but

00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:59,050
just learn enough about them because

00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,459
there is only so much you can learn in a

00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:03,009
given year and we'll talk about this in

00:14:00,459 --> 00:14:05,560
a minute and but always keep your eye on

00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:08,079
what's coming and the next slide you'll

00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:09,699
see why and the second thing is to

00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:12,490
continue developing your expertise

00:14:09,699 --> 00:14:14,259
downwards so basically the way you

00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:16,990
should think of it is that you you want

00:14:14,259 --> 00:14:19,990
to take your 8080 model and make it

00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:24,250
stronger and bigger the goal is not to

00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:26,019
have 10 specialties and know everything

00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:29,309
about everything because it's completely

00:14:26,019 --> 00:14:32,819
unfeasible does that make sense

00:14:29,309 --> 00:14:37,750
cool okay so why should you go broad

00:14:32,819 --> 00:14:42,040
this map is it actually goes from 1950

00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:45,100
to 9 1998 I think it is but you can't

00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:46,930
see the names and basically is a really

00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:48,430
cool chart it shows programming

00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:50,350
languages and how they inherit from each

00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:52,839
other and Python is actually in here

00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:55,089
somewhere and but the reason I want to

00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:57,730
show this is because when you think

00:14:55,089 --> 00:15:00,480
about the lifespan of your career if

00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:03,550
you're working for 30 40 years

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:06,430
technology changes drastically every

00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:08,259
three to five years so most of what you

00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:10,000
know now you're going to have to relearn

00:15:08,259 --> 00:15:12,730
in the next three to five years and

00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,370
again and again and again and again so

00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:17,680
saying you know I'm gonna tie myself to

00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:18,970
Python 3 and that's the thing I know and

00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:22,540
that's going to keep me going for my

00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:25,050
career things change often so when I

00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:27,220
show that 80 80 I'm saying go wide but

00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:28,660
shallow in different areas

00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:30,220
that's because different technologies

00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:34,030
and different things will come around

00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:35,350
pythons not going anywhere so yeah

00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:37,180
pythons basically one of the pillars

00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:39,100
over here and it inherited from

00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:41,080
different languages and then other

00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:44,620
languages have been inspired by Python

00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:46,510
and so things do change and during your

00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:48,280
career frameworks will come and go

00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:51,400
different approaches and different

00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:54,100
design styles will come and go so being

00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:55,450
able to be good at learning and learning

00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,420
new skills and King on top of things

00:15:55,450 --> 00:16:01,320
will be very beneficial

00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:04,390
however there are so many distractions

00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:06,310
day to day hey that's saying that you

00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:09,490
can learn new stuff and keep up to date

00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:13,870
with technology is great to say really

00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:16,180
hard to do so there's a few things I

00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:19,120
kind of want to share as tips about

00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:22,330
finding time to do more and the do-more

00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:24,490
might be practicing your coding it might

00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:26,470
be learning something new it might be

00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:29,650
you know collaborating with your

00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:33,910
co-workers more it might be mentoring

00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:35,560
somebody so if you if you've got that

00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:38,020
t-shaped model that you want to develop

00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:42,030
towards you're going to need to be slick

00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:42,030
and effective to build out those blocks

00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:49,450
so first thing you want to say is that

00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:50,740
focus makes you faster and increasingly

00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:52,300
more and more countries are actually

00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:54,880
saying that working day should be six to

00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:57,820
seven hours the reason is because the

00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:01,660
brain gets tired if any of you've ever

00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:02,860
done a problem-solving mission that you

00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:04,930
started at nine o'clock in the evening

00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:07,000
and you look at your watch and you're

00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:09,250
like wow how is it 2 a.m. already and I

00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,189
still haven't fixed this back it's

00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:14,650
because the brain gets tired and you

00:17:12,189 --> 00:17:17,589
need to draw lines to stop yourself from

00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:19,689
doing that sometimes so focus makes you

00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:23,740
faster and there's lots of ways that you

00:17:19,689 --> 00:17:27,040
can focus one turn off notifications on

00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:28,630
your phone as much as you can strongly

00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:31,090
recommend doing this somebody told me

00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:33,160
this and it has completely changed how I

00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:36,520
do things unless someone has sent you a

00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:38,620
direct message on email or whichever

00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:41,050
channel you use try and turn off push

00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:42,430
notifications it having your phone next

00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:43,690
to you when you work or when you're

00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:46,059
researching is

00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:47,470
destruction especially on your laptop or

00:17:46,059 --> 00:17:49,389
your computer if you've got desktop

00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:51,970
notifications pinging all the time it

00:17:49,389 --> 00:17:53,940
just switches your brain and you lose

00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:56,470
focus

00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:58,659
next thing block and turn off social if

00:17:56,470 --> 00:18:01,090
you want to focus and there's some cool

00:17:58,659 --> 00:18:03,190
apps actually there's one called self

00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:05,230
control for Mac which you can actually

00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:07,600
leave blacklists social media websites

00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:09,669
for like a given amount of time so you

00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,679
can say don't let me go and read it or

00:18:09,669 --> 00:18:13,480
Twitter or whatever for the next three

00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,789
hours and once you've turned it on you

00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:17,919
can turn it off so if you really need to

00:18:15,789 --> 00:18:19,779
focus and get something done and there's

00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:22,870
some really cool tools you can use used

00:18:19,779 --> 00:18:25,330
to do that and last this is not for

00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:27,309
everybody but go easy on the caffeine is

00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:30,610
awesome for helping you focus for about

00:18:27,309 --> 00:18:32,289
10 minutes and then it's a downward

00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:34,779
spiral from there especially sugary

00:18:32,289 --> 00:18:36,460
drinks are the same but yeah keep

00:18:34,779 --> 00:18:38,470
yourself keep yourself hydrated it's

00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:42,090
good for the brain that's my only health

00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:46,779
advice for this since I talk okay

00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:48,509
the timeboxing so I think very important

00:18:46,779 --> 00:18:51,460
skill that developer can have is

00:18:48,509 --> 00:18:52,960
problem-solving so often you're going to

00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:55,509
get stuck with something that crashes

00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,720
you find a bug you've tried something it

00:18:55,509 --> 00:19:00,220
didn't work and you can't figure out why

00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:02,620
so you're gonna need to problem-solve

00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:04,779
sometimes there's somebody working with

00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:06,460
you or near you or someone you know who

00:19:04,779 --> 00:19:08,110
you can ask for help which is awesome

00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:09,759
but a lot of the times you're going to

00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:13,360
be having to figure that out for

00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:15,039
yourself and problem solving is probably

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:18,840
the number one skill I think you would

00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:21,279
need as a developer because as you learn

00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:23,019
new things or as you work on new

00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:25,179
frameworks or new tools you're going to

00:19:23,019 --> 00:19:26,620
hit issues all the time and it's

00:19:25,179 --> 00:19:29,769
probably the biggest difference I see

00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:32,230
between very experienced developers and

00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:34,769
beginners is that beginners get very

00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:38,019
disheartened when things go wrong and

00:19:34,769 --> 00:19:39,490
experts are used to it and I think it's

00:19:38,019 --> 00:19:40,899
that you know if you've been doing this

00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:42,340
for a long time if the whole thing

00:19:40,899 --> 00:19:44,679
collapses in a crash and you don't know

00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:45,730
why then I think a beginner might think

00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:48,309
that's because I don't know what I'm

00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:51,519
doing and experts just like right how do

00:19:48,309 --> 00:19:54,100
we get this done how I fix it so problem

00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:56,350
solving is very challenging with in in

00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:59,200
technology because

00:19:56,350 --> 00:20:01,240
often could be no documentation you can

00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,890
get led down all these little to rabbit

00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,360
warrens because you don't know what the

00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:06,550
issue is so you might think oh maybe

00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:07,840
it's a database how does that work and

00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:09,580
you go on a link and then all of a

00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:12,670
sudden you find yourself four hours

00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:14,340
later stuck on the same issue no further

00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:17,320
than where you were when you started

00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:22,870
so the concept I want to introduce this

00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:26,410
time boxing and you missed problem

00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:29,440
solving is the skill sometimes it takes

00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:31,360
your brain time to figure things out so

00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,220
my recommendation is if you get stuck on

00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,320
an issue and you've been stuck on it for

00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:37,300
an hour two hours and you don't feel

00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:41,260
like you're making any progress stop

00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:44,170
working on it because your brain needs

00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:45,940
time to think it through it doesn't it

00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:48,100
can do it in the background it's amazing

00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:49,330
I don't know how it works but if you

00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:52,630
come back to the same problem

00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:54,040
a day later two days later you can look

00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:55,870
at it with a different pair of eyes and

00:20:54,040 --> 00:21:00,870
you can figure out what the issue is

00:20:55,870 --> 00:21:04,150
like this sometimes doesn't always work

00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:05,530
take a break have a walk absolutely

00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:07,590
recommend this if you've been stuck on

00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:10,660
the same issue for a long time and

00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:12,640
actually like famous scientists have

00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:15,460
done this over time this isn't a new

00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:17,980
thing most of them have basically come

00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:19,810
to their Eureka moments whilst walking

00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:22,480
around the garden or whatever and

00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:24,760
actually stuck in the lab having your

00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:27,130
brain and your mind just focus on the

00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:29,740
screen doesn't let you use your whole

00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:32,020
brain capacity you just get focused on

00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:34,780
that one thing and you can't think with

00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:37,060
your whole mind if you take a break have

00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:39,370
a walk you'll find that having a space

00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:44,100
to think and think things through you'll

00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:46,690
figure out a solution and then lastly if

00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:49,360
you find yourself in these situations

00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:52,090
often and you know you can get stuck on

00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:55,060
issues for two hours three hours use a

00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:56,740
timer and even something simple like an

00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:58,810
egg timer just selling it for ten

00:21:56,740 --> 00:22:01,120
minutes so let's say you just run the

00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:02,620
unit tests and one of them crashes and

00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,210
you don't recognize the error message

00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:06,340
and you think okay I'm gonna have a look

00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:08,740
into this but I was supposed to be doing

00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:10,580
something else and actually this wasn't

00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:13,669
the main task I suppose

00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:18,919
I'm gonna look into it set yourself a

00:22:13,669 --> 00:22:20,299
timer ten minutes maybe is too short but

00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:21,860
if you set yourself a time and when that

00:22:20,299 --> 00:22:23,660
timer finishes you say okay I'm gonna

00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:26,480
stop working on this issue and I'm going

00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:29,480
to come back to it another great

00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:31,580
technique is to debug for other people

00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:33,830
so if you're working in a team in a

00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:36,710
space and you recognize that a colleague

00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:39,049
has got stuck on an issue even if you're

00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:40,940
not an expert actually even more so if

00:22:39,049 --> 00:22:43,130
you're not an expert if you just go over

00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:45,890
to them and say hey you know what are

00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:48,350
you stuck on and ask them to explain it

00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:50,750
to you and they'll actually find that by

00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:53,410
explaining the issue to you it'll help

00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:56,780
them figure out what the issue was and

00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:58,220
there's Trey Hana M has actually got a

00:22:56,780 --> 00:23:00,890
really cool technique called rubber duck

00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:03,200
debugging and basically if you don't

00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:05,270
have a colleague who you can talk to you

00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,220
get a rubber duck instead and you put

00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:08,830
the rubber duck down and you explain to

00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:11,120
the rubber duck what the issue is and

00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:14,450
through mutual conversation and

00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:18,460
intelligence the rubber duck helps you

00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:22,730
to figure out the whole thing cool

00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:24,530
so timeboxing ultimately can be used not

00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:26,990
just for debugging and solving

00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:28,520
complicated issues and but also for

00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:33,140
setting out your day and helping you

00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:37,910
focus and do more next I want to talk

00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:40,910
about learning to learn so um if you

00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:42,590
think about your 8080 and all the boxes

00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:44,780
you need to refresh and you want to go

00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:47,000
broad and you want to go deep in a

00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:48,350
particular couple of areas you're going

00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,200
to need to get really good at learning

00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:53,600
new technologies or new skills and new

00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,510
approaches or new frameworks this is

00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,919
probably one of the hardest things to do

00:23:55,510 --> 00:24:00,620
learning to learn new things is very

00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:03,320
challenging and the thing I think that

00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:05,590
puts most people off is that they often

00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:07,940
think about going back to school and

00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:11,240
being kind of disciplined or being very

00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:13,820
bored in class but learning doesn't

00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:16,640
always have to be like that and there's

00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:18,400
a few tips that I have for you number

00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,780
one find the right space to learn

00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:23,179
sitting at your desk on your computer

00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:24,290
might not be the right space for you you

00:24:23,179 --> 00:24:26,000
might find that you have too many

00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:27,230
distractions you might find that staring

00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,190
at a screen trying to concentrate

00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:34,970
doesn't work so for me personally as an

00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:37,700
example and I've consumed probably

00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:40,130
thousands of hours of video courses on

00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:41,750
poor site and YouTube and I found that

00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:44,140
actually watching them whilst doing the

00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:46,250
ironing was the best space for me

00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:48,500
because it's something that's time

00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:50,659
consuming you can't go anywhere it

00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:52,400
doesn't take any brain capacity and you

00:24:50,659 --> 00:24:54,559
can just focus on the TV and you can

00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,640
listen and learn at the same time so

00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:58,159
that works for me I used to do that

00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:59,659
every Sunday for three hours and you

00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,799
might find that listening to things is

00:24:59,659 --> 00:25:02,570
much better for you

00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:04,429
you might find that doing the mastering

00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:06,799
exercise works just try different

00:25:04,429 --> 00:25:09,650
approaches if you've picked something

00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:12,820
and it's not working don't beat yourself

00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:16,850
up about it just try something else

00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:20,120
secondly find the right time and we're

00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:21,760
all different some of us our brains are

00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:24,200
more pliable first thing in the morning

00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:27,140
some of us are the absolutely opposite

00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:29,179
and so myself if you tell me anything

00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:30,740
pretty much often before my third cup of

00:25:29,179 --> 00:25:34,429
coffee you're not going to get a very

00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:36,230
intelligible response so for me and sort

00:25:34,429 --> 00:25:37,970
of like early afternoon works really

00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:40,429
well but that's only from trial and

00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:43,460
error so if you want to learn stuff

00:25:40,429 --> 00:25:44,960
normally a couple of hours is the good

00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:47,270
amount don't try and do a whole day of

00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,370
learning your brain just doesn't have

00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:51,320
this capacity if you're hot you can't

00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:53,179
stay focused long enough find a time

00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:55,669
that works for you it's when you feel

00:25:53,179 --> 00:25:56,840
alert when you can focus that might be

00:25:55,669 --> 00:25:58,490
nice and early in the morning it might

00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:00,140
be before lunch it might be late in the

00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:02,299
evening you might be one in the morning

00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:04,429
if you're one of those people and but

00:26:02,299 --> 00:26:08,110
just trial and error just experiment see

00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:10,880
what works next find the right content

00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:13,250
books work for some people not for

00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:16,490
others video courses work for some

00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:19,640
people not for others blogs lectures

00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:21,740
hands-on labs tutorials each of these

00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:24,350
are very different styles and they work

00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:25,880
for some people and not for others just

00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:28,100
because somebody's recommended a video

00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:29,600
course to you and you've got an hour

00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:31,520
through it and you just can't watch

00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,200
anymore of it or you've watched an hour

00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,490
you've watched an hour of it and you

00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,750
can't remember a single thing the

00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:37,280
lecturers said

00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:40,039
that doesn't mean there's anything wrong

00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:42,320
with you it means that that style is not

00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:44,690
right for you and there are lots of

00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:48,470
options obviously I'd recommend real

00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:50,090
Python calm but or porous light but

00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:53,059
there's there's loads out there video

00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:58,280
courses audio courses and so trial and

00:26:53,059 --> 00:26:59,450
error and then lastly and this probably

00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:02,299
goes back to one of my points at the

00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:03,830
beginning is to pay it forward one of

00:27:02,299 --> 00:27:06,559
the best ways to learn something is to

00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:09,080
teach it which when you say that loud

00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:11,390
doesn't make any sense but actually a

00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:12,980
great way to reinforce learning is to

00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:16,070
have to explain it to other people so

00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:18,110
when I say pay it forward I'm saying if

00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:21,020
as you're learning something let's say

00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:24,559
you're learning Django and you're about

00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:25,909
a year into learning Django talking to

00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:28,070
someone who's a month into learning

00:27:25,909 --> 00:27:30,980
Django and teaching them how the user

00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:34,309
model works for example or how the admin

00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:36,530
pages works or how basic views work is a

00:27:34,309 --> 00:27:38,620
great way for you to you reinforce your

00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:40,370
learning and also pay it forward

00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:42,140
especially if someone's gone out of

00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:42,830
their way to coach you or teach you in

00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:44,480
the past

00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:51,679
then it means you can pass that on to

00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:54,250
somebody else okay so if you're watching

00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:57,020
all this and thinking yeah that's great

00:27:54,250 --> 00:28:00,020
but it's not going to work in my

00:27:57,020 --> 00:28:02,090
circumstances and I want to give a

00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:03,650
couple of examples about not just

00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:06,890
impostor syndrome but just doubt in

00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:10,250
general I think doubt about your own

00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:13,760
capabilities and your ability to focus

00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:16,250
and learn new things and even preparing

00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:19,220
for this talk I had in my notes

00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:21,289
initially put and talk about impostor

00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:22,669
syndrome and then I freaked out because

00:28:21,289 --> 00:28:25,190
I was like I'm not qualified to talk

00:28:22,669 --> 00:28:26,690
about impostor syndrome and then I was

00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:29,299
panicking about it and I was like how am

00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:31,970
I going to explain this so yeah

00:28:29,299 --> 00:28:34,700
ironically I think probably the best way

00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:37,900
to explain it is that impostor syndrome

00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:40,220
feeling like you're gonna get caught out

00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:43,159
so you don't know what you're doing

00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:46,070
or that you cannot fumbling your way

00:28:43,159 --> 00:28:47,630
through but you don't really know what

00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:48,920
you're doing and someone's gonna figure

00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:53,590
that out at some point

00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:56,930
and a good way to think of this is that

00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:59,960
doubt is birds flying around your head

00:28:56,930 --> 00:29:00,380
and there's nothing you can do to stop

00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:03,710
them

00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:04,970
you can't stop doubt you'll always have

00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:06,640
these little birds flying around your

00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:08,870
head keeping in your ear all the time

00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:11,900
what you can do is stop them from

00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:13,760
nesting in your hair so you're never

00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:17,510
going to ignore the doubt just don't let

00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:20,990
it settle that's my piece of advice but

00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:24,590
sometimes it's extremely hard so my last

00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:26,960
three real Python articles completely

00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:31,280
freaked out every single one the first

00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:32,930
one was about testing and spend a lot of

00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:35,750
time putting it together and published

00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:37,640
it and asking people for feedback and my

00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:38,330
worry was that somebody who really knew

00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:40,850
what they were doing

00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:42,500
would read it and be like what is this

00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:45,800
idiot talking about none of this stuff's

00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:48,620
true that's wrong and it's hard and it's

00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:50,000
difficult but like I say you're never

00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,290
gonna stop the birds from flying around

00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,130
your head just try and stop us from

00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:57,830
nesting in your hair and another example

00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:59,690
for me is was a my name's Anthony sure

00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:03,770
there's another Anthony who I look up to

00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:07,820
equal to athletes to CLA and he to me is

00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:10,730
like much more successful person so he

00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:13,910
like contributes to Corp I test he has

00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:16,310
like a video blog video tutorials and it

00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:19,490
was so bizarre meeting him at PyCon in

00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:21,020
the US this year because and he was

00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:22,430
really excited to meet me I was really

00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,360
excited to meet him we just have

00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:27,190
different approaches and different

00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:30,050
schools so don't think that you have to

00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:31,820
finally get there like I said with Mario

00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:35,390
at the end this is just about

00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:36,650
continually evolving and then lastly in

00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:39,200
this slide if there's anything I can

00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:42,110
leave you with its that doubt kills more

00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:46,550
dreams than failure so try and stop

00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:49,460
those birds from nesting okay so let's

00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:52,130
say you've done all this you've got your

00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:54,140
8080 model you've got your two strong

00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:56,630
legs that you can stand on and you found

00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:58,520
a job that you want to apply for so

00:30:56,630 --> 00:31:01,250
you're going to find loads of tutorials

00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:03,019
out there about how to nail technical

00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:06,470
interviews

00:31:03,019 --> 00:31:08,389
super important but the reason most

00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:11,389
people don't get the job is not for

00:31:08,389 --> 00:31:13,359
those reasons I think I may be

00:31:11,389 --> 00:31:17,299
interviewed about 300 developers and

00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:19,220
I'll share with you typically the

00:31:17,299 --> 00:31:21,039
reasons that I haven't hired people or

00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:23,179
where people have fallen short and

00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:25,129
almost always it's not for technical

00:31:23,179 --> 00:31:27,769
reasons because you can read down the CV

00:31:25,129 --> 00:31:29,389
ifs on someone's TV you can normally

00:31:27,769 --> 00:31:31,820
figure out if they've got the technical

00:31:29,389 --> 00:31:33,710
know-how to even have an interview but

00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:36,379
then once they're in front of you these

00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:38,450
are basically the things that I would

00:31:36,379 --> 00:31:41,539
like to know and often interviewers who

00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:44,109
do this a lot want to know number one

00:31:41,539 --> 00:31:46,249
why are they leaving their last job if

00:31:44,109 --> 00:31:49,070
you haven't prepared an answer to that

00:31:46,249 --> 00:31:50,509
before you get in there and the answer

00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:51,399
is either uncomfortable or you haven't

00:31:50,509 --> 00:31:54,429
really thought it through

00:31:51,399 --> 00:31:58,340
it makes the interviewer uncomfortable

00:31:54,429 --> 00:32:00,289
so if if the reason is genuinely I mean

00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:02,539
the reason most people to lose their jaw

00:32:00,289 --> 00:32:05,570
leave their jobs is because they don't

00:32:02,539 --> 00:32:09,320
like or get on with their manager so if

00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:10,309
that's the reason think beforehand how

00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:16,850
you're going to explain that in the

00:32:10,309 --> 00:32:18,590
interview please secondly do they have

00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:21,980
the skills we need and those are not all

00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:23,269
going to be technical so saying that you

00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:25,789
know the latest version of this

00:32:23,269 --> 00:32:28,489
framework or you do this is going to be

00:32:25,789 --> 00:32:29,929
good enough to get you in the door but

00:32:28,489 --> 00:32:31,369
there's going to be other skills do you

00:32:29,929 --> 00:32:33,499
know how to work in an agile team for

00:32:31,369 --> 00:32:35,029
example do you know how to run you know

00:32:33,499 --> 00:32:37,369
to do stand-ups do you know how to putt

00:32:35,029 --> 00:32:39,019
tear with people and you know anything

00:32:37,369 --> 00:32:42,649
about unit testing do you know how to

00:32:39,019 --> 00:32:44,960
debug the build for example and so do

00:32:42,649 --> 00:32:47,029
you have the skills they need before you

00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:49,279
go to the interview read the job

00:32:47,029 --> 00:32:50,570
description because you know what skills

00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:52,429
they need because they will put it in

00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:55,100
the description the number of people

00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:57,109
who've who have I've interviewed who

00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:58,460
haven't really thought through what

00:32:57,109 --> 00:33:02,359
we've said in the description is

00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:04,340
astonishing so please prepare thoroughly

00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:05,859
well they work well with others if

00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:07,970
you're working in a team environment

00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:09,799
it's not just important that you know

00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:11,690
what you're doing it's important that

00:33:09,799 --> 00:33:13,489
you can work with the rest of the team

00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:15,859
this is hard to figure out in an

00:33:13,489 --> 00:33:16,280
interview but there's lots of subtle

00:33:15,859 --> 00:33:18,710
quest

00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:20,180
you'll typically get asked they rarely

00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:22,490
asked do you work well on the team

00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:24,560
because it's really obvious and really

00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:26,870
easy to answer but they'll be looking

00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:28,430
for other things like have you got

00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:30,590
stories about how you collaborated with

00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:32,870
people have you got stories about how

00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:36,650
you've taught people on the team how

00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:38,950
does that work this is really important

00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:41,870
interview people who are technically

00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:44,600
absolutely brilliant but not hide them

00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:45,550
because their ego didn't fit through the

00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:48,230
door

00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:49,430
and this is super important because it

00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:51,680
links to the previous one

00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:54,200
so whilst it's important to have

00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:57,230
confidence in an interview sometimes

00:33:54,200 --> 00:34:01,040
it's not super appropriate and so just

00:33:57,230 --> 00:34:02,300
please turn it down sometimes and then

00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:04,340
are they going to learn new things so

00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:05,830
that links to their previous previous

00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:13,040
slides that I've raised

00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:15,080
cool so sorry I missed a really really

00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:19,820
important one are they going to ask for
