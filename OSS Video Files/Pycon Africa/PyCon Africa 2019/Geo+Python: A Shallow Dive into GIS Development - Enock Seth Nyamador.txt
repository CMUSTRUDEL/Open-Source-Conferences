good afternoon my name is Enoch and I

00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:10,730
think we are far behind time know which

00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:13,960
Matt time will be quick and snappy just

00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:17,330
yet to tell you about geo and Python

00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:20,180
there have been a lot of talks but I

00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:23,180
similar to find a lot of them in

00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:25,550
relation to you so I decided to put in

00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:29,060
this call and this presentation it was

00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:32,210
accepted and I'm here to say something

00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:36,559
but before we get started first of all I

00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:39,829
wouldn't call it a disclaimer NIDA an

00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:42,109
aspect in these two fields but I still

00:00:39,829 --> 00:00:46,549
do something with them every day as part

00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:49,280
of my workflow and what I do may not be

00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:52,369
convinced enough I'm trying I will try

00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,679
to convince you and then finally if you

00:00:52,369 --> 00:00:57,039
take a deep dive the title says a

00:00:54,679 --> 00:01:01,119
shallow dive but if you take a deep dive

00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:04,850
I'm sorry there's no lifeguard on duty

00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:09,590
so basically we'll be looking at gi's

00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:13,280
basics was you and some Python projects

00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:16,909
that connects you with geospatial now

00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,229
why is this really important it's

00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:20,149
important because everything that

00:01:18,229 --> 00:01:22,579
happens in this world happens somewhere

00:01:20,149 --> 00:01:25,729
the link of our days to a YouTube video

00:01:22,579 --> 00:01:27,649
by the UN which I think when you watch

00:01:25,729 --> 00:01:31,130
it you can actually access the fact that

00:01:27,649 --> 00:01:35,649
everything that we do has the location

00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:37,939
component and nor related as snakes

00:01:35,649 --> 00:01:40,189
actually understand geography the leaf

00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:41,479
traces around and it's like now we are

00:01:40,189 --> 00:01:43,310
snakes in a digital world

00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:45,890
whatever we do we are living the

00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:48,259
location traces everyone checks in on

00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:51,859
Facebook do Instagram and other stuffs

00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:54,679
the allocation is being recorded now

00:01:51,859 --> 00:01:58,880
basically what is G is G is a system

00:01:54,679 --> 00:02:03,469
made of both hardware software and the

00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:05,479
users the women's we use maps or we

00:02:03,469 --> 00:02:08,950
interact with certain level of

00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:12,170
applications that have maps in them Maps

00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:13,940
the end product or just a small part of

00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:18,020
the GIS world

00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:21,050
miss geographic information systems yes

00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:23,300
also have data types and if you want to

00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:25,580
get started with developing applications

00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:27,410
or doing something with your dev you

00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:29,840
need to understand the concept of what

00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:31,760
this is really about if you are writing

00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,250
an application for a bank you need to

00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:37,510
know how the workflow is so we have a

00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:40,760
two data type that is vector and raster

00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:42,680
the vector data simply represent all you

00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,540
query that is what you can search for

00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,700
that's what is in the database if you're

00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:49,550
searching for Bank of Canada to Rome you

00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:51,830
search on Google Maps or any other map

00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:54,080
application use is the vector data that

00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:57,980
is being queried and it's in three forms

00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,960
see the point line or polygon points we

00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:01,450
see all of our lines representing

00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:05,630
continuous features such as roads

00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:08,890
streams etc polygons buildings football

00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:12,200
field swimming pool what have you and

00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:15,710
this vector data is in several formats

00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:18,350
they are open some a proprietary graph

00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:20,840
geo package which is highly open

00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:23,030
geo Jason which some of us may have used

00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:25,610
before if you're a developer you have

00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:27,410
played with some loose tiles before and

00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:31,459
pause the eyes which is an extension to

00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:34,820
the Postgres database allows you to do

00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:37,640
really advanced cool stuffs sometimes

00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:40,700
you can't even do with easy in the GI

00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:44,360
systems and then shape files I push a

00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:47,000
files as a small item because shell file

00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:50,720
is actually not a one file or want a one

00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,300
data type is several files which kind of

00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:56,170
bloated if you miss one file you are

00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:58,640
Bish's by is one of the most used format

00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:01,070
outside there the requesting that your

00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:05,150
data you will find it in a shape file

00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:08,330
Muslim your hasta is the picture you see

00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:11,690
the picture you see the satellite image

00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:14,630
the auto photo that if the DMS what are

00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:17,780
you so this is Rusted rasta enables us

00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:21,100
to generate vector data because you can

00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:23,660
see the alignment and the other stuffs

00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:25,820
now you also need to understand a

00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:27,950
coordinate reference system

00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:29,420
this will not go marching or not say

00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:34,010
much but this is just to tell you that

00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:36,320
the earth is not flat or maybe just

00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:37,970
plain like that I we have X Y we have

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,850
latitude along it but it's not this

00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:42,590
really the case mostly so you can't use

00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:45,260
the latitude and longitude for Ghana

00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:47,900
here in a different projection

00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:50,990
projection just like we have a skill

00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:54,020
I mean Ghana here my projection is kind

00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:55,880
of different from somewhere in the US if

00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:57,590
I pick a coordinate here and I use it in

00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:00,110
a different project it belongs to the US

00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:02,420
you do not actually put that points or

00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:05,390
that locations at Leo I am one comma one

00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:08,300
that is used and we all use it Mosley's

00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:11,240
by the sat-nav the GPS receivers does

00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:13,070
wgs84 and logic along we see every

00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,080
dollar come if you travel along you

00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:17,270
don't have to reproject your stuffs they

00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:19,370
push you on the map automatically so

00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:21,530
this is one thing that it's confusing

00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:24,500
sometimes but you need to get your hands

00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:26,150
of it as you start doing your

00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:28,360
development because that I have to

00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:32,060
project present needs to be in a certain

00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:36,260
coordinate reference system why the need

00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:38,300
for just special development acts and

00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:40,670
all this stuff there are several

00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:45,770
questions that could be answered from

00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:48,110
geo analysis basic buffer say how many

00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:50,510
people could be affected in the flooding

00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:52,850
we have a drain with a very big drain

00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:56,200
and then it's overflowing how many

00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:59,180
people be affected in five meter radius

00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:01,910
you can actually do this stuff and then

00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:03,800
in a GI system and it gives you that

00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:05,750
idea gives you the perspective the

00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,490
picture the visual presentative of what

00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:10,790
is missing here what is not there and

00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:13,180
what can be done and server analysis you

00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:16,430
could do as a sibility connectivity and

00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:18,290
many more yeah

00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:20,660
so if you are getting started or you are

00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:26,360
doing geo development one issue that you

00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:30,050
might come across is data data is really

00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:32,930
really an issue let me say on our side

00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:36,230
of the continent because government is

00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:39,340
the biggest or the largest producer of

00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:43,270
data you can't doubt

00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:45,130
fact and then most institutions think

00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:47,080
this is a personal property sometimes

00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:48,639
and it's locked up you need data for

00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:51,760
some time something you have to go

00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:54,460
knocking sobre this and stuff before you

00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:56,919
get it but it's a major producer of data

00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:59,350
we have private and then we have the

00:06:56,919 --> 00:07:03,850
crowd and it turns out the crowd seems

00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:07,510
to wake faster and better in our area

00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:10,479
over here so I will take the time to

00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:13,600
talk about one great project called Open

00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:15,520
Street Map where if you want to try

00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:19,389
something and you don't have a data from

00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:23,169
anyway play around a quick source to go

00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:26,979
to for data is Open Street Map this

00:07:23,169 --> 00:07:29,919
online offline and open data is an open

00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:32,080
database common license and at the base

00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:35,289
level all the time Open Street Map is

00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:39,729
xml stored in a posse is database and

00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:42,310
you can assess osm dog yeah it's a map

00:07:39,729 --> 00:07:45,130
of the world and try it people trying to

00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:47,700
map the robot from scratch no copying

00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:50,710
because all other maps you see have

00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:53,260
copyrights Google Maps is free as in

00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:55,120
free beer but not as in freedom so you

00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:56,889
can use it here move around but you

00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,979
can't get a nitty gritty what is in the

00:07:56,889 --> 00:08:01,960
database you can actually extract it for

00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:04,360
me or someone with a geographic

00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:07,330
geologist want to do something with this

00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:10,900
or a GI system can actually reuse data

00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:13,599
come from Google operations might be

00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:18,250
used by many I use it every day every

00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:19,840
second Facebook is one big user who by

00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:21,970
uses it as well

00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,820
when Korean purposes is the map that we

00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:28,780
call it save lives because for disaster

00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:32,020
risk management the federal respondents

00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:34,870
need just basic data when there's an

00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:37,959
earthquake all you need as a respondent

00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:40,810
is which rows are disconnected you don't

00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:43,479
care if there are plating but roads are

00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:46,570
disconnected basic stuffs so even two

00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:49,959
routes on the map is better than none

00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:52,060
for Red Cross or USAID or any respondent

00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:53,149
community yeah you can try OpenStreetMap

00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:55,639
yourself offline

00:08:53,149 --> 00:08:58,699
my favorite application is the first one

00:08:55,639 --> 00:09:00,999
who assam ant tell you that you can

00:08:58,699 --> 00:09:05,509
download a whole database because it's

00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:07,999
open data yeah this organizes features

00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:09,350
what are we what ever that is permanent

00:09:07,999 --> 00:09:11,480
of just Carter we mapped in this

00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:14,149
database and you can also extract it

00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:16,459
like I said in the beginning is XML at a

00:09:14,149 --> 00:09:20,199
base level so whatever I save is key

00:09:16,459 --> 00:09:23,749
value pairs with dates and time stamp

00:09:20,199 --> 00:09:26,089
now you as a developer you would like to

00:09:23,749 --> 00:09:28,309
maybe query this database extract data

00:09:26,089 --> 00:09:30,379
from it the Swiss Army knife to the

00:09:28,309 --> 00:09:34,370
whole database is called overpass API

00:09:30,379 --> 00:09:36,019
this API is really interesting you can

00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:39,999
really use it in your tools and better

00:09:36,019 --> 00:09:43,309
do whatever this year is just basically

00:09:39,999 --> 00:09:45,350
searching for all schools so all schools

00:09:43,309 --> 00:09:48,050
in Ghana will be a military school and

00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:51,819
then Assad I think I run this around

00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:54,829
12:00 12:00 a.m. dis done and had

00:09:51,819 --> 00:09:56,839
thousand for staff that is basically on

00:09:54,829 --> 00:09:59,959
notes points there might be schools on

00:09:56,839 --> 00:10:02,569
polygons not lines because lines can

00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:05,389
represent that so points this what is

00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:08,240
telling me and you can do several stab

00:10:05,389 --> 00:10:11,749
their libraries to do connectivity see a

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:13,999
graph network this is a quick graph

00:10:11,749 --> 00:10:16,759
network of routes around investing on

00:10:13,999 --> 00:10:19,759
Ghana and just some train line of course

00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:25,939
and with a osm annex library I could

00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:27,529
just do this quickly just OpenStreetMap

00:10:25,939 --> 00:10:29,870
in Africa is a community just like how

00:10:27,529 --> 00:10:32,600
we have Python community Wikimedia and

00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:34,999
whatever you serve wrapper just going on

00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:37,040
you're not Africa and across and this

00:10:34,999 --> 00:10:39,290
year there is also going to be state of

00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,809
the map like graph pack on Africa in

00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:44,740
Cody voyagers here so you can check it

00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:47,540
out and see what you can grab from it

00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:51,410
data reuse because it's open data can be

00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:53,240
reused several times just last week this

00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:54,889
application was open source does how

00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:58,069
come I'm adding it to my slide it's

00:10:54,889 --> 00:11:00,620
called truck shots up this data was

00:10:58,069 --> 00:11:03,259
generated into OpenStreetMap we use the

00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:04,490
OSM to GTFS to convert GTFS is a

00:11:03,259 --> 00:11:06,380
standard for

00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:08,240
transits data so

00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:10,190
you're searching for where is the next

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,280
bus arriving in Europe or using a train

00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:16,160
or Google Maps to query transit stuff

00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:19,520
the data is in GTFS so with this tool is

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:22,190
Python 3 we were able to transform a dis

00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:23,090
daytime to gtfs and his lab you can also

00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:24,740
go grab it

00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:28,670
try something innovative with it and

00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:31,820
let's make our lives better Nadia's

00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:34,430
application a system you can do all from

00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:36,140
the terminal because it might not be

00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:38,330
friendly from you for you to program

00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:40,040
distance in the beginning so yeah where

00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:42,080
we have open source and proprietary one

00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:44,630
issue is a big player in the proprietary

00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:49,370
industry OS dude open source you've

00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:53,720
special foundation that's QGIS and QGIS

00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:57,470
is one too that loves Python at its core

00:11:53,720 --> 00:12:01,580
the QGIS has an API that is built on top

00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:04,810
of Python so you can see and a Python

00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:08,990
console directly in the QGIS interface

00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:11,600
huger also has plugins that I would say

00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:14,620
80% of the plugins that extend the

00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:20,000
functionality of QGIS I built with

00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:22,190
Python and when I was just writing these

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:27,110
slides I look into tiled and quickly I

00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:29,600
saw something this is over 2000 DMS

00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:31,940
digital elevation models by someone is

00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,940
trying to process them in QGIS and guess

00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:38,120
what he's using just just three lines of

00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:39,920
Python code to actually support some

00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:42,320
other stuff she's doing tell you that

00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:45,170
it's not any big stuff you have to do

00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:48,050
but understand the basics identify the

00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:51,830
field in which you want to use GI

00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:55,730
development and implementing it geo node

00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:57,740
is one interesting project is a CMS for

00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:59,930
geospatial data you might want to create

00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:02,930
a portal for geospatial data but

00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:06,410
database such as MySQL might not be able

00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:09,550
to handle your elements with that kind

00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:13,040
of geometry they have so you'll note is

00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:16,250
interesting built on top of jungle which

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:18,470
you love we has a Jo server the backend

00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:19,899
and some other stuffs it has been

00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:21,759
deployed around the

00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:25,149
so you can also take a look and see how

00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:28,209
this could serve them in your you're

00:13:25,149 --> 00:13:30,190
awake yeah there are some other

00:13:28,209 --> 00:13:31,800
libraries there a lot of them we can

00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:34,839
look at all of them this meant to be a

00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:36,639
an appetizing talk talk to motivate you

00:13:34,839 --> 00:13:38,500
and inspire you to see what you are

00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,630
missing from the new site and you can

00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:43,420
dive into it you have several of them

00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:46,660
and in pattern there's a pipe roach

00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:48,009
which manages CRS that is corny

00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,630
reference system so you don't need to

00:13:48,009 --> 00:13:51,430
always go after search for Cornell

00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:53,829
reference or try to control them

00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:57,750
yourself but with this you can handle

00:13:53,829 --> 00:14:02,319
projections and other stuff yeah so

00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:05,410
basically in conclusion GIS is fun there

00:14:02,319 --> 00:14:08,170
is more than just writing codes to eat

00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:10,600
because what you are doing goes directly

00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:12,420
to effect something which is physical

00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:16,000
all the stuffs you have seen a

00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:19,290
location-based manipulate the libraries

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,459
I said Pat allows you and vice versa and

00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:23,470
your data science there there is data

00:14:21,459 --> 00:14:26,560
science we do a lot of people in data

00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:29,170
science but other geospatial component

00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:31,360
to it and see the beauty brings there is

00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:33,639
a location component to all the data

00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:38,680
being collected if it does not exist you

00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:40,810
can and I don't know if maybe pattern is

00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:42,850
taken over because there are a lot of

00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:45,100
stuffs you could actually do in a GI

00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:49,089
system that you could still run from a

00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:52,990
Python such as maybe clipping and basic

00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:54,730
GIS analysis and get out there try

00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:56,829
something you can collect GPS points

00:14:54,730 --> 00:15:00,220
yourself try to visualize how you move

00:14:56,829 --> 00:15:02,110
from home to work all this data you can

00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:04,509
actually color them yourself play around

00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:07,600
it and see it's no rocket science

00:15:04,509 --> 00:15:09,459
absolutely and just to conclude all

00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,990
these stuffs are built around

00:15:09,459 --> 00:15:13,300
communities without communities who

00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:16,300
would not be here today to celebrate

00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:18,430
this community as a park on Africa so

00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:21,550
the several of them Wikimania pike own

00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:24,759
set of the muffles 4g in Accra here we

00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:26,620
have a user group for Linus and then we

00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:28,720
meet every Saturday to tomorrow be

00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:30,550
meeting and then so what I basically

00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,400
want to say is if you are a developer

00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:35,040
you do some 10 years

00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:37,050
all kind of just try to connect to the

00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,610
community share what you know and then

00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:40,560
learn from others as well because it's a

00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:43,670
community of practice we learn from each

00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:45,680
other and then the community grows

00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:53,559
thank you

00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:53,559
[Applause]

00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:06,319
thank you

00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:32,559
[Music]

00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,200
[Music]

00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:23,050
okay can I tell it straight forever all

00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:26,160
right so I was talking specifically

00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:29,890
about OpenStreetMap now talking about

00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:33,730
accuracy wise in relation to what is on

00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:35,350
the ground everyone is wrong what shows

00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:37,900
that this is Bank of Ghana auditorium

00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:40,990
you may sit on Google Maps or any other

00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:43,030
Maps my washes is Bank of nanomaterial

00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:45,540
unless you come in doesn't exist before

00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:48,430
you know that this doesn't exist so

00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:50,500
talking about accuracy operation fit map

00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:52,600
is a crowd source project crowd-sourced

00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:55,570
movement the whole database is built on

00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:57,610
the wiki style like Wikipedia Wikipedia

00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:58,810
and everybody can contribute even if you

00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:03,280
don't have an account you can contribute

00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:05,290
but whatever you do is start there is

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,820
history about it you can see the history

00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:09,100
of it so in operations map every single

00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:10,390
point you add that history about it so

00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:12,490
you have that flexibility to add

00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:14,830
something for a newcomer and then you

00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:17,770
mess it up still there is somebody who

00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:18,130
actually see at one point in a time fix

00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:18,940
it

00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:21,100
send you

00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:23,170
guide you you know not to become a

00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:25,660
better person because it's a community

00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:27,700
of practice some people started very

00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:29,710
badly by the point in time they got

00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,970
mente they found out that is out to do

00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:33,400
you know that the person didn't know how

00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:35,530
to do it but in the beginning it was not

00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:38,410
obvious that this is how to do it so

00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:41,820
yeah OpenStreetMap is one platform is a

00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:44,410
community very big than myself here and

00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:46,570
the data gets in there true volunteers

00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:48,760
is a volunteer volunteered geographic

00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:49,600
information so volunteers put

00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,490
information there

00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,770
just like how Google Maps Google map

00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:56,020
buys the data volunteers put today as

00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:58,720
well but OpenStreetMap we don't buy the

00:18:56,020 --> 00:19:01,840
data we put it ourselves and it's for

00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:04,690
everybody well for Google Maps is for G

00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:06,120
you can't use it as a shapefile I've

00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:10,120
never tried before

00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:11,620
good yeah you have to do it yourself but

00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:14,590
so you can go for the whole

00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:16,810
OpenStreetMap database and use it as a

00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:18,940
shapefile database whatever and because

00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:21,610
it's reusable does not come facebook's

00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:23,470
map when you check Facebook the map you

00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:25,570
see there is hand represent Open Street

00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:27,700
Map with some other things coming from

00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:30,610
Facebook itself and upper maps also is

00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:33,280
Open Street Map for the road networks so

00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:36,910
is for everybody the other one use it

00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:38,970
you state that from Open Street Map

00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:42,450
I've I've been able to answer a question

00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:42,450
thank you very much

00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:16,979
[Music]

00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:30,580
you are right University of Ghana is

00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:32,640
mapped on OpenStreetMap so what

00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:35,380
basically that line is doing is using

00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,990
geo coder called no Martin which

00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:41,470
OpenStreetMap uses so no Martin is open

00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:42,970
source and then is searching for area

00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:44,980
points anything that has the name

00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:47,410
University of Ghana within a crack

00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:50,140
anything Ghana you can see the comma is

00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:52,090
actually specifying so if I said for

00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:55,960
University of Ghana me somewhere else it

00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:59,110
will return a list of values so just

00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:03,070
that and it is just plotting a graph is

00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:06,490
really basic this and this one is based

00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:10,390
on the overpass API so overpass is just

00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:13,240
like the terminal to query data in

00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:17,050
OpenStreetMap at the base of the XML

00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:18,760
itself so easily defined amenity equal

00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:21,520
SKU so in OpenStreetMap recall something

00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:23,620
map features here so that is how the

00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:26,350
whole community has agreed to map

00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:28,420
schools so when you go to UK to go for

00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:31,840
whatever you go every screw that is map

00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:33,730
has physical tag so this University of

00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,650
Ghana so you can see University of Ghana

00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:38,650
he is having the touch we have key and

00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:40,690
then a value K equals this so is having

00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:41,950
amenity school you can say for

00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:43,960
University of Ghana is amenity

00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:45,910
University so that is how invest is

00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:48,820
attacks does the physical what is the

00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:51,160
Reg no is ATM by doesn't mean all of

00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:53,020
them has the key amenity is very so when

00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:55,540
a map features which you see that and

00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:59,560
then it really search for that in Ghana

00:21:55,540 --> 00:22:00,730
and these four points so you can see

00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:03,909
note

00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:05,889
then Odia is a point yeah so this side

00:22:03,909 --> 00:22:08,919
as I was saying that it could be that

00:22:05,889 --> 00:22:11,200
the schools that are mapped as polygons

00:22:08,919 --> 00:22:14,100
that is the person knew the boundary and

00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,100
trace it around

00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:18,299
