Publication date: 2019-12-05
Playlist: PyCon Africa 2019
Description: 
	Candy tells us what WebVR is and how we can use it to implement diverse applications. Furthermore shares knowledge skills, and the right platforms we can use to communicate with other Mozillians to learn more on WebVR, and also learn more about how to build and maintain  volunteers community, and how to overcome obstacles we might encounter  as a community.

my name is candy I'm from Ghana I'm a

00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:21,869
Muslim speaker and enthusiastic about

00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:25,250
technology so start my presentation on

00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:25,250
what we are

00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:40,010
so um firstly electrically what remote

00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:42,720
reality is where no reality is

00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:47,400
computer-generated technology or a

00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:52,160
simulation of three 3d environments or

00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:59,040
an image which you can possibly up

00:00:52,160 --> 00:01:02,730
interact with kind of like manna so as

00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:05,509
you can see behind me that somebody kind

00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:08,509
of like shooting something but it's not

00:01:05,509 --> 00:01:08,509
so

00:01:19,689 --> 00:01:29,229
so what is wimpy our web PR is more of

00:01:23,329 --> 00:01:36,799
like experiencing video yeah but having

00:01:29,229 --> 00:01:40,990
experience on the web browser so um I

00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:44,569
would like to explain how when VR is the

00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:49,099
advantages of having what we are so what

00:01:44,569 --> 00:01:53,479
PR is open it's mostly you could program

00:01:49,099 --> 00:01:56,090
using HTML and it's connected you can

00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:59,929
browse from one hyperlink to another and

00:01:56,090 --> 00:02:03,340
it's also instance you can share it's

00:01:59,929 --> 00:02:16,220
not like some kind of like complex

00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:20,410
technology the community so I'll go

00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:24,319
right up to explain the process that I

00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:26,959
firstly used as Mozilla when we were

00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:30,829
carrying out this project of what we are

00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:40,400
so the one of the first browsers to be

00:02:30,829 --> 00:02:44,329
used to deploy of what VR was 15 and it

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:47,590
came about to also be able to use other

00:02:44,329 --> 00:02:49,819
browsers like chrome chromium into the

00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:52,819
Microsoft edge and all the other

00:02:49,819 --> 00:02:57,069
browsers it's pretty much kind of like

00:02:52,819 --> 00:02:57,069
is an open-source product that

00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:09,069
technology so they are different kinds

00:03:06,139 --> 00:03:13,099
of this friction within the eco system

00:03:09,069 --> 00:03:18,319
visual reality so um you may find out

00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:20,930
that when you are when you are creating

00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:24,920
applications for iOS

00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:26,930
or other platforms where you want to

00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:30,560
when you want your application to be

00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:32,390
seen or to be approved or to be accepted

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:39,530
within the sole you will have to go

00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:43,069
through some criteria so kind of like to

00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:46,489
find a lot of developers from developing

00:03:43,069 --> 00:03:52,400
VR applications and then one other

00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:55,269
problem that we encounter is that when

00:03:52,400 --> 00:04:00,379
when people wanted to create your

00:03:55,269 --> 00:04:03,889
applications is that they have to they

00:04:00,379 --> 00:04:06,549
have to install a lot of software

00:04:03,889 --> 00:04:18,859
technologies like the happy-go-lucky

00:04:06,549 --> 00:04:34,789
software - because you have to lend the

00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:36,320
context so it and learn via so I would

00:04:34,789 --> 00:04:39,919
like to share with you one of the

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:45,099
gadgets some of the gadgets that are

00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:48,919
mostly used within the visual reality

00:04:45,099 --> 00:04:53,840
ecosystem so firstly we see the Google

00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:57,710
cardboard and cost around 15 dollars and

00:04:53,840 --> 00:05:00,560
then that's the oculus rift gadgets and

00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:04,130
we have the Sun someone we have the

00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:06,740
daydream nitendo and the high HTC hat

00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:09,229
which is one of the best our gadgets -

00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:18,400
kind of like an experiment and see how

00:05:09,229 --> 00:05:18,400
virtual reality operated at 360 so

00:05:18,669 --> 00:05:23,110
virtual reality is a very great

00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:33,690
technology to use but I wouldn't advise

00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:36,820
yes good end up having some issues so

00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:42,580
although this Peckham of what the young

00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:46,320
russ was introduced it was still quite

00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:50,620
hard for people because it was quite

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:59,320
complex complex and quite a harsh today

00:05:50,620 --> 00:06:01,080
so because why so when let me where we

00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:04,360
are and what's not because you have to

00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:06,850
import a lot of attributes you like you

00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:08,710
have to import what we are volatile you

00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:11,620
have to you have your camera you have to

00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:17,280
have lights you have to import a lot of

00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:17,280
things which is which was quite hot so

00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:27,370
the Mozilla community they introduced a

00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:32,350
frame so this is a technology which

00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:38,130
encapsulate a volatile place kind of

00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:38,130
like making it with VR to be able to

00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:57,690
where you can easy like a plain HTML

00:06:45,540 --> 00:07:00,970
code and drawing traction so for you to

00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:03,790
experience the 3d scenes and be

00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:08,230
introduced to the visual reality

00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:11,170
platform apron allows you to only have

00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:14,290
that scripts so but that's fear to you

00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:17,640
are easy to go and start having your

00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:24,130
components and starts building your

00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:27,790
hello world in the 3d so we have the 18

00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:32,160
tag the tag is mostly used for having

00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:37,540
your objects yeah you can build whatever

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:42,120
object you want to and so I'll go on and

00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:42,120
show you some of the objects that

00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:49,860
employed here so I don't have the box

00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:54,010
which is the object and then I'll have

00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:56,440
I'll give my box of confidence which is

00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:59,610
the color position and try get

00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:04,660
protection to it and they don't have

00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:10,300
Linda and just to give it up and give it

00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:11,020
to see the other ones and then we I have

00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:15,250
a plane

00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:21,700
this is a vision standing for my objects

00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:27,220
within the VR implementation of mine and

00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:30,490
then we have a sky which was my time

00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:33,160
created so the outcome of this will look

00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:39,729
like this this is the hello world for my

00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:46,840
virtual reality application so bear with

00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:50,190
me because we don't have but then if you

00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:50,190
were to copy that

00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:58,000
[Music]

00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:18,830
so um the next thing yes so my object is

00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:21,410
an empty key and it has it has to have

00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:24,890
company which is color or it could be

00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:28,580
sound or it could be position so for

00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:33,140
example as we had like the sphere there

00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:54,200
and let's Linda those were objects so I

00:09:33,140 --> 00:10:00,220
keep them color so if I wanted so we

00:09:54,200 --> 00:10:00,220
have registry was it a community this is

00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:30,370
you can have your application or try an

00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:30,370
application we also have an inspector

00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:38,089
this is where by possibly kind of like

00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:40,760
view the object that you have just

00:10:38,089 --> 00:10:43,600
created and kind of like see how you can

00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:47,959
position it better and a more

00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:49,459
appropriate manner so some of the tools

00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:57,880
that you could use whether you are

00:10:49,459 --> 00:11:01,250
create so I like to explain some of the

00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:05,779
technologies that have helped that are

00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:08,440
very advantageous to beneficial to the

00:11:05,779 --> 00:11:11,720
community and can help so many people to

00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:15,170
experience the things in a better way in

00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:19,100
the world so well apron we have like

00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:20,700
this Macomb and kitchen food so this

00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:24,480
would help a lot of doctors

00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:27,840
- kind of like experiments on how they

00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:31,740
could do at a top surgery so apron has

00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:38,130
that ability kind of like give you the

00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:47,790
experimental process without so this

00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:52,290
would be the future for future and then

00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:55,590
some of the other apps that have been

00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:58,290
done it that a painter so this is an

00:11:55,590 --> 00:12:05,610
application with why you can't walk you

00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:09,620
can have it going in and you can have a

00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:09,620
piece of your application

00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:25,310
and then um what are the application is

00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:30,889
the mathematics we can easily have we

00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:34,010
could easily analyze data and have what

00:12:30,889 --> 00:12:40,220
we are as one of those applications that

00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:43,490
could help us analyze data and then a

00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:47,870
plus this is fun bit for everyone who

00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:50,209
wants to just relax and have fun so we

00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:55,870
can easily create a game with a frame

00:12:50,209 --> 00:12:55,870
and play these shooting

00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:06,520
