Description: 
	One of the hardest things to do for developers, especially freelancers, is to inherit someone else's code, regardless it's an open source project, an internal project, or some small web page that your best friend asked you to fix. 
Flavio shares some of his experiences on this topic, some strategies to inherit old code without (totally) going mental, and how to rant about it without looking like a douchebag.
