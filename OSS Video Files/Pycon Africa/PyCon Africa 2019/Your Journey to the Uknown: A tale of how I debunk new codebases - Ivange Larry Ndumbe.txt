Playlist: PyCon Africa 2019
Description: 
	In this talk  Ivange will share his methods and tools he used to explore open source projects without asking too many questions on the issue to risk some other new contributor steal his issue and complete it.

thank you my name is Yvonne gallery' I'm

00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,809
a software engineer at bright core I'm

00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:15,570
from Cameroon

00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:18,210
I woke from what early from Cameroon and

00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:22,320
I'm happy to be at my first bike on as a

00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:25,859
speaker first bike on d'hubert my first

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:30,529
bike when I was super happy thank you

00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:33,420
so I will be sharing my experience on

00:00:30,529 --> 00:00:36,660
getting contributing to a new project

00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,430
like you come into large code bills and

00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:42,090
you find yourself overwhelmed

00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:43,410
so I started I started working I'm doing

00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:46,050
it with professional stuff from

00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:49,380
open-source projects so even though

00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:52,740
open-source projects are open like DC

00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:54,960
but the developers are volunteers so no

00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:57,390
one has the time to mentor you you might

00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,710
ask questions they will answer board you

00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:01,290
need to know the right questions to ask

00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:03,330
so a lot of times you might find

00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:05,040
yourself you get inside the core you

00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:13,880
have to figure things out on your own

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:17,760
so okay I'd like to start with the

00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:19,500
report quest I created I think that was

00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,450
like four months or five months ago I

00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,190
can't really remember

00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:27,510
so our language this is story behind the

00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:29,520
pool request so I was kind of bored one

00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:31,800
started even I was bought and that time

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:35,010
I was not working at bright core yet so

00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:36,930
I needed to pass time on something and I

00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:41,580
thought to myself ok let me contribute

00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:44,180
to an open-source project so i i've been

00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:46,440
using elasticsearch and spring but-- so

00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:50,130
those were the two projects that came to

00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:52,110
mind first so I I said ok let me

00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:53,729
contribute to elasticsearch I really

00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:58,979
like I like the idea of Alex's - its

00:01:53,729 --> 00:02:02,670
kind of cool so I picked an issue on on

00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:04,260
github it was not very clear so when I

00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:05,850
asked for clarification you know they

00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:08,250
say thing with open source especially

00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:11,340
the popular ones like it's crowded you

00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:13,170
know especially I think in the US there

00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,430
are some schools where they make it

00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:16,379
compulsory for their students to

00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:17,140
contribute to open source and there's

00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:18,580
program like

00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:20,230
some of code which makes a lot of

00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:22,810
students come to contribute to open

00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:24,880
source so I never did that there is

00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:27,010
competition to complete us especially

00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:30,069
when it's period for google Summer of

00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:32,110
Code so I asked the question about

00:02:30,069 --> 00:02:34,450
clarification on this the issue was

00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:36,580
still when I actually a question for

00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:39,010
clarification like why should I start to

00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:41,410
make code modifications I got a response

00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:43,239
I'm quickly but before I could finish my

00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:46,180
lunch someone else already acted on my

00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:49,330
response and made a pull request so a

00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:52,660
response that was meant for me so I

00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:54,970
decided another issue it was not very

00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:57,730
clear I asked the question again I got

00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:59,320
the response someone else acted on it so

00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:01,300
I decided I need to start figuring

00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:09,700
things out without creating too much

00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:12,519
attention so yeah so and after a bit

00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:15,250
like that this pull request was is a

00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:16,780
result of the decision I made so I

00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:19,180
picked an issue I didn't make any

00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:20,410
comment actually one guy acts for

00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,880
clarifications he didn't get any

00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:23,600
response but before a response could

00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:29,310
come already made a pull request for it

00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:33,400
[Laughter]

00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:36,489
yeah so under the put down the PR there

00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:38,350
was a lot I really I got frustrated oh I

00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:40,120
got angry for like maybe these guys

00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:41,560
don't want me to contribute so there was

00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,989
a lot of the conversation I didn't want

00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,510
to sit share the chat I don't know how

00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:48,519
they got ready so I'm sharing just the

00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:54,160
push on that belongs to me yeah which is

00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:56,560
my description of my pull quiz so like I

00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:59,560
said getting involved in a new project

00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,510
is can be frustrating I remember the

00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,049
first time I decided to contribute to

00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:04,660
open source

00:04:02,049 --> 00:04:07,060
I picked on an open source organization

00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:09,790
called open air matters they build a

00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:12,640
medical record system at the time I just

00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:15,100
I was just from Lenin's Java I didn't

00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,739
know anything about frameworks so I went

00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:20,590
to the code base I saw a lot of

00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:24,160
annotations and I freaked out so I

00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:27,789
wasn't sure what was happening then I I

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,770
left the project so I was fortunate to

00:04:27,789 --> 00:04:30,820
follow on a Java text book that talked

00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:33,870
about a lot about

00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:36,310
spring so when I started spring I

00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:38,650
started to like oh this thing I saw in

00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:41,230
this could this is what he was doing so

00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:42,670
then I went back to started making

00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:43,480
contributions back to the project in

00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:46,780
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:50,250
yeah and in 2017 now I got accepted my

00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:50,250
friends goggle Summer of Code internship

00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:58,030
so in my experience before you

00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,410
contribute to any project before you

00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:02,320
make any cool contribution

00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:03,790
you should demo the application like for

00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,400
my experience whenever I play the

00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:09,070
application as a normal user first when

00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,290
I go to the code it helps me create a

00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:15,430
mental map in my mind so when I see

00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:18,400
things for example say I log in form and

00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:20,320
I opened the codebase I see if something

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,030
called login dot P why I'm not lost I

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,590
know this is probably maybe this is

00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:26,440
something are already interacted with

00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:28,570
from the web browser so first like a

00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,790
first demo the application get a picture

00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:32,440
if the application is like too big you

00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:34,750
don't need to demo the whole application

00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:36,520
you pick a small component maybe you

00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:38,920
want to walk on you pick a small

00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:44,580
component you demo the component then

00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:44,580
you try to look for for the code that

00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:52,510
makes the okay thank you so so this was

00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:55,300
going to be a killer point but I

00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:58,060
attended Iran's presentation where he

00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:01,180
used him to be a lot of good stuffs so I

00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:05,320
guess editors are good too but I like

00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:07,810
IDs like I just help you navigate could

00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:09,610
easily so you can easily go to the

00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:11,680
implementation or like of a method that

00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:14,280
is being called in an idea just by

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,830
clicking on the method super time with

00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:20,740
things like editors it's usually hard

00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:23,170
when I work with a normal editor I have

00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:25,600
to come back and search from my terminal

00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:27,790
find a fire where I am the definition

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,550
I'm looking for my be defined then I

00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:31,960
open that file but with an idea I can

00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:35,170
just right click and say go to

00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:42,640
definition so I this will make life much

00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:44,800
easier for me well that being said so

00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:46,690
there are a lot of

00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,539
when I started coding an ID must be

00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:51,520
something that has some an editor a

00:06:49,539 --> 00:06:54,759
compiler and it's bugger all-in-one

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:57,490
software but right now I use vs could I

00:06:54,759 --> 00:07:00,060
- me I see like an IG but it's just an

00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:02,500
editor I use something else to compile

00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:05,259
it has a debugger they have never used

00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:08,020
it I used a port B from the terminal so

00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:10,240
but it's it's sophisticated it's there

00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:13,419
so I guess you should just use something

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:17,490
intelligent it's not our plane is it

00:07:13,419 --> 00:07:17,490
aware you have to find things manually

00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:27,039
okay so the next thing I do when I get

00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:29,620
into a new project is to look for

00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:32,409
patterns and it could be this helps like

00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:35,069
a lot of really world architecture

00:07:32,409 --> 00:07:38,469
projects either use the library or a

00:07:35,069 --> 00:07:39,759
framework or they have a custom

00:07:38,469 --> 00:07:42,159
architecture what you want to implement

00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:45,580
a new future there is a procedure you

00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:48,340
follow like for example our openmrs if

00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:50,919
you want to implement sorry this I'm

00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:52,029
walking for I'm building a proprietary

00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:53,800
software I would've loved to give

00:07:52,029 --> 00:07:55,719
examples what I'm currently working on

00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:58,210
but that's not possible so I'll keep

00:07:55,719 --> 00:08:01,360
referring to my open-source experience

00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:04,659
in the talk so like for example at

00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,789
openmrs to create a REST API for a

00:08:04,659 --> 00:08:08,680
resource did you have a key they have

00:08:06,789 --> 00:08:11,889
built the framework where you just need

00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:14,139
to implement one single class for it

00:08:11,889 --> 00:08:16,990
that capacity model and you have a

00:08:14,139 --> 00:08:19,389
complete REST API so first you need to

00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:21,729
understand find these patents like look

00:08:19,389 --> 00:08:23,440
at the code base dos DOS does this

00:08:21,729 --> 00:08:24,759
application does this code how do you

00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,800
have does that do they have a party I

00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:28,690
didn't using a particular framework say

00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,370
for example you want to contribute to a

00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:33,490
project I use this jungle is birch the

00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:36,159
first line jungle like once you know

00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:38,919
jungle it's easy to to see different

00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,839
code bases and like a little bit

00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:42,640
understand what is happening even though

00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:44,560
there are two different code bases that

00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,079
are not related because our framework

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:49,500
puts constraint on the application

00:08:47,079 --> 00:08:49,500
development

00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:56,230
yeah so you find out if the user library

00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:58,420
if it's a small library yeah fine if

00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:00,399
it's a Lewis library that is used all

00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:02,620
it's good to spend some time learning

00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,899
that library say for example you walk in

00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:08,860
on a project guy uses jQuery all over

00:09:04,899 --> 00:09:11,320
you know it's nice to figure out how the

00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:12,610
syntax of jQuery before yeah looking at

00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:15,760
it cool so you don't get lost

00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:17,230
so exactly another example I can Oh am I

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:23,019
remember one time I was looking at it

00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:25,630
code it had a person to join he had a

00:09:23,019 --> 00:09:28,300
person to join and I wanted to think I

00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:30,760
it was not always not it was not built

00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:31,990
by the code like it's not part of a

00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:36,370
solution

00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:38,740
it's it came from SQL alchemy so by

00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:40,990
learning SQL alchemy first I was not

00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:43,000
lost when I see something like that but

00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:45,790
at a time I did this thing was

00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,529
complicated so but I knew underneath

00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:49,420
that that that call was coming from SQL

00:09:47,529 --> 00:09:51,970
alchemy so I went to the documentation

00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:57,100
SQL alchemy and I read everything about

00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:58,870
it so when I talk about framework like

00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:01,630
for example a lot of applications

00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:03,160
followed MVC even those that are full

00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:05,500
and visit it's usually when you work

00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:08,380
with MVC applications it's usually easy

00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:10,120
to also like apply the same knowledge to

00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:12,040
figure out how things are working

00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:16,029
you know sometimes like for example when

00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:17,350
you see a URL on the web browser for

00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:18,610
example in my experience whenever I see

00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:21,640
you are on a web browser and I'm trying

00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:22,870
to debug something I quickly in my mind

00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:25,120
I first think okay I should be looking

00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:27,160
for say a controller or a resource you

00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,740
usually use those names interchangeably

00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:37,959
like say for an API let me give an

00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:42,519
example so for you a URL like this in my

00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:44,350
mind when I see that I know somewhere in

00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:46,839
the code base there is a mapping because

00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:50,050
I know it's used its its uses arm jungle

00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:52,990
at the back so somewhere at a back I

00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:56,620
know there is a mapping that map's this

00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:59,680
URL like to a specific code so it

00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:01,600
already gives me a little bit of Health

00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,300
stat I know I'm looking for something

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:07,899
that will say I'm at route map to this

00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:10,690
particular you are so if debugging says

00:11:07,899 --> 00:11:12,370
something like this I know I'll just

00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:15,389
look for extra in the code

00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:15,389
and actually found it

00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:39,060
okay I think I closed the project I

00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:49,950
almost I lose a project well look for it

00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:51,990
somewhere that time okay so so

00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:53,700
identified I still at identify patterns

00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:56,520
that it could be you want to read it

00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:58,800
dogs look at the requirements of txt if

00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:03,210
you have an application is using a sip

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:04,740
flask of jungle it's me it may be in its

00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:07,620
requirement or txt so that's a good

00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:09,840
start you look there you use Google or

00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:11,130
slack I found a lot of solution or slack

00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:14,460
like just searching on slack

00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:16,950
like when I'm gonna meet a bug this a

00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:18,870
lot of times when I just search on slack

00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:22,140
I find a solution without even asking a

00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:24,630
question and even on get up get up to is

00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:26,640
really helpful especially when I I have

00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:29,760
an idea of the file I'm looking for I

00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:31,440
can use github from fine future and give

00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:36,390
something mix a lot of suggestions for

00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:38,850
me so ok you can pay attention to what

00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:42,150
you're doing a lot of times the URL may

00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:44,730
not tell you where like for example the

00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:46,380
applications where the backend is there

00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:48,420
what you see on the URL has nothing to

00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:51,000
do what is happening at the back so you

00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:54,150
might see the URL it just says on whom

00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:58,250
but at the back it's calling an API rotc

00:12:54,150 --> 00:13:01,440
some slash API slash checklist so

00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:03,510
looking at a URL just they will not give

00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,010
you an idea it might not give you an

00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:06,810
idea so sometimes just what you are

00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:09,090
doing for example if you are login you

00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:11,220
are trying to log in or you are trying

00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:12,720
to sign up you know you might be looking

00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:14,520
for something that has to do with login

00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,840
or sign up in the code base so you

00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,370
should pay attention to what you are

00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:21,540
doing with a code while you are demoing

00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:24,510
like why you are playing with it so I

00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:26,820
think I like unit tests a lot I feel

00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:29,910
like unit test is documentation for

00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:31,740
programmers I program a lot for me maybe

00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:34,470
speaking for myself I like reading code

00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:36,900
more and I like reading normal stakes so

00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:39,149
when I'm working on an issue or the

00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:41,309
first thing I look for is the you

00:13:39,149 --> 00:13:44,220
so if there is no unit test for it I

00:13:41,309 --> 00:13:45,989
first write one so while writes in the

00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:48,179
test I get to learn a lot about a code

00:13:45,989 --> 00:13:50,160
base and if there's already a unit test

00:13:48,179 --> 00:13:51,420
for it just reading the test tells me

00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,829
like in the test because like in the

00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:54,869
test where I look at a test they will

00:13:52,829 --> 00:13:57,239
tell you how the API is supposed to be

00:13:54,869 --> 00:13:58,709
used so because they do is being used in

00:13:57,239 --> 00:14:00,299
the test so you get out you have an idea

00:13:58,709 --> 00:14:02,220
of how the API is supposed to be used

00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:03,959
so I like unit tests a lot so you should

00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:05,660
get familiar with writes you know

00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:09,269
reading unit tests

00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:13,679
yeah and box will help you yeah but just

00:14:09,269 --> 00:14:15,089
small box know small box no you might

00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:18,360
pick something that might frustrate you

00:14:15,089 --> 00:14:21,209
so it's nice to one you want to start

00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:23,970
contributing pick small box yeah so when

00:14:21,209 --> 00:14:25,860
you pick a small book it is really

00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:27,929
especially bugs I have like input and

00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:29,670
output say you are given an input and it

00:14:27,929 --> 00:14:32,369
give you the wrong output so it's

00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:33,449
usually easier to write a unit test or

00:14:32,369 --> 00:14:36,600
something like that if you are getting

00:14:33,449 --> 00:14:40,649
started on the project so some books may

00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:42,420
need you to spend hours running in life

00:14:40,649 --> 00:14:44,549
application to figure out what is

00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:47,040
happening but some we just write a unit

00:14:44,549 --> 00:14:48,689
test and you cash the box so I like box

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,519
a lot of small ones when I'm getting

00:14:48,689 --> 00:14:56,549
started not not the box I introduced

00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:58,980
though I don't like introducing box okay

00:14:56,549 --> 00:15:13,040
I was supposed to do a live demo and I

00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:13,040
could crash so yeah okay

00:15:16,589 --> 00:15:19,589
okay

00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,279
anything started up yeah

00:16:50,780 --> 00:17:08,780
okay okay Emily I just don't just

00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,780
proceed okay

00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:38,420
so I'll just continue that live demo but

00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:39,980
be he's trying to embarrass me so I want

00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:41,240
the pointers point I make you errors

00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:43,220
like you get to learn a lot from you

00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:45,020
errors but in the application I'm

00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:48,710
calling running the URL does not tell me

00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:51,740
anything so but I see believe I can

00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:56,300
still learn something from a URL so what

00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:59,240
I do is I open see the developer tools

00:17:56,300 --> 00:18:00,740
and like there's a lot of requests that

00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,240
happen even if it doesn't show on the

00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:04,940
browser like the browser just shows

00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:07,610
these but a lot of requests happen so

00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:13,100
see i refresh this page if you look the

00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:13,880
record on API down here like like slash

00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:16,280
API slash

00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:17,810
tickets so that is that gives me the

00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:19,910
information I need so sometimes even

00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:22,760
when the you are on the browser doesn't

00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:25,220
give you enough information to to know

00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:28,010
what to track down you you can open our

00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:32,360
dev tools we open their tools every

00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:34,940
request it's been recorded there yeah so

00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:38,330
you can also use our debugger pod be

00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:40,400
that is the one I use with Python it's

00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:43,280
really good so you wrote you can run

00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,650
your code it is inside pod be with

00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:49,550
breakpoints and analyze the input and

00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:50,780
output of your functions or you could do

00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:53,180
remote debugging when your application

00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:58,100
is running live are you connected to

00:18:53,180 --> 00:19:00,530
port B yeah okay that was the doors I

00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:06,070
was supposed to demo that but demo is

00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:06,070
not working so big questions thank you

00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:12,980
so we've got a little bit of time five

00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:53,929
minutes for questions but yeah thank you

00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:56,419
very much your your your torso so it

00:19:53,929 --> 00:19:59,120
depends like if I'm if I'm contributing

00:19:56,419 --> 00:20:02,270
to an open source project I just create

00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:04,490
an issue on github and with well a

00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:07,700
properly documented documented issue on

00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:10,370
github so for it and someone is going to

00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:12,580
look at an issue if it's a cool future

00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:15,500
they are probably going to approve it I

00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:18,020
make a peer or someone else make a PR

00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:20,150
but if you are walking and say in a

00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:22,460
software company probably you have to

00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:24,500
discuss these things say in a meeting

00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:29,600
with other engineers or your lead

00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:33,190
developer before changes can be made to

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,190
the codebase thank you

00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:38,400
[Applause]

00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:52,460
okay so I pick projects that I use so

00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,080
project that I use and I find

00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:56,060
interesting for example I said

00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,980
elasticsearch on spring boot loose up

00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:59,510
projects I used a lot and I found them

00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:01,760
interesting so I picked them to

00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:03,080
contribute so I you can I don't like

00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:06,740
codes which of the things are boring to

00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:08,390
me it's first it's volunteerism so you

00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:09,620
need to enjoy the way I doing it because

00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:12,020
nobody is going to pay you for it

00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:14,540
so I pick things that I like what it

00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:17,120
depends on your objective so when I pick

00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:19,760
my first project like Oprah's progressed

00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:22,670
to contribute to I was planning to apply

00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:24,500
for google Summer of Code and I had I

00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:25,820
did this know how I was thinking because

00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:29,420
I was not using elastic search or

00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:31,250
springboard at a time i I just got lucky

00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:32,450
and I picked that one there was no logic

00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:34,580
in picking up wound MREs

00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:35,870
but one I got experience if I want to

00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:36,820
contribute to a project I picked

00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:39,080
something I'm enjoying

00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:41,390
yeah something I've already been using

00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:45,700
then I like it so I pick it on a

00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:45,700
contribute to it thank you

00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:16,680
yeah yeah so what I learn a lot

00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:19,590
contributions open-source is following

00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:21,930
standards you know in open-source

00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:24,660
especially the very big ones they are

00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:28,530
very strict with code that gets merged

00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:31,950
into the idea idea could be so I learned

00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:35,190
to follow a lot of standards a lens

00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:38,310
write clean code and also I got used to

00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:41,940
writing unit tests by contributing to

00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:44,060
open source projects that answers your

00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:44,060
question

00:23:17,789 --> 00:23:24,640
okay so first you start with the

00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:26,320
motivation you need to have the

00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,179
motivation something that makes you

00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,470
something that will force you to want to

00:23:28,179 --> 00:23:31,510
contribute because first like I said

00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:33,789
it's free nobody's going to pay you for

00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:36,010
it so if it's some if you don't have a

00:23:33,789 --> 00:23:38,169
strong motivation it's easy to give up

00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:39,820
even when things may not be hot so for

00:23:38,169 --> 00:23:42,760
example me my first motivation was

00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:46,090
google Summer of Code in twini's I pass

00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:48,309
para in 2016 at that time it was $5,500

00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:51,090
that's a lot of money in Cameroon so

00:23:48,309 --> 00:23:53,919
that was a strong motivation for me so

00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:56,289
the first thing is to get him out get a

00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:57,730
strong motivation so something that is

00:23:56,289 --> 00:24:00,250
going to push you even when things get

00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:03,010
hot you will want to go because the

00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:04,409
motivation is there 5500 was enough to

00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:08,409
motivate me to contribute to open source

00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:11,110
so the next thing is like you pick a

00:24:08,409 --> 00:24:12,519
project if you are if you are not

00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:14,799
experienced or you don't use a lot of

00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:17,470
tools it's usually nice to ask someone

00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:19,299
experience like say ok I'm good in this

00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:21,070
programming language I would love to

00:24:19,299 --> 00:24:23,289
contribute to open source can you help

00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:25,059
with refer me to a nice project I can

00:24:23,289 --> 00:24:26,529
contribute to yes there are some

00:24:25,059 --> 00:24:28,510
projects that are beginner friendly as

00:24:26,529 --> 00:24:29,740
some other beginner friendly has nothing

00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:31,630
to do the code builds but to the

00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:33,610
documentation are the attitude of the

00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:35,740
contributors you know for some projects

00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:38,169
are very friendly very dumb question

00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:39,519
someone very senior very senior engineer

00:24:38,169 --> 00:24:41,889
sitting at them and answer your dumb

00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:46,269
question they take them are right really

00:24:41,889 --> 00:24:47,559
good documentation so you you don't you

00:24:46,269 --> 00:24:49,870
don't get lost you don't you don't get

00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:51,309
stuck too much so if you are getting

00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:53,380
started you don't have any clue act

00:24:51,309 --> 00:24:55,870
someone that is already confident so see

00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:57,340
okay I'm walking with this programming

00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:59,200
language I will really love to

00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:01,179
contribute an open-source project do you

00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,740
have anything to refer me to you is also

00:25:01,179 --> 00:25:04,419
nice to mention your interests if you

00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:06,789
like game development or like web

00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:07,100
development so the person has a little a

00:25:06,789 --> 00:25:09,980
lot

00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:13,100
like has more context on what you will

00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:16,910
enjoy and then once you already have a

00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:19,429
project read a lot of projects are

00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:20,330
getting started guides don't don't skip

00:25:19,429 --> 00:25:21,830
them always read them

00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:24,080
yeah you've read a getting started

00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:27,710
guides and then you start working on

00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:32,289
issues big small issues box yeah small

00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:32,289

yeah so I got my first job job shoe

00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:15,700

00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:21,010
your linkedin he has been he had me seen

00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:23,710

yeah um that's what I want to do so uh

00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:41,320
like I said I work for on implementation

00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:44,140
briefs inkabunga that uses openmrs as a

00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:46,240
back-end as a core because they put a

00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:49,510
lot of software together but openmrs

00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:53,110
decoded this career maher system then in

00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:55,240
Cameroon - I know if you walk first

00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:58,929
startup in Cameroon for like three

00:26:55,240 --> 00:27:03,150
months that has deployed openmrs at at

00:26:58,929 --> 00:27:03,150
the General Hospital in in in Dwolla

00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:10,869
