Publication date: 2019-11-18
Playlist: PyCon Africa 2019
Description: 
	The importance of this talk is to educate people on how to verify that stuff they create does not exclude the disabled.
As a deaf person, Adeyinka knows first hand that when software/tutorials/videos aren't accessible, it excludes people from its usage. It's a lose-lose situation for both creators and users. In this talk Adeyinka introduces the audience to the concept of accessibility testing.
