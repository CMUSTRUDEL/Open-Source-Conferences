Title: Accessibility Testing: Making Information & Software available to all & sundry - Adeyinka Adegbenro
Publication date: 2019-11-18
Playlist: PyCon Africa 2019
Description: 
	The importance of this talk is to educate people on how to verify that stuff they create does not exclude the disabled.
As a deaf person, Adeyinka knows first hand that when software/tutorials/videos aren't accessible, it excludes people from its usage. It's a lose-lose situation for both creators and users. In this talk Adeyinka introduces the audience to the concept of accessibility testing.

00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:12,530
my name is adilyn ha I think Poirot I

00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:17,220
mean I journal and I work with break off

00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:19,800
as a software engineer and I won't talk

00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,990
about accessibility testing making

00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:26,699
information and software available to

00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:29,340
all and sundry ok so before I start I

00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:30,840
would say I'm deaf I'm a deaf person so

00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:34,050
if you're good you can be having

00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:37,800
questions after the talk it's probably

00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:40,770
good idea to rice it is needed notes and

00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:45,390
passes for what I thought it talk okay

00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:47,340
so now Isis please listen

00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:52,039
now if I talk about that I want to give

00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:55,410
you a brief history story of my life and

00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:56,370
let me take you back in time to 2015 in

00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:59,430
November 2010

00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:01,469
I lost my earring sudden deafness the

00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:05,939
police are into this so I lost it

00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:09,150
suddenly and them it might the like so

00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:12,210
the V beats time for me was like this

00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:14,760
huge time point for me it's literally

00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:16,409
splits my life institute like I have

00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:20,040
this super of my life time a bit

00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:21,540
differently so the first pass was this -

00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,000
I have two hours of my life that you

00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,770
remember differently like the first

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,170
stuff of course been the plot which time

00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:34,710
before the deafness and then ii have

00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:36,990
been then a person now the first during

00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:40,710
the first half of my life when i quit

00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:43,470
yeah and everything it was I didn't and

00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:45,119
I didn't like most people that you know

00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,979
to access information without thinking

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,899
about it you know I also watched video

00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:52,140
if I was watch video it's the easiest

00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:54,570
and or just plain fun you watch if I

00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:56,490
want to watch TV or listen to music or

00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:59,640
whatever shows is just saying the world

00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:02,009
but then on the other hand like after

00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:05,729
deafness so the old friends to me like a

00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:09,330
rude awakening and I realized that

00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:11,099
subsea accessibility was this ad easy on

00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,230
the other hand you know if you can't

00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:16,120
hear

00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:22,040
blind or you know yet support it so this

00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:26,680
kind of work anyway so it might be

00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:29,599
curious about accessibility I do and

00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,160
I've learned about its I thought was

00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:33,590
important to share because accessibility

00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:38,500
is and is not an exception align them

00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:41,690
yet you know so that's why I'm here and

00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:43,099
so let me just get to it now so on a

00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:44,870
star accessibility testing you first

00:02:43,099 --> 00:02:49,670
have to understand what I see split

00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:51,290
itself means so accessibility means okay

00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:55,400
let me not say a lot of people believe

00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:57,799
that accessibility means if you are deaf

00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,750
you should be able to watch a video with

00:02:57,799 --> 00:03:00,319
subtitles or captions and then if you

00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,750
are blind

00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:05,209
you should be able to use a search and

00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:09,530
let's use the websites with a square

00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:11,989
either no but that's correct of course

00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:17,840
but it's quite narrow than our

00:03:11,989 --> 00:03:20,989
definition yeah so I think the correct

00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:26,780
definition would be that accessibility

00:03:20,989 --> 00:03:28,880
is just ease of I ease of use doesn't

00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:30,799
necessarily mean you're deaf or blind

00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:34,130
you can be returns you can have it can

00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:37,010
be colorblind you can it can be learning

00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:38,150
pH becomes physically impaired is you

00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:42,019
know it doesn't necessarily mean being

00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:46,180
just blind and or deaf you know so it

00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:48,260
means that people are able to use

00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:52,220
something that you create a software

00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:54,079
product I quit without frustration you

00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:56,900
know they are independent values near

00:03:54,079 --> 00:04:01,730
products and but it means that people

00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:04,190
are both disabled and a board you know

00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:06,850
can use your products in the same

00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:13,400
amounts of time with similar efforts

00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:14,810
without getting frustrated or stress is

00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:18,260
just basically ease of use those

00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:20,419
variants is simple as that so now that

00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:22,669
we know what accessibility means we

00:04:20,419 --> 00:04:25,900
don't talk about what accessibility

00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:25,900
testing assortments

00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:35,730
yeah I sniff Destin the type of software

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:40,680
testing that justice versus ability

00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:43,290
that's it it checks that software is

00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:47,520
accessible that follows us with the

00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:50,550
guidelines and there's a great length

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:53,910
for accessibility by World Wide Web

00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:55,830
Consortium does what web content

00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:58,440
accessibility guide that you can use to

00:04:55,830 --> 00:05:00,450
measure if you're you know websites ISM

00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:12,260
accessible products intercept accessible

00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:15,870
so for first years I won't talk about I

00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:18,480
want to talk about the kind of

00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:22,190
disabilities to supports when you're

00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:26,450
trying to make your product accessible

00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:28,770
so we have visual impairments visual

00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:30,870
impairment impairments is not for just

00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:34,410
with our blind it's for it's also for a

00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:36,750
half prohibition you know if you use

00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:38,670
glasses you might be able to see quite

00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:40,260
clearly but something of my opponent

00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:42,300
temporarily you might just lose your

00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:45,210
glasses and not be able to see in that

00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:47,070
moment you a temporary disabled so we

00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:49,380
have permanence and disability and

00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:51,450
temporary simplicity so it's not just

00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:54,480
for permanent disabilities you can find

00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:56,250
something somewhere by yes you can't

00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:58,260
after something that's disabilities

00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:01,830
doesn't means doesn't necessarily mean

00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:04,140
you something is missing on your body or

00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:06,720
anything like that so then we have

00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:09,060
physical impairments then this is for

00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:12,750
food can really use keyboard or mouse

00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:17,190
well then cognitive impairment in

00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:21,980
impairments means that I'm okay this is

00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:21,980
for people who can't who find open a

00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:28,380
graceful food will find it adds to

00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:30,830
Solenn Newtons who find that to

00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:33,419
understand or remember what poor memory

00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:34,860
example of someone with cognitive

00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:37,620
impairments will be someone with a

00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:40,680
Leamas disease you know

00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:42,960
then we have literacy so this is for no

00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,740
older people will I just get something

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,860
get used to

00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:49,440
I'm software and them no technology in

00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:52,740
any sense so they are disabled in that

00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:56,700
aspects they find it odd to use some

00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:59,210
software and that's why a lot of em

00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:01,440
companies I'm add unburden to your sides

00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:03,900
so let's try see also involves see I

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,400
knew that so am a software it means you

00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:08,490
don't you don't have stand what the

00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:11,940
surface all about you know so enough of

00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:13,020
video games Adam I'm training a demo

00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:15,300
okay

00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:16,860
like a sort of an introduction to new

00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,810
users it's lots of fun most

00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:21,990
accessibility for food don't understand

00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:24,570
how to use your products so then we have

00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:27,000
hearing impairments which is for people

00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:32,280
like me what deaf and then people who

00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:37,200
have hearing loss and yeah who find it @

00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:41,760
Hsu understand certain these reactants

00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:43,950
in loud places so if you are able body

00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:46,590
language accounts you can yell like this

00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:48,870
and um the loud environments and you

00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:51,180
tried you tried to watch the video

00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:56,210
online I can't yet yeah charlie disabled

00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:58,770
in that way other points in time so um

00:07:56,210 --> 00:08:01,680
then we have users with poor

00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:03,390
communications infrastructure well as an

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,840
example of this is people with point in

00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:08,490
tennis or between low bandwidth areas so

00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:11,430
complicated to this school is like

00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:13,110
Google cater to this with M offline

00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:17,700
accessibility that's progressive web

00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:21,570
apps so I tell people with some low

00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:26,190
interim body Internet's so access things

00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:30,350
quite faster than usual then use always

00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:33,089
users with old system these are people

00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:36,330
who use probably using another version

00:08:33,089 --> 00:08:39,209
of your software so you wanna keep

00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:41,640
supporting them about SharePoint there

00:08:39,209 --> 00:08:47,089
we have internet store app work in that

00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:47,089
category too then

00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:56,279
users who have wished addresses I think

00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:58,140
it applies to I hope you can help some

00:08:56,279 --> 00:09:00,170
of your users as well in countries like

00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:03,839
North Korea well strict laws or

00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:05,880
countries like China you know if you can

00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:09,959
find them like a walk around for them to

00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:11,670
use your products that's underway then

00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:13,770
we have learning impairments this is for

00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:16,550
people with a form of learning

00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:20,279
disabilities like dyslexia or ethnicity

00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:22,649
you know so companies should find a way

00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:24,089
to accommodate all of these disabilities

00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:26,520
when they should think about them

00:09:24,089 --> 00:09:28,890
whenever you are trying to to create

00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:38,190
software or make this was very

00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:41,459
accessible so I want to share why I see

00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:43,200
split testing is important what's big

00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:45,360
deal with business why do we have so you

00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,510
know why do we have to change our

00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:51,000
software from the weights well the foot

00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:53,300
so catalyst people know the 11 that many

00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,300
huh

00:09:53,480 --> 00:10:02,730
well number one let's let me talk to

00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:07,160
self-interest it's increased market

00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:10,079
share of your company if you tried to

00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:13,380
it's a Christian your others the

00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:16,020
disability of use products it much more

00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:17,700
popular among users it's pushing a step

00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:19,829
ahead of your competitors you know

00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:21,390
because ever often watch your friend so

00:10:19,829 --> 00:10:23,940
you love us yellow a bi users are going

00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:24,510
to love you because you're giving them

00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:27,890
what they need

00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:30,480
I mean I love apps like Netflix and

00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:32,010
FedEx and them doesn't say you got to

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,770
make my life easy I love them because

00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:36,690
when I'm there when I use the up a lot I

00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:38,490
don't know but I'm deaf you know gives

00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:42,570
me joy cellphones don't take my money

00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:46,640
you know so the nationalization of

00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:48,870
products yeah so this is under form of

00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:51,360
this is under ways are services

00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:55,020
departments so I think

00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:58,190
trustless the absolutely the product its

00:10:55,020 --> 00:11:00,690
next product

00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:03,480
however its products DiMaggio native

00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:04,980
language accessible to you so you can

00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:08,580
just you know click on it and translates

00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:09,600
and gives you what you want so a lot of

00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:11,100
companies are doing this Ella book

00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:16,500
authors I haven't doing this to make

00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:19,710
their products I have if Y damage to

00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:21,120
people outside of their country it

00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:26,280
brings in more revenue you know a few

00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:30,330
people use your products and then we

00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:37,140
have four countries of Isis Beauty laws

00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:40,290
of course or like make like did like my

00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:45,030
yes yes awesome awesome American stably

00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:49,140
she acts I think yeah so so if you are

00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:52,560
in countries they have those laws yeah

00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:55,140
being accessible helps you to abide by

00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,640
those laws you know you don't be open to

00:11:55,140 --> 00:12:00,870
fines on all of us

00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:04,920
then you bill to avoid lawsuits I'm in

00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:07,740
the past in the past of fortune 500

00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:10,470
companies have been live in sued by a

00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:12,570
special of deaf people blind for you

00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:14,700
know because they don't Kate that's if

00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:18,090
you think it of them so they've been

00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:19,410
stood out of money even so your company

00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:21,840
or you put that's kind of with this in

00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:25,020
the future if you prepare for it now to

00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:26,700
be accessible then nothing is there

00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:29,190
accessibility apps

00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:33,420
ok City for us we see helps people with

00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:35,580
low bandwidth so I think what does

00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:37,980
temper was with very very bad internet

00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:41,910
and I know this is that whenever all my

00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:44,940
other tabs are given me the chrome game

00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:48,589
they but low internets and bad interests

00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:51,320
I am NOT for this I don't understand me

00:12:48,589 --> 00:12:53,570
whenever all my other tabs are giving me

00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:56,460
poor network connectivity

00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:59,220
Google Sites does YouTube keeps playing

00:12:56,460 --> 00:13:04,740
I don't love this let's just keep

00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:07,080
working and outs keeps working

00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:09,530
I don't know that these but whatever

00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:18,170
dealership deemed the

00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:19,490
to people the oven no internet so if you

00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:23,270
you can also get that so people would

00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:25,700
buy the Internet's with progressive web

00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:28,780
apps you can make some parts of your

00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:32,720
site's you know go offline walk offline

00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:35,660
you know and then there's this then okay

00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,610
a bunch of texts on sites so in places

00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:41,360
like that she yell it's likely that

00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:44,120
videos and the images are going to Lord

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,800
so Kristin alternative text helps them

00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:49,840
to at least get a cisternae information

00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:53,030
if they can't load the video or the

00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:55,940
images in person it will in places with

00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:57,740
bad Internet's so how's the bunk some

00:13:55,940 --> 00:14:01,400
myths about accessibility that you might

00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:03,710
have ed okay a lot of people thing is

00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:10,190
ridiculously expensive of course yeah I

00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:16,270
spend spend money but but a lot of that

00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:19,130
can be avoided if you if you if you add

00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:24,110
the accessibility during the beginning

00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:26,030
of product design you know if you know

00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:27,230
if you add it towards the later stage of

00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:29,420
your products it's saying but that

00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:34,520
design is going to be my expensive

00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:36,560
really so so like I said for

00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:39,830
accessibility is not just for blind and

00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:41,570
deaf people before the after book using

00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:46,190
you it's for all kinds of people died

00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:48,110
after bogeys in your app then animates

00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:50,570
is that people think you have to just

00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:55,420
you know changes all your possible site

00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:58,640
that's once okay that's not sure you can

00:14:55,420 --> 00:15:00,589
you can take a stage step by step it

00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:04,910
does do everything that's once and then

00:15:00,589 --> 00:15:07,370
I'm nothing is then your people think

00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:09,230
that if you're your site's accessibility

00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:11,960
you guys make it out yeah yeah guys make

00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:13,910
it boring it's miss make it look boring

00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:15,530
but as much true then you can you find

00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:18,020
your cells can be fun and attractive and

00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:20,380
also accessible they are not mutually

00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:20,380
exclusive

00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:28,600
um I'm just say okay I said this

00:15:26,709 --> 00:15:31,839
accessibility she starts at the

00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:34,540
beginning of the product design then you

00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:36,010
should do accessibility testing everyone

00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:38,170
in a company should be involved in the

00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:41,399
process of accessibility testing by

00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:41,399
buying this specific

00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:51,730
if i try to be specific developers

00:15:58,779 --> 00:16:05,660
okay developers developers should take

00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:07,160
pass and a split testing designers your

00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:09,080
accessibility engineers Quality

00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,670
Assurance people the code reviewers

00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:14,180
before we are repeating your coach bill

00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:17,019
no point out flaws in the V process for

00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:20,089
us as a beautiful us and then I'm

00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:23,510
confused like I'm a double they have a

00:16:20,089 --> 00:16:26,360
old depart our department and I look at

00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:27,589
that explicitly complete like Netflix is

00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:31,720
thy old apartment there has to be

00:16:27,589 --> 00:16:35,930
engineers but if you only if yes you

00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:39,529
okay let me just run this up so testing

00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:43,000
facility involves two stages you have

00:16:39,529 --> 00:16:46,690
automated testing and manual testing so

00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:49,519
automated as of course about using

00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:52,459
scripts so automatic process of testing

00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:54,980
to find flaws in your code wimon our

00:16:52,459 --> 00:16:58,370
testing is no manually check in even

00:16:54,980 --> 00:17:00,170
their captions manually check in if they

00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:02,480
are your square that works squared I

00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:04,730
work for blind people you know why I

00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,949
check in that you can use the keyboard

00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:10,400
so assess office of your sites as

00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:12,439
opposed to Mouse the sunny aspects of

00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,919
m'naghten so let me just round up and

00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:17,360
say two days ago I thought somebody

00:17:14,919 --> 00:17:20,059
break back I told him that I read are

00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:23,900
not too cool about so well they actually

00:17:20,059 --> 00:17:30,530
drove his kind sweet Lake because why

00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:33,770
using the location up now anyway is I

00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:35,450
think it may be you got me thinking I

00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:37,910
mean the survives live in the audience

00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:40,580
and so it got me thinking the people

00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:42,740
people really take what we do seriously

00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:45,380
what we do it matters a lot you know

00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:47,390
what we creates matters less food you

00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:49,640
can make a mess on Wednesday with what

00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:51,490
you are present you know so that's what

00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:54,710
you should think about whenever you are

00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:56,360
no working on creating content or crazy

00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:58,640
stuff you should always err on the side

00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:01,070
of the path the mixture is app uses the

00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:03,710
P so now as busy testing is just one of

00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:05,230
those things that'll make him user fee

00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:10,429
and she always clean up a keep in mind

00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:12,520
whenever you're creating stuff so thank

00:18:10,429 --> 00:18:12,520
you

00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:21,470
please I know some of you have got

00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:23,750
questions already as requested by an

00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:25,520
Inca please write them down or a piece

00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:29,210
of paper and we'll bring them to the

00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:31,399
front so that she is able to read them

00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:32,720
so if you've got a question write it

00:18:31,399 --> 00:18:34,669
down now please wave your hands so that

00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,240
I can see it I'm asking I have a

00:18:34,669 --> 00:18:40,700
question here for her to start us off

00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:44,049
how hard is it to persuade companies the

00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:46,399
accommodating disabilities is important

00:18:44,049 --> 00:18:49,279
how can this be done especially in

00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:55,940
Africa and do you have any success

00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:57,440
stories of doing this this is my first

00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:58,640
time out of Nigeria so I don't know

00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:04,789
about Africa but I can tell you about

00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:06,830
Nigeria I've never tried to you know

00:19:04,789 --> 00:19:09,649
communicate with any government agency

00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:12,710
will get in accessibility but of

00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:15,230
everything and anime also my cable

00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:17,240
provider go TV I don't have anybody

00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:19,279
knows good to be here so the abscissas

00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:21,740
channels and I'm a label to watch two

00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:24,380
channels because you have that you want

00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:25,669
subtitle one of them is Nickelodeon

00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:30,440
theorize a Bollywood Channel

00:19:25,669 --> 00:19:33,740
I mean I son got me oh and then give me

00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:35,390
one day anyway play it sad it's very

00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:36,370
very hard because I don't even quite

00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:39,020
there yet

00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:41,720
ya know when I have quite days but I

00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:44,330
think the best way is you know set up a

00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:46,960
sort of Union that can you know present

00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:48,380
a united front to them and talk to them

00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,240
regarding them

00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:56,529
I regard to the Masters ability in

00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:58,940
general this is a question from Daniel

00:19:56,529 --> 00:20:03,049
what is an ascent egde of people who

00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:05,809
have a disability so by not being good

00:20:03,049 --> 00:20:08,270
for disabilities how much business would

00:20:05,809 --> 00:20:11,840
we lose okay it doesn't what you mean by

00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:13,429
you took my burger take my boat's okay

00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,470
of course when I read I think it's not

00:20:13,429 --> 00:20:15,890
change for cents but I don't think

00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:17,720
that's awkward

00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:22,100
I'm not sure I always have to get back

00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:23,929
to you on that so but so by not being

00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,480
good for instability we lose that much

00:20:23,929 --> 00:20:30,000
business

00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:32,190
yes you do it because it was are you

00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,480
suppose I just love you and you can keep

00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:35,100
coming back what shoe are given them

00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:39,720
what others are given them and it's good

00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:42,360
come on here's another question are

00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:44,400
there any automated tools that can be

00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:48,180
used for some types of accessibility

00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:51,240
testing if so how do we add these tools

00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:56,100

00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:58,830
of online tools one of them is wave then

00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:01,280
we have yeah you can just wave I think

00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:06,180
for wave you can you can upload your

00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:07,500
HTML could face you automatically give

00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:11,220

00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:16,170
then there's under one a checker then we

00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:21,570
have CAW these are just these are online

00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:25,320
tools that you can use to get a report

00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:28,880
of your sites the corner sites and give

00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,880
you a feedback on our system your sites

00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:44,610
thank you

00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:46,110
here's a question from Jeff in African

00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:47,880
countries when you are starting a

00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:50,250
project you are just three or four

00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:52,380
people are there tools that can help

00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:54,860
small teams to go fast with

00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:58,290
accessibility testing that's like I said

00:21:54,860 --> 00:22:01,170
let's start elasticity beyond the lab

00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:02,850
project at first you can start with

00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:06,200
since I'm still as small as an

00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:10,950
alternative text on sites you know

00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:13,440
adding captions to your videos I mean

00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:16,650
Google YouTube helps know sometimes we

00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:19,950
upload it we just YouTube it's very nice

00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:23,730
it's generate some automatic captioning

00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:27,530
for you then it's not very hard to make

00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:29,760
sure your websites queried accessible

00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:31,650
you know daddy

00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,270
yeah HTML attributes you can use for

00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:36,040
that to add the text you want the

00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:41,260
cronuts read out that was the cost money

00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:44,350
you know then you can make your you can

00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:46,000
make sure that for every Mouse we have

00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:47,500
ever use of the mouse on the sides that

00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,300
is a keyboard equivalents but that's

00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:51,640
that's what we for that have trouble

00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:53,890
using mouse and they I was you the

00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:56,500
special keyboard but you know doesn't

00:22:53,890 --> 00:23:08,200
there's so many ways you can get sizable

00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:12,100
without spending a little money yet any

00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:16,240
big distribution UX and UI yes actually

00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:19,900
is it subsets of um user experience okay

00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:23,230
Larry depression upload okay any big

00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:26,650
differences between you your X /ui

00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:29,710
and accessibility as abilities and

00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:32,770
subsets of user experience or UI

00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:36,430
interface it's all those bits making

00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:40,780
something easy to use so it's a part of

00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:47,140
it there's no difference at all it is UX

00:23:40,780 --> 00:24:01,130
and UI thank you very much
