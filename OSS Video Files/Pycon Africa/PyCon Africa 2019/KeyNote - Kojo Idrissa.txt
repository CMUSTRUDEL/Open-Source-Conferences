here I was happy to be invited for the

00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,420
first Python Africa this is my first

00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:49,399
time in Africa and as an African

00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:52,819
American that is something that is

00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:54,860
important to many of us so the talk

00:01:52,819 --> 00:01:58,270
coach of Python and you I was sort of

00:01:54,860 --> 00:02:00,799
asked to talk about my path and how I've

00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:03,649
come to where I am now and the things

00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:07,039
that I do in the Python community so Who

00:02:03,649 --> 00:02:11,510
am I who is Kojo sort of the the TLDR

00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:14,540
version is I'm someone who can employ

00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:16,280
dld are too long did not read it's a an

00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:17,660
abbreviation we use I know in North

00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,450
America maybe in other parts of the

00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:21,890
world but I am someone who I'm a Python

00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:24,260
developer now but I started with a

00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:27,470
different career I started as an

00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:29,500
accountant so I got a bachelor's degree

00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:31,670
in accounting worked as an accountant

00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:33,230
decided I wanted to spend time teaching

00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:36,200
and so I spent two years working on a

00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:37,130
PhD and realized that a PhD in the

00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,079
counting is nonsense

00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:43,070
don't ever do that if the option comes

00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:46,370
up so don't do that went back and

00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:49,250
finished an MBA got my MBA promptly ran

00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:50,810
off to China to teach in China teach

00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:53,329
accounting in China for two years

00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:56,269
accounting in Mis they came back to the

00:02:53,329 --> 00:02:58,670
u.s. from China and worked more than

00:02:56,269 --> 00:03:00,200
accountant but in that entire time I had

00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:03,470
had an interest in computers my entire

00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:05,269
life and in programming and after I came

00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:07,190
back from China decided to become more

00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:08,989
serious about learning enough

00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:12,859
programming to make a career switch so

00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:14,540
then I went through that process started

00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:15,889
speaking at conferences and presenting

00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:18,590
at conferences before I was a developer

00:03:15,889 --> 00:03:22,430
got a development job and then became an

00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:24,800
organizer for Django con us which is the

00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:28,130
North American conference for Django

00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,000
and through that ended up to creating

00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:30,830
and taking on this North American

00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,850
ambassador role and speaking of

00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:34,130
different conferences and talking to

00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:36,730
people about Django con us coming to

00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:38,900
their City so that's sort of my history

00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:40,370
professional history in a nutshell as

00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,290
far as some of my personal interests I'm

00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:44,110
into all sorts of unusual stuff that one

00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:46,850
might not expect different this kpop

00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:50,540
Korean pop music is that popular here in

00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:53,180
Africa yes no yes because some people

00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:56,000
like yes but so kpop is a thing I'm into

00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:57,740
tiny houses also a thing that I'm

00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,210
interested in my friends find this

00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:01,640
hilarious that I'm generally the biggest

00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:03,860
person that they know I'm a hundred

00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:05,300
ninety five centimeters tall and you but

00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:06,800
they're like wait why is Kojo the big

00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:09,650
person into tiny houses what was that

00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:12,110
all about I think of the side effect of

00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:14,090
having lived in Asia and then also the

00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:15,410
video game overwatch is something that

00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:17,630
I'm a fan of so the shirt that I'm

00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:18,830
wearing actually is a jersey from the

00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:20,209
overwatch league it's a competitive

00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:22,670
eSports league where they play overwatch

00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:24,740
this is actually the Jersey for the

00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:27,050
Washington Justice which is my hometown

00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:29,450
team I live in Houston Texas but I'm

00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:30,560
originally from Washington DC and the

00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:31,610
the Jersey has a little more

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,620
significance to come up later in the

00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:36,040
talk so we'll see that later so that's

00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:39,350
me what do I do

00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:41,000
again jaemin u.s. organizer and I do

00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:43,790
some I'm working on doing some dev rel

00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,930
stuff for Django con us I am as pointed

00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:48,110
out before the Deaf in the North

00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:49,190
American ambassador and so as I've

00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:51,140
traveled around the North American

00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:54,919
continent talking to people about Django

00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:56,870
con I refer to it as noir MGT the North

00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:58,760
American Grand Tour and so you might see

00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:01,640
that hashtag on Twitter sometimes it's

00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:07,370
something that I use is that travel I'm

00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:09,050
getting feedback so I use that in again

00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:10,790
that role has sort of morphed the

00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:12,380
original goal was for me to be the North

00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:14,419
American and the Ambassador from

00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:16,340
definite to North America it has now

00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:18,320
sort of changed because clearly I am

00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:20,930
this is not North America this is Africa

00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,910
I spoke last year at PyCon Australia

00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:24,530
also map North America so I seem to

00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:26,770
become the North American ambassador to

00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:29,240
the rest of the world so that's a thing

00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:31,340
what I try to focus on it was as far as

00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,229
my community activity is trying to add

00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,650
new contributors to the Python and

00:05:33,229 --> 00:05:35,990
Django

00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:38,300
munities so i feel i can sort of do the

00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:40,669
most do the most good and make the most

00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:42,620
contribution and as a result of that I

00:05:40,669 --> 00:05:44,900
was awarded the 2018 Malcolm tread Nick

00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:47,150
Memorial Prize by the Django Software

00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:49,580
Foundation it's something that I'm

00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:51,470
fairly proud of I believe I am the

00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:57,860
second African to win that award I

00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:59,780
should bellow so I won the award in 2018

00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:01,940
but I should bellow from Nigeria who has

00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:06,260
been active in many many Python things

00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:08,690
won the same award in 2016 so I am happy

00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:11,419
to be in that company all right so now

00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:13,789
let's move on to one of the big

00:06:11,419 --> 00:06:16,639
questions that I get really all the time

00:06:13,789 --> 00:06:21,860
in America and has happened a lot since

00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:25,070
I got here to Ghana people see me and my

00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:27,169
name like coach oh yeah you're a coach a

00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:28,400
B it's like we see this name we

00:06:27,169 --> 00:06:30,680
recognize this name it's one of our

00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,680
names but you don't you don't look like

00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:36,400
a coach a what's what's going on your or

00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:40,010
is it Cujo a Quadro or what have you so

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:42,139
this causes a lot of confusion in North

00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:44,260
America if there's confusion because no

00:06:42,139 --> 00:06:47,090
one has heard of kocho for the most part

00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:48,919
here there's confusion because everyone

00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:51,320
is history of kocho even knows the coach

00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:53,240
Joe but I don't seem to match and so

00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,800
there's almost a confusion I'd like to

00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:58,490
think of myself as the North American

00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,990
coach Joe but the reality is I'm not the

00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:01,789
North American I'm aiming with American

00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:04,280
coach Joe I am actually I have this name

00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:05,900
because I am named for the person I

00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:09,740
considered to be the North American Kojo

00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:11,270
and so that person the the the most

00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:13,130
common spelling of their name is is this

00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:14,659
spelling so if you look that person up

00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:18,430
on Wikipedia that's what you'll find

00:07:14,659 --> 00:07:22,789
and so this crew this coach Joe /qu Joe

00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:26,240
is a person who is believed to be of a

00:07:22,789 --> 00:07:29,000
con descent who is born free in Jamaica

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:32,419
to a group of formerly enslaved

00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,520
Jamaicans that rebelled and he led a

00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:36,009
rebellion

00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,990
those who were called the Maroons he led

00:07:36,009 --> 00:07:42,580
a rebellion of those people against the

00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:43,930
British and so in 1739 the British were

00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:46,389
forced to sign a non-aggression pact

00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:49,090
with him because they couldn't take him

00:07:46,389 --> 00:07:51,400
over so as the gonna ends and many

00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:52,900
others you know code rose anaconda name

00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:55,360
for a people who were born on Monday I

00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:59,050
was born on Sunday so I should be crazy

00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,550
but this card was born on Monday but his

00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:02,560
name in North America took on the

00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:04,569
meaning of uncomfortable because the

00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,159
British couldn't conquer him and so I

00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:09,449
think it's interesting sort of for

00:08:06,159 --> 00:08:13,840
myself and in a group of ghanians that

00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:16,330
in 1739 in let me read this quote in

00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,069
1739 Khodro reached an agreement with

00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,599
the British that recognized the Leawood

00:08:18,069 --> 00:08:23,050
Maroons as an independent nation

00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:24,789
so in 1739 the real North American Kojo

00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:27,310
achieved independence with the British

00:08:24,789 --> 00:08:28,900
this was about 40 years before my

00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:30,520
country the United States achieved

00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:32,560
independence of the British and about

00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:35,140
220 years before Ghana achieved

00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,610
independence of the British so the real

00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:39,669
Kojo making things happen

00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:42,010
it's in 1739 I am named for that coach

00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:44,410
Joe so I am I'm the the lesser coach out

00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:48,640
of North America but it's a good name

00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:50,770
nonetheless so how and why Python is as

00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:54,040
I said I changed careers parks they do

00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:55,750
do a personal interest I had an interest

00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:58,089
in building things and making new things

00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:59,440
and also in looking forward in my

00:08:58,089 --> 00:09:01,149
accounting career a lot of the energy

00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,070
was put into looking back looking at

00:09:01,149 --> 00:09:05,110
what had happened in the past and in

00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:06,760
sort of recording results of things that

00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:08,140
had already happened I was born shooting

00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:10,360
forward and building new things and

00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:13,000
being able to plan for the future but I

00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,380
also made the career change because I

00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,200
thought it would give me prospect for a

00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:20,500
better life better income potential as a

00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,930
programmer more location flexibility

00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:24,940
it's much more common to be able to work

00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:27,010
remotely as a software developer than it

00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:30,010
is as an accountant things of that

00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:32,350
nature and so this idea of a better life

00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:34,300
how or why is that important in my case

00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:37,899
it's important to me because this is

00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:40,180
what what my parents wanted and I've got

00:09:37,899 --> 00:09:42,100
parents here in quotations because I'm

00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:43,540
talking about not my biological parents

00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:47,250
but my actual parents the people who

00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:49,140
raised me so my my normal pants bye bye

00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:50,850
parents got divorced when I was 2 and so

00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:52,560
I was raised by my mother and her mother

00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:53,730
and my grandmother and so those are my

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,690
parents those are the people who raised

00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:59,010
me if you've had interactions with me at

00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:01,530
the time that I've been here or if you

00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:03,150
have heard things about me you're seeing

00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:05,400
things about me and they have been

00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:07,290
positive things that's my mother and my

00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:09,570
grandmother so all of the good things

00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:11,910
about me come from them if you've seen

00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:14,190
me and things have gone wrong that's me

00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:15,810
that's culture that's the that's you and

00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:18,600
not even like fancy North American coach

00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:20,400
that's the lesser North American Kojo so

00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,990
but all the good things about me come

00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,040
from my mother my grandmother those are

00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:24,650
the people who raised me that's where

00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,450
all my powers and abilities come from

00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:30,060
but one of the key things about my

00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:32,100
family is that my grandmother was born

00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:33,540
in a small town of South Carolina she

00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:36,660
didn't get a chance to go to high school

00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:38,700
and so for her education was always very

00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:40,050
important and so one of her biggest

00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,360
points of pride and that's one of my

00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:43,620
biggest points of pride is that not only

00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,960
did all of her children go to high

00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:47,820
school not only not only did all of her

00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:49,560
children finish high school but they all

00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:51,960
did some sort of formal education after

00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,550
high school and so in my family this is

00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:55,080
an important thing it was the point for

00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:56,970
my grandmother it's important in the

00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:59,790
generation before me it's an important

00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:03,180
in my generation as well so my mother

00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:04,740
went on to get a bachelor's degree and

00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:09,060
also get a master's degree in education

00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:10,589
and worked as a teacher so the idea of

00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:12,690
education was always very important in

00:11:10,589 --> 00:11:15,150
our family I ended up starting high

00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:17,130
school at what we called an engineering

00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:18,960
magnet program so something focused on

00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:20,960
what nowadays would be called stem

00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:23,250
science technology engineering and math

00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:27,060
so I started high school there when I

00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:29,400
was 14 doing that unfortunately just

00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:31,530
about the same time my mother was

00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:34,940
diagnosed with cancer so by the time I

00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:38,010
was fifteen and a half she was gone and

00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:39,360
so at this point this is sort of in that

00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:41,220
time those first two years of high

00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,380
school is sort of when my grandmother

00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:44,880
you know sort of becomes my other parent

00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,930
she I mean she's always been she was the

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,200
queen of our family she was our

00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:51,810
matriarch but I spent my first two years

00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,310
of high school either living with her

00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:54,810
because my mother's in the hospital in

00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:57,270
and out of the hospital or living by

00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:58,670
myself for probably most of my second

00:11:57,270 --> 00:12:01,529
year of high school

00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:04,380
my father and I I ended up living with

00:12:01,529 --> 00:12:07,230
him later in high school just because of

00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:10,680
odd circumstances but he wasn't really

00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:12,899
the person that raised me and so my

00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:16,740
mother's gone I go on to college I major

00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:19,490
in business and but still there's this

00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:21,600
idea of wanting to have a better life in

00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:23,970
winning each generation to do better

00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,410
than the one who did before it and one

00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:27,899
of the reasons that was so important to

00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:30,269
my grandmother was because of her

00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:33,300
experiences as an African person in

00:12:30,269 --> 00:12:34,560
America and so for that we need to talk

00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:38,399
about the idea of like home and what

00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:40,410
this home mean so here we have a couple

00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,760
of images on the right we see the

00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:45,630
outline of the state of Texas which is

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:48,180
where I live now and it's still sort of

00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:49,740
funny to me if you go to Texas this

00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:51,180
shape is like everywhere it's like

00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:53,010
people in Texas are going to forget that

00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:55,139
they're from Texas and so like

00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:57,240
everything is like Texas Texas like on

00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:59,010
the troika's Texas for it in you Pepsi

00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,750
the soda is notice today's Texas tastes

00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:02,220
just like oh by the way check this did

00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,329
you know you're in Texas hi Texas how

00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:06,440
about s'more check this you read some

00:13:03,329 --> 00:13:11,430
Texas on that it's just it's everywhere

00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:12,750
so that's something I just always yeah I

00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:14,970
just see it all the time I'm used to it

00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:17,370
now on the left which you see is an

00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:19,920
outline of Washington DC the nation's

00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:23,040
capital in my hometown and so to me it's

00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:25,320
important because again going back to my

00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,269
family it's where I was born it's where

00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,380
my mother was born it's not what my

00:13:27,269 --> 00:13:29,970
grandmother's of warm but it's where she

00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:32,130
raised all of her children my grandma

00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:35,279
there at nine children eight of the nine

00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:36,990
were born in DC and the oldest my mother

00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,579
was a second oldest the oldest was not

00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:41,209
born in DC but she they moved there when

00:13:38,579 --> 00:13:44,850
she was like four or five so this is

00:13:41,209 --> 00:13:46,380
literally my ancestral home this is you

00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:48,769
know where the ancestors that I know

00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:53,519
personally this is where you know they

00:13:48,769 --> 00:13:56,310
grew up and built their lives and so if

00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,839
we take a look and this well it works

00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:59,750
out sort of well here so this is another

00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,380
that line of Washington DC in the bottom

00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,610
that gets in the bottom right corner

00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:04,680
from your perspective the bun right

00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:07,949
corner the big word there Anacostia

00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:09,750
that's Southeast Washington DC the city

00:14:07,949 --> 00:14:12,209
is divided into four quadrants northeast

00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:12,510
northwest southeast Southwest Anacostia

00:14:12,209 --> 00:14:14,190
is a

00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:16,440
neighbourhood that my family is from and

00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:20,040
so I'll be I'll go home at the end of

00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:21,780
September for just because of some

00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,130
events but that's where I'll go go to

00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:25,200
Anacostia so that's how my mother

00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:29,460
graduated from Anacostia high school so

00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:31,350
this is home I love my home I'm proud to

00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:33,630
be from my home one of the reasons I

00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:36,900
wore this Jersey is because it

00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:39,360
represents my home city and here the the

00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:40,920
logo is the shape of my hometown I'm

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,140
always pleased to see it I am off

00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:44,640
because as I think you all know home is

00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:47,280
home and there's always a special place

00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:49,770
in your heart for home at the same time

00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:52,470
as an african-american in America I

00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:54,840
can't help but be reminded that this is

00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:57,230
also home is also the capital of the

00:14:54,840 --> 00:15:00,240
country that enslaved my ancestors and

00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:02,700
as a result has created all sorts of

00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,830
negative systems for people of African

00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:06,660
descent so as much as I love my home and

00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:08,130
I love my family that's there I also

00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:09,090
recognize that my home doesn't really

00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:12,570
love me back

00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:17,460
in a lot of ways so let's talk about

00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:19,650
African people here we talk about I'll

00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:21,570
talk about the actors I'm in Honsou we

00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:22,830
are all familiar with him yes so Simon

00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:25,290
Honsou if you sort of look up

00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:26,820
information on him I did include a

00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:30,150
picture of him next to me cos that's

00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:32,340
just a bad comparison for me so he is a

00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:34,560
Beninese American because he is from

00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:36,780
Benin formerly I think it was Dom made

00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,670
when he was born but he's a beninese

00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:40,590
American because he is from that country

00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:43,440
he is from that culture he has a

00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:45,810
connection to it I am African American

00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,610
because I don't know where an Africa I'm

00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:50,040
from and this is the nature of most

00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:52,740
African Americans somewhere on the

00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:55,800
continent probably you know south of

00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:58,710
Senegal of the Gambia and probably north

00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:01,140
of Cameroon but somewhere probably West

00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:02,370
Africa and even though there's a some

00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,840
sort of genetics test that I could take

00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:05,730
that would give me some idea as to what

00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:07,500
what particular ethnic group I might

00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:09,210
have come from I still won't have a

00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,170
direct connection to that culture I

00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:12,240
wouldn't have been raised in those

00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:15,720
cultural tradition traditions so this is

00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:18,710
the nature of African American people

00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:22,230
and there's there's one reason for this

00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:23,490
and so I've been working on this talk

00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:25,190
for quite some time and as I was

00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:27,829
preparing the slides and preparing top

00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:28,970
I thought to myself culture do you

00:16:27,829 --> 00:16:30,769
really just want to go to Africa and

00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:32,990
talk about white supremacy is that

00:16:30,769 --> 00:16:34,730
really like it's it's a it's Python

00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:36,620
Africa yeah yeah I mean do you really

00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:38,000
don't talk about white supremacy and so

00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:42,069
I went back and forth on it but then

00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:47,060
some things happened I left my apartment

00:16:42,069 --> 00:16:50,779
in Houston on Saturday August 3rd at

00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:54,199
about 11:30 Houston time Houston on the

00:16:50,779 --> 00:16:55,939
east side of the state at 11:39 in El

00:16:54,199 --> 00:16:58,550
Paso Texas on the west side of the state

00:16:55,939 --> 00:17:02,449
a white supremacist went to a Walmart

00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:07,010
and shot 46 people 22 of them killed 24

00:17:02,449 --> 00:17:08,390
them injured and so you know the idea of

00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:10,339
white supremacy is like it's not just

00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:12,409
some sort of weird pie-in-the-sky thing

00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:13,699
and in the u.s. right now there's a lot

00:17:12,409 --> 00:17:15,919
of political debate some people will say

00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:17,689
that our president has fostered this

00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:20,179
sort of thing the reality is these white

00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:22,010
supremacist ideas have been in the

00:17:20,179 --> 00:17:25,120
United States since its inception and

00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:27,260
that's just the nature of my country

00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:30,860
well no matter how I feel about it

00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:32,870
that's just the reality so literally

00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:34,760
right after I leave my apartment to come

00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:36,559
to Africa for the first time a white

00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:38,419
supremacist on me he drove with he drove

00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:41,840
a thousand kilometers to do this so like

00:17:38,419 --> 00:17:43,370
driving from from my garage on just to

00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,740
shoot up people or from from Lagos to

00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:47,240
Dwolla it was like okay I hate these

00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:51,530
people that much I'm just I'm gonna

00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:52,730
drive that far to shoot people so that

00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:55,340
happens is just before I get on the

00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:59,570
plane then when I arrived in Ghana I

00:17:55,340 --> 00:18:02,450
arrived on August 4th which is the first

00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:04,580
time that the new Founders Day here is

00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:06,830
being celebrated the Founders Day here

00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:07,850
that the new fabulous day the form of

00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:10,460
the I guess the original Founders Day

00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:11,840
September 21st climbing from his

00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:14,090
birthday now there's a new Founders Day

00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:16,880
August 4th for all the founders of Ghana

00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:19,280
and now quantum Crimmins birthday is

00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,380
climbing from Memorial Day I'm watching

00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,929
the news here and the Ghanaian president

00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:25,850
is talking about how god I needs to get

00:18:23,929 --> 00:18:27,440
rid of the old arrangements you need to

00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:28,730
move forward and get rid of the old

00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,419
arrangements that have benefited the

00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:34,580
former colonial powers so just before I

00:18:32,419 --> 00:18:36,950
get on the plane to leave my country to

00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:38,930
come to Africa white supremacists attack

00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:40,760
I get off the plane

00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:42,380
in Ghana the Ghanaian president is

00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:45,350
talking about white supremacy and how

00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:46,490
they used to be overcome so I sort of

00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:48,560
felt like I needed to talk about white

00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:50,990
supremacy because it sort of bookended

00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:53,060
my trip here interesting enough this is

00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:55,220
a screenshot from Wikipedia of Founders

00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:56,480
Day in Ghana Wikipedia can't keep up

00:18:55,220 --> 00:19:00,470
with Africa so it's still showing

00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:05,870
Founders Day as September 21st but that

00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:07,040
has changed just recently so we look at

00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:09,800
African people dealing with white

00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:11,720
supremacy African people in Africa have

00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:14,690
the other white supremacy African people

00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:17,840
in America are dealing with it I'm here

00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:19,730
to speak to my cousins my cousins in

00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:22,280
Africa because this is something that we

00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:25,010
have all had to face so my ancestors

00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:27,730
were taken from Africa and taken across

00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:29,810
an ocean disconnected from our culture

00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:31,400
due to white supremacy and

00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:33,080
in my country systems of

00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:35,240
institutionalized racism have been built

00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:38,330
that continue to affect the African

00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:40,970
people in that country to this day here

00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:43,430
in Africa my cousin's ancestors weren't

00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:44,810
taken but they were colonized in their

00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:46,460
own homes that had white supremacy

00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:49,190
inflicted upon them in their own homes

00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:52,490
but white supremacy remains white

00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:54,250
supremacy and it continued to have

00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:57,230
negative effects on African people

00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:59,900
so I'm African American what does that

00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:03,620
mean what what is African American

00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:05,810
how do those things interact so as an

00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:07,160
African person as African people my

00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:09,290
ancestors who didn't have that fist of

00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:11,240
their own home culture the only culture

00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:12,770
that my ancestors had access to was the

00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:15,110
culture that they were surrounded by and

00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:17,150
that was the culture that clearly

00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:20,510
devalued them that hated them

00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:23,390
because it in slave them in support of

00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:25,310
their enslavement there's a joke by a

00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:26,960
comedian who's now since passed away

00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:29,150
named George Carlin a white comedian and

00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:32,270
his joke was that America was founded by

00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:34,370
slave owners who wanted freedom so you

00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:36,590
know there were people who while owning

00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:38,870
slaves felt that the king of England

00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:41,270
wasn't like being fair to them or giving

00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:44,300
them their freedom so that's it's my

00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:47,000
country yeah America he's just sort of

00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:48,560
the reality and so there's this sort of

00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,330
weird duality of being African and

00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,980
American and I've said this to some

00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:53,750
people I've been here in

00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:55,460
we tend to think that we are the center

00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:56,750
of the universe and that we invented

00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:59,540
everything and that everything started

00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:01,730
with us if you speak to a lot of

00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:04,400
african-americans we sometimes tend to

00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:06,260
think it was some of us sometimes tend

00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,940
to think that like we are literally the

00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:09,230
black people like if someone's talking

00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:11,450
about black people they must have mean

00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:12,920
us and you know it's like and that

00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:15,110
people from Africa what they're

00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:16,550
different they're Africans no there's

00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:19,100
you know we're caught african-american

00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:21,500
for a reason but there's this strange

00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:23,620
dichotomy of being African American and

00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:25,940
that we have a lot of that sort of

00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:28,070
bravado and self-confidence that comes

00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:29,540
from being American because we know

00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:30,800
that's the only culture we know so we

00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:32,960
sort of feel like we can do everything

00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:34,640
and anything but at the same time we

00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,200
have these self-destructive behaviors

00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,910
because we grow up in a culture that

00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,990
hates us and that tells us that we're

00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:42,230
not supposed to survive and they're

00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:44,900
we're not supposed to advance but the

00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:47,420
reality is you can't stop African people

00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:49,520
we just sort of keep it moving so in

00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:52,640
America specifically African Americans

00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:54,620
gave America most of us modern music in

00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:57,230
many other aspects of American culture

00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:58,520
and that American culture has sort of

00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:00,170
spread around the world but it is

00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:02,870
heavily influenced by the African people

00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:03,590
who were there some of us including WB

00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:05,810
Dubois

00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:07,370
joined with our Continental cousins here

00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:09,290
in the in the pan African movement

00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:12,080
recognizing that African people of

00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:16,340
different nations can benefit by working

00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:18,650
together in common but it's always been

00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:20,240
an uphill battle for African Americans

00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:22,550
because the only culture that we know

00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:25,490
that we really have access to is one

00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:27,680
that hates us and that devalues us so

00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:29,330
we're the citizens of the richest most

00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,620
powerful nation in the world but it's

00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:33,230
the country that doesn't really want us

00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:35,120
and doesn't really care for us so Dubois

00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:38,290
coined this term double consciousness

00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:41,150
which is this idea of being sort of

00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:42,980
African and American and sort of having

00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:44,540
these warring factions in your mind

00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:46,370
because you have all the American

00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:48,110
confidence and you you think you're on

00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:49,610
these resources but at the same time you

00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:52,340
know that the country doesn't really

00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:54,470
care for you and for my african-american

00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:55,880
sisters it is sometimes known as a

00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:57,890
triple consciousness because there is

00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:59,150
the the patriarchy that women have to

00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:01,190
deal with and so there's the

00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:02,570
institutionalized sexism that African

00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:03,760
American women have to deal with along

00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:09,890
with the

00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:12,650
so realizing the promises that America

00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:13,370
has to offer are much harder than it

00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:16,309
would seem so

00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:17,600
you're surrounded by wealth and riches

00:23:16,309 --> 00:23:19,150
it's the richest country in the world

00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,410
we're surrounded by all these resources

00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:23,330
but it's very difficult to actually make

00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:27,679
sure on those promises but it's not

00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:31,910
impossible and so what I said earlier

00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:34,610
about my ancestors my mother and my

00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:36,230
grandmother and me being the best parts

00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:39,650
and that's not hyperbole that's just the

00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:41,539
literal truth each of them one of the

00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:44,030
generation that came after them to have

00:23:41,539 --> 00:23:46,809
a better life and so despite the fact

00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:50,659
that my national culture is one that

00:23:46,809 --> 00:23:53,659
wants me to self-destruct my mother and

00:23:50,659 --> 00:23:56,150
my grandmother built the foundation that

00:23:53,659 --> 00:23:57,230
I could end my cousin's every one of my

00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:58,880
generation who sort of could move

00:23:57,230 --> 00:24:00,080
forward on so that we could have success

00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,929
so all the things that I've been able to

00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,950
do going to college getting a bachelor

00:24:02,929 --> 00:24:06,020
degree getting a graduate degree

00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:06,650
teaching in different countries blah

00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:10,100
blah blah

00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:12,890
that's all happened because my literal

00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:15,409
direct ancestors paved the way for that

00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:16,730
and not in a you often hear people talk

00:24:15,409 --> 00:24:19,250
about their ancestors in this sort of in

00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:21,289
a very I'll say in a very black panther

00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:23,000
way like a you know like your your

00:24:21,289 --> 00:24:25,280
ancestors from a thousand years ago in

00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,020
the spirits of whomever it no like my

00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:29,090
mother and my grandmother the people

00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:31,760
like literally a step and two steps

00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:33,289
behind me you know we're paving this

00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:38,120
road and pushing me and moving me

00:24:33,289 --> 00:24:40,190
forward and so in and so when I was

00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:41,870
invited here to speak one of the things

00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:43,730
that I pointed out was that I on behalf

00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:46,970
of my ancestors was very pleased to

00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:49,100
accept the invitation because that's who

00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:51,380
that's who made me that's who gave me my

00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:55,490
powers and abilities the reality however

00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:57,740
is that lots of african-americans in my

00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:59,929
generation and generations even younger

00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:02,419
than me don't have that advantage they

00:24:59,929 --> 00:25:04,940
didn't have two generations behind them

00:25:02,419 --> 00:25:06,950
who had this singular focus of your life

00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:07,880
is going to be better than mine and then

00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:09,320
you should make the life of the people

00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,700
they after you better than mine so there

00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:12,230
are lots of people that I know who in my

00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:14,980
age range and younger who don't have

00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:19,270
those two generations behind them

00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:21,250
building that support so there's good

00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:23,040
news after all the sort of doom and

00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:25,690
gloom it's not all it's not all bad news

00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:27,100
the reality is that double consciousness

00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:29,290
can often be a strength and that's

00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:31,780
something that Dubois that has noted the

00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:34,360
idea that you know African Americans can

00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:37,120
be both African and American and try to

00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:40,900
embrace the best aspects of both of

00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:44,110
these identities and I have heard in

00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:45,490
different narratives so some of you may

00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:48,010
be aware that some of you may not be

00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:49,840
there there have been at times points of

00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:52,480
contention among continental Africans

00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,740
and African Americans with regard to how

00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:57,360
we get along with each other or how we

00:25:53,740 --> 00:26:00,760
sometimes don't one narrative is that

00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:02,740
African Americans are people whose

00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:04,660
ancestors got enslaved and so we must be

00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:06,010
like the bad ones or the weaker ones or

00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:09,760
you know the ones who couldn't make it

00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:13,840
or whatever another way to look at that

00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:17,920
is that I am descended from people who

00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:20,020
survived more than 200 years of forcible

00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:23,170
enslavement and then another hundred

00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:25,930
plus years of legal legalized racial

00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:29,230
apartheid and so yes my sisters were

00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:31,630
enslaved but they survived it and my

00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:36,100
direct ancestor survived it and we're

00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:38,320
here now we're still here so and then

00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:40,750
the red the reality is that I was raised

00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:43,240
by two women who lived in much more

00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:44,590
difficult times than I did and again as

00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,910
I pointed out with the idea of triple

00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:47,410
consciousness my mother and my

00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:49,840
grandmother both women had to deal with

00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:52,510
the institutionalized sexism along with

00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:57,940
the racism and in times when it was much

00:26:52,510 --> 00:27:01,690
more difficult so that is here more good

00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:02,740
news is that I'm this is a phrase you

00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:05,260
will hear some times in American

00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:06,760
commercials you know a store is having

00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:08,530
something on sale we found something on

00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:11,410
sale and we're passing the savings on to

00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:12,940
you and so I have been through these

00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:15,430
difficult things and I'm sort of passing

00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:16,660
the savings along to you all the reality

00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:17,560
is that some of the struggles that I've

00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:19,390
gone through and some of the

00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:21,040
difficulties that I've had have given me

00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:23,140
a large amount of empathy and ability to

00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:26,500
understand the feelings of perspectives

00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:28,360
of other people and it allows me to see

00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:30,370
some of the advantages

00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:32,559
I have in the privileges that I've had

00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:33,640
in certain situations where other people

00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:37,059
might not have those privileges and

00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:38,830
advantages and so it's giving me an

00:27:37,059 --> 00:27:42,250
ability to see these things and also a

00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:44,650
desire to be helpful so now how does

00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:45,850
this all come back to Python and so I

00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:47,500
know some folks might have been a little

00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:48,910
bit worried I said oh hold on Kojak

00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:51,820
this is not like the pan-african

00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:53,679
Revolution conference this is you know

00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:54,640
we we came to learn about computer stuff

00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:55,840
Gojo so

00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,700
although actually the pan-african

00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,830
revolution conference might be happening

00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:03,250
down the road i'll talk about that in a

00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:05,110
little bit but the empathy that I have

00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:06,640
has driven me to do many of the things

00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:08,679
that I do in the Python the Django

00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,150
communities to make an effort to help

00:28:08,679 --> 00:28:12,520
people who have been overlooked or

00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:14,140
underestimated so the work that I do to

00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:15,640
try to help bring new contributors in

00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:18,700
the community is based around been

00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:20,380
empathy a Django con us I created the

00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:22,780
orientation session that we have to help

00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:23,890
people get acclimated and get

00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:25,360
comfortable when they first arrive at

00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:25,870
the conference that comes from that

00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,820
empathy

00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:31,270
I am the lightning talk chair for Django

00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:32,290
con us I do that because I feel that if

00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:33,640
people are trying to get started

00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:34,929
speaking a lightning talk is a great way

00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:37,960
to do that so I try to create an

00:28:34,929 --> 00:28:39,190
environment that fosters that I'm also

00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:41,260
the Sprint XI other developers first

00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:43,000
chair for django con us and I've taken

00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:44,380
that on because I feel that if people

00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,049
are trying to get started and making

00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:48,850
contributions to open-source I want to

00:28:47,049 --> 00:28:51,070
try to create the best environment for

00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:54,400
that so that people can can get started

00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:55,840
on that in the best way and I also took

00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,160
on the role of being the definite

00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:59,980
American bachelor I created the role and

00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:01,600
took it on because Django con us and a

00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:04,450
lot of software development can be very

00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:06,580
us centric but in North America there's

00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:08,020
ten another's Mexico there's a Caribbean

00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:09,970
where there are lots of African people

00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:11,950
in the Caribbean and I wanted to make

00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:13,660
sure that those people were included in

00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:15,250
the process as well so I've spoken up I

00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:17,320
Caribbean and spoken to people there

00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:20,940
about things about you know being more

00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:25,540
involved with the Continental community

00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:28,630
alright and so again focusing on Python

00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:30,250
and how that sort of empathy and how

00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:32,830
these things can be beneficial to

00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:34,419
software developers here in Africa again

00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:36,250
when I talk about white supremacy and

00:29:34,419 --> 00:29:38,350
the impact that it has on African people

00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:39,760
it's not just African Americans it is

00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:40,360
also impacted my cousin's here on the

00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:44,050
continent

00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:46,060
and as a result many of my cousins here

00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:49,480
have similar types of empathy and

00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:50,620
ability to understand that people aren't

00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:52,510
always treated well things don't always

00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:55,230
go the way that you would expect and you

00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:57,190
have to push through these challenges so

00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:58,930
although it's not often talked about

00:29:57,190 --> 00:30:00,820
increased empathy makes for better

00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:03,490
software engineers if you're building

00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:04,990
software again as a software engineer

00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:06,940
you're probably building software for

00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:09,070
someone else to use you're not the one

00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:10,960
using it and so an ability to understand

00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:13,770
those other people your target market is

00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:16,420
very useful for a software engineer

00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:18,430
there's also the idea that global

00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:21,850
automation is a very real trend that's

00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:24,250
happening this person in El Paso who

00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:26,170
shot all those people one of his

00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:28,300
rhetoric points of rhetoric was the idea

00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:30,940
that foreigners were coming in you know

00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:32,560
taking jobs that's not a real thing in

00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:35,050
the United States what's actually

00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:38,110
happening in taking jobs or robots and

00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:39,430
automation and so he didn't go shoot

00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:40,930
like a bunch of robots so he didn't go

00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:44,230
to like an electronics store and shoot

00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:47,200
up a bunch of flat-screen TVs so but

00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:49,510
robots are in automation are some of the

00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,380
things that are reducing jobs but all

00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:56,070
that code needs to be written by

00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:59,260
somebody so cousins well it could be you

00:30:56,070 --> 00:31:00,370
but also don't forget about other other

00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:01,930
automation opportunities not just

00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:04,090
globally but also here locally what are

00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:06,190
opportunities to create software to make

00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:07,620
life better for people here on the

00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:09,900
continent here in your home countries

00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:12,250
there are lots of you know put from

00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:14,260
things that might not be as glamorous as

00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:15,870
robots you like point-of-sale systems or

00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:18,010
you know we've seen talks here about

00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:19,720
payment systems of payment processing

00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:21,490
and all sorts of other things so there

00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,870
are lots of ways that automation can

00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:25,120
benefit people here on the continent but

00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:26,470
having some empathy for the people who

00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:29,230
might benefit from these software

00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:31,710
solutions is very valuable and so you

00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:34,600
can you can write code with compassion

00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:37,720
one concern about automation is that it

00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:40,000
just puts people out of jobs that

00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:41,680
doesn't have to be the case sometimes

00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,450
automation can free people from certain

00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:46,390
jobs so they can contribute to society

00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:48,870
in other ways and so that's something to

00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:48,870
keep in mind

00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:57,050
and so why am I here uh uh my watch is

00:31:53,980 --> 00:32:00,850
my watch is not cooperating with me here

00:31:57,050 --> 00:32:03,740
we go so why am i why am I here

00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:15,620
primarily I'm here because my cousin's

00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:17,690
invited me to come home and so and so I

00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:20,090
was very pleased to be invited to become

00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:21,800
home by my cousins and and I think it's

00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:22,970
I've had the conversations of Marley

00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,650
Indian you know I was going to do

00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:27,740
whatever was necessary to make sure that

00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:29,330
I made it here to come and and speak to

00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:32,930
my cousins and hope that I had something

00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:35,450
useful to say because again I was not

00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:37,490
going to embarrass my ancestors I was

00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:39,980
not going to you know just shame my

00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:42,170
mother and my grandmother I was going to

00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:44,690
do what I could to not only be here but

00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:47,720
J to be of some benefit to my cousin's

00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:51,320
here on the continent and so just let me

00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:53,540
say this very clearly your cousins are

00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:55,610
here your North American cousins we are

00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:58,490
here we are working hard we're working

00:32:55,610 --> 00:33:01,460
to advance ourselves but we also see you

00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:05,630
and we see that you all are here at home

00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:07,760
doing the same thing and I cannot

00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:09,830
guarantee you that if you go to North

00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:11,630
America or that every African American

00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:13,580
that you meet is going to embrace you in

00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:16,550
the same fashion but there are enough of

00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:19,250
us who will such that you know we see

00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:20,710
you and we see you working and we see

00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:22,960
you hustling the way we hustle and

00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:25,790
that's the thing that we can do together

00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:29,990
so that is part of the message I bring

00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:32,750
to you from North America also this is

00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:34,700
something that and again things change

00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:36,680
just before I was making my trip work

00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:38,570
right after I made my trip this is

00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:40,700
something for lack of a better term I

00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:44,450
suppose you know God works in mysterious

00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:49,790
ways so has anyone heard of the year of

00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:55,040
return I did not know about this until I

00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:58,550
got to Ghana and so apparently literally

00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:59,360
like what is it a 15 minute drive from

00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:01,340
here

00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:03,650
was it ANC mall did anyone know what

00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:05,360
agency mall is yeah so

00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:07,130
Simo next to an sea monster I've

00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:09,950
provided a map in case you wanna go

00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:12,649
later the heritage cultural society of

00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:14,300
Africa and let me just read this court

00:34:12,649 --> 00:34:16,220
here the heritage and cultural society

00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:18,580
of Africa is having their summit from

00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:22,790
August 5th to 11th so it's happening now

00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:24,080
and I'll quote the 2019 H ACS a summit

00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:26,000
will examine the four hundred year

00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:27,640
legacy of the transatlantic slave trade

00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,230
through which Africans were enslaved

00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:32,330
with an aim to link reunite and

00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:34,130
reconciled the affected communities and

00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:35,960
share examples of innovation and

00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:39,440
creative strategies to overcome that

00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:41,270
episodes persisting negative effects the

00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,190
summit also coincides with Ghana's year

00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:44,870
of return program which symbolically

00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:46,880
much the 400th anniversary of the

00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:48,890
arrival of enslaved Africans in the US

00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:52,970
and invites the African Diaspora back

00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:59,480
home so I didn't know this was happening

00:34:52,970 --> 00:35:02,690
but it's happening downstream so so I'm

00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:06,350
here to say I am home cousins I am I am

00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:07,940
here in WA dossier for inviting me I am

00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:10,250
I'm glad to be here

00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:13,640
yeah this again when I saw this I was

00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:15,350
like oh it's like a bit early like down

00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:18,560
the street from where where we're having

00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:19,820
Python Africa so that's interesting when

00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,050
I found this story there was an

00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:23,840
interesting quote I find because there

00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:25,580
was an interesting quote so the Vice

00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:27,020
President of Liberia is one of the

00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:28,910
people so there are a number of very

00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:31,130
fancy you know dignitaries and people

00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:33,620
like that there the Vice President of

00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:36,560
Liberia had this quote Accra has become

00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:39,050
the America of sort of it's the New York

00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:41,000
or the America of Africa so the quote is

00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:42,830
Accra has become the America of most of

00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,220
us so instead of going to New York in

00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:50,030
California most people come to Accra and

00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:53,900
so right now we're having some problems

00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:55,670
in America and so I'm not sure I'm not

00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:58,190
sure how exactly do you feel about that

00:35:55,670 --> 00:36:00,710
it's like is it good that across the

00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:02,840
America of Africa or you know should my

00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:04,730
cousins aspire to better and maybe but

00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,750
but I sort of understand what she's

00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:06,980
saying so I think in general it's

00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:09,290
fathers but I just remember thinking

00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:11,660
well that's an interesting quote so a

00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:14,680
crime has become the America of Africa

00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:19,630
or the New York of Africa okay

00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:22,839
so that's that was interesting so that's

00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:24,910
all that I have prepared if you want to

00:36:22,839 --> 00:36:26,740
reach out to me and get in touch with me

00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:30,789
for those of you who use Twitter

00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:35,049
I am transition on Twitter my website is

00:36:30,789 --> 00:36:36,730
just my main calm and it I it's a blog

00:36:35,049 --> 00:36:38,289
but I don't update as much as I need to

00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:39,789
but I am working on that again your

00:36:38,289 --> 00:36:41,589
cousin's continue to hustle and the

00:36:39,789 --> 00:36:44,259
slides are going to be here at this

00:36:41,589 --> 00:36:45,759
github repo and that's all I have

00:36:44,259 --> 00:36:50,950
prepare so thank you very much for your

00:36:45,759 --> 00:36:55,240
time I was so so good for Joe like that

00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:56,740
was super powerful and we are gonna do

00:36:55,240 --> 00:37:01,119
some time for patience I'm just gonna

00:36:56,740 --> 00:37:02,529
just rant a little not rant too long but

00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:06,339
I just want to say that that was really

00:37:02,529 --> 00:37:10,210
powerful and I think having this at on

00:37:06,339 --> 00:37:12,309
the year of return and having this as a

00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:15,579
pan-african event we are really honored

00:37:12,309 --> 00:37:18,670
to have you come and it's so amazing to

00:37:15,579 --> 00:37:21,640
learn from you as an African who is

00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:24,819
living in America from Felipe who is an

00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:29,470
African in Brazil you know they are

00:37:24,819 --> 00:37:32,349
unlike you've moved yeah they are so for

00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:35,920
me it's so powerful to see that Africans

00:37:32,349 --> 00:37:38,109
are able to unite and come together you

00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:40,269
know from across the world with Python I

00:37:38,109 --> 00:37:43,329
guess bringing us together so thank you

00:37:40,269 --> 00:37:46,799
again Kojo thank you

00:37:43,329 --> 00:37:49,480
we do have time for some questions so

00:37:46,799 --> 00:37:51,339
going to do like two questions really

00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:53,710
quick before we move on to lightning

00:37:51,339 --> 00:37:55,450
talk let me also say as the I'm happy to

00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:56,799
answer questions but as someone who is

00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:57,910
the lightning talk to share for another

00:37:56,799 --> 00:37:59,920
conference I definitely don't want to

00:37:57,910 --> 00:38:02,019
run into the lightning talk time I feel

00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:03,999
like that would be a terrible thing that

00:38:02,019 --> 00:38:05,739
happened into any questions okay we're

00:38:03,999 --> 00:38:10,269
going to just do probably one or two

00:38:05,739 --> 00:38:13,989
questions okay thank you I mean you

00:38:10,269 --> 00:38:18,999
really spoke to two most of us yes my

00:38:13,989 --> 00:38:22,869
question many Africans here they try to

00:38:18,999 --> 00:38:23,940
take that dangerous route back to the

00:38:22,869 --> 00:38:28,109
States

00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:30,059
and they tried to do all sorts of things

00:38:28,109 --> 00:38:32,520
to to because they believe when they

00:38:30,059 --> 00:38:36,150
leave the shores of Africa and they go

00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:37,740
back to the Americas or whatever it's

00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:40,770
going to they are going to have a better

00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:45,839
life dies in stark contrast to our

00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:47,700
ancestors we're forced over there now so

00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:50,549
what do you say to young people who

00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:52,589
think that the only way of survival is

00:38:50,549 --> 00:38:55,349
to be in the United States of America

00:38:52,589 --> 00:38:57,510
why what do you think about them staying

00:38:55,349 --> 00:39:00,230
home and making this place a better

00:38:57,510 --> 00:39:04,770
place for cousins to come back good

00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:05,730
question I like that question so I would

00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:09,089
say on the one hand I mean there's

00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:10,530
definite value in improving your home I

00:39:09,089 --> 00:39:12,599
know and I've had this conversation with

00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:16,200
a few people while I've been here there

00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:18,180
is the idea that I don't really have a

00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:20,099
home you know I mean there's like

00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:22,319
there's you know there's where my family

00:39:20,099 --> 00:39:23,970
lives and and they love me but I know

00:39:22,319 --> 00:39:26,670
that my my home country doesn't and

00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:27,470
so the fact that you have a home country

00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:30,779
here

00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:34,529
you know in Ghana or that maybe or

00:39:30,779 --> 00:39:36,270
whichever African country you're from do

00:39:34,529 --> 00:39:38,190
what you can to try to make improvements

00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:40,109
there if you decide you want to go to

00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:41,970
the United States to for certain

00:39:40,109 --> 00:39:43,140
improvements it is true that it is the

00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:44,990
richest country in the world and there's

00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:47,460
a tremendous amount of opportunity there

00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:48,750
you just have to be prepared you know

00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:51,270
for the white supremacy that you will

00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:53,910
encounter it's a little bit different

00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:56,430
for continental Africans going to the US

00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:58,220
because for lack of a better term okay

00:39:56,430 --> 00:40:01,859
so I've said before I'll say it again

00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:04,140
Americans as a group not very smart so

00:40:01,859 --> 00:40:07,680
that's just sort of how that goes we do

00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:11,329
in say dumb things so oftentimes in in

00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:14,099
America I'm considered black but like

00:40:11,329 --> 00:40:16,799
Martin Lee wouldn't be because black

00:40:14,099 --> 00:40:19,109
means people descended from slaves ma

00:40:16,799 --> 00:40:21,119
means African she's foreign she's from a

00:40:19,109 --> 00:40:23,970
different country and so it's slightly

00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:25,680
different and so sometimes when Africans

00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:28,880
continental Africans come to America

00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:31,440
there are certain they're sometimes

00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:34,140
treated slightly better than African

00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:35,369
Americans because you are you know you

00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:37,980
coming from another country but then

00:40:35,369 --> 00:40:39,599
there's also the fact that as an African

00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:40,950
coming to America there you have the

00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:43,109
advantages that an immigrant has

00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:45,960
immigrants move from one country to

00:40:43,109 --> 00:40:48,180
another purposefully decisively with

00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:50,579
their own culture intact and with the

00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:54,839
plan of building a better life and so

00:40:50,579 --> 00:40:56,880
that can lead to more success than what

00:40:54,839 --> 00:40:58,170
my ancestors had because we the only

00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,599
culture we had access to was one that

00:40:58,170 --> 00:41:02,250
hated us so I would say sort of to your

00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:04,950
larger question I don't know that you

00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:06,690
need to go to America to build a better

00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:09,660
life but there are definitely

00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:10,920
opportunities to go there be exposed to

00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:13,440
more things and bring those things back

00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:16,500
right now American immigration policy is

00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:18,420
is really stupid where if you come to

00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:20,160
America and come to an American

00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:21,390
university and get a degree Finn

00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,589
American University you come you get

00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:24,000
like an engineering degree or math

00:41:22,589 --> 00:41:26,130
degree or something you learn all this

00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:29,849
fancy science stuff we don't let you

00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:31,980
stay like I mean you can like okay well

00:41:29,849 --> 00:41:34,140
you have to go back to Africa now it's

00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:36,990
like well wait like you graduated from

00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:39,089
MIT or Stanford or one of our fancy

00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:40,859
universities I need you to get your

00:41:39,089 --> 00:41:42,509
fancy on right here in my country how

00:41:40,859 --> 00:41:43,890
about that but no we're like no no now

00:41:42,509 --> 00:41:47,460
you have to go back to their country so

00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:48,869
I personally think that's dumb but again

00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:51,809
so if that's what you decide that you

00:41:48,869 --> 00:41:54,960
want to do be pressed be purposeful

00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:55,529
about it and and have a plan to learn

00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,470
what you can

00:41:55,529 --> 00:42:01,619
as we say get your hustle on and then

00:41:58,470 --> 00:42:10,650
bring that back home to improve improve

00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:13,109
your home yes so my question is is about

00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:15,029
so the picture that I personally have

00:42:13,109 --> 00:42:17,009
about most of the black people in

00:42:15,029 --> 00:42:19,680
America is sort of the path so towards

00:42:17,009 --> 00:42:22,529
entertainment more than say programming

00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:24,990
as a leader in the communities of

00:42:22,529 --> 00:42:26,369
programming in North America so for if

00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:29,339
you can me if you can paint a small

00:42:26,369 --> 00:42:32,460
picture of the numbers how many black

00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:36,390
people sort of within this Python

00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:38,369
communities or other okay so I I don't

00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:42,660
have actual numbers but I can tell you

00:42:38,369 --> 00:42:45,480
anecdotally that okay this again it's

00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:47,500
it's it's real talk with my cousins time

00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:49,540
one of the reasons the

00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:51,370
I am so well known in the Python and

00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:52,870
Django communities in North America is

00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:56,410
because those communities are so

00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:58,090
predominantly white and I am not and

00:42:56,410 --> 00:43:00,220
there's also the fact that I'm at 195

00:42:58,090 --> 00:43:02,080
centimeters tall I'm bigging noticeable

00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:05,140
almost anywhere on earth

00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:06,280
but again like the reality that those

00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:08,650
communities tend to be predominantly

00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:09,700
white now there's also the fact that a

00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:11,410
lot of the things that I do are very

00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:13,830
forward facing so interacting with

00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:17,050
people but there's there's also this

00:43:13,830 --> 00:43:18,970
double-consciousness issue where if you

00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:20,530
behave in certain ways as an african

00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:23,740
american some other african americans

00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:27,010
will accuse you of acting white and so

00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:30,430
it is stigmatized within the community

00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:32,800
and so there is not there's not always

00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:36,370
support from the people around you to

00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:39,220
pursue some of these technical pursuits

00:43:36,370 --> 00:43:40,930
that is changing but historically that

00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:43,450
has been the issue so I don't have like

00:43:40,930 --> 00:43:46,510
numbers per se but I know that they are

00:43:43,450 --> 00:43:48,430
small and so I know we're running out of

00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:51,820
time I'm sorry your cousin is verbose

00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:55,210
but again I can you can find me on the

00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:57,340
internet if later Oh a couple more

00:43:55,210 --> 00:43:59,410
questions in just a second because it

00:43:57,340 --> 00:44:03,310
was really good if anyone has any

00:43:59,410 --> 00:44:06,780
questions that I really like Kojo I'll

00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:06,780
try to be more concise with my answers

00:44:15,870 --> 00:44:26,100
to the North American community so I

00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:28,690
know what I will take back personally is

00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:30,820
and I'll avoid any adult language here

00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:33,700
but to give my hustle on because I know

00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:34,630
like my cousins are here working and you

00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:37,240
know I'm not going to come back here

00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:39,610
next year and not be on top of my game

00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:41,110
you know so if I come back here next

00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:43,930
year I need to have new things to show

00:44:41,110 --> 00:44:45,310
my cousin's so so that's what that's one

00:44:43,930 --> 00:44:49,060
thing that I'll personally take back I

00:44:45,310 --> 00:44:52,030
think in a larger sense the idea that

00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:53,590
just sort of being exposed to the range

00:44:52,030 --> 00:44:56,830
of things that people are doing here in

00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:58,570
the here on the continent and letting

00:44:56,830 --> 00:45:00,550
people in North America know that hey

00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:03,520
you know they're there

00:45:00,550 --> 00:45:05,650
Trinity's here to partner with my

00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:07,780
cousins because I'm and I'll just be

00:45:05,650 --> 00:45:09,640
direct I'm not here to support

00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:11,440
colonization of my cousins you don't

00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:12,520
don't don't go to my cousin's help me

00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,410
trying to colonize my cousins because

00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:16,540
you might have to see me about that I

00:45:14,410 --> 00:45:18,130
you know you will have problems but

00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:19,480
there are definitely opportunities for

00:45:18,130 --> 00:45:24,670
you to partner with my cousins because

00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:26,470
they have skills and abilities that some

00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:27,640
of the resources the infrastructure

00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:29,350
things of that nature on the continent

00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:30,610
might not be where they need to be but

00:45:29,350 --> 00:45:32,920
my cousin's you only kind of definitely

00:45:30,610 --> 00:45:35,080
have skills and abilities and you can

00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:36,910
partner with them in in a way that can

00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:40,740
benefit both parties so I think those

00:45:36,910 --> 00:45:40,740
would be like the two main takeaways

00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:46,890
thank you so much coach oh that was such

00:45:43,870 --> 00:45:49,890
a powerful closing keynote super

00:45:46,890 --> 00:45:49,890
