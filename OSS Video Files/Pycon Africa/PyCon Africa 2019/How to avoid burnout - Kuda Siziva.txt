Playlist: PyCon Africa 2019
Description: 
	Frequently our communities are affected by burnout and we do not discuss it regardless of its impact. In Kuda's presentation he aims at addressing burnout, what it is, what are its effects on the growth of python communities and how to recover from one and help each other grow the python community.

so if we have been following the

00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:12,590
presentations since yesterday and today

00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,540
most of them have been hinged around

00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:18,539
developer communities in Africa in how

00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:20,160
we can develop them and one of the key

00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:22,650
things that are not just in all the

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,109
presentations was how the developer

00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:27,449
community is not progressing how the

00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:30,090
developer community is not growing so

00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:33,239
allow me to give you a presentation on

00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:34,980
Bernard as one of the reasons why the

00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:37,730
developer communities in Africa are

00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,960
stagnant and not growing

00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:42,719
so my name is could have questions

00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:45,090
easier I am a final year student it we

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:48,629
think odd in South Africa I'm also a

00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:50,489
full-stack developer at cohesion those

00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:53,219
are my twitter handles it might get up

00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:55,680
you can follow me so for us to

00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:57,930
understand developer burnout we need to

00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,390
you know understand a developer a little

00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:03,899
bit the advantage is pretty much

00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:07,170
everyone in here is as a developer so we

00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:10,170
can relate to some of the stresses that

00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:13,020
we experience on a daily basis the

00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:15,869
deadlines that our clients give us the

00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:19,020
deadlines that the companies imposed on

00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:21,030
us and that stress building up is also

00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:24,150
one of the things that leads to to

00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:27,210
burnout so let's jump into defining what

00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:31,520
exactly is been out so early this year

00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:35,009
the World Health Organization realized

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:37,850
burnout as one of a mental condition and

00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:41,220
that definition is Bernard as a syndrome

00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:43,439
is a syndrome conceptualized as

00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:46,350
resulting from chronic workplace stress

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:49,770
that has not been successfully managed

00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:53,420
in summary basically it means Bernards

00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:56,219
these are its when demands of the job

00:01:53,420 --> 00:02:00,119
outweighed the resources to cope with it

00:01:56,219 --> 00:02:03,240
I'm pretty sure if we have HR in the

00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:04,920
audience you can also say you are

00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:08,129
responsible for making sure that the

00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:10,379
developers day-to-day is actually worth

00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:12,760
taking care of the resources for them to

00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:16,420
execute the business requirements

00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:17,920
meant but when a situation arises where

00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:20,739
a developer is not given adequate

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:23,129
resources for them to execute their

00:02:20,739 --> 00:02:26,319
day-to-day tasks this can lead to

00:02:23,129 --> 00:02:28,390
burnout so in the definition that World

00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:30,610
Health Organization gave they also

00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:32,980
pointed out an element of stress which

00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:35,019
has not been managed so what exactly is

00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:40,030
the difference between burnout and

00:02:35,019 --> 00:02:43,090
stress so stress let's get one thing

00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:47,440
clear stress does not cause burnout

00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:49,569
however stress and inadequate support

00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,760
does cause burnout which I alluded

00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:53,739
earlier on that if a developer does not

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:57,599
get enough support for their day-to-day

00:02:53,739 --> 00:03:01,769
activities it will cause them a burnout

00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:04,569
however a little bit of healthy stress

00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:07,629
can also be good on our day to day

00:03:04,569 --> 00:03:10,269
activities this is so because that

00:03:07,629 --> 00:03:13,239
stress puts us on edge a little bit of

00:03:10,269 --> 00:03:16,780
adrenaline could be all we need just to

00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:18,790
get just to jumpstart us into actually

00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:24,879
performing or doing our day to day jobs

00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:26,799
and being on edge so we have identified

00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,599
Bernard's the definition of pain art we

00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:31,000
have also seen the differences between

00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:34,870
they're not and stress so what exactly

00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:39,220
causes been out first of all is

00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:41,019
excessive coding when we get into the

00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:43,540
profession of programming and coding we

00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:47,109
get so consumed that is very possible

00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:50,699
for us to spend hours or even days of

00:03:47,109 --> 00:03:54,430
non-stop coding this is often

00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:56,680
misinterpreted as progress but it's also

00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:58,659
a contributing factor to burnout because

00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,730
you're not giving yourself enough time

00:03:58,659 --> 00:04:04,690
to take a breather and also explore

00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:07,000
other new things pushing your mind to

00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:09,190
max for hours this is all the same thing

00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:14,109
as excessive coding but you're now

00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:16,570
pushing the limits of your mind to you

00:04:14,109 --> 00:04:19,299
know execute certain tasks the mind can

00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:22,539
go is this far but if you push it

00:04:19,299 --> 00:04:25,719
further than its limit it will cause you

00:04:22,539 --> 00:04:25,980
burn out and this done over long period

00:04:25,719 --> 00:04:32,640
of

00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:35,600
his drastic effects on developers doing

00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:39,000
the same type of work day-in day-out

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:42,000
this I can speak from a personal point

00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,770
of view I went at a company where I was

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,170
doing the same thing over and over again

00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:48,810
it gets exciting when you join the

00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:51,060
company you wake only on one product in

00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:53,910
one product alone because that is the

00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:56,490
driving or the driving product of the

00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:58,290
cab of of the company but if you don't

00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:00,060
do anything else other than your

00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:02,400
day-to-day job and doing the same thing

00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:04,140
over and over again that motivation that

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,900
pushed you to apply for that particular

00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:08,540
job that motivation that woke you up

00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:11,490
every morning to go to work

00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:17,580
decreases and eventually you fall into a

00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:19,440
burnout being isolated from people also

00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:22,440
from a personal perspective I enjoy

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:25,710
coding in isolation usually when I start

00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:27,660
working I put on my headsets and I you

00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:30,420
know go into a corner and start coding

00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:33,120
the only time at work where I interact

00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:34,830
with other people is either during daily

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,050
stand-ups or when we're doing record

00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:40,170
reviews but in most cases usually do

00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:44,250
code reviews over Skype or hangouts but

00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:46,440
that continuous isolation from people

00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:49,680
and not interacting with people can also

00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:55,200
cause you to feel or to fall into a

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:58,500
Bernard lack of sleep and exercise one

00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:01,320
of the recurring motifs within amongst

00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:03,810
developers is its lip code and repeat

00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:06,360
however this sleep element is usually

00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:09,090
ignored when developers are starting off

00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:11,970
or they engaged in a very exciting

00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:15,480
project so we tend to go into a cycle

00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:18,110
where we only code and code in code

00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:19,710
alone with length of exercise we hardly

00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:21,420
hit the gym

00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:23,340
I'm also guilty on that have a gym

00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:26,250
subscription that I'm paying but I'm not

00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:29,210
using it completely that also can lead

00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:32,880
into burnout

00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:36,180
right let's now look into we've sinned

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:39,320
what causes Bernard so what exactly are

00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:41,690
the signs of Bernard how do you identify

00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:44,890
yourself as having fallen into into a

00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:48,080
burnout loss of motivation and passion

00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:50,390
earlier on I pointed out that doing the

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:53,780
same thing over and over again causes

00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:56,390
you to fall into a space where you start

00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:59,090
questioning the you know the motivation

00:06:56,390 --> 00:07:01,340
behind you joining the company that same

00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:04,580
passion that same spark that she had at

00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:06,140
the beginning of the of your career when

00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:08,300
you started you know working as a

00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:11,450
programmer starts to fade away and you

00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:13,970
start to question your career choice if

00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:16,010
I might say so if you're having loss of

00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:20,060
motivation and passion you should

00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:22,160
definitely reexamine where you stand in

00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:25,700
sick for help because you might be

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:28,670
experiencing signs of burnout feeling of

00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:31,550
depression so this is Rayleigh recurrent

00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:33,680
in a lot of developers we come from

00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:35,960
different backgrounds and the pressure

00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:39,770
that we have at work we work in 8 to 5

00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:42,050
job it brings its own stresses and with

00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:44,210
programming being something that can be

00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:46,390
addictive you tend to check that work

00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:49,400
also back home and when you go home

00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:52,160
you're also met with a lot of other

00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:54,140
challenges at home so that alone is a

00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,210
cocktail for disaster and a lot of

00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,920
people fall into depression and if

00:07:56,210 --> 00:08:00,260
you're constantly being depressed as a

00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:06,920
developer that's also a sign of you

00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:09,830
being burnt out yesterday the keynotes

00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:13,790
ending the day Anna McCarthy she

00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:15,920
highlighted that she constantly will not

00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:18,380
constantly but a lot of people you know

00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:20,630
glorify her of her achievements but she

00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:23,840
gets to a point where her achievements

00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:27,170
do not bring any satisfaction this could

00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:30,080
also be a sign of burnout its developers

00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:32,680
we do a lot of good things beets in a

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:36,460
workplace or in the communities that we

00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:39,650
work in and ultimately those are

00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:42,740
achievements they get your point where

00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:44,600
you're like well I've done this but does

00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:46,310
it really matter it doesn't give you

00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,500
that self satisfaction is the next

00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:51,990
person who is admiring your work so that

00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:56,280
could also be a sign of

00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:58,470
their formation things if everything one

00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:01,470
thing in common which is you're stuck in

00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:03,960
one place you have come from being a

00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:07,940
highly motivated and very productive

00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:10,950
engineer to a very less motivated and

00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:12,840
depressed and burned-out engineer you're

00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:15,870
now stuck in one place where you can

00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:18,410
neither go back to that place where you

00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:21,240
hid the passion the spark to develop

00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:22,740
good solutions and you cannot move

00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,660
forward away from that so you're now

00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:31,470
stuck in one place and you're heavily

00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:35,400
bent out so how bad is Bernard in the

00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:40,170
developer circles so according to a

00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:42,390
gulab study it says 63% of people who

00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:44,700
are burnt out I'm more likely to apply

00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:46,560
for sick leave so if you find yourself

00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:49,200
in a situation where constantly applying

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:52,620
for sick leave even if you are very fit

00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,840
to work you probably might be having a

00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:58,620
very large because that number is very

00:09:54,840 --> 00:10:00,660
huge and from an HR perspective if you

00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:02,550
have a lot of employees seeking sick

00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:07,290
leave that sort of decreases the

00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:09,270
productivity of the company also to

00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:12,540
point those people are burnt out there

00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:16,170
2.6 times more likely to actively sick

00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:17,910
for look for four jobs so remember we

00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:20,220
spoke about that spark that brought you

00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:22,080
to a company you saw something in that

00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:24,090
particular company so something in a

00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:27,150
particular project that you took up to

00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:30,120
do but when you get to a point where you

00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:33,060
are now frequenting recruitment websites

00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:35,430
you are now looking for external work

00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:37,800
you should probably consider you know

00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:39,450
doing an introspection into the

00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:44,010
situation that you're in you probably

00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:47,100
might be burnt out and they say 18% of

00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:49,440
the people who decide to stay regardless

00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:52,020
of them being bent on the particular job

00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,630
have less confidence completely in their

00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:56,790
performance so that also goes to that

00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:59,760
lack of motivation and passion so your

00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:03,270
productivity goes way way down and you

00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:05,220
are less productive to the company but

00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:09,029
chief of all

00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:12,209
bring out how bad it is it destroys the

00:11:09,029 --> 00:11:16,110
ambitions and the sense of worth in a

00:11:12,209 --> 00:11:19,889
developer so this is so bad in the

00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:23,550
African context when we look at our

00:11:19,889 --> 00:11:25,800
developer communities so imagine you

00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:28,350
have ten developers in a developer

00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:31,410
circle and all of them are going through

00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:33,720
different stages of burnout each and

00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:35,610
every one of them is experiencing at

00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:38,790
least one or two symptoms of burnout

00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:42,990
that community is likely to fall apart

00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:45,089
because they are questioning their worth

00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:49,079
they're questioning their performance

00:11:45,089 --> 00:11:50,850
they have the ambition that they had to

00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:52,829
build the developer communities is

00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:55,290
diminishing or is being destroyed and

00:11:52,829 --> 00:12:00,300
that sense of width is going way way

00:11:55,290 --> 00:12:04,139
down so that alone is a huge threat to a

00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:08,550
well or a healthy developer community in

00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:12,180
Africa I've talked about that being a

00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:14,850
developer communities now you might be

00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:17,189
wondering if it is this bed and the

00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:18,930
symptoms I'm pretty sure you know if we

00:12:17,189 --> 00:12:20,970
can have a raise of hands which we're

00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:23,459
not going to do we probably have

00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:25,980
experienced one or more of the side

00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:27,600
effects all the signs and symptoms of

00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:30,720
burnout that I've pointed out earlier

00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:35,100
but how do we get to a point where we

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:38,000
avoid being burnt out so first of all

00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:41,459
you can consider working remotely

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,399
working remotely has its benefits the

00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:46,980
flexibility of working from home working

00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:49,199
in your PJs you don't have to go through

00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:51,180
the stress of traffic being stuck in

00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:53,759
traffic you can work remotely

00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:57,410
so regardless of you being working in an

00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:59,279
8 to 5 job where a remote option is not

00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:01,740
up for discussion

00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:04,889
you could negotiate with your HR present

00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:06,930
your case to say I am feeling burnt out

00:13:04,889 --> 00:13:09,329
and I'm less productive if I continue

00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:11,160
with this pace can I at least take two

00:13:09,329 --> 00:13:13,740
days from the five days that I work

00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:15,750
where I can work remotely that change in

00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:18,950
environment from your work or your

00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:22,730
office to your home can

00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:25,950
the likelihood of you being burnt out I

00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:29,040
talked to your loved ones loved ones

00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:32,280
could be humans it could be cats but

00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:35,010
talk to someone I think one of the

00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:36,750
things that we have to admit is it's a

00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:39,180
problem you have to accept that is a

00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:41,370
problem you have to accept that you need

00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:44,580
to speak to someone for them to help you

00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:47,550
don't live in isolation programmers like

00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:50,760
I said earlier that we love that sense

00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:53,190
of you know the space we love our space

00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:55,320
but when it gets this bed and it's

00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:57,090
affecting our developer communities we

00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:02,010
need to at least reach out to someone

00:13:57,090 --> 00:14:04,590
and speak to them keep the passion this

00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:09,000
is entirely up to you as an individual

00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:12,060
how do you stay motivated I've seen a

00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:15,060
dozen of CVS where people would say I'm

00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:16,950
a highly motivated individual but look

00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:19,380
at those people a year down the line

00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:21,360
they are less motivated completely

00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:24,000
they're looking for motivation outside

00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,800
of themselves so let's stick to the

00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,300
things that we put up on our CVS to say

00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:30,810
I'm a highly motivated individual and

00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:32,310
keep that passion going you could try it

00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:33,990
drink quite a number of other things

00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:35,940
that are completely different from your

00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:37,980
work just to keep the passion that would

00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:41,780
reduce also the likelihood of you

00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:44,940
getting burnt out seek professional help

00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:47,450
earlier I said world health organization

00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:50,370
now you know recognizes burnout as a

00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:54,750
serious problem within the workplaces

00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:55,410
and it's not a shame or it's not

00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:57,840
embarrassing

00:14:55,410 --> 00:15:01,200
for you to walk up to a professional and

00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:02,940
say I need help because if you don't the

00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,920
consequences of a burnout are very

00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:07,020
drastic you might change your career

00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:09,510
completely or you might go through a

00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:11,790
stage where you are less productive or

00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:15,030
not productive at all completely so

00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:16,980
don't be ashamed to be open about it and

00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:19,530
say I need professional help sick

00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:24,360
canceling the a lot of psycho or a lot

00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:27,320
of therapists that can help us out also

00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:30,180
on top of us talking to our loved ones

00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:32,220
prioritize our health

00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:35,640
I know this might be a challenge for

00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:39,240
most of the people but try taking a walk

00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:43,320
try exercising every day because a

00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:45,360
healthy body and mind is very it's very

00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:48,570
difficult for that body to be bent out

00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:50,670
so try to stay healthy you know hit that

00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:52,500
gym once or twice in a week you know

00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:55,110
take that long walk clear your head

00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:57,180
don't just focus on the work alone you

00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:59,610
know if you're taking an uber to go to

00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:01,380
the Texas or to go to work if it's a

00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:04,140
walkable distance try walking there try

00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:06,450
running the try cycling to work just

00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:09,120
stay in shape you know as long as you

00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:12,300
don't shift the whole routine in your

00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:16,470
day-to-day just try to be healthy and

00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:20,730
you stay away from burnout take breaks

00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:24,330
throughout the day so if my current job

00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:26,040
I'm really enjoying what I'm doing I'm

00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:30,149
most afraid that I might get burnt out

00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:32,160
very soon because I don't stand up from

00:16:30,149 --> 00:16:34,770
my desk I literally have a bunch of

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:38,130
drawers and a lot of snacks in there I

00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:39,870
don't walk out to go get food if I need

00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:41,790
food I can just do goodbye it's the guy

00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:44,730
walks right into the office straight to

00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:46,980
my desk and gives me food this is not

00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:50,100
good at all let's try to take those

00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:50,640
frequent breaks between our day 5-10

00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,529
minutes

00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:54,329
stand up from my desk go speak to a

00:16:52,529 --> 00:16:56,220
co-worker just find out how their day

00:16:54,329 --> 00:16:57,839
has been you know it doesn't have to be

00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,500
a very complicated discussion about the

00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,690
personal life

00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:03,329
oh man how's your cold how's your task

00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:06,689
today just stand up and go to someone

00:17:03,329 --> 00:17:09,059
and speak to someone throughout your day

00:17:06,689 --> 00:17:14,010
take vacation frequently I put in a

00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:17,040
stress on this one because well most of

00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:19,559
our salaries some people might not be

00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:21,990
enough for us to take a holiday it might

00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:25,380
be expensive to take holiday so just

00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:28,679
find something to do instead of a

00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:30,780
vacation just take a day off or two days

00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:33,600
away from work where you completely

00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:35,100
don't touch any line of code where you

00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,170
get into different environments

00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:40,130
completely and you speak of different

00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:42,780
things other than cold some people their

00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:45,420
time or their break

00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:47,250
take is going to take meetups they they

00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:49,380
also go further into discussing tech

00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:51,450
related stuff and that's not really a

00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:52,410
break take a break into something

00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:54,990
completely different

00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:59,220
I'll in a new language join the meetup

00:17:54,990 --> 00:18:03,420
for yoga for anything that you don't do

00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:08,400
on a day-to-day basis set aside time to

00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:11,160
try new things this is very important I

00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,970
recently found a passion in agriculture

00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:18,210
I've been researching about aquaponics

00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:20,820
in hydroponics I am very passionate

00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:23,910
about it and it's something that is

00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:25,980
taking my mind away from code and I'm

00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:28,320
researching about plants and how to do

00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:30,870
hydroponics something that I don't do on

00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,310
a day-to-day at work so it might be

00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:35,610
different in your case you might be

00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:37,200
interested in other things try to you

00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:39,450
know try new things you could be

00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,640
interested in cooking take up a cooking

00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:43,710
class you might be interested in cycling

00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:45,870
during a cycling club but just try

00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:48,150
something different get out of your

00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:50,700
comfort zone behind your computer and do

00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:52,590
something entirely different the

00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:56,130
community the community is very

00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:58,380
important I think we can all of us being

00:18:56,130 --> 00:19:01,500
here today is evidence of a very strong

00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:03,660
community in Ghana if that community did

00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,350
not exist this event would not have been

00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:06,630
possible

00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:09,030
so tap into the strength of the

00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:10,290
community your problems someone else

00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:12,180
could also be going through the same

00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:14,910
problems in the community reach out to

00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:17,940
your community talk about it right make

00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:19,710
this conversation plain for everyone to

00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:21,060
talk about don't be shy to talk about

00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:23,850
these conversations in your community

00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:25,260
but chief of all let's leverage on the

00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:27,990
strength of the community that we have

00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:30,180
and encourage each other to attend

00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:31,920
meetups that we have and build a

00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:34,470
stronger community ultimately to

00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:39,150
translate into strong individuals that

00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:41,670
unless bent out find a hobby this is

00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:45,690
probably the same thing as trying

00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:48,570
something new I find it hard to find a

00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:49,320
hobby probably in the audience someone

00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:52,140
can help me out

00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:54,660
you know with suggestions of new hobbies

00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:57,060
that I can try out I've tried learning

00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:59,160
African languages

00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:01,800
but the previous speaker yesterday

00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:04,740
pointed out there 2000 languages so

00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:06,570
that's going to be a very tough thing to

00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:09,930
do to learn African languages but I'll

00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:12,890
try I'll try I'll find one and stick to

00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:16,950
it and have fun with it

00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:18,990
in conclusion what I'm saying is burnout

00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:20,580
manifests differently from person to

00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:22,050
person you might not experience

00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:23,940
everything that I've pointed out here

00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:27,060
you might experience one of it or two of

00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:29,130
it but it manifests differently in a lot

00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:30,900
of people and the only way for us to

00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:32,940
understand how the other person is

00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:34,650
feeling is when they talk about it

00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:37,440
so let's make it an open conversation

00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:41,760
where you don't live in isolation and

00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:43,590
feel like you are feeling isolated speak

00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,840
to someone tap into the community and

00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:48,420
discuss they but you can find out how

00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:51,330
burnout is manifesting in other people

00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:53,490
it would sneak up on us when we least

00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:55,530
expect it you'd be like well I've been

00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:58,470
coding for 30 years I have never had a

00:20:55,530 --> 00:21:00,360
breakdown in my life but when you least

00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:02,880
expect it that would the time that is

00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:05,100
going to sneak up on you so being a way

00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,410
of its effects it's times and symptoms

00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:09,960
before it hits you it's always a good

00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:12,450
thing because you know before it sneaks

00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:14,430
up on you burnout will cause developers

00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:17,370
to abandon their careers instead of

00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:20,790
seeking for help and support like I said

00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:23,010
if you let burn out get to you you get

00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:24,900
to a point where you feel like this is

00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:27,120
not the career for me I need to switch

00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:29,520
completely and that's which would take

00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:32,130
you a lot of time and will further push

00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:34,380
you down the drain of being burnt out

00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:36,450
and your recovery from that would be

00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:39,030
close to impossible

00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:40,650
so before you consider changing careers

00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:42,570
just because you burnt out or you're

00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:44,460
less motivated in the work that you do

00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:47,280
try to speak to someone sick

00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:51,630
professional help and you will be saved

00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:54,870
from changing careers there's a final

00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:56,520
word to everyone here let's go back to

00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:57,510
our communities and let's keep the

00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:00,360
conversation going

00:21:57,510 --> 00:22:03,090
this is a less talked about issue in

00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:04,620
developer communities I don't know for

00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:07,080
whatever reason but we need to start

00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:08,970
talking about it now because if we don't

00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:12,350
we see it

00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:14,400
decline or a dying community

00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:16,980
particularly in the software space

00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:19,350
software development space the Python

00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:21,900
groups that we have in Africa we have so

00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:23,700
many challenges that we have from our

00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:25,409
countries that we come from and if we

00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:28,020
don't start talking about this in our

00:22:25,409 --> 00:22:30,960
communities we stand to lose a lot we

00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:33,299
stand to lose a lot of developers in our

00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,950
communities dying let's continue talking

00:22:33,299 --> 00:22:45,200
about this in save or developer

00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:48,419
communities thank you questions love you

00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,830
thank you very much CUDA yes please I

00:22:48,419 --> 00:22:52,100
hope we do have some questions from the

00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:54,690
audience so we'll start with Flavio

00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:56,010
someone will pass your microphone well

00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:57,690
thirst for most thanks a lot for talking

00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:59,580
about it it's extremely important topic

00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:01,710
I wish you had like two hours to talk

00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:04,980
about it or you have probably burnt out

00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:07,530
of it but the question is you

00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:09,750
recommended remote working as a way for

00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:11,070
people to actually like cope with a

00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:13,110
little bit with the stress of the office

00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:14,429
and the traffic and all that but more

00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:16,260
and more these days we see more people

00:23:14,429 --> 00:23:18,120
working only remotely like a hundred

00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:20,429
percent remotely so what advice can you

00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:22,679
give to those guys so that they don't

00:23:20,429 --> 00:23:24,750
burnt out in their homes and then take

00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:26,340
it on their loved ones that they are

00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:29,909
supposed to be talking nice trick I

00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:32,400
think when I pointed out the remote work

00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:34,770
I pointed out the flexibility of you

00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,929
working from home the advantages come

00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:38,580
through in the sense that you don't have

00:23:36,929 --> 00:23:41,880
to be stuck in traffic you don't have to

00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:44,190
go to work so that's less time that's

00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:46,620
been more time for you to work so

00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:48,690
ultimately you have a lot of time in

00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:51,659
your hands to check those frequent

00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:53,130
breaks in your space because when you go

00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:55,110
to an office probably it's just a bunch

00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:57,390
of buildings and there's no something

00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:59,070
you know interesting for you to go out

00:23:57,390 --> 00:24:01,230
and look at but if you're working from

00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:03,480
home you have you're close to maybe seen

00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:05,730
scenery that's close to you so it's easy

00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:07,350
for you to check those breaks and go

00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:09,690
away from from you from your zone

00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:11,400
without anyone saying hey I need to see

00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:13,770
you on the desk I think the problem with

00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:15,630
in 8 to 5 job is you know our managers

00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:17,580
that are non-technical they think that

00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:19,740
being in front of a computer from 8 to 5

00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:21,630
you're being productive so moving away

00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:22,650
to a remote job where you can check

00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:24,360
those frequent

00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:26,520
but still clock in your required hours

00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:29,280
it's still okay I mean you have

00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:37,650
flexibility of moving on from from out

00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:39,060
forensic question of your own and raise

00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:43,230
your hand as soon as possible so that we

00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:44,640
can see where they're coming from okay

00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:50,340
while you're thinking I'd like to ask

00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:53,070
him do you think that burnout is a

00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:55,560
Western disease that has been is being

00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:59,390
imported into Africa through with our

00:24:55,560 --> 00:25:04,250
technology industries I'm not really so

00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:07,410
burn out a lot of people from different

00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:08,910
industries experience burnout I the

00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:11,430
privilege of speaking to one of my

00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:13,800
doctors and she said they get burnt out

00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:16,020
constantly looking at working hours that

00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:17,640
they have they get burned out a lot and

00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:20,220
that causes them to make a lot of

00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:22,830
mistakes in the wrong decisions that

00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:26,250
they have so I don't look at it as a

00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:28,650
Western you know imposed you know thing

00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:31,410
that's nice I think it's something that

00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:34,890
already has been there we were just not

00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:37,200
aware of the severity of it because we

00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:38,850
did not have these communities that we

00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,670
have so through these communities that

00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:43,560
we have and seeing how they decline and

00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:45,420
out they disintegrate that's when we're

00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:47,670
starting to realize that all day is

00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:53,690
Barnard and when I feel like this I'm

00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:53,690
burnt out yeah sure thank you

00:25:56,260 --> 00:26:07,549
soon if somebody would like to ask a

00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:09,490
final question for our speaker okay this

00:26:07,549 --> 00:26:12,530
isn't him this is an important topic

00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:14,360
please when your thoughts have settled

00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:16,700
find some time to talk to CUDA about

00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:19,160
this because it's something that creeps

00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:20,310
up on you faster than you realize

00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:30,109
thank you once again

00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:30,109
