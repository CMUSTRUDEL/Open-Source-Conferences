Publication date: 2019-11-18
Playlist: PyCon Africa 2019
Description: 
	In Felipe's talk we get to know that most of the people in Brazil are black but this people are sub-represented in Tech. It's also the second country with more black people in the world, just behind Nigeria. This talk is to showcase an initiative created in Brazil to include and empower black people through technology called AfroPython, filling in this gap.

can we clap for you on one thing thank

00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:16,529
you my friend so how are you today it

00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:19,380
happening a very big event right so let

00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:23,820
me go to the start of my presentation so

00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:27,240
we can start hi I'm Felipe I'm from

00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:33,149
Brazil I'm a software developer I work

00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:35,219
for taught works in Brazil and I will be

00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:37,829
talking about a free Python that's the

00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:43,980
initiative that we started in Brazil and

00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:48,539
we are happening smart bye-bye jungle

00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:51,000
girls so a lot of things that we do we

00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:54,930
learn it with my ladies and junk girls

00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:04,979
and we start to make our own path after

00:00:54,930 --> 00:01:07,049
this so I'd like to talk about how far

00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:09,750
and how close we are

00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:12,810
yeah this is my parent first time in

00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:16,049
Africa so again I will be my perspective

00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:20,070
of Africa for now so you are doing an

00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:23,100
amazing job he's for you this city that

00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:25,680
I born a lot of people know about this

00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:30,000
because of the beaches there is one of

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:32,700
the most famous cities in Brazil but

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,360
also a lot of people don't know about

00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:41,960
this but after Nigeria Brazil is the

00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:44,759
second black-ass country in the world so

00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:47,490
we have a most of our population are

00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:49,680
black people like me and we have an

00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:50,800
issue in ninety that we are at they

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,550
represented

00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:57,700
a lot of countries and any preserve it

00:01:54,550 --> 00:02:00,250
it happens as well so this is one of the

00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:08,500
motives why I would have a pro Python in

00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:12,280
Brazil so how does everything started we

00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:15,340
were a group of people very bovid with

00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:19,500
IT especially the Python community but

00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:23,280
we were seeing a lot of movement around

00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:29,050
women in IT but we were not able to see

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:35,200
black people in 80 so some of the these

00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:38,590
movements were able to to support the

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,900
black males but the black males were not

00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:45,540
able to be there because there were a

00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:49,090
barrier that we were not able to cross

00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:52,320
so things I was very forward with a lot

00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:56,620
of women and IT as well so this is the

00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:59,650
jungle that we had in 2017 was one of

00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:02,320
the biggest in in South America so this

00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:06,550
was a big achievement for me and my

00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:09,250
friends but in this event to be realized

00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:11,739
that even we who are very a Chanel we

00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:15,730
are able to focus on females but not

00:03:11,739 --> 00:03:21,459
black males so that's why we started to

00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:23,800
have a small different approach so that

00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:27,959
was a question that I was making to

00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:31,060
myself I can see the black males been

00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:34,390
supported by events like cherry girls

00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:36,700
girls girls or any women energy movement

00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:41,520
but there was not able to see the black

00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:45,160
males there so this was how it started

00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:48,310
so this is a video that I want to share

00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:51,070
with you that talks about the black

00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:52,110
people in Brazil so we to give it's very

00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:05,250

okay so one important curiosity

00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:51,790
this video isn't worth a lot of people

00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:54,490
think that we speak Spanish in Brazil

00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:59,020
but we do not we speak we speak

00:06:54,490 --> 00:07:01,690
Portuguese so this video helped us to

00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:04,420
understand very briefly what are the

00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:08,280
issues that black people face in Brazil

00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:11,860
so that's where a propriety one to

00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:15,010
support people especially because for a

00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:16,890
lot of people in Brazil I think it's a

00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:20,860
lot of other parts of the world as well

00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:23,980
working ID is a kind of social hack that

00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:26,140
you are able to achieve a very good

00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:28,480
salary and support your family and help

00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:31,800
your parents with a very short time of

00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:34,870
career so this is one of the motives why

00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:39,370
we were already acting so it was good

00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:41,770
for us but it is a kind of social hug

00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:46,900
that you want to use it to support more

00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:49,410
black people so that's how we came out

00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:53,050
with the idea to have an initiative to

00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:55,870
support more black people so this was

00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:59,530
our very first meeting and now that we

00:07:55,870 --> 00:08:02,830
are from you it's a very hot place but

00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:04,930
in the suburb reservist is colder so a

00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:08,260
lot of people there are used to it

00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:10,450
but I am NOT that's why I have that in

00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:13,690
my neck to protect me from the cold and

00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:17,020
the natives are very good at this but in

00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:20,110
the middle of the Java 2017 we had our

00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:23,950
very first meeting to organize our very

00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:26,770
first workshop in Brazil so during 6

00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:28,960
months we were have meeting every week

00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:31,540
so we can't coordinate everything why

00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:36,130
come up with our website social networks

00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:39,370
and a lot of things to be able to have

00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:43,090
this event we were very inspired by Java

00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:45,100
girls so we had a workshop and when we

00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:48,520
started we the very first thing that we

00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:49,960
made was create a Facebook page because

00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:54,070
that's very popular in Brazil

00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:58,149
and that was our main way to and reach

00:08:54,070 --> 00:09:00,640
the people so this was very important so

00:08:58,149 --> 00:09:05,730
we came out with our website that was

00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:10,500
very simple but it served their purpose

00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:12,940
but we want to know how we were able to

00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:16,660
get the feedback and know that we were

00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:19,720
in the right path so we started to look

00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:24,399
for achievement that we were meeting -

00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:27,029
that were able to do that were letting

00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:30,880
us know that we were in the right path

00:09:27,029 --> 00:09:33,070
so one of the points were how we get

00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,880
very fast a lot of supporters and

00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:38,050
sponsors so one of them is the

00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:40,600
department Software Foundation what was

00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:45,940
very important for us to be able to come

00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:48,959
up with this event and even people that

00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:50,560
were willing to support us they also

00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:54,160
helped us a lot

00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:55,610
so this was our achievement that let us

00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,300
know that we were in the right path

00:09:55,610 --> 00:10:00,490
[Music]

00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:02,650
after this we had our train the

00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:05,680
trainer's that were where we were

00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:08,589
preparing the people to be trainers in

00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:11,350
our workshop so this was very good

00:10:08,589 --> 00:10:14,020
because that was the first time in my

00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:16,990
career that I was able to see more black

00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:20,560
people because before this the feeling

00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:24,010
that I had was that I was alone in this

00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:26,529
in the IT market but with every bite I

00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:30,339
was able to see that I was not alone and

00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:36,130
a lot of stories like mine were in the

00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:40,630
IT market as well after this we had our

00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:42,630
very first workshop as you can see this

00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:45,190
is the t-shirt that are using right now

00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:47,829
because this is very important for me so

00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:50,620
this was our parent workshop for her

00:10:47,829 --> 00:10:55,860
first workshop and this was amazing was

00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:58,579
a very good environment part of it is a

00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:00,980
it's a workshop

00:10:58,579 --> 00:11:03,259
teaching people how to code people that

00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:05,930
have never will never like programming

00:11:03,259 --> 00:11:08,329
before so this was amazing

00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:11,300
but another part of it is inspiring

00:11:08,329 --> 00:11:14,329
people to get in the IT market it--when

00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:17,060
know how is it that's not so hard as a

00:11:14,329 --> 00:11:18,110
lot of people think that it is and at

00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:21,139
the end of the event

00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:23,839
we usually do a fishbowl that our space

00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:26,209
where people can share their experiences

00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:28,399
or their feelings and that's the best

00:11:26,209 --> 00:11:31,009
moment of the event for me because

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,600
that's where you understand that a lot

00:11:31,009 --> 00:11:35,240
of people are facing the same issues

00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:37,610
that you have been before so that's

00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:40,490
where you connect with the people and

00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:42,529
one thing that we really like to do in

00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:45,199
the Python events in Brazil is we have

00:11:42,529 --> 00:11:47,269
an something to get the people together

00:11:45,199 --> 00:11:49,910
after the event so we go to a restaurant

00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:52,790
or a bar where people can get in touch

00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:55,940
and talk so that's a very important

00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:57,649
moment that's where the people in the

00:11:55,940 --> 00:12:00,709
organization get together if the

00:11:57,649 --> 00:12:02,360
participants and we start to get to know

00:12:00,709 --> 00:12:04,760
each other better so that's very

00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:10,880
important for building the relationship

00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:14,329
between the people so after our very

00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:18,199
first workshop we had a different

00:12:14,329 --> 00:12:21,110
approach we made a conference we where

00:12:18,199 --> 00:12:23,690
we had tracks ichirin was responsible

00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:26,930
for a set of technologies so it's all

00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:29,630
imported but the very first it talked

00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:33,079
about IOT data science big data

00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:35,540
blockchain so we had three rooms where

00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:38,690
we and our proposal if this was

00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:40,699
different we want to have the black

00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:44,000
people that were running the market be

00:12:40,699 --> 00:12:46,430
able to speak in a conference and so

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,639
this was a real model for more black

00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:50,830
people that were coming and seeing

00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:53,260
people that they can see

00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:56,710
selves so that was a very important

00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:59,440
point this is something that we learned

00:12:56,710 --> 00:13:02,020
it from jungle girl jungle girls events

00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:05,080
and by ladies where most of the trainers

00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:07,180
are the codes are females so the

00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:14,200
participants can get inspired by these

00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:17,470
people and this was the beta form from

00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:19,960
the second event so first it was a

00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:25,360
workshop and the second one was a

00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:25,840
conference and one thing that I did last

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,480
year

00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:31,240
I opened the forum where people can

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:35,340
share how I prefer to have affected

00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:41,140
their lives so these are some of the

00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:44,100
what people have experienced let me read

00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:46,930
it it has impacted my self-esteem

00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:50,950
representativeness and I'm proud of it

00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:55,360
a lot of people was not able to see

00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:59,140
themselves in the IT market so see this

00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:03,070
kind of experience for me was very

00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:05,920
important because I was not able to see

00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:08,230
people like me so be able to see this

00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,840
kind of experience for me is very

00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:12,040
important because these people are not

00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:16,710
going to experience what I have

00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:16,710
experienced and I for sure didn't like

00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:25,529
it was beautiful to see a United team

00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:28,050
creating empathy supporting career

00:14:25,529 --> 00:14:31,890
growth helping like people talking about

00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:33,589
the job market in 80 which I in my mind

00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:35,490
would be impossible for black people

00:14:33,589 --> 00:14:39,209
that's another point about

00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:41,820
representativity they were not able to

00:14:39,209 --> 00:14:44,790
see myself there so they were not able

00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:47,190
to imagine a career in that space so

00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:50,670
this is a very important point when we

00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:54,870
do events like this like jungle girls or

00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:56,640
initiatives like this it's a very

00:14:54,870 --> 00:15:00,860
important point we need to inspire

00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:00,860
people and let me know that we can do it

00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:07,740
AFRICOM helped me to learn new things to

00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:10,790
realize that there are more

00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:14,940
possibilities and make me feel welcome

00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:17,279
even when we know that what you want you

00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:19,709
know that will be really hard sometimes

00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:23,640
you don't have any support around so it

00:15:19,709 --> 00:15:28,170
can be very tough so one more point that

00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:30,959
we realize that was that with everybody

00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:34,260
was able to see a lot of very similar

00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:36,510
experience and we were able to get

00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:38,610
support from each other or when

00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:41,100
something bad happening with someone so

00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:44,790
some of us we were able to get support

00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:47,540
really fast and we feel very warm that

00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:47,540
was very good

00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:53,900
and I can't deal with the laughs but I'm

00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:56,030
from I don't have in fact that mean the

00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:59,150
most positive and beautiful way possible

00:15:56,030 --> 00:16:01,610
I couldn't amana imagine it that one day

00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:03,290
computer programming class would create

00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:05,540
such a network of people willing to help

00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:08,990
and support each other as enough

00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:11,060
repeatin you don't have to come to a 4

00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:14,510
by 10 and after this you have to become

00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:18,830
a developer you can just use programming

00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:21,590
as a 2 you can do anything else you can

00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:24,290
do any other career or profession but

00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:28,490
you can use it as a 2 that it can help

00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:32,030
any career so this was one more point

00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:34,220
about this warm in this welcome Ness

00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:38,170
that we had that was very important to

00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:42,290
help each other and support each other

00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:47,240
so this was our last event it was in

00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:49,760
November of 2018 usually we try to do

00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:52,310
the event in November because there is

00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:57,380
one very important day temperature in

00:16:52,310 --> 00:17:00,800
this time so these will were bigger

00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:04,130
event we had a lot of people give us a

00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:06,800
lot of work but it's amazing how we see

00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:13,430
people very happy and how people get

00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:15,860
connected it's amazing so a lot of

00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:19,070
people ask us what do you want for for

00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:24,530
the future a frightened and it's very

00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:26,300
hard to to say but in to be simple we

00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:29,540
want to support more black people in ID

00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:32,480
especially in Brazil we know that in

00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:35,420
South America in different parts of

00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:37,730
Brazil or in the world there are a lot

00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:41,180
of issues with black people as well so

00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:44,990
we want to be a platform to support more

00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:47,929
black people in Brazil so

00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:50,820
one of the things that we did this year

00:17:47,929 --> 00:17:53,400
all these events that they were that I

00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:56,340
was sharing Abnett in one city in the

00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:58,220
topography oh that's the whitest place

00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:02,520
in Brazil so there was a lot of races

00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:05,970
races so one thing that we did were

00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:08,159
expanding for different cities so now we

00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:11,250
have people from enough right now in Sao

00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:14,669
Paulo in a city that's the Northeast of

00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:18,210
Brazil in Rio and we are starting to get

00:18:14,669 --> 00:18:21,179
together and form their own groups so

00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:23,190
they are start with meetups that easier

00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:26,909
to organize and after some time they

00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:29,370
build their own conferences or workshop

00:18:26,909 --> 00:18:31,850
and this is how we want to grow and this

00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:36,270
is the future that we are seeing now but

00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:38,610
to in the our major goal is to support

00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:40,110
the black people in Brazil to don't face

00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:46,980
these issues that we were seeing in the

00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:49,679
video and a lot of people also ask us

00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:52,890
how to support these kind of events or

00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:55,080
these kind of initiatives you don't have

00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:57,720
to be a black person to support black

00:18:55,080 --> 00:19:00,659
people as at the beginning of this video

00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:03,779
I was not a female to support females

00:19:00,659 --> 00:19:07,260
events so you just need to get there and

00:19:03,779 --> 00:19:11,970
support more people to be able to

00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:14,370
achieve their goals and this is the

00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:15,960
major goal to help people and support

00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:17,880
each other that's what we should do

00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:23,340
especially when you see such high

00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:25,770
inequality in these fields so my name is

00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:27,450
felipe de mirage and this was a forum

00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:34,979
item thank you

00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:34,979
[Applause]

00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:44,470
Thank You Philippa I think Philippe may

00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:47,140
be the visitor who traveled the farthest

00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:49,990
possibly out of everybody here because

00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:51,730
he traveled all the way from Brazil so

00:19:49,990 --> 00:20:01,030
it's really special to have you here

00:19:51,730 --> 00:20:04,390
thank you so much yeah and it's amazing

00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:08,680
to see this connection between Africa

00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:11,020
and Brazil through technology we give

00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:14,230
the slides on please bow s tisson

00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:16,630
connection here is it ok well Felipe

00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:19,180
would like to answer some questions so

00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:20,380
if you have a question to ask please

00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:22,560
raise your hand and we'll pass you the

00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,560
microphone

00:20:29,419 --> 00:20:37,109
excellent or the rock presentation as

00:20:34,489 --> 00:20:40,259
winning the microwave has to question

00:20:37,109 --> 00:20:50,999
the first one being you look so fresh

00:20:40,259 --> 00:20:53,249
did you bring the t-shirt a lot of

00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:54,869
people were the teacher yeah what we

00:20:53,249 --> 00:20:57,690
usually do we give the teachers for

00:20:54,869 --> 00:21:00,509
people that have in the events so if we

00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:04,559
have an event like a 4.0 here we could

00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:07,739
have a t-shirt as well very interesting

00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:10,559
point is the least part of the t-shirt

00:21:07,739 --> 00:21:14,849
it comes from Mozambique is that always

00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:16,379
Satan forgive we have a friend that was

00:21:14,849 --> 00:21:19,469
important like at the moment that we

00:21:16,379 --> 00:21:22,200
were uniting she had some capital as for

00:21:19,469 --> 00:21:23,249
us so we made these tails in the t-shirt

00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:26,729
okay

00:21:23,249 --> 00:21:30,299
and I'd like to know since you are doing

00:21:26,729 --> 00:21:33,320
this division

00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:37,019
what was the most I mean challenging

00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:41,749
moment for your life is there some

00:21:37,019 --> 00:21:41,749
moment when he was like okay I'd like to

00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:54,690
the beginning was really tough because

00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:58,170
we have to do everything from the front

00:21:54,690 --> 00:22:01,200
from the beginning like we have to come

00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:03,930
up with a tutorial with a website social

00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,730
networks a lot of stuff and at the

00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:10,530
moment that we were coming up with all

00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:13,230
of this there was a lot of haters people

00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:15,000
that didn't like the initiative so one

00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:16,590
of the very first thing that we when we

00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,080
created the Facebook anyway and after

00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:22,560
that we were going to have a workshop

00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:24,420
for black people a lot of haters came in

00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:27,510
the our social networks to say who

00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:29,520
should we have also even just for white

00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:32,130
people as you are doing just for black

00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:34,980
people so this was one thing that was

00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:37,770
really challenging because we were like

00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:40,350
are we in the right path that's why we

00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:42,810
started thinking about our achievements

00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:45,480
and detective were in the right path or

00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:47,610
not and at the end of the day we

00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:50,640
realized that we were in the right path

00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:52,640
and we achieved it Richard a lot of

00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,130
people that were facing a lot of issues

00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,610
related to racism

00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:57,610
like this

00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:16,090
hi Philippe so towards the end of your

00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:20,980
talk you mentioned supports in alpha

00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:24,460
beta do you have specific ways people

00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:32,830
are not impress you can support and help

00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:36,090
how about support from people that are

00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:39,790
not trouble do we have a github where we

00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:44,350
will we see some cool press for example

00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:46,480
our website is on github so a lot of

00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:49,840
people came through it helped to support

00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:52,630
us with code or the commutation or

00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:55,270
improving our tutorial so our tutorial

00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:57,220
is also on github it sounds all import

00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:58,810
is right now but there is a lot of

00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:02,950
people that want to translate it for a

00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:05,290
different language like Spanish or

00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:09,100
English or any other letters are welcome

00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:12,340
especially because we designed the event

00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:17,500
for all of these events that we that we

00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:19,030
shared here are free so anyone that find

00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:21,580
formative the event have to pay for

00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:25,480
anything with the part a lot of people

00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:28,090
that come from far away to get like uber

00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:32,350
or any kind of stress part to to come

00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:34,060
here come to the events we also change

00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:37,150
the tutorial in a way that the person

00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:40,510
doesn't need to have a computer so you

00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:43,600
usually do it in universities or later

00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:46,030
times there are computers or informatics

00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:50,820
lab so the people can just come with

00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:50,820
their hands and learn how to program

00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:58,440
if they have access to Internet in their

00:24:56,310 --> 00:25:01,320
computer they are able to continue their

00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:05,220
tutorial because we use a web

00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:07,920
environment we have fewer pen during the

00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:09,750
history of the tutorial but right now we

00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:13,640
are using one called

00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:17,370
code Fe that you can program online

00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:18,930
platform so you don't have to have your

00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:21,660
own computer and bring it to the

00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:22,560
tutorial and so go back to home and keep

00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:24,540
it working

00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:26,880
we also have the trainers because we

00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:29,180
have a common environment for everyone

00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,110
so if you have an issue it's easier to

00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:36,170
understand what's going on and how to

00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:36,170
solve it does it answer your question

00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:45,830
hello I forgive you

00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:50,340
oh yeah thank you called great talk I

00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:54,720
just wanted to ask how do you manage to

00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:58,410
get sponsorship if you get a need to

00:25:54,720 --> 00:26:03,500
cover the cost then the second question

00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:09,650
is program is an everyday event and

00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:12,990
assume most black people come from

00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:17,010
underprivileged communities in in

00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:21,180
Brussels how are you able to cater for

00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:25,110
those that don't have internet access if

00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:25,940
they're in are you able to help them a

00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:30,870
lot

00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:33,840
how do you deal with them can you repeat

00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:36,540
the first question our first person are

00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:40,800
asking your funding process okay it's a

00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:43,490
shitty so a lot of people want to work

00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:46,680
with that I like this a lot

00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:48,600
one second and not a lot of people but a

00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:51,420
lot of companies who want to be diverse

00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:54,270
so they usually when we think about

00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:56,580
diversity we think about women and ID

00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:59,760
but there is a lot of other aspect of

00:26:56,580 --> 00:27:02,580
diversity and be inclusive that we are

00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:05,430
not thinking so when we think about

00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:07,020
black people embrace you there is

00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:07,900
nothing similar I know that there is

00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:12,040
something you

00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:13,780
about like the world I need to program

00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:16,570
and this kind of stuff but in Brazil

00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:21,460
there was nothing similar so when we

00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:24,190
talk about diversity in acting a

00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:26,170
clinical perspective usually we think

00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:30,760
about after my turn now

00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:33,580
so this was a very important point so

00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:36,310
that's why they came to us or when we

00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:40,090
came to van they were open and want to

00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:43,660
help us and about the second question

00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:45,930
about the people that are more far away

00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:49,000
that doesn't have access to Internet

00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:51,820
that's a limitation that we have

00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:56,370
usually when we defeat the person comes

00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:59,920
and we are able to help and learn some

00:27:56,370 --> 00:28:02,800
programming it's very hard because we

00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:06,250
don't have a lot of power to change

00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:09,640
their environment or their home so

00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:12,010
that's that's hard but we are not able

00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:18,490
to help very much in this secret in

00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:22,050
these cases and thank you and there is

00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:22,050
more cultures here in here

00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:28,710
so I was just closing hey so I would

00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:30,570
like to ask you regarding to this

00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:33,360
previous question I think have you

00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:36,390
thought of working with some

00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:39,210
organizations like that people would

00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:41,970
donate money and then you would have

00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:45,030
hardware and maybe Internet and give to

00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:48,330
people to continue learning and also

00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:51,330
some ideas with some boot camps or

00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:53,550
things they could do - because I my

00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:56,730
experience is that you start and then

00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:58,559
it's a year of process with learning

00:28:56,730 --> 00:29:15,809
learning learning or longer if you

00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:18,480
cannot do it full-time to say okay so

00:29:15,809 --> 00:29:21,870
the point that we share the first about

00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:26,520
take longer it's not full-time it's very

00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:30,330
hard I have a dream about this project

00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:33,870
is in my dream it will be something like

00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:37,710
a boot camp where people can get in with

00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:40,020
no experience and come out with a job so

00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:43,620
this would be the best experience for me

00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:47,600
in my my dream but for now we don't have

00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:47,600
this power or two

00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:51,170
these people in this way

00:29:52,299 --> 00:29:58,809
all right Felipe thank you once more I

00:29:55,769 --> 00:30:02,909
really appreciate the passion you put it

00:29:58,809 --> 00:30:07,119
into this what I want to ask a question

00:30:02,909 --> 00:30:10,029
the students of who bite on and is

00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:12,119
trying to talk about relaxed coding and

00:30:10,029 --> 00:30:17,229
programming and stuff

00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:19,359
is it just for people that write a

00:30:17,229 --> 00:30:21,159
Python blocks all right and fight

00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:23,169
because I know the other plug we bought

00:30:21,159 --> 00:30:25,929
that to order programming or a

00:30:23,169 --> 00:30:28,719
technology stuff so I'll just be cool

00:30:25,929 --> 00:30:37,869
like you cooperated what you're doing or

00:30:28,719 --> 00:30:41,529
it's just black zoo technology that we

00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:45,459
were using to most of the people that

00:30:41,529 --> 00:30:50,559
work or help us doesn't know Python

00:30:45,459 --> 00:30:53,589
itself just for the tutorial and we have

00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:56,649
some programming experience tone it's

00:30:53,589 --> 00:31:00,309
not that hard for them so we just come

00:30:56,649 --> 00:31:02,769
in collaborate so it's not for just for

00:31:00,309 --> 00:31:05,729
people that are able to write bite or no

00:31:02,769 --> 00:31:09,779
fighter for anyone that work to help

00:31:05,729 --> 00:31:09,779
black people get better

00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:25,510
anyone else still be shy raise your hand

00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:30,909
so I can see think about it I would like

00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:33,760
to ask a question also you talk about

00:31:30,909 --> 00:31:37,570
black activism in a very political way

00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:40,630
and the technology community often is

00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:43,440
not political at all

00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:45,850
or they're political in very

00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:49,860
non-confrontational ways they want to be

00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:49,860
inclusive and so on and

00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:58,029
do you feel that people are too afraid

00:31:55,059 --> 00:31:59,580
of being political in the technology

00:31:58,029 --> 00:32:04,240
community do you think they should be

00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:05,679
there to be more political I believe

00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,779
that there are a lot of ways to be

00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:10,419
political especially when we talk about

00:32:07,779 --> 00:32:14,620
technology for example the mustafa

00:32:10,419 --> 00:32:17,860
talked about use AI for a lot of very

00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:24,490
good social things with a political way

00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:26,799
to use technology as well so I'm not

00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:29,909
sure if they are afraid it just me that

00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:32,730
we may not have realized how to be

00:32:29,909 --> 00:32:37,240
political and use the technology for

00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:41,830
improve people's life people life I want

00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:43,690
to ask one more thing if I make can your

00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:47,500
program how'd you see it being exported

00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:52,620
out of Brazil to other countries where

00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:55,210
there are also large populations of

00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:57,059
people who are not white not necessarily

00:32:55,210 --> 00:33:00,100
black but people who are not white and

00:32:57,059 --> 00:33:04,110
maybe have less power or less economic

00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:05,860
advantage than the ones who are in power

00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:08,799
because there are many parts of the

00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:12,970
world which are like that the way that I

00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:14,830
can imagine it growing it like general

00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:17,289
girls when we have it in a lot of

00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:20,919
different theories like we just have

00:33:17,289 --> 00:33:23,950
here so the PSF is very important for us

00:33:20,919 --> 00:33:27,159
to be able to do this because when we

00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:28,110
have u.s. dollars if it gets very easier

00:33:27,159 --> 00:33:31,169
to

00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:34,610
set up the event so we just need to

00:33:31,169 --> 00:33:37,200
bring people and get the volunteers so I

00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:39,390
feel it growing very similar if German

00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,820
girls and people get motivated in one

00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:46,789
city and they get support to do this and

00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:46,789
the BFF is a very key element in this

00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,540
