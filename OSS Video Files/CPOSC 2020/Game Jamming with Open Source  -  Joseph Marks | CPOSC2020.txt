joe is a software engineer based here in

00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,240
lancaster pennsylvania

00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,559
he develops websites and web

00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,559
applications for the restaurant store

00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:15,679
using various programming languages and

00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:17,760
technologies

00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,000
he also enjoys making small and weird

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,720
games and frequently participates in

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,160
game jam

00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,760
so uh joe i'm hoping you'll talk a

00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,359
little bit about the weird games i'm

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,439
interested to hear

00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,400
what that's all about so folks let's

00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,279
give joe

00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,160
welcome take it away joe all right thank

00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,920
you

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,920
for the lightning box

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,000
thank you um so i actually uh two years

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,960
ago at cpas guy gave a similar

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,320
talk as um about this topic and that's

00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,200
kind of what made me want to do the talk

00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,680
because i got a lot of

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,719
feedback from that so um if you put

00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,399
similar lighting talk

00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,000
now it might be a real talk in the

00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,239
future um

00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,160
so as charlie mentioned i'm a software

00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:03,280
engineer for the restaurant store um

00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:06,960
and i am a hobbyist game developer um

00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,960
my first game it's hard to pinpoint when

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,799
my first game was i

00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,159
in college i started making weird uh

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,520
little games of css and javascript but

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,439
i would consider the first game i made

00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,840
with stazer to be the first game that i

00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,720
made

00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,080
around easter 2014 i made a game where

00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,640
you would play as a

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,080
rabbit and collect easter easter eggs

00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,280
and avoid a lawnmower and then i made a

00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,640
game where you were a lawnmower and you

00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,079
had to avoid rocks

00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,079
and then shortly after that i

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:35,439
participated in my first game jam

00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:39,200
which was ludum there in 2014

00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:40,400
so i will be showing you some stuff with

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,840
phaser today and that

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,399
so hopefully you can kind of experiment

00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,920
with that

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,439
tool or other tools maybe and make your

00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,880
first game jam if you haven't

00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,960
made your first game or participating

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,119
first game game if you haven't already

00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:56,079
so i have my slides up here and i'll go

00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:57,920
ahead and start going through them

00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:00,159
so uh the first question is to ask uh

00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,520
what is a game jam specifically

00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,520
there are lots of definitions for what a

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,600
game jam is but i like this definition

00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,119
from kultema anakesa

00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,200
in a paper that she wrote called

00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,800
defining game jams uh

00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,319
it just says a game jam is an

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,760
accelerated opportunistic

00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,520
game creation event in which

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,280
participants create a game in a

00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,239
relatively short time frame exploring

00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,760
given design

00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,680
constraints with the end results shared

00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,920
publicly i think that's a good uh

00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,040
summary of what a game jam is uh some

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,280
game jams don't have

00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,319
restraints some game jams are not in a

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,080
short time frame

00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,599
some game jams do not have the results

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,480
shared publicly so that's not always the

00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,160
case but

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,840
i think in its simplest form of game jam

00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,840
is an event to where you make a game

00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,959
um as i mentioned many game jams have

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,400
restrictions and here's a list of a few

00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,480
of the different common restrictions

00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,840
there are sometimes you're restricted in

00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,360
the screen size you have

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,239
one game jam you have to make a game

00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:55,360
that is in 64 by 64 pixels

00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,879
um some game jams have restricted color

00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,519
palettes or it has to be in black and

00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,879
white

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:03,920
um the game boy game jam actually

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:05,599
covers both of those inside in terms of

00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,959
pixel restrictions and color palette

00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,560
restrictions because if you

00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,480
remember the old game boy you had that

00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:14,000
grayscale color palette so

00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:17,599
a lot of people make games that try to

00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,120
stick true to that style controls is

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,879
another restriction that is often used

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,400
sometimes you have to have a touch

00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,319
screen based game or

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,799
a game where you only have one button

00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:28,400
that you can use

00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,560
some game jams restrict you to a

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,480
specific engine this is often used as a

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,599
kind of a marketing uh

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,040
strategy for newer or less popular game

00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,319
engines for example

00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,440
one of the game engines i'll talk about

00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:43,360
is libgdx and that is a

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,879
a free open source game engine where

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,400
they had a lib gdx game

00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,000
game jam where the purpose was to use

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,080
their engine to make a game and then

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,840
they had a contest and prizes actually

00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,040
for that

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,040
so um

00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,720
themes and restrictions are fun because

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,959
they

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:04,239
forced you to be creative and make

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:07,599
things outside of your comfort zone

00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:10,000
uh we did a game jam at uh with a

00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,720
group of co-workers an unofficial game

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,959
jam where

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,760
our purpose was to learn unity and we

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,760
actually

00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,359
all decided to do a game jam and submit

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,400
games for this and i was the only one

00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:19,840
that actually ended up submitting

00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,440
anything but it was a nice opportunity

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,880
to try to learn unity a little more

00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,160
than i had used previously because i had

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:29,759
only once before that time

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:32,639
and i back to the list

00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,320
um another restriction is genres

00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,880
sometimes you have to make a specific

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,880
genre like a first person shooter or a

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,800
puzzle game

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,000
time limits is another big restriction

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,360
that many game jams have

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,680
most game jams are a common restriction

00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,160
is

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,919
a two-day game jam a 48-hour game jam

00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,080
led air is one of those that

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:54,080
has a 48-hour and 72-hour version of the

00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,680
game jam

00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,120
many other game jams are a week long or

00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,520
a month long or longer

00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,120
there's actually a ongoing game jam

00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,479
called the decade jam which

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,160
you can submit a game as long as you

00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,240
make it sometime within

00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,759
the time frame between 20 20 and 20 30.

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,680
so there's

00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,199
a lot of variation to these restrictions

00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,639
and sometimes there's no restrictions at

00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,080
all

00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,240
and the last kind of restriction is

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,960
themes many game jams have themes which

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,600
can be a

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,199
a noun or a phrase that you have to

00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,400
adhere to

00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,080
and i'll actually show you a couple of

00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,759
these that i've made games for in the

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,280
past sometimes these themes are total

00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,800
and sometimes they're

00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,639
just decided by the people who run the

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,800
jams and they're often not revealed

00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,160
until the game jam starts

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,840
so i'll show you a couple themes that

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,120
game jams have had previously that i've

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,639
made games for

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,600
and you can see one of a couple of the

00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,600
weird games that i've made

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
so uh this was for one of the ludum dare

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,759
game jam events the theme was combine

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,639
two incompatible genres

00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,720
i made a simple uh breakout clone mixed

00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,759
with a farming sim like harvest moon or

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,919
stardew valley

00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,600
so you just move the paddle around and

00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,520
you bounce the ball on the

00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,120
blocks and you can change your tool to

00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,000
water and can scythe

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,840
hoe pickaxe or seeds and then you have

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,720
to plant crops and then harvest them to

00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,720
move up the levels

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,319
so that was the game that i made using

00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,840
combined two incompatible genres

00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,120
um and you can actually go back and look

00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,400
at these if you're curious what other

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,440
people made that's one of the fun things

00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,680
about game jams

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,800
is to see the different interpretations

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,240
of the theme

00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,479
um and see what other people came up

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,479
with

00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,160
the second example for a theme for a

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,360
game jam is keep it alive

00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,800
um this one i tried to think outside the

00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,560
box a little bit because i figured a lot

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,600
of people would be making a game where

00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,560
you have to keep a pet

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,240
or a plant or a child alive so i went

00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,400
with fire because i thought maybe

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,080
less people would be using that uh

00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,720
concept so i created a falling block

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,639
game

00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,280
where you have to drop wood down onto a

00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,840
fire to keep it burning uh the water

00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,360
uh pieces will extinguish the fire of

00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,880
all the pieces directly below it so

00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,080
you have to place them strategically and

00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,960
keep the fire burning as long as

00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,120
possible

00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,720
so those are two james james games that

00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,840
i've made using the themes that

00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,160
are here and you can kind of see how

00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:07,919
people interpret the themes and

00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,280
make a game from them so

00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,199
the second biggest question about game

00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,440
jams besides what it is is why should

00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,599
you do a game jam

00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,880
i think one of the biggest reasons to

00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,560
especially for developers that are

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,919
trying to hone their skills is to learn

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,639
and practice a new skill or programming

00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,560
language

00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,960
i've used many different languages and

00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,479
engines because i like to try to

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,280
learn something new every time and do a

00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:31,280
game jam so this is one of the

00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,960
best and funnest ways to learn a new

00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:36,160
language or engine

00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:39,199
is to try to make something in a given

00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,199
constraint using that engine

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,319
the second reason i have listed is to

00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,000
prototype ideas

00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,520
if you're not really if you want to make

00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,319
a game but you're not really sure where

00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,000
to start

00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,400
game jams are a nice way to kind of put

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,720
you in a box so you can kind of

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,039
you have to think creatively about what

00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,639
kind of game you're going to make and

00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,800
maybe prototype a few different ideas

00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,879
and get some feedback on it

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,479
one thing that i've seen is many game

00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,400
development companies will have internal

00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,840
game jams where their employees will

00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,680
make prototypes and they'll kind of have

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,039
a competition and then sometimes those

00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,520
prototypes end up being

00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:15,360
completed games and some of the the game

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,720
jam games that end up becoming published

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,840
are often made in these kind of

00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:22,560
prototyping game jam events

00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,919
another very beneficial reason to

00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,240
participate in the game jam is to

00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:29,199
connect with other game developers

00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,000
many game jams have forums and community

00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,599
pages so

00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,399
during the course of the jam you can

00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:36,479
share your progress a lot of game jams

00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,000
also have active

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,680
a lot of activity on twitter if you

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,599
follow a hashtag for a specific

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,000
game jam you can see what other people

00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,839
are making and how they're progressing

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,519
their game being made in front of you uh

00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,399
some people also do time lapses for game

00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,320
jam so you can

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,760
you can watch them or they'll stream

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,080
their development

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,360
uh not true made minecraft has

00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,080
participated in game jams in the past

00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,120
where he was just

00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,399
streaming his progress even if you're

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,920
not participating in game jam if you

00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,360
know game jam is going on it's a lot of

00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,640
fun to kind of look at those hashtags

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,839
and see what people are making for those

00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,040
game jams

00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,560
sometimes when there's a game jam that

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,920
i'm too busy to participate in i'll

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,320
often follow along to see what people

00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,320
are making

00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,720
um the biggest one for me is to express

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,320
yourself creatively i'm not

00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,839
an artist or a musician or poet or

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,680
anything but i feel like i can

00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,360
kind of make something express myself

00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,040
when i make a game because

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,399
i feel like i can share something i make

00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,680
with other people and i get positive

00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,880
feedback from it so

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,120
that's the biggest reason for me

00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,640
personally is to kind of make something

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:36,240
to express myself

00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:38,240
because games are art a form of art

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,600
and then lastly just to have fun i game

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,040
jams can be stressful especially when

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,080
you're approaching a deadline

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,680
but it is a lot of fun to make games and

00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,440
don't stress too much about it if you

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,360
submit a impartial game

00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,279
or a partial game or an unfinished game

00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,800
because really it doesn't matter

00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,560
about the end result doesn't matter as

00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,200
much as the process that you used to get

00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,519
there

00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,880
so those are some of the main reasons to

00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,360
participate in game jams i'm sure there

00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,240
are more

00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,880
those are the ones that i i've uh

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,839
personally

00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,839
think are the most important

00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,800
uh i'll quickly go over a few noteworthy

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:13,360
game jams

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,560
i mentioned uh let him there lavender is

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,079
hard to pronounce i think some people

00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,560
call it let him there some people call

00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:20,320
it ludum dare it's from the latin

00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,920
meaning to give a game

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,519
it is one of the most popular game jams

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,240
and one of the oldest it was

00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,680
originally run in 2002 it used to be run

00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,040
three times a year but now they do it in

00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,279
april october

00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,040
they have a different start time in both

00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,720
of those based on time zones because it

00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,720
is an international game jam so

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,640
they don't want to make it uh too

00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,440
centric to the western hemisphere where

00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:43,040
the the deadline is when people are

00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,399
asleep or anything like that so

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,079
it's a recent change where they'll have

00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,519
it where the deadline is different for

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,120
those two ones so that people all over

00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,320
the world can have kind of a fair shot

00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,000
at when they submit it or when the game

00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:55,279
jam starts

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,040
um london there is one that has a theme

00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,079
every year it's voted upon in the weeks

00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,720
leading up to the jam

00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,279
and it's revealed at 9 00 p.m or 6 p.m

00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,839
on

00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,320
the the friday night of the jam they're

00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,320
usually

00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,079
uh they always start on fridays and

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,760
there's two variations there's the jam

00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:12,560
and the compo

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,079
the jam is you're allowed to work in

00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,600
teams you're allowed to use pre-made

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,920
assets as long as they're

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,600
free or they belong to you and you have

00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,440
three days to complete your game

00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,640
for the compo it's a little more strict

00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,800
you have to work solo

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,720
you can only use assets that you make in

00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,680
the 48 hours and

00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,120
it is 48 hours long so you have sat from

00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,680
friday night until sunday night to

00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,680
submit your game

00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,920
another popular one is seven day fps it

00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,519
started out as a game jam where you have

00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,160
to make a first person shooter in seven

00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,160
days

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,920
but it's been tweaked since then to just

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,640
be any first person game

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,240
besides first person in seven days there

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,920
are no rules for it

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,920
uh this one runs a little more

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,880
sporadically it's ran in 2012

00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,240
13 14 18 and 20. there's actually an

00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,440
iteration of this running right now i'm

00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,560
not participating in it but it is

00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,880
running right now if

00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,160
you are if you know how to make fps or

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,279
if you want to try to make an fps in

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,800
seven days you can

00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,639
you have until the 13th to do so and

00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:12,160
submit it for this 7 day fps game

00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:12,160
so there's one that's running right now

00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,839
lowrise jam is one of my favorites uh

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:21,279
the main requirement is that has to be a

00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:23,200
game that is 64 by 64 pixels

00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,720
or lower and it usually lasts about two

00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,760
weeks it's been running every year since

00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,320
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,920
and there are optional themes uh on the

00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,959
bottom left you can see one game i made

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,560
there

00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,720
you just throw bowls of curry at

00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,560
walruses and the walruses will chip away

00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,920
at the ice and each level you get

00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,920
more ice but you have to destroy all the

00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,440
walruses so it's

00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:45,440
just kind of a weird little game i made

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,440
for 64 by 64 pixels

00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,240
besides those there are lots of other

00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,839
game jams here are some highlights of

00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,680
game jams that i've participated in or

00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:56,480
been interested in participating

00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,760
um uh you can obviously check out this

00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,120
when it's recorded and

00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,639
research these yourself in the future

00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,920
but they're these are some of the ones

00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,680
that i think are pretty cool some of

00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:07,200
these i have participated in such as

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:10,480
the game bytes cover and resist jam

00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:13,440
and beyond that there's even more uh if

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,440
you're familiar with h.i.o it's a

00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,160
marketplace for indie games and

00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:20,240
other stuff it has a fully featured game

00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:23,200
jam system where you can create

00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,200
and run game jams you can have voting on

00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,760
game jams message boards for game jams

00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,120
and

00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,639
on the screenshot here you can see a

00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,600
calendar of all the game jams that are

00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,040
happening right now

00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,120
and this will actually if you scroll

00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,399
down there's more game jams below this

00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,360
so there's always a game jam going on

00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,720
that you can participate

00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,079
in you can see the seven day fps game

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,000
jam is on here

00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:44,079
and proc jam which was in the last slide

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,079
is on there as well

00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:48,000
so if you go here you can see which game

00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:49,920
jams are running currently if you're

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,560
if you want to participate in game jamma

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,560
that's happening

00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,880
some game jam games are later released

00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,519
as full titles here are

00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,800
three that i selected uh celeste was

00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,920
made as a p28

00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:05,920
game for a game jam super hot was

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,720
actually created originally for

00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,320
7 day fps which i mentioned and goat

00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,680
simulator i don't remember which game

00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,880
jam that was created as a part of but

00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,959
that is also

00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,000
a product of a game gem people will

00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,839
often polish

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,040
their games after they create them for

00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,399
game jams and release them

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,399
especially if they get good feedback

00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,160
that people want a game like this a

00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,680
fully fledged game like this uh people

00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,560
will also often

00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:31,760
release as a full title later on which

00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:34,320
is my goal one day

00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,360
so uh the main thing i wanted to do for

00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,560
this talk is to

00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,839
convince you i don't think they bothered

00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,120
with the polishing for good singing i

00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,560
haven't played that but that makes sense

00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,959
from screenshots that i've seen

00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:47,279
um games don't have to be polished

00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,720
that's i like weird games that

00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:50,399
i i don't mind if the game isn't

00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,519
polished personally

00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:55,199
um so the one thing i wanted to

00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:58,000
the one takeaway i wanted to give people

00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:59,600
from this talk is that you can make

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,760
a game you can participate in a game jam

00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,720
so if you have participated in game jam

00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,600
then this is

00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,959
not your first obviously but uh i'm sure

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,079
the majority of you this might be your

00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,720
first game jam if you

00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:12,399
decide to do one so i will show you some

00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:16,320
tools that you can use to

00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,320
make a game relatively easily

00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,320
uh the first thing you should do when

00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:23,040
you're doing a game jam is to brainstorm

00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,560
uh i think pencil and paper is best

00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,720
don't jump into the code right away

00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,000
just kind of sketch out ideas and and

00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,199
think about it spend some time thinking

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,040
about it typically

00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:32,959
i spend at least an hour to sometimes

00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,240
for let them there i go to bed before i

00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:36,959
write a single line of code

00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,560
and actually before i fall asleep i'll

00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,600
be seeing games in my in my head just

00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,959
thinking about what kind of game i want

00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,959
to make and then in the morning

00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:44,639
i'll think which idea i think i can do

00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:47,360
in the weekend or which one i like the

00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:49,600
most and go for it

00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,399
one piece of advice i have is to throw

00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,720
out your first

00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,759
idea and maybe your second idea because

00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,839
it's very likely

00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:57,279
especially if there's a theme that your

00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,720
first idea is also

00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,480
the first idea of many other people

00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,079
especially if it's popular game jam

00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,600
so you don't have to do that but if you

00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,480
want your game jam if you want your game

00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,519
to stand out

00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:09,120
i recommend going

00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,800
thinking more than just the first idea

00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,160
that pops in your head

00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,800
but it is good to have backups just in

00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,320
case you end up a few hours in you

00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,160
you think your game isn't fun or it's

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,519
just not working out uh it's good to

00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,639
have backups to go to

00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,839
that way you can still participate in

00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,839
the game jam

00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,199
as i mentioned think outside the box

00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,079
with these game jams you want your game

00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,480
to stand out

00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:34,959
usually unless you really want to make

00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,800
it like a zelda clone or a mario clone

00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:38,079
or angry birds clone or something like

00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,120
that typically you want to make

00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:40,800
something unique

00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,600
and it's best to think outside of the

00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,120
box and try to to think

00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,440
about ideas that other people might not

00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:50,480
be thinking about so that your game gets

00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:53,440
more attention or people

00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:55,120
gravitate more to your towards your game

00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,680
especially if it's like a ranked or

00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,160
uh a game jam where there's voting

00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,839
involved

00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,000
uh you you don't want your game to look

00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:05,600
like 20 other games or look like a clone

00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:08,000
of something else

00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:10,480
after you pick an idea then you start

00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,799
the process of prototyping it

00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,480
i recommend referencing previous code or

00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,760
tutorials because

00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,319
especially if there's a time constraint

00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,919
you don't want to reinvent the wheel

00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,439
you you don't want to waste a lot of

00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,919
time trying to get something to work if

00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,400
a

00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,480
engine already has gravity or physics

00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,400
involved

00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,679
if it's your first game game jam there's

00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,200
nothing wrong with

00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,120
starting with a tutorial and kind of

00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,640
working off of that but just be sure

00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,440
that you you're submitting code that you

00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,440
wrote yourself

00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,760
you can use it as a basis to learn but

00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,640
don't like edit the tutorial file and

00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,559
submit it with

00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,480
some re-skinning or anything like that

00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:46,960
that's typically that's not a good idea

00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,280
in most game jam it's just straight not

00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,280
allowed

00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,360
and try not to take too long with

00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,559
prototyping one of the other pieces of

00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,559
advice i have is

00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:58,000
especially in a game jam with a short

00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:59,520
time frame

00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,120
for example with ludum there which has

00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,120
two day time frame try to have your

00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,080
prototype like your game complete by the

00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,480
end of the first day

00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,919
like in its simplest form uh and

00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,840
actually i'll jump the next

00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,760
slide because that's what it is create

00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:14,160
your mvp early

00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,120
you want to win condition early as early

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,919
as you can because

00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,200
if you have a complete game then when it

00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:20,559
comes to the deadline you're not

00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,919
scrambling to submit something you're

00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:23,120
not scrambling to finish your game

00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:25,840
you're just

00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,640
polishing it or adding extra levels or

00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,480
maybe

00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,840
tweaking or adding a new enemy type or

00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,200
something like that you don't want to be

00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,200
scrambling to the end of it

00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,400
to try to make your game work you want

00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,360
to get your game to work as

00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,360
early as you can and then

00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:43,919
improve it from there

00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,200
and take advantage of free and open

00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,440
source tools and frameworks like i said

00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,559
don't reinvent the wheel

00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,080
i'll show you frameworks that have

00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,720
gravity that have physics that have

00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,880
sprite

00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:57,200
engines that have 2d 3d

00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,880
there are fully featured engines and

00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,360
libraries that you can use to do these

00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,799
things

00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:04,880
really quickly and almost no one

00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:05,840
writes a game purely from scratch in a

00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,480
game jam

00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:12,160
uh i not almost no one but most people

00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,160
use engines or frameworks to do this

00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,640
and uh especially if there's a time

00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:20,000
constraint you can get stuff up and

00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,000
running really quickly with these tools

00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,200
all right so i'll go over a few gaming

00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,840
engines and frameworks kind of the core

00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,320
building blocks of your game the first

00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,720
one is

00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:33,200
libgdx which is free in open source it's

00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:36,080
widely supported by windows linux mac

00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,679
android ios and web browsers the game

00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,440
code is written in java but there is

00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:42,799
additional support for other languages

00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:45,039
such as scale scala kotlin closure and

00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,480
groovy there's support for 2d and 3d

00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:49,039
games

00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,559
it includes the box 2d or it utilizes

00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:52,720
the box 2d physics engine which i

00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:54,720
believe is also open source

00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,000
and it's pretty uh feature packed

00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,240
especially for an open source game

00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,240
engine

00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,120
um game jam suitable tools for online

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,480
multiplayer i'll i'll take a look at

00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,280
that in a second uh probably towards the

00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,720
end i'm not sure if

00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:10,080
i'll have time to get to it but i can

00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,080
definitely answer after if i need to

00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:14,559
i've participated in four game jams

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,159
using libgdx and

00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:18,240
slay the spire and five nights at

00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:19,600
freddy's are two the android

00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,440
specifically are two games that were

00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:24,880
built in web gx so there are some games

00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,880
out there that were built in libgdx

00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,919
uh phaser is also free in open source it

00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,720
is used primarily for making web-based

00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:32,880
games

00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,960
you can compile to ios and android with

00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,120
it if you use third-party tools

00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,559
uh use javascript to write the games in

00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,559
this engine

00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:42,240
i participated in two game jams using

00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:43,600
this and this is the game engine that

00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,360
i'll show you and this is actually

00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,360
the first game engine that i kind of

00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:49,280
learned to make a full game with

00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,440
it's pretty easy to learn and it is also

00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:54,480
pretty fully featured especially for

00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:56,240
being a javascript game engine framework

00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,559
there's physics built in sprite

00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:01,440
animations tile mapping all that stuff

00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:01,440
is built into phaser

00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,200
unity uh you unity the engine itself is

00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,600
not open source but i believe it does

00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,280
utilize some open source tools uh open

00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,840
source libraries and stuff

00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,640
so i i'm gonna mention because it is

00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,880
worthy of

00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:17,520
using um i'm not only gonna mention open

00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:20,000
source ones but

00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:22,240
it's widely supported windows mac linux

00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,120
android ios web browsers consoles

00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:27,600
streaming devices and more all have a

00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,559
capability to use even to run unity

00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,159
games

00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:33,760
i've participated in two game jams with

00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:35,440
unity uh not my most experienced one but

00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,200
uh and also there's a unity talk after

00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,640
this one at 2 30 today so

00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,159
i recommend if you're interested in game

00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,400
development check out that suit talk as

00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,400
well

00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,039
uh pico 8 is my favorite it's not open

00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,720
source and it's not free

00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,760
but i want to mention it because a lot

00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,400
of the games that i'm going to show you

00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,559
are from

00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,679
pico 8 uh because i really like making

00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:55,440
itunes pique

00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:58,720
it is a game engine and retro virtual

00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:02,080
console limited to 128 by 128 pixels

00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:04,159
16 colors and 4 channel audio output

00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,600
it is not free like i mentioned but it's

00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:08,960
only 15

00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:12,240
you can write code um

00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:15,039
make tile maps sprites music

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,919
all the stuff inside the uh inside the

00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:17,520
engine itself

00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:18,880
which is typically how i do it even

00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:21,360
though it's not ideal because you're

00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,240
basically writing code in a 128x128

00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,200
window

00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,000
but it is kind of fun to do you can make

00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:30,960
games for windows

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,960
mac linux or web browsers and uh

00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:35,039
john flinch ball asked how often do

00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:37,039
participants release source uh

00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:38,960
linum there actually requires that you

00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,799
upload the source code for your game

00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,080
so that is one where this every game

00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,600
that you see for let them there should

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,400
have the source code uploaded not every

00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,480
game jam

00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,520
requires that but many people do upload

00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,000
their source to

00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,000
get lab

00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:56,720
and github get lab atlassian

00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,559
i i forget what the atlassian one is

00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,600
called but a lot of people use source

00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:01,600
control for those so you can

00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,120
you can pretty easily find source code

00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,600
if you uh vape it yes

00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,320
um yeah you can retain copyright and set

00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,000
the license it's

00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,880
you're not giving over any any right to

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,360
your game if you're submitting the

00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,360
source code

00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:15,120
um so for pico 8 uh the game code is

00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,559
written in lua

00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,000
as i mentioned i love pikaway i've

00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,039
participated in five game games using

00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,840
pico eight

00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:23,280
in addition i've just made games for fun

00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,679
in pico8 because i like working on it so

00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,919
much

00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:27,120
so not open source but we're worth

00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,559
mentioning because

00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,320
hopefully the open source ones can kind

00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:33,120
of pique your interest into these these

00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,120
other engines as well

00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:37,520
all right i am doing decent on time so

00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,440
i'm going to

00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,600
go out of here and show you an example

00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:44,240
game that we are

00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,520
going to go through with phaser this is

00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,120
adapted from the

00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,640
uh the example game on the phaser

00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,880
website um

00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,960
it's pretty different but i did start

00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,799
from that as the basis just because

00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,400
you guys anyone who's watching this talk

00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:58,080
can go there and look at that and

00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,360
work through the example game and kind

00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,720
of get a feeling for what you can do

00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,000
with phaser so i figured it would be

00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,360
useful to show

00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:08,960
that as the basis so i'm going to

00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:12,480
get out of here and go

00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:14,080
here and here so don't uh judge me for

00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,679
my unregistered sublime

00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,720
i installed that yesterday because i

00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,400
realized i didn't have a good text

00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:22,080
editor on here

00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:23,279
so to uh work with phaser you need to

00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,919
have a web server running on your

00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:27,440
computer

00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:31,440
i am using mamp which is

00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:33,919
mac apache mysql php

00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,120
it's free and you can just run a web

00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:38,320
server really easily

00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:39,679
so if you are using a mac you can use

00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,400
amber if you're using windows you can

00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:44,799
use wamp or anything else to get a web

00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:48,400
server running on your computer

00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:49,679
and here is the page for my game

00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,640
just this little block right here

00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:55,279
because i removed a bunch of stuff

00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,039
this is the file um you can have

00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:59,120
multiple files multiple classes but for

00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:02,159
simplicity this is just one file

00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:05,760
everything's in here i'm importing the

00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:05,760
phaser code from a cdn

00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,919
i am configuring the game here there are

00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:11,440
some

00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:13,440
boilerplate stuff for this game i'm

00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:16,400
going to make the width of the game

00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:18,880
a little bit bigger so we can see what

00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:22,000
that looks like

00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,440
so that's 500 by 500

00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,520
there's some default physics engines

00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,880
here this uses the arcade physics there

00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,720
are other options to use here but i'm

00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,640
going to use the arcade physics

00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:34,720
you can set the gravity set debug to

00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:37,440
show some useful debugging displays

00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:40,400
and just some basic stuff there some

00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:42,080
basic variables declared

00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,600
because i was tight on time when i was

00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,440
practicing this i'm gonna

00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,799
go through this a little quickly but um

00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,880
i will make this available after the

00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:50,720
talk

00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,559
um and also i'm not doing live coding

00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,559
because i'm not i'm

00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:55,679
i'm not interested in that today but i

00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:58,400
am gonna do

00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:59,760
live uncommenting so all this code is

00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,679
written previously but i'm going to kind

00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,279
of uncomment stuff as i go through

00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:05,039
to show you what it would look like if

00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:07,760
you incrementally create a game from

00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:08,720
scratch in phaser so the first thing i'm

00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,200
going to do is i'm going to

00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,960
uncomment this player object so we're

00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,679
just adding to the physics of the game

00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,720
we're adding the sprite which is this

00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:21,360
here

00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:24,400
which is this guy here

00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:26,799
um i made this sprite myself but the

00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,400
original sprite for the game is this

00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:28,960
this is the sprite that came with phaser

00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,400
but

00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,400
i made my own sprite here

00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:39,440
so if i don't load the sprite

00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:41,440
then we have this object that

00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:44,080
should fall from the sky but i think i

00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,080
need to add

00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:53,840
rounds and

00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:02,000
so there's the object right there so

00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:02,640
there's no image uh collide world bounds

00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,120
will make it

00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:07,600
bump into the physics of the world bound

00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:11,360
which i set

00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:13,840
up here so i can't do anything with it

00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:16,159
but there's my player object right there

00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,600
so if i uncomment this this will load

00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:19,360
the spreadsheet for

00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,640
the player which i showed you in the

00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,000
file browser

00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,919
it has the frame width and the frame

00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,200
height for the player so it's right

00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:27,840
there

00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,960
that line is from the debug uh setting

00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,159
we have up here if i uh

00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,600
if i made this fall so we wouldn't see

00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:35,120
those lines and boxes but they're useful

00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:38,240
especially when you're developing

00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:40,720
so i'm gonna go down

00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,600
to well first i'll mention these there's

00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,399
the preload

00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,679
function the create function the update

00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:48,159
function

00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:48,799
and that function which doesn't matter

00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:50,799
yet

00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:52,240
so basically the game loop is you

00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:55,360
initialize everything

00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:57,600
in the preload you are you load the

00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,960
um assets in the preload you initialize

00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,279
everything and create

00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,039
and then in the update is when you have

00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:07,200
your your game loop so

00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:10,559
when the cursor is down right or up

00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:13,520
you will apply these here

00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:16,799
so we're setting the speed of the player

00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:19,360
if you press

00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,360
arrow keys

00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,399
so you can move the player pretty easily

00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:31,840
and i'm going to go ahead and add the

00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,840
animations as well

00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:36,640
so the animations are already loaded

00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:37,279
here this will basically use the sprite

00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,640
sheet

00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:42,960
to work through index 0 through

00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,080
3 if you're running the left work

00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,200
through index five

00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,279
through eight if you're running to the

00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,559
right and then it'll it'll face forward

00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:50,480
if you're not running at all

00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:52,399
so this is the initialization for the

00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,240
animations but they won't do anything

00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:56,720
unless you call them down here

00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,000
so when you're running to the left you

00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,120
play the left animation when you're

00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,880
running to the right you play the right

00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:03,039
animation

00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,200
and if you are not doing anything you

00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:07,600
want to face forward

00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,240
so if we uncomment those then we can

00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:11,440
show you

00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:13,279
how that looks

00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,440
so we're running to the right on the

00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:17,279
left or facing forward

00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,200
so animations you can make them pretty

00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:20,799
complex but this is kind of the basic

00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,679
animation you can have less frames as

00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:23,200
well if you

00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:24,720
or you have more frames you want a more

00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,679
detailed animation but

00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:30,880
uh mine is pretty basic just some some

00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:30,880
minor movement animations

00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:37,520
so i'm i know a professional game

00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,960
developer who has developed in the

00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,480
source quick start editor web server for

00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:43,919
javascript screen today

00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:45,200
javascript game development uh

00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:47,279
yeah you can post a link um that

00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:50,720
actually kind of sounds like this

00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:52,320
phasers for game jams i'll often have

00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:55,279
quick start files that i use too just

00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:56,799
kind of to initialize things quickly

00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:58,720
it's nice to have something that you're

00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:00,559
used to and you can kind of

00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,080
copy from a previous game jam that you

00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:04,080
did and like okay well

00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:08,880
i'm going to leave yeah i can increase

00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:12,559
the box

00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:14,799
um i don't have that i'm not familiar

00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:14,799
with

00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:23,840
anyone know how to increase the font

00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:23,840
size and sublime off hand

00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:33,200
we had a suggestion of control shift

00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,200
plus control command plus

00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,880
there we go okay yeah sorry about that i

00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:39,679
realize that's probably a little small

00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:42,960
with part of the screen showing my face

00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:44,880
okay so and i mentioned

00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:47,200
i'll share this uh somewhere after this

00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,200
as well

00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:52,559
so we were yeah

00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,320
you can share a link to that um i often

00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:56,480
have starter files that i use too but

00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,360
but with a lot of these engines uh there

00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,799
are quick

00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,480
tutorials and quick starts that you can

00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:02,080
use for

00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,679
for any engine uh especially for the

00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,279
first time using just kind of

00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:09,120
take a look at whatever their example

00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:09,120
game is and build from there

00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,559
so i'm going to uncover a few more of

00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:15,440
these things just to show you what

00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:17,600
kind of stuff you can do you can change

00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:20,000
the background color

00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,679
just using the rgb colors here change it

00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,919
to blue

00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,919
maybe

00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,159
unsave it

00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:36,399
yeah there you go um

00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:39,200
so 204 so i'm going to try to speed

00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:39,200
through this a little bit

00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:45,200
i'm going to add so the this example

00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:46,720
game basically you're just going to be

00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,679
collecting stars

00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,080
so i'm going to we already loaded the

00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:53,200
star

00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:57,200
image here i'm going to go down here and

00:31:53,200 --> 00:32:00,640
i'm going to create the stars

00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:03,200
object they're called groups in phaser

00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,399
i'm going to create a star here at 400

00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,679
by 400

00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:10,320
xy coordinates and it will put a star

00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:10,320
on the screen

00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:13,840
so let's start over here but we can't do

00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,320
anything with it yet because it's just

00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,320
an image

00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:22,559
but if i go down here and uncomment this

00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,760
we can add an overlap between the player

00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:25,039
and the stars

00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,880
and when the player and the stars

00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:29,919
overlap with each other it will call the

00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:32,320
function that we have created down here

00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:33,679
so it will disable star body so it'll

00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:36,080
get rid of the star but then we'll also

00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:38,480
want to increase the score

00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:40,240
and score text which i didn't add yet

00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,519
but i'll add the score text here

00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,840
you can display text on the screen

00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:45,039
pretty easily just add text at x y

00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:48,320
coordinates on the screen

00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:52,399
have a default message font size

00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:54,080
colors etc

00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:56,240
so now when we get the star we should be

00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:58,640
able to see the score go up

00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,919
but i don't see the score text there yet

00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,080
nope nothing happened in there

00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:02,080
so

00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:11,840
one second and save again

00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:20,799
there we go so

00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,720
we collect it score goes up star goes

00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:23,919
away so that's the basic

00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,840
um i'm going to jump back to the

00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:27,840
powerpoint now because i want to show

00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:29,679
you some other tools

00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:32,399
we're doing decent on time so i'm going

00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:39,840
to go back to the powerpoint

00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:39,840
which i have somewhere

00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,200
might have lost it

00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:53,840
oh here we go it was full screen

00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:07,840
okay sorry i

00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:07,840
typically don't work with my mac

00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:21,839
now if i do present mode

00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:26,800
okay sorry about that

00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:36,800
okay so we were at the example game

00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:38,720
and now we are at more open source tools

00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,159
so these tools will make it easier to do

00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,960
some of the stuff that i have in this

00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:42,399
game

00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,480
uh the first one i'm going to mention is

00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:45,919
pascal which is a free online editor for

00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,280
animated sprites and pixel art

00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:48,320
this is the one i use most frequently

00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,119
because i don't have to download any

00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,720
software

00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:52,320
and it is made specifically for game

00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:53,119
development so there's tools to make

00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,760
sprite sheets

00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:56,159
and tile sheets um tile sets i should

00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,480
say

00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:00,960
it's open source it's free and it's

00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:02,079
great for making quick art for your game

00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,240
the second tool i'm going to show you is

00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:05,920
called tiled it is also free and open

00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,119
source and it is a general purpose tile

00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,800
map editor

00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:10,240
this is very useful if you're making if

00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:13,440
you're hand making levels or

00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:16,480
uh areas for 2d games you can make

00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:18,000
really you can make platformers and top

00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,599
down games really easily with

00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,599
tiled and it's actually a lot of fun to

00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:22,880
use tiled

00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:25,119
and then we're going to jump back to our

00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:29,520
example game

00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:31,040
i'm gonna take that out of maximization

00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:34,320
and so first i'm going to show you

00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:37,440
pascal which i have here

00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:39,680
so uh this is pascal just some recent

00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:41,680
stuff that i've made but i have

00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:43,440
player here and our tile set here so

00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:47,599
i'll show you

00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:49,280
the player and it's sprite

00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:50,720
so this is all online you don't download

00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,440
any software but there is a download

00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:57,119
option if you want to do it offline

00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:59,760
so there's the different frames for the

00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:01,440
sprite sheet

00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,200
you can see the preview on the right

00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,880
hand side here there's a lot of

00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:07,280
different stuff that you can do in here

00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,079
it's pretty robust for an online

00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:11,119
application

00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:12,800
it's not as robust as photoshop or

00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:14,560
games or anything like that but it is

00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:17,760
really useful to make

00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:21,040
quick games with game jams so this is

00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:24,079
what i use to pull in to create the

00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:27,839
sprites that i use here

00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:30,079
and to use the animations that i have

00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:30,079
here

00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,480
the second thing i want to show you is

00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:35,920
tiled and hide that so tiled is a way to

00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:39,520
create tile maps

00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:40,079
and tile sets really easily it's free

00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,359
open source

00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:44,000
this one is doubt you have to download

00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:45,119
the software tiled is a lot of fun to

00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,359
use

00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:49,040
i'm going to show layer 2 because you

00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:50,400
can have your tile set down here which i

00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,160
created in pascal

00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,079
there's different options you can draw

00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,280
them so you can create a level really

00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:57,040
quickly really easily

00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,280
and the difference between a top-down

00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,400
game and a side-scrolling game is

00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,920
basically gravity

00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,079
if i took away the gravity then i can

00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:07,359
make a top-down game really easily

00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:09,359
in phaser i could do it very quickly

00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:10,640
i have a five minute countdown now so

00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:12,480
i'm going to go ahead and show you what

00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:14,240
i created already for this

00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,640
so this is the tile map that i already

00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:19,680
created it uses the same tile set

00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:22,160
and you can also create object tile maps

00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,800
so this tile map here i'm going to show

00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,880
it

00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:27,040
these are objects that it creates in the

00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:29,200
json file

00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:31,040
and basically you can use this to load

00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,720
specific objects in your game

00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,240
this is what we'll use to load the stars

00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:36,880
so everywhere where i have one of these

00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:39,440
there will be a star

00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:40,960
so if i go back to the game i already

00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:43,200
loaded the tile set in the timelapse

00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:46,320
here

00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:47,280
but if i go down here i can uncomment

00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,760
these

00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:51,760
and we're pulling we're creating the map

00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:53,440
object using tile map we uploaded

00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,280
we're creating tile set using the tiles

00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:58,000
that we uploaded

00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:00,720
we're pulling in that first layer that i

00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,720
i showed you

00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,599
i'm not going to do the star layer yet

00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,240
we're gonna set the collisions for the

00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:09,119
map

00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:10,560
the significance of this is one lines up

00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:13,520
with

00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:15,040
this right here this is cell one two

00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,880
three and four

00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,480
we're not setting collisions for those

00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:22,160
so you can

00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:24,160
make it so that you will fall in

00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:26,000
you will be blocked by this but you can

00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,200
walk through these so this is a nice way

00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,320
to make different

00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,320
blocks do different things

00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:36,640
um these are two other lines that we

00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,640
need for the collisions for the player

00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:41,440
and then if i save that and go back over

00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,440
to the game

00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:48,560
we should have the whole level loaded

00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:49,680
yeah so it's loaded we have the

00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:51,440
collisions there

00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,560
i skipped the head my my plan was to

00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,359
show you me falling through all these

00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,560
blocks but

00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:56,480
we're running low in time so i'm not

00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,880
going to show you that but i can show

00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,200
you

00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,960
oh we can't go over there so we need to

00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:03,280
add the camera

00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:06,400
scroll because this the tile map is

00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:08,720
bigger than the world we created

00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:10,480
so if we uncomment these we're setting

00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:13,440
the bounds for the camera

00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:16,560
960 by 960 is the size of the tile map

00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,560
and we're going to follow the player

00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:29,839
when i go over here it should follow and

00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:29,839
it does

00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:36,370
world is still blocked there

00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:39,420
because i need to increase

00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:39,420
[Applause]

00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:45,680
this

00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,680
i need to increase

00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,079
oh no i know it is i need to get rid of

00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,359
collide world balance because we're not

00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:54,400
collided by the world anymore we're

00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:57,839
collided by the

00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,839
level we created

00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:02,640
so now i should be able to go further

00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:08,160
so now we're going to quickly try to add

00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,079
these stars we're going to load the

00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:12,319
object layer which we created in

00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:14,079
tiled it's in the same json file that we

00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:15,440
export from child so it's pretty easy to

00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:17,520
load

00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:19,040
and then instead of creating one star

00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:21,359
here

00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:22,079
we're going to loop through the star

00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:23,599
layer

00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:25,040
we're going to loop through each object

00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:26,400
in the star layer and we're going to

00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:29,119
create one of each coordinates of each

00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,119
of those objects

00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:34,720
so there are stars there they all have

00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:36,319
the same logic because they all

00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,599
use the same function so we don't have

00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:38,800
to write anything to handle each of

00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:43,280
those separately because

00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:43,280
they're considered to work the same

00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,960
but our score text isn't following us

00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:49,040
anymore because we have a camera

00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:51,040
so if we add a scroll factor to the

00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:53,599
scroll text

00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:55,680
the score text i should say the score

00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:58,880
will follow us

00:40:55,680 --> 00:41:00,160
so we have a hud now a little laggy i

00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,240
think it's because i'm streaming because

00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:05,040
it's not this likely when i

00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:05,040
wasn't streaming

00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:09,119
so let me just check quickly because we

00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:12,400
are

00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:13,920
running out of time a little bit um

00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,680
i think that's everything that i wanted

00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,880
to uncomment for this

00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:18,960
there are a few different things you can

00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:22,079
do to tweak things like you can

00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:23,200
set different attributes on your your

00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:25,040
physical objects

00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,319
like right here i'm going to change this

00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,599
to give it a little bit of bounce but

00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:30,319
this is going to be a crazy bounce so

00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:33,520
things will get a little weird

00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:36,240
yeah so you can make things really weird

00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:37,839
um so you have to kind of tweak things a

00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:39,760
little bit to find

00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:40,960
something that you like so if i do that

00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:44,079
i actually don't want him to bounce but

00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:44,079
i can show you that he can bounce

00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,839
that might not be enough to show

00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,839
anything

00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,720
i'll definitely share my slides

00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,920
so then there's just a little bit of a

00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:03,119
bounce there but i don't like that so

00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:04,960
i'm getting rid of it um

00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:06,240
so let me go back to my slides just make

00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:08,000
sure i don't think i have any more

00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:10,720
slides after this but

00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,720
i want to make sure

00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:17,839
so here are some more frameworks and

00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,760
tools that you can use i'm going to

00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:20,960
mention these before i hit 2 15 and then

00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,480
i might tinker with the game a little

00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,160
bit more if we have time

00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,599
if anyone wants to wants to watch me

00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,040
tinker with it

00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:29,040
so some of the frameworks you can use

00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:31,119
are puzzle script godot bitsy and

00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:32,800
maker i have used puzzle script on that

00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:33,920
list but not the other three but

00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,319
i know that they are popular ones that

00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:38,800
are often used in game jams

00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:39,440
audacity is a tool you can use to make

00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,200
sound

00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:43,359
i was going to include sound in this but

00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:44,880
one i rarely include sound i've only

00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:45,440
added it to two games i've made because

00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:48,160
i'm not

00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:49,839
musically inclined so most of the games

00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:52,000
i make have no sound in them

00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:54,560
uh but it's here for anyone that wants

00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:58,160
an open source tool to create sounds

00:42:54,560 --> 00:43:01,200
uh i'm gonna skip down to sfxr

00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:02,720
rfx gen and bfxr are all sound tools

00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:04,319
they were actually created as a result

00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:05,520
of game jams

00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:06,720
so that people could have a tool they

00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,920
could use to quickly create sound

00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:10,079
effects

00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:12,160
i use those a little bit here and there

00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:13,359
but p28 is the one i use most frequently

00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,560
and that has some built-in tools to

00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:17,040
create sounds

00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:18,240
uh is a more fully featured open

00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:20,800
source image editor

00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:22,640
and blender is for uh three an open

00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:25,839
source tool for 3d modeling

00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:27,440
i've made one game with 3d models and i

00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:30,079
didn't use blender but

00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:31,040
i used a different one line application

00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:32,960
so

00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:36,400
um if we go back here i'm going to go to

00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,400
my last slide and

00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,480
yeah so that's basically the end of my

00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:44,000
talk um i

00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,359
was planning to tinker around with the

00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,240
code a little bit more but it's a lot of

00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:52,400
content to cover in 45 minutes so

00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:54,480
um i will share these links here uh but

00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:55,839
thanks for listening i hope the if you

00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:57,760
take anything away from this that

00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:59,520
it's not that difficult to make a game

00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:01,280
and it's kind of

00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:02,560
it is worth worth making a game it's

00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,680
there's lots of reasons to

00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,720
make games there's lots of reasons to

00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,839
participate in game jams and there's

00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:08,319
lots of open source

00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:08,960
and free tools to do so it was a

00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:11,280
terrific

00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:12,720
talk really appreciate you putting this

00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:15,520
together for us and delivering it

00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:16,319
this afternoon great great job uh a lot

00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:18,000
of good uh

00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:19,920
questions throughout you did a really

00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,680
good job addressing those questions

00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:23,359
uh christian i don't know if you heard

00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:26,160
joe and i were talking before

00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:27,119
uh his talk began about uh trying to

00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:30,240
come up with some

00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:33,359
uh introductory tools for young students

00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:33,839
um what we use at penn manor to to get

00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:35,200
kids

00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:36,800
starting to think about games is

00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,520
actually scratch believe it or not and

00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,680
we've seen

00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:41,200
kids create some incredibly

00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:43,599
sophisticated

00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:45,040
platformers and games with scratch but i

00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:45,760
think what you know many of the tools

00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:49,520
that

00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:51,119
joe presented here especially fazer

00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,960
i'm looking at that now as potentially a

00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:54,400
second level for our students especially

00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:55,200
as they get into middle school and high

00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:58,800
school

00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,800
when they outgrow scratch

00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:02,160
yeah i actually think phaser would be a

00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,440
good one for that this might look a

00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,560
little intimidating because i tried to

00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,760
show a lot in here i

00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:07,200
i probably could have trimmed some of

00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,400
this but i really wanted to show tile

00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,920
maps and sprite sheets

00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:12,560
um so that's why i had some of the extra

00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:15,280
stuff in here but phaser is really nice

00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:16,400
too phaser has a lot of stuff that is

00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:19,119
easy to understand

00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:20,560
um and it has a very detailed library to

00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:22,240
follow through so you can go through and

00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:23,760
look at these functions in the library

00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:25,599
the only disclaimer i'll say is a lot of

00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:28,880
stuff changed between uh

00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:30,000
phaser two and phasor three so um

00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,680
just make sure that when you're looking

00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,359
at that stuff you're looking at

00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:35,119
functions that are methods that are for

00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:37,839
the version you're using

00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:39,599
i mentioned uh fico as well so joe did

00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:44,079
did i catch a

00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:44,079
it's not free there's a there's

00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:48,720
yeah it's not free but it's only fifteen

00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:51,839
dollars and i i do recommend pico eight

00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:53,040
um i i'll pull this up quickly this is a

00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:55,440
picoa game which you can

00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:57,520
run in the browser the the first six of

00:45:55,440 --> 00:46:01,359
these five of them are pq8 games

00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:03,200
uh so this is what a pique game will

00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:06,560
look like

00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:07,280
when it's running in browser um pico 8

00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:09,440
is a

00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:10,319
i'm not sure if i'd recommend piko 8

00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:15,680
because it is

00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:17,920
lua and lu is pretty simple but the

00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:17,920
sound

00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,280
yeah so this is a little laggy too i

00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:24,240
think because i'm streaming so i'll

00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,640
close out of that but

00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:28,240
um lua took me a little bit to kind of

00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:30,880
understand what i was doing with lua

00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:31,680
it is it seems more not primitive but

00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:34,720
it's definitely

00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:37,440
not as it's not

00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:38,560
as complicated as javascript looks so it

00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,040
could be a good starting point for

00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:41,440
people

00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:43,040
but um it could also be a little

00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,359
confusing because some of the functions

00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:46,720
are

00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:48,400
are named with um some of the stuff

00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:50,079
built into pq8 are named a little weird

00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:52,400
because p28 also has

00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:54,079
size constraints in the files itself so

00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,400
some of the functions aren't named very

00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:55,920
very

00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,359
verbosely so it's a little confusing

00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,000
especially if you first get started with

00:46:57,359 --> 00:47:01,359
it

00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,359
to know what functions do what

00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:09,359
uh you'll remember

00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:11,359
free multiplayer networking packages

00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:12,640
even network manager yeah unity has a

00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:15,760
lot of stuff like that

00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:17,839
i i never really dig into the

00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:19,520
network uh multiplayer networking stuff

00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:21,280
with uh unity but

00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:25,839
there's a lot of tools that you can use

00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:25,839
to do stuff like that

00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:32,720
and christian pierce said the object

00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:34,000
oriented in javascript and running a

00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:36,960
lamp stack is a lot

00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,880
uh it sounds like a lot but it's pretty

00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:41,200
quick and easy to get up and running

00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:42,160
um if they have any familiarity with

00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,520
javascript it

00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:45,359
it shouldn't be too hard for them to

00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:46,480
learn but i'm not sure what what level

00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:48,240
they are for

00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:50,079
14 year old yeah i don't think

00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:52,960
javascript is too hard but um

00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:53,680
if they're past scratch uh personally i

00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:55,200
would say

00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:56,960
either phaser or pico 8 would be the

00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:59,839
best ones to do

00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:01,599
out of the ones that are listed but uh

00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:04,319
game maker might be another intermediate

00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:04,319
one that you could do

00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:08,559
very good okay all well thank you very

00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:10,240
much again joe terrific work

00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:18,400
uh we appreciate everybody being here

00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:18,400
