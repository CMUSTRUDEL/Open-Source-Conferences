hello and welcome to

00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,839
how to build your own engineering lab my

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:19,359
name is joe latrell

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:23,119
and i am the founder and chief engineer

00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,160
for mini cube's llc what we do is we

00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:26,640
design

00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,560
micro miniature satellites to go into

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,840
orbit we work with

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:34,079
what we call nanosats or cubesats

00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,760
or pocket cubes these are the types of

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,239
satellites that

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,960
are pretty much cutting edge we do that

00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:43,120
right here in akron pennsylvania

00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,079
so how do we go about doing all of that

00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,600
how did we create

00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,960
a lab that would allow us to build all

00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,680
of these things

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,600
well we took it one step at a time we're

00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,800
going to cover a couple of things about

00:00:53,600 --> 00:01:00,640
what you should have in a studio a lab

00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:02,160
a maker space that's important to you

00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,640
and also we want to provide some

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:08,080
information about how you get started

00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,720
and what do you need to start

00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,000
an engineering studio alright let's take

00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:16,000
a look at a couple of things

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
starting with personal protection

00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,560
the first thing i want to cover with you

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,240
today is personal protection equipment

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,159
or ppe

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,479
before you do anything in a lab it's

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,759
very important that you protect yourself

00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:32,640
and it's very easy to lose an eye damage

00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,720
your lungs

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,840
or lose a finger if you're using heavy

00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,520
equipment

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,360
so we want to cover a couple of things

00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,040
that will help you stay safe while

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,320
you're in the lab

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,079
now the first thing that we're going to

00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,960
look at we always

00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:47,920
always have gloves these are nitrile

00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,520
gloves

00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,280
they work really well they don't react

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,240
with a lot of chemicals

00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,200
and they're just overall a good thing to

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,200
have around

00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,880
i use these all the time no matter what

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,119
chemicals i'm working with

00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,560
unless it happens to be acids when i'm

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:05,280
working with acids or

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,280
extremely caustic bases i actually have

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,160
a pair of gloves specifically designed

00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,000
to do that

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,200
they're kind of expensive but for the

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,599
type of work we're doing

00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,120
they're very important okay always have

00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:17,920
a box of these on hand

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,319
you can never go wrong without having

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,520
them

00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:24,800
okay better to have and not need

00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:27,200
then need and not have okay all right

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,000
so gloves are important another thing

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,280
that's important

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,200
are respiration okay most people are

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,519
familiar with this type of a mask

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,879
it's just a simple little surgical mask

00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,200
that you put over your face

00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,000
to keep dust and debris out while you're

00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,519
breathing

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,800
around those are great if you're doing

00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,319
basic things but sometimes you need

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,640
something a little heavier duty

00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:52,800
okay that's why we have here in the shop

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,800
we have these respirators

00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,080
this is very important when you're

00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,360
working with things like

00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,680
paints or very

00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,800
light solvents something that is

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,599
designed to either etch

00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,120
metal or in some cases you might want to

00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,959
use this if you're working with

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,640
a resin printer like we have over here

00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,959
in the corner

00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,800
they do emit a lot of vapors that are

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,080
not healthy for you it's good to have

00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,319
one of these

00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,120
another thing you can do is also have

00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:23,280
proper ventilation in your studio

00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,400
i have a series of fans that are built

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,599
into the ceiling

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:30,720
in this place that allow us to keep

00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:32,239
the air circulating constantly it's just

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,640
another preventative measure

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:37,200
to protect our lungs it's very easy to

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,200
damage your lungs and a lot of times the

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,959
damage does not show up for several

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,840
years so it's always a good thing to

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,120
have

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:48,720
okay always always

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,400
have safety glasses of some sort okay

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,480
i have several different types here that

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,159
i want to show you everything from your

00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57,280
basic safety glasses

00:03:54,159 --> 00:04:00,879
these are polycarbonate they deflect

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,799
a lot of debris especially non-metallics

00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,319
if you're dealing with wood if you get

00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,720
that in your eye

00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,239
you've lost your eye more than likely

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,080
i've had the unfortunate pleasure of

00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,840
seeing those types of accidents when i

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,560
worked in construction

00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,320
wear safety glasses okay when you're

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,880
working with chemicals however

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,400
safety glasses are not going to cut it

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,199
you really should have something

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,560
that protects the sides of your face

00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:28,880
these actually come

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:31,120
real close like this and they keep

00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,639
any sort of splashes from getting into

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,880
your eyes from the side

00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,800
they're a really good thing to have and

00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,960
i have different pairs of them i even

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,919
have a slightly tinted one here

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,600
that i actually like the tinted version

00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,479
it does cut down on some glare while

00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,639
you're working

00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:50,960
and you can never ever have

00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,280
too much safety especially when it comes

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,759
to glare while you're working

00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,360
another set of glasses that we have are

00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,080
designed for working with

00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,800
ultraviolets again we have a resin

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,600
printer here

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,600
we have a laser etcher here we want to

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,039
make certain that we protect our eyes

00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,440
while those devices are

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,400
are being used and so we have these

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,840
glasses

00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,080
oh another thing that we do have in the

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,479
lab is we have a uv

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,759
light that's designed to harden resins

00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,479
or sterilize

00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,759
various equipment these are a necessity

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,479
when you're working with that kind of

00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,880
stuff

00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:26,000
okay all right two more things we want

00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,360
to cover

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,120
again when you're working with heavy

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,000
gear you might need to have hearing

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,320
protection

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,080
these are an over-the-ear set they work

00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,800
real well you can also get the kind that

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,600
go in the ear have a little cord those

00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,560
are good to have

00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,199
i prefer the over the ear simply because

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,080
they have

00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,479
more of a noise protection system in

00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,320
them

00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,320
they're just really good to have okay

00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,960
finally in the gear side of things we

00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,800
want to make certain that we have

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,000
some sort of coveralls if we're working

00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,160
with chemicals

00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,160
now for me while i'm in the clean room

00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,360
and we do have a one-man clean room over

00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,720
here

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,600
i use the tyvek coveralls tyvek is

00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,960
really good

00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:11,680
for keeping a lot of dust and debris out

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,639
these get taped around my hands along

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,639
with

00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,759
nitrile gloves i have little booties

00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,759
that i have to put on

00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:21,360
this is what we use in the clean room

00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:24,000
but when i'm working with chemicals

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,000
i'll actually grab myself one of these

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,840
yes it's a lab coat

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,680
lab coats are great because they keep

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,800
you safe from spills

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,199
you don't want to get if you're working

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,160
with

00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,880
various chemicals that can stain or

00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,280
cause

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,400
problems like resin you really want to

00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,919
have

00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:47,440
your regular clothing protected

00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:50,560
okay so one of these yes it looks dorky

00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,199
but they're a lifesaver at least as far

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,280
as your

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,280
your clothing is concerned okay

00:06:55,599 --> 00:07:00,840
in addition to personal protection gear

00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:03,280
it's important to keep your lab

00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:06,479
clean okay that means

00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:08,720
using a dust pan and a little dust brush

00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,800
having a vacuum handy when you have

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,599
particles that get all over the place

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,720
i also keep a series of cleaners on hand

00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,759
i have

00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,319
natural cleaners just for cutting out

00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,599
grease

00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:25,039
i have windex over here on the shelf

00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:26,160
i have alcohol in different strengths

00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:29,759
for everything from

00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,000
91 percent to 99 percent and we use that

00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,840
for

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,080
cleaning up whatever spills we need to

00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,720
worry about and that means having

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,840
lots of shop towels on hand okay i

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,240
happen to use

00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,039
these blue ones here they're really

00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,120
really good

00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,240
you can get them at home depot or other

00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,440
different

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,759
locations harbor freight has them

00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,960
direct tools has them they're just good

00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,800
handy things to have

00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,720
in the shop again they're very heavy

00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,280
duty they absorb a lot of stuff

00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,800
they work well and we have normal paper

00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:02,000
towels and we have

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,720
cotton towels as well for dealing with

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,960
things that

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,840
we don't worry about you know having to

00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,599
wash

00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:11,199
out of a cloth good thing to have okay

00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,680
i know i'm going through a lot of things

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:17,680
very quickly we're going to continue

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,680
just moving forward with

00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:26,479
stop that's the basics of

00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,759
personal protection gear or personal

00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,240
protection equipment

00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:41,839
we're going to step on to how do we move

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:41,839
forward with our lab

00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,360
those are just a few of the things in

00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,440
personal protection equipment

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,399
that we highly recommend if you're

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,640
putting together

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,480
some sort of an engineering lab these

00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,040
are the basics

00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,320
they can be expensive to acquire but

00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,600
they're good to have

00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,800
again it's more important to spend the

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,880
money on good

00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,480
personal protection equipment and

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,680
protect yourself

00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,000
than it is to worry about you're just

00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,600
getting

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,279
hurt don't get hurt all right

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:22,320
next up we're going to talk a little bit

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:24,880
about how you build out your space

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,320
so my current setup is broken into three

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,800
distinct pieces

00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,640
upstairs in the house we have our design

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,920
studio this is where we actually do all

00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,040
of our computer work

00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,399
and make things um in the digital world

00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,959
that we're going to turn into real

00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,720
objects later then we have a second

00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,839
section this is called the craft area

00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,399
down here

00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,360
this is where i actually design smaller

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,200
pieces

00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,720
work on models and of course deal with

00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,320
anything around the house that needs to

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,320
be repaired

00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,360
the area is broken down into several

00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,600
small sections

00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,480
one a large table that i can work on

00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,160
with all of my

00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:02,240
various parts that i need to fix

00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,360
and then i have an organizer over here

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,600
on this side

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,560
that organizer allows me to just find

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,519
things quickly

00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,040
it's a simple drawer setup and of course

00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,279
i have a series of

00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,800
scissors and cutters and various things

00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,600
that you need in order to actually do

00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,160
the work

00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,800
that you're trying to accomplish i also

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,440
have a

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,800
library of various things these include

00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,880
how-to books

00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,120
a couple of travel guides just for fun

00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,040
and an assortment of various components

00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:32,160
that i'm working on such as models

00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,600
for my side hobbies or whatever

00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,079
an important thing to remember about

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,959
this craft area this is very tiny

00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:40,480
it's approximately seven feet across and

00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,959
maybe five feet deep

00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,880
it isn't a lot of room but it allows us

00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:47,600
to get done what we need to get done

00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:50,480
for these particular items you can set

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,959
up an engineering lab or a makerspace

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,640
easily in this type of area it's just a

00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,959
matter of what tools you need

00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:59,200
in order to do the jobs you want to do

00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:01,200
if you're interested in 3d printing

00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,480
this could be a nice little area for a

00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,959
little

00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,399
creality or maybe a prusa printer

00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:08,640
sitting here in the corner

00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,720
and then you could file all of your

00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,160
filaments and spare parts over here

00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,200
and just use this as a nice little

00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:17,120
creation station you can also and have

00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,839
various knives or whatever tools that

00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,480
you need in order to like again build

00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,880
models

00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,600
work on rocketry i have some small ones

00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,839
here

00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,880
or do any sort of crafts we also have

00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,680
the sewing table

00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:32,079
here in the same craft area so if i need

00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:34,320
to manufacture anything like parachutes

00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,920
or just want to sew up a shirt or try

00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,640
something along those lines

00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,920
i have the gear in order to do that

00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,600
let's say you want to do something a

00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,160
little bit bigger that you're

00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,920
more than just doing modeling you're

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,160
doing some serious work

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,000
well you should consider either adapting

00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,560
a section of your garage

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,040
which you can do with as simple as

00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,800
ripping down a sheet of plywood

00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,120
and mounting it with some two by fours

00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,160
to the wall and boom you've got a

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,320
workspace

00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,240
add a couple of shelves above and below

00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,320
and you're in business

00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,839
those are really good areas if you're

00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:11,279
more into the construction

00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:13,040
or auto mechanics and i actually have a

00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:15,120
place out in my garage where i do those

00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,519
sorts of things

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,160
the next step up from using your garage

00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,279
is to have a

00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:24,160
dedicated space in my case i have a

00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,639
a special building it is 11 foot by 14

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,760
foot

00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,959
that contains all of my equipment with

00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,440
the exception of

00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:33,760
my design studio and my little itty

00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,920
bitty craft area

00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,200
the engineering studio that i have here

00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:40,320
is

00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,360
in my personal opinion pretty neat we

00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,760
can do just about

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,079
anything in this location it's big

00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,040
enough to allow for a center table that

00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,800
we use

00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,800
we have our clean room in the corner we

00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,120
have storage electronics

00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,399
area and then we have our 3d printing in

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,839
cnc area

00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,720
so this is where all the heavy stuff

00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:00,720
gets done in this particular room

00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,959
because we're building satellites we

00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,040
have to have all of this stuff

00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:06,000
and everything from looking at circuit

00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,639
boards to actually

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,160
manufacturing circuit boards we can do

00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:13,760
it here

00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:16,880
that's just part of what our needs are

00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,320
your needs will be different but the

00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,120
recommendations i would have is

00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:24,160
regardless of your space

00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,440
keep yourself organized always have

00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,560
storage containers

00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,800
that show what is inside them note that

00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,839
i have these back here on the wall

00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,240
all of them are labeled with their

00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:36,480
contents

00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,160
if you stay organized regardless of the

00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,199
size of your space

00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:43,040
you will have an easier time of being an

00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:49,839
engineer

00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:49,839
keep things organized so that simple

00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,600
as far as storage systems i highly

00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,800
recommend using with sterilite

00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,279
containers i have them

00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,240
in two major sizes i have the large

00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,720
containers that go

00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,399
underneath my shelving and then i have

00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,360
the little tiny ones that you see

00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:08,480
up on top they're great for the various

00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,240
things that you're doing if you're

00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,880
storing large equipment or large

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:15,040
supplies the big boxes work if you're

00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:18,320
doing little tiny detailed pieces

00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,360
like various electronic components those

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,120
work well

00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,720
for anything smaller than that like nuts

00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:31,839
bolts and screws consider

00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:31,839
wall mounted units those work

00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,000
let's talk a moment about purchasing

00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,839
tools and supplies

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,680
now that you've got an idea for what

00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:50,800
type of space you want to use

00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:53,600
you really should select the tools that

00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:56,800
you're going to use in that space

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,480
for me i'm into all kinds of different

00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,199
things i've done everything from

00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,480
modeling

00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:05,760
to building houses

00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,760
working on cars those sorts of things

00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,680
require tools and some of these tools

00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:12,000
can be very very expensive

00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,040
so how do you decide what it is you need

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,720
to buy

00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:18,240
well first what are you working on

00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,920
if you're working in photography you're

00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,000
going to want some cameras you're going

00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:25,279
to want some tripods maybe some lights

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,680
and a backdrop if you're working on

00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:29,199
building electronics you might want to

00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:32,480
have you know a simple

00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:35,600
rework station a soldering gun maybe an

00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,519
oscilloscope for testing

00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,279
you might want to have your own reflow

00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,600
oven like we have here

00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:43,839
or even a prototyping unit that's

00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,519
designed specifically for making circuit

00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:48,000
boards

00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,639
each of these tools can be either bought

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,959
cheaply

00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,800
or expensively but i also have a trick

00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:54,880
for you so you don't have to spend quite

00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,240
so much money

00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,720
when you're first starting out in

00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:02,320
something consider buying a

00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:04,320
cheap set of tools go to harbor freight

00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,399
pick them up there they're usually

00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,240
fairly decent quality but not what you

00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:12,000
would use if you were quote unquote

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:14,639
a professional they do work however

00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,199
and they're great they might be usable

00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,839
for

00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:19,920
one or two times maybe a dozen but

00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,519
eventually that tool is going to fail

00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,279
if you continue buying cheap tools

00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:25,360
you'll find out that very quickly it's

00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:29,360
more expensive than if you just bought

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:32,240
the higher quality one so

00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,600
buy the cheap study what it is you're

00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,920
doing

00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,959
for me when i got into 3d printing i

00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,360
bought an anet

00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:41,040
printer it wasn't the best but it was

00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,800
enough for me to get started and then

00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:45,040
when i decided that yes

00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,199
this is what i want to do i moved on to

00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:49,440
using things like the creality printers

00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:50,800
that you see

00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,199
there's a trick though with buying

00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:56,480
expensive tools and that is

00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:58,959
buy last year's model as an example

00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,480
i have a tripod here that i purchased i

00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:02,560
bought last year's model

00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,559
for just under a hundred dollars

00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,480
normally if i were to buy it brand new

00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:08,400
it would cost four hundred dollars

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,679
so look for those deals you can find

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,760
them if you're

00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,360
very very careful and you don't have to

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,439
worry about time

00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,880
if however time is essential for you

00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:19,199
getting something done

00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,919
and you need the quality tool by all

00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,400
means

00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:24,079
spend the money it is well worth having

00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,400
a good set of tools

00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,839
that are easily maintained than it is to

00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,520
buy cheap tools

00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:33,840
that are hard to maintain and you'll

00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,840
just end up throwing out later

00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,280
okay so you've got a little tiny

00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,799
workspace that you've picked out

00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,760
you've got your personal protection

00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:46,640
equipment you've selected your tools

00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,240
what now what else is there the last

00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:51,440
thing you need to be worried about

00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:53,039
is proper cleaning this is often

00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,160
overlooked when people have an

00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:57,280
engineering area

00:17:54,160 --> 00:18:00,000
or maker space but cleanup is

00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,039
important probably the number one thing

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,840
you need to worry about

00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:05,760
other than yourself with ppe i mentioned

00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:08,400
having different cleaners available but

00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,880
what sort of methodologies do you use

00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,960
well

00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,080
as soon as you are done with the project

00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,000
we're done for the day

00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,840
make certain you give yourself about 15

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,160
minutes afterward

00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,160
so you can clean up properly in the case

00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,559
of resin printer that i have here

00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,440
that involves the use of a lot of 99

00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,520
alcohol

00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,120
scrubbing every surface down that i have

00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,039
come in contact with

00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,120
and then i check it under a uv light to

00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:33,600
see if there's any exposure

00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,480
once i have all of that figured out all

00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,280
cleaned up

00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,720
all that material is exposed to uv

00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,720
intense uv

00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,160
so it solidifies and is no longer a

00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,919
problem because

00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,960
resin can be toxic that then goes into a

00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,760
special trash can

00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:52,320
and is taken out in the case of other

00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:54,880
things like you're working with

00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,880
sanding down some plastic parts as soon

00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,200
as you're done sweep the area

00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,880
vacuum the area wipe everything down

00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:04,240
with a good cleaner

00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,120
this will keep you from developing a bad

00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,840
habit

00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:09,679
of just letting things build up then it

00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,919
becomes hard to find your equipment

00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:12,720
hard to find your projects and hard to

00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,039
deal with

00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,799
debris in the case of some of the

00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:18,960
electronics that i work on

00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:20,880
if i don't take care of the debris the

00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,640
electronics won't work

00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,280
especially for satellites since we're in

00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,840
a clean room that room has to be clean

00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,880
everything that we do in there is near

00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:32,160
sterile

00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,880
so yeah we have to take extreme

00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,440
precautions

00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,799
when we go in everything is wiped down

00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,039
we do the work we need to

00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:40,160
it is sealed off we then wipe everything

00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,480
else down again

00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,919
before we exit the room you don't have

00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,400
to be that

00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:48,640
detailed if you're running your own

00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,799
maker space or engineering lab

00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,919
but it depends on what you're doing

00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:53,360
cleanliness is

00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:55,039
important it's the last thing i'm

00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,240
recommending but it is one of the first

00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:58,240
things you need to be

00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:01,200
concerned about when you develop your

00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,200
engineering space

00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,840
so you've decided you're going to go

00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:10,559
ahead and build your own engineering lab

00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,840
well how do you get started easy you

00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:13,360
just start

00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,280
decide what it is that you're going to

00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,760
do and then

00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,360
outline it put together a plan and see

00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,280
what materials you need

00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,640
you don't always have to have everything

00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,280
you need to get started

00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,240
don't worry about missing tools you can

00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,919
figure it out

00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:33,120
the idea is get moving first

00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:35,919
with a general plan and fill in the

00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,520
details as you go along

00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:38,960
for me one of the things that helped me

00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,200
get started before i had

00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,000
anything to work with as an engineering

00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,039
space

00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,600
was i worked with make 717. i became an

00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:49,360
early adopter of the facility and i

00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:52,640
worked with their machines

00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:55,200
and just talked with other people who

00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,919
were interested in the same things i was

00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,840
learned from them develop the habits

00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:03,360
that i needed in order to do what it is

00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:04,880
i do today if you don't have access to a

00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:08,080
space that you can use

00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:10,880
consider a makerspace make717

00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,240
shameless plug here is a wonderful place

00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,559
to start

00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,320
you'll learn a lot by watching others

00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:20,159
and interacting with them

00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:20,159
so consider that as an option

00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:30,320
finally remember making engineering

00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:32,960
it's not a degree it is a mindset

00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,320
what you're trying to do is take

00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,120
scientific knowledge

00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,919
whatever it is that you're interested in

00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,480
physics

00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,039
chemistry mathematics and putting them

00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,799
together

00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:44,240
to create something that no one has seen

00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:48,159
before or

00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:52,159
at least something that you want to see

00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:54,159
don't let your lack of those materials

00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:56,320
lack of knowledge lack of experience

00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:59,840
stop you the important part

00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:02,400
get started it's really easy to do

00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:04,000
hard to continue with but it's worth the

00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:07,200
journey in the end

00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,640
i recommend everyone at least take a

00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,280
little bit of time in their lives and

00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,960
become a maker

00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,400
normally about this time in a

00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,480
presentation i would

00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,720
take questions and answers but since

00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,400
this is pre-recorded

00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,520
that's going to be a little tough

00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:25,120
instead right here is my email address

00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,919
if you want to get in touch with me

00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:29,120
to take a tour of the facilities we have

00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:31,120
here at mini cubes

00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,400
or you want to learn more about being an

00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,000
engineer or

00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,720
setting up your own engineering lab or

00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,840
maker space feel free to contact me

00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,440
if you have any questions i'm there for

00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:43,120
you it truly has been a pleasure putting

00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,280
this video together for you

00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,400
and i hope that you enjoy making in the

00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:53,120
future
