	00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,160
let's go ahead

00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:16,160
welcome to the lightning talks today we

00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,800
have one two three four

00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:22,000
five scheduled talks and maybe one or

00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,920
two extras will throw in along the way

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,320
everyone's going to get five minutes to

00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,480
speak at about four minutes in i have a

00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,400
bill

00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,040
at about five minutes in i have a gong

00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:36,559
and i'm not afraid to use it

00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:38,719
when you finish speaking

00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:40,800
i will say who's supposed to be the next

00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,320
ad and reminder who's doing the next

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,520
talk so they can start setting their

00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,559
slides up

00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,480
we'll do the add when the ad finishes

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,920
hopefully i will know who the next ad is

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,640
going to be so i can say who it's going

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,120
to be

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,039
and then we'll start to talk and

00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,920
remember when you start your talk after

00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,680
i say to go

00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,039
please wait a few seconds so we can cut

00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,320
me out from

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:06,000
the youtube version and with that

00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,000
jason you may get going

00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,600
hi so i'm jason um and i'm my talk is

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,680
about

00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,040
gene you make just trying to give you a

00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,119
little bit of a snake oil

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,880
salesman pitch on using this instead of

00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:24,479
shell scripts for um

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,479
doing like data processing

00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,669
um why would you want to use me

00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:30,669
[Music]

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,799
you already know bash you already know

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,640
some other scripting language

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:41,680
um so dependencies

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,840
are made explicit in make files

00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,040
if you're not familiar with make it's

00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,600
the program

00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,920
that interprets and executes make files

00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,240
usually used to compile software this is

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,280
all like in a linux environment you've

00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,119
probably already

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,960
used it if you're familiar with linux to

00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,439
like install software that wasn't in

00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,640
your

00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:03,280
distributions package repository um

00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,079
if you've ever done configure make build

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,560
make install

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,399
does that sound familiar you've used

00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,959
make maybe not realizing

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,720
exactly what was going on but you can

00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,640
also use make not just to

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:19,120
compile software but to generically

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,120
define a data or a processing workflow

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,160
so here's a fairly simple bass script

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:28,000
wrapper so it's a wrapper

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,760
that this is the that executes a series

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,040
of other steps so there's four steps in

00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,440
this

00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:37,280
workflow and then there's a wrapping

00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,800
script which is the slide itself

00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,879
some of the scripts read output from the

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,680
previous steps but bash doesn't really

00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,319
know that

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,200
if i update one of my subscripts i have

00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:48,000
to know

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,080
that something's out of date and rerun

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,599
either the whole wrapper or comment line

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,680
comment about lines that i don't want to

00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:56,160
run um

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,680
and in this example step one and two

00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,280
they could be run in parallel

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,879
um they don't really depend on each

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,120
other

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,879
uh you can do this explicitly in bash by

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,480
launching processes in the background

00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,040
and then using the weight command but

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,360
from it

00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,400
with make you kind of get

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,239
parallelization

00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,440
kind of for free um so this is the

00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,319
equivalent make file

00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,920
doing the same same workflow it's a

00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,560
little longer obviously i had to

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,720
decrease the font size with the slide

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,239
i could have saved some typing by using

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,640
some built-in variables but

00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,440
the point of this is it gives me a lot

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,239
of benefits

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,360
just for slightly more typing so if

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,200
there's an error in

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,200
step three for example and i need to

00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,799
rerun it i simply fix the script

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,959
and run make on the command line

00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,760
it'll determine by the time stamps on

00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,599
the files whether anything's out of date

00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,959
i has a prerequisite with a newer

00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:52,239
modified time

00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,519
and rerun steps required i don't have to

00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,200
comment out anything

00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,280
or run the entire script to be sure i

00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,760
haven't missed some dependency

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,799
if i want to run steps in parallel i can

00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,000
specify

00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:06,239
make dash j n with n being the maximum

00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,319
number of processes allowed

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,080
make also gives the ability to do like a

00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:12,560
test drive of the process

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,239
printing out what steps would be run

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,879
based on the files and timestamps

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,239
present

00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,239
but not actually executed

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,040
so in short make saves machine time by

00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,199
only running what's necessary

00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,360
and easily running stuff in parallel it

00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,280
saves human time by eliminating the need

00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,080
to tease out dependencies when something

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,320
breaks

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:37,280
this does require that dependencies be

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:40,320
made sort of explicit in the makefile

00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,479
so it

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,440
i think it's helped me become like

00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,960
better at

00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:49,360
teasing out all of the actual um

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,720
workflow if you write like a very

00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:55,040
explicit make file

00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:58,479
it it um it forces you to understand

00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:01,280
exactly what is

00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,160
what the process entails what depends on

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,440
what

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:11,840
so i didn't hear gong but i think we're

00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:11,840
about done with my time so

00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,000
you actually had another minute but

00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,880
without the gong you want to

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,880
make it all official

00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:28,880
so josh you are up doing the ad and

00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,759
jake get your slides ready all right i

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,360
just wanted

00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:36,080
to call out a project

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,120
that i think is uh useful it's called

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,240
barrier

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,120
it is they call it a virtual kvm so you

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,360
install

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,160
this program on two computers next to

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,120
each other

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,280
uh it could be a mac windows linux uh

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,199
doesn't have to be two of the same thing

00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,720
and then it lets you move the keyboard

00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,440
and mouse back and forth

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,039
uh as if it was a dual screen computer

00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,080
there's some support

00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:03,199
there used to be a program called uh

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,319
synergy that did this but synergy went

00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,919
close source and

00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,600
their version two apparently had a bunch

00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:09,440
of problems and so i was left without

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,000
such a thing until i found

00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,440
very recently and i just thought of it

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,199
earlier and thought i'd mention it in

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,360
the um

00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,440
uh as a lightning ad with last time i

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,800
heard jeffrey asking for

00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,479
uh lightning talks so that's pretty much

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,919
all i have to say about it i will now

00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,919
paste a link to it into the chat

00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:36,319
[Music]

00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,319
okay jacob you are up

00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,319
all right hello everybody um is my audio

00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,360
all right

00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,360
my video is not on

00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:52,160
how about that uh so uh i'm jake

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,479
i work for applied educational systems

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,759
i need to make sure i let you all know

00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,759
that we are hiring

00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,800
a front-end developer and back-end

00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,440
developer so

00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,560
if you think you might want to work with

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,560
us

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:10,319
uh try and find me or lon

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:14,840
or uh ken richard might be on here today

00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:17,759
he's in here somewhere too there's me um

00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:20,000
anyway for my lightning talk i do

00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,280
apologize i am not a fast talker so i'm

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,240
trying to do my best

00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,520
um i wanted to talk a little bit about

00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,639
something i'm tinkering with

00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:32,000
uh we've been trying to

00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:34,720
be more intentional about diversity and

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,360
inclusion in our platform

00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:41,120
and we've also been recently working on

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:43,120
a redesign of our student interface

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,280
and one of the things that we've been

00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:50,960
trying to do

00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:53,360
is iconify the idea of a student and a

00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:56,240
teacher

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,759
and that's really difficult to be

00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,680
diverse

00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:03,039
and also iconified because

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,280
you have this problem of where you're

00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:07,440
going to use a static

00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,360
abstract image to represent the idea of

00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,720
a teacher and what does a teacher look

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,479
like

00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,960
so this is our first um not first but

00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,800
the

00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:21,840
first version of a kind of a f

00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:24,000
initial revision of a icon that

00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,560
represents a teacher

00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,520
and immediately people started noticing

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,639
okay well

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,960
you know her i think it's a white woman

00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,959
and

00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,880
i think her style looks a little bit

00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:37,680
like the 50s

00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,839
and you know all these ideas start to

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,399
come across

00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:43,039
um and i started thinking about the idea

00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,320
of

00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:48,480
uh can we be a little bit more dynamic

00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,440
in how we represent this

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,920
image on the screen could we show

00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,279
different

00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:58,800
variations of what a teacher

00:08:55,279 --> 00:09:02,080
is on

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,120
the same general icon so the first step

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,959
of course is

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,279
we've got this vector art that our

00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:09,519
designer created

00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:12,000
and the good news is vector art can be

00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:15,360
exported as an svg

00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:19,200
and svg is really just a collection of

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,959
each xml you can see right here here's

00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,959
my svg image

00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:28,959
it's got a bunch of math in it and some

00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:32,320
elements with which i can put ids on

00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:34,000
and because i can do this on all modern

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,360
browsers

00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,000
currently have native svg support

00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,040
and i can traverse the xml that means i

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,920
can style it

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,920
with css

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:51,600
so something that i can do if i put ids

00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:53,279
on particular groups i can target them

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:57,839
with my css

00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:59,839
and i can change them so

00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,279
we use react for a front end so i just

00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:05,120
did a quick little

00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:05,120
mashup in react here

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:10,640
really simply this is just importing my

00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,440
svg image

00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,839
and making a react component out of it

00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,480
i'm doing just some random math

00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:20,160
to come up with random random numbers

00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,680
between one and three

00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:27,839
and i'm making some css classes

00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:30,880
to attach uh pass through to my

00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:33,839
react component and then over here my

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,839
css

00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:39,680
i've got some variables for skin tones

00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:44,480
shirt colors hair colors

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:47,600
and based on what class i randomly apply

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:51,200
to that component

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,200
i'm going to change

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:59,519
these paths in in the svg

00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:04,399
to different colors fill colors based on

00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:04,399
whatever class i randomly assigned to it

00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:10,640
so real quickly i can go from one static

00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:14,560
image

00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:17,279
to this which is

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,680
every time i refresh or re-render my

00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,680
page

00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,920
i'm going to get a slightly different

00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:27,680
version

00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,640
of my teacher and students and i'm doing

00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,000
this all with one

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:33,440
svg source uh so i don't know

00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,360
something i was playing with a little

00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,640
bit i thought i'd show you

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:41,760
um and

00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,959
this is just a first flush but something

00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,760
to look at

00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:47,519
uh if you feel free to hit me up if you

00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,880
want to talk about anything like this

00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,800
later on

00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,560
i'll be around for a little bit and you

00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:57,839
can find me in slack too

00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:57,839
at jake uh yeah thanks

00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:06,580
[Music]

00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,399
okay eli you are getting your slides

00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:14,399
ready i

00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:16,079
don't think we have an advertiser yet so

00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,800
while you're getting your slides ready

00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:20,399
i will just mention that philly

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,959
linux.org

00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:25,920
the linux users group around here meets

00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:28,720
twice a month first wednesdays and

00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,079
second tuesdays the third mondays have

00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,240
been chances because we lost

00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,440
space even though that's not important

00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,040
now

00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:40,800
so philly linux.org

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:44,000
and ui you are up great

00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:46,639
thanks jeffrey um jake's talk actually

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,079
uh serendipitous serendipitously ties

00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,959
into my own i'm going to be talking

00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:51,360
about exorcism io which is an open

00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,680
source

00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,600
platform that i discovered a while ago

00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,600
for learning programming languages

00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,000
and so i'm just going to walk through a

00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,480
couple aspects of it for you to see

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,639
so the first step is if you go to this

00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,959
link exorcism io you'll notice

00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:09,120
it's kind of a promotional page code

00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:12,000
practice and mentorship for everyone

00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:14,079
and you can read all about that yada

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,959
yada i'm going to drop this in the chat

00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:17,279
so

00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:18,320
you can see and then i'm going to switch

00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,720
over actually

00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,480
to the inside track and talk a little

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,959
bit about this

00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,760
from my perspective and then also

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:29,200
quickly jump

00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:32,320
into a terminal and i'll show the

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,880
command line client and so

00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,920
what i like about exorcism and what i

00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,519
found helpful

00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:42,639
is it has a guided track

00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:44,880
for learning a programming language and

00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:47,120
the guided track has

00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,880
mentor feedback and mentors are actually

00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:52,480
other people volunteering

00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:55,440
to give you specific tips on

00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,040
your solutions and you solve solutions

00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,040
through iterations so

00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,279
what's a programming language as well

00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,079
they have everything under the sun you

00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:04,880
could say

00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:06,480
there's lots of different uh languages

00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:09,680
from popular ones

00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,720
from scripting ones to compiled ones in

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,880
this case

00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,800
i've been interested in rust for a while

00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,480
and so i found exorcism

00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,160
through a conversation to figure out

00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,000
okay how can i practice this more

00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:23,040
because there's some concepts that

00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,959
i don't know as well because of my

00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,440
background or other things and so

00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:28,560
this is a dashboard that they've built

00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,480
and it gives you a great

00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,680
kind of summary of your progression

00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,120
through the track

00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:36,399
you can see in this case i'm a

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:39,600
procrastinator i started this

00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,000
over a year ago i'm still not not quite

00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,839
done

00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,160
i'm almost there so maybe if you were to

00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:46,240
grade me i get a b

00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,320
which is fine by me where i'm at right

00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,720
now but one of the neat things is

00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,639
as you're going through the track they

00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,760
you make a submission

00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:59,199
and when you submit um you get this

00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,639
interaction with a mentor

00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,560
who can give you some positive

00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:05,279
encouragement as well as some

00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:07,519
tips like hey what you did here was

00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,880
maybe a little inefficient or

00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,560
based on their knowledge of the

00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,120
programming language they might give you

00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,600
some

00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,519
useful pointers that you can immediately

00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,399
apply and in this case i did

00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:19,360
and then i create another iteration and

00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,360
so

00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,040
the other way this can reinforce your

00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,720
learning is you can check out community

00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,000
solutions so i'm not the only person

00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,079
that's in the rest track

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,519
and there's thousands of people and

00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:32,160
thousands of other people have

00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:34,079
published their solutions to this

00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,000
exercise so you can kind of go in

00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:38,079
and check out people's solution you can

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,759
comment on them i don't see many people

00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,360
commenting as much but i have found it

00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:43,279
helpful to explore

00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,959
how people solve the specific problem

00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:47,120
especially when i get stuck

00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,079
it's not cheating it's just learning

00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,920
from others

00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:52,160
in the context where you don't have them

00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,800
next to you in a class or something

00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,320
so that's a quick overview of the

00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,240
specifics of the track

00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,360
um some of the kind of flavor of those

00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,759
interactions but

00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,040
one of the things i also like is uh nate

00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,199
publishes cli

00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,320
um the cli is standalone i believe it's

00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:08,240
written in go

00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,560
and it just gives you a quick way to be

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,800
able to um explore

00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:15,120
these exercises whether they're the main

00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,839
track exercises or the practice ones

00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:20,240
on the side so the main track is kind of

00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:22,720
that stat i showed you where i'm 85

00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:25,120
through the rest track that's the

00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,440
canonical list of exercises that

00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,399
are to help you achieve fluency in the

00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,800
language but

00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:32,959
there's a ton of other exercises just

00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,880
for practice so in this case

00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,079
i think i downloaded let me see actually

00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,720
i killed my history

00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:40,079
so you can download the specific

00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,680
exercises

00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:44,320
um using their exercise name so in this

00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,079
case

00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,759
it creates a directory in your home

00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:52,560
photo folder called

00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:55,360
exorcism with the relative languages

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,560
in subdirectories and so in this case

00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,320
this is an example

00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,600
of one of the practice problems that i

00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,759
recently downloaded

00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,800
and all i had to do is actually just

00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,120
execute a command

00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,559
exorcism download and i think it was

00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:09,679
exercise

00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:12,400
um isbn verifier that sort of thing

00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,600
it should probably yell at me and say um

00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,720
that doesn't work

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:20,079
or no it does ah cool so

00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,280
yeah that's that's it uh thanks for

00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,439
listening and

00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:26,040
yeah i posted the link and feel free to

00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:30,510
ask me any other questions

00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:30,510
[Music]

00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:35,840
thanks

00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,880
pj you are ready to get your slides

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:41,039
ready

00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:43,440
yes i am reminder if you want to give an

00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:47,600
ad you have to uh click the button in

00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,600
the top corner so that you can ask

00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,559
[Music]

00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,039
all right can you see my slides yep go

00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,520
ahead

00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,640
excellent all right so my name is pj

00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,400
some of you may have been in my talk

00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,520
earlier about imposter syndrome this is

00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,360
not about that

00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,120
there's a bunch of ways to get to know

00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,440
to talk to me so

00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,960
what is music uh this is just one part

00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,720
of the definition of music that was laid

00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,120
out by a guy named don campbell

00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,400
in his book the mozart effect don

00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,799
started his research in an interesting

00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,320
way

00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:20,080
and like a good scientist he found that

00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,280
sometimes his conclusions didn't exactly

00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,000
match his hypothesis

00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,200
but that's okay his original idea was

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,720
that music could heal

00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,799
like better than modern medicine which

00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,160
is a little bit out there in my opinion

00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,000
but that's just me

00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,840
when don tried it out on alzheimer's

00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,360
patients he thought he was seeing what

00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,799
he expected which is an increase in

00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,640
cognitive function

00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:40,480
for non-brain maladies though don was

00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,480
mistaken he also saw an increase in

00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,840
cognitive function so what is it that

00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,640
don played for his patients

00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,600
mozart so don basic's research on

00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,360
testing so

00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,960
not just for developers also scientists

00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,600
do it and this was testing that was

00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,440
performed by

00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,679
a doctor named f h rauscher and his team

00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,840
in 1993 when they posted that mice

00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,679
then chimps than humans would perform

00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,000
better at tasks of spatial reasoning if

00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,000
they were

00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,080
listening to mozart humans the mean

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,080
spatial iq score rose 8 to 10 points

00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,600
after listening to a mozart piece

00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,840
compared to relaxing instructions or

00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:12,000
just silence

00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,600
set of research results that indicate

00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,200
that listening to mozart's music may

00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,640
induce a short-term improvement on the

00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,200
performance of certain kinds of mental

00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,120
tasks

00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,799
known as spatial temporal reasoning so

00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,320
that's the mozart effect basically the

00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:23,840
idea that listening to mozart

00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,840
will make you able to perform better due

00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,760
to better ability to vote

00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,160
now music is a stimulator i think we all

00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,919
know that we all know can evoke emotion

00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,679
give you the feels and it can also move

00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,360
your your brain in every direction but

00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,120
in 1993 rasher and his

00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,480
colleagues made a surprising claim they

00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,840
thought it was all about mozart

00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,640
specifically

00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:44,880
mozart sonata for two pianos k448 for

00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:47,520
about 10 minutes it's a 10 minute piece

00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,360
um but the interesting thing is what

00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,280
does this have to do with coding

00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,799
at heart we as coders are really doing

00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:55,200
things with words translating them

00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:56,720
into mathematics music is essentially an

00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,600
artistic representation of mathematics

00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,240
using sound

00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,760
so the jump's not monstrously large so

00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,039
developers mathematicians scientists of

00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,320
every shape and size

00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,760
weren't even an afterthought for these

00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,880
researchers they didn't really care

00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,240
about that their nature

00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,799
their initial focus was patients with

00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,880
epilepsy alzheimer's als or lou gehrig's

00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:14,720
disease and other maladies in the brain

00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,080
the fact is once they started testing on

00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,080
controlled group of people

00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,200
without any issues with their brain they

00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:22,400
found that music to be

00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:24,240
just just as if not more stimulating

00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,080
so the researchers at howard oxford

00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,440
tried to reproduce this a few years ago

00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,000
and what they saw was kind of

00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:32,799
interesting so the issue was

00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
it wasn't just mozart they just only

00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,679
used mozart in the original

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,039
test so the folks at harvard oxford

00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,679
realized it could have been the bieber

00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,039
effect

00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,960
it's a similar effect that could be

00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,320
tracked so let's all try to control

00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,280
ourselves as we gaze at what could be

00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,360
the future

00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,280
of the improved mental performance in

00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:49,440
reality however bieber is not the answer

00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:51,200
while being partial to pieces of music

00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,000
is important another important part is

00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,440
the contents

00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,960
not every song will be moving and not

00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,840
every song will give you a cognitive

00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,840
boost

00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,000
okay so it's important to note this

00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,919
cognitive boost is also not permanent

00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,200
um if that's the case i i've listened to

00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:04,559
enough music in my life and probably

00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,760
just today to be the most intelligent

00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,440
person on the planet

00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,120
possibly the universe how most of us

00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,640
have i mean let's be realistic

00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,559
the effect of music on your performances

00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,679
coder will be short-lived now the sense

00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:15,520
that you'll become like charlie from

00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,880
flowers for algernon after the fact

00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,640
but more likely to have a steady

00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,679
decrease after you stop listening

00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:23,360
back to your normal brain brain sense um

00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,799
additionally the efficacy

00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,320
of the same music repeatedly will mean

00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:27,120
that you kind of get used to it kind of

00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,799
like when you

00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,240
take a drug for so long and eventually

00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,200
kind of goes down

00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,360
so this is where it gets a bit

00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,720
complicated all of this starts with your

00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,000
preferences so if you're raised in a

00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,600
certain culture even if it was in the

00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,120
united states

00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,559
you have a certain preference to music

00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,200
your parents or caretakers listen to

00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,240
certain music

00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,400
there's a type of music in other

00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,320
relatives houses this all influences

00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,720
what you listen to today

00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,320
um in south by southwest keynote a few

00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,799
years ago bruce springsteen the boss

00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:54,480
specifically the one we all work for

00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:55,679
addressed the issue of genre sometimes

00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,400
this is a problem

00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:59,440
he opined we ought not to get too caught

00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,200
up in what's right

00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,720
and stop paying attention to what sounds

00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,880
good and what makes us feel good

00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,559
that's what we should focus on when we

00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,919
feel good we work better so don't get

00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,120
too stuck on this

00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,720
so it's important that while you're

00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,240
seeing what floats your proverbially

00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,159
proverbial boat

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,480
is good do be careful not to have a

00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,919
placebo effect it kind of works like

00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,520
like this you like the music you're

00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,480
listening to so it seems effective so

00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,720
you're reluctant to

00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,559
branch out finding new music is a key

00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,159
part of this so just like working on one

00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:27,440
project over time can cause stagnation

00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,559
and mental constipation

00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,480
listening to the same music over and

00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:31,760
over again can cause the same problem so

00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,799
what you need to do is find things that

00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,720
are tangentially

00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:36,320
reasonable and similar to your tastes

00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,880
find a new boat if you know it floats

00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,640
your boat

00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,240
find other boats pandora used to be a

00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,080
great way to do this discover weekly on

00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,559
spotify works really well for this

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:46,000
um musicforprogramming.com this is a

00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:47,520
dedicated providing a mix of tunes to

00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,799
help aid in focusing concentrations you

00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,600
should check that out

00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:52,720
um so the riaa is really cool sharing

00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,559
music but who cares

00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,000
if you have no other way to do it do it

00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:58,000
yourself start playing

00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,520
start playing your instruments and and

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,799
exploring your space i just recently

00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,240
picked up the trumpet i don't know how

00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:04,159
to play it but it sure is fun

00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,440
and if no other way do with code so with

00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:07,870
that thank you very much and listen to

00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:11,000
music we'll talk to you soon

00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:11,000
[Music]

00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,080
i think i have the ad as well correct

00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,000
you do go for it

00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:20,240
um so my ad is actually for one of the

00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,240
companies i work with matter most

00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,320
everybody knows about slack you know

00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,360
what slack is you use it every day but

it's my middle name yes we're friends

00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:35,600
and i didn't know that

00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,200
what's your first name james

00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,960
interesting uh what might people know

00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,039
you from

00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,720
they might know me from threadless where

00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:44,400
we made a lot of t-shirts

00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:47,840
probably the obama campaign where we

00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:50,799
elected a president and maybe from

00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,520
honestly talking on the internet all

00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:54,720
right okay

00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:58,559
um will you ever not be known

00:24:54,720 --> 00:25:00,880
as obama's cto you know i have

00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:02,640
tried to do interesting things since

00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,480
then and

00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,559
i think i've been moderately successful

00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,919
but it's kind of an okay legacy to be

00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:10,559
known for

00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:11,120
i'm not so worried about it yeah okay

00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,480
cool

00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,279
what was the first computer you ever

00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:17,200
used apple 2c

00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:18,880
um when did you write your first line of

00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,559
code and what was your first stop

00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,080
oh probably around the same time i got

00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:25,279
an apple 2c basic

00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:27,200
it was probably to move some little

00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:29,039
robot around in the classroom

00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,840
or maybe actually it was logo and i

00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:34,320
think about it logo and a turtle

00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,600
quick leading to basic though i'm going

00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,480
to ask a question from the chat here

00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,320
someone wants to know how you got the

00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,960
job as obama's cto

00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:42,400
it was actually relatively complicated

00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,080
and by when i say that i mean there's

00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,559
not a real way to replicate it or to

00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:49,679
kind of plan for it but i had built a

00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:51,520
network of people working in technology

00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,279
for about five or six years here in

00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:55,279
chicago and

00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:57,039
it just one thing led to another i just

00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:58,559
bounced from one person to the next and

00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:59,760
then someone said hey you should talk to

00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:01,039
this guy michael slaby

00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,320
and michael celebi was like hey do you

00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:03,679
want to help out with the obama campaign

00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,679
and i was like absolutely

00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:06,880
and i helped out hiring and i helped out

00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:08,640
kind of architecting

00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,559
kind of a plan for building cheap

00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:15,039
infrastructure um this was

00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:16,640
2011 so cloud wasn't as big a deal

00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,159
um and so it was really actually uh you

00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,480
had to do some effort

00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:22,720
and that kind of led to them saying oh

00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,799
maybe you should be cto and i

00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,400
had a lot of imposter syndrome and was

00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:28,240
like no way that's crazy

00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,520
um and then of course i talked to my

00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,039
father and my partner and they were both

00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,360
like you have to do this this is a this

00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:33,760
is an

00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:36,080
awesome opportunity and i was like okay

00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:38,720
super scary though

00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,760
where'd you get sweet frames um a brand

00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:43,120
called cooper round

00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:45,919
yeah from berlin all right um

00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,559
in in as fast a time as possible tell us

00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,600
about your

00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:51,120
latest work related to covet this year

00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,559
yeah so i mean like many of us i was

00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,000
stuck in my basement and i spent a lot

00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:55,120
of time trying to figure out how to be

00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,679
helpful and

00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:59,200
one of the things that i know that i can

00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:00,880
do probably like many of y'all

00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,159
is we know technology very well and

00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,080
there's a lot of spaces that don't know

00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:05,600
technology so i tried to help out and be

00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:08,880
an advocate for

00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:10,960
you know helping technology um

00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,480
or helping spaces that don't have tech

00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,960
do tech work around covid

00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,679
a lot of contact tracing a lot of uh you

00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,799
know making

00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:21,039
uh places more efficient around tech a

00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:22,799
lot of this is honestly just connecting

00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:25,120
people who have the skills with people

00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:26,720
who want people that have the skills

00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,960
a lot of it was talking about open

00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,799
source a lot of us talk about privacy

00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,720
i'm actually very happy that almost all

00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:34,799
of the kind of

00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,000
conversations we had resolved revolved

00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:37,520
around open source

00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,120
um obviously i did a lot of work with

00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:41,360
dan kong who

00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,960
um passed away earlier this i think

00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,600
about this month and it was really sad

00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,039
but

00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,640
from the linux foundation a lot of that

00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:48,640
work was really great

00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:50,640
and it continues to be great and and it

00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:53,200
was really exciting to see

00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,840
open source be such a big part of that

00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,000
process

00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:57,840
and everyone just kind of expected it

00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,600
right well so just on that last bit

00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,600
everybody expected it can you trace a

00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,360
line between possibly the open source

00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,720
approach you took during the obama

00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,960
campaign and

00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,760
um is there an arc that exists between

00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,720
that and

00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:12,000
everybody just expected it to be part of

00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,200
the solution

00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,520
i don't know if there's an arc between

00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:18,159
the obama campaign and

00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:20,240
2020 in regards to open source but i do

00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:22,240
think that when you start talking to

00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,520
governments when you start talking to

00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,159
folks that are trying to get a lot of

00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,399
stuff done

00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:27,840
very quickly with no time and no

00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:30,159
resources

00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,760
oftentimes they're building on on you

00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:33,279
know the backs of a lot of open source

00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,600
developers they're building on a lot of

00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:36,320
the

00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,679
foundations that that people like us

00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,399
have created people like y'all have

00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:40,240
created

00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:41,600
um and they're doing that work they're

00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,600
focusing on that because

00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,279
it's accessible and it's available and

00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,960
one of the things that i noticed is that

00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:48,480
a lot of people were looking for service

00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,360
orders people who could support this

00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,640
work

00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,399
and there's a lot of people making money

00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,000
off of open source and then there's a

00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:55,679
lot of people who are building

00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,520
really great products really great

00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:59,279
companies and it's all open source and

00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,960
it's just it's just makes me very happy

00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:03,039
being that my first linux install was in

00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:05,679
1993 um and i'm

00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:07,200
i you know i run it today so it's like

00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:09,279
for me this was like yes

00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,200
you know finally this is i think every

00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:12,880
time i i've run into this i'm like

00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,159
finally even though it's happened over

00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,000
and over again it's like every time i'm

00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:18,799
so excited

00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,559
nice uh what um what tech are you most

00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:24,000
excited about right now

00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:27,039
oh man um

00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,559
i really am excited about wireguard i

00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:29,919
get really excited about vpns

00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:32,240
i get really excited about software

00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:33,600
defined networks um mostly just because

00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,480
it solves this problem that i think is a

00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,760
real pain in the butt

00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,960
it's just like how do you connect these

00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,919
two computers that are in disparate

00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,760
locations

00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:41,360
um you know i think that's that's

00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,640
something that is fun i've been

00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:44,159
you know i'm really excited about tail

00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,320
scale which is using the wire guard

00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:47,520
technology to make a more consumer

00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:50,960
friendly vpn

00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:53,520
um and it's pretty exciting um i am

00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,240
you know i i just installed pop os and

00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,000
i've been a

00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,840
ubuntu user for many years i just called

00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,880
popos i'm actually pretty stoked about

00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:01,919
how easy and

00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:03,840
it is so

00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:05,840
right now i'm just kind of focused on on

00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,799
some making my dev environment a little

00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,760
bit better

00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:09,440
i'm really excited actually to hear

00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,640
about barrier pj told me about a couple

00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,000
days ago and just to hear it in the

00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,799
conversation earlier today was really

00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,880
good because

00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:16,320
this is a problem that i want to solve

00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,840
but so for me you can see it's very

00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,399
myopic like i'm thinking just about the

00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,320
things that are

00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:21,919
kind of right in front of me and that's

00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,720
because you know i've been programming

00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:24,159
computers

00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,080
for the last six months building this

00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:27,440
fun project and

00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,799
a lot of it has just been about how can

00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,840
i eke out the smallest amount of

00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:32,320
performance

00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,600
um from my my workstation and and that's

00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,200
kind of it so i'm super stoked about

00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,120
that so if anyone has any other ideas

00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,799
please send them our way

00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:41,919
question from bj do you own a t-shirt

00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:44,720
with sleeves i

00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:46,080
don't i mean i do i buy t-shirts with

00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,240
sleeves but then i cut them off because

00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:50,960
i try and be cool and show off my guns

00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:54,320
try try try uh what advice do you have

00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:57,279
for people who are new to leading teams

00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:58,000
um i think the hardest thing that i had

00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:00,799
to learn

00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,600
was how important it is to listen during

00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:04,399
leadership

00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:06,240
um oftentimes we think about leading

00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:08,000
like you are in the front

00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,080
but oftentimes it's important for you to

00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,720
be in the middle listening to everything

00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,120
around you

00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,000
hearing what people are saying i

00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,600
remember when

00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,960
i was leading my first teams at

00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,080
threadless back in the day and one of

00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:21,360
the things i i

00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:22,480
did was i tried to replace all the work

00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,080
that i like to do

00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,840
with people who like to do it more than

00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,279
i did what that meant is i had a bunch

00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,159
of crappy work that i didn't like to do

00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:30,080
at the end

00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:31,600
but what was really neat is to see those

00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,480
people flourish and become leaders in

00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,559
their own

00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,159
in their own kind of right in those in

00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,760
those organizations and

00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:40,080
and it was really nice to just sit back

00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:42,640
and kind of watch them

00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,200
do great work also i got to do less work

00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,840
which is

00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,039
ultimately my goal in life is less yeah

00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,760
i guess there's only so much you can

00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:51,039
automate

00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:53,120
um vim remax or vs code

00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:54,960
i mean vim but vs code seems to have

00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:58,480
taken over the world which i'm not

00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:59,679
so i'm fine with it it's good yeah

00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,760
what can people do to get started in

00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:03,600
open source do you think

00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,279
oh man i you know i i always think that

00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,480
the best thing to do is just

00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:08,320
look at the pull requests that are

00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,480
available on some of these big suck

00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:12,840
project projects like a documentation

00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,240
pull request and just jump in and do it

00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:16,720
um

00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:18,960
it feels so scary to me even today in

00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,519
2020 to make a poll request on a public

00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,760
product

00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:23,919
project it freaks me out but when i do

00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,120
it and it's accepted or i do it even if

00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:26,640
it's not accepted even if they're just

00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,039
like this is not up to the quality that

00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,960
we

00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:30,640
we appreciate you know i'm just like

00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,000
well i did it and it's out there and the

00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,279
idea is out there and that's the thing

00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,320
that's important to me is pushing that

00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:35,360
idea out there

00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,120
getting it out there and having that

00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,159
conversation even if it is scary but

00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,159
yeah just those little

00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:41,519
there's lots of help needed tagged pull

00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:43,279
requests all over the internet that are

00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:46,559
just looking for someone to jump in

00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:47,919
fix documentation fix a small bug um

00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:49,600
and and it's a great way to learn and

00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:52,159
meet people

00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:53,919
yeah right on um one more question um

00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:56,080
because i think we've gone way over

00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:57,279
there we go it's the milk probably most

00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,480
important question you've been ever been

00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:01,360
asked

00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,360
times or spaces

00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:06,880
there's spaces i mean i'm not an animal

00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:12,240
grunt okay that's it thanks for having

00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,240
us

00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:20,399
[Music]

00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:24,000
okay and owen has just submitted a talk

00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:26,880
there here he comes alright i think that

00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,480
works we can hear you so share your

00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,000
screen and you're all set

00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,519
all right and where's the share screen

00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:39,760
button again

00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:42,480
right bottom center yes yeah thank you

00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:43,120
all right so yeah i just threw this

00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,240
together

00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:50,960
really really quick and

00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,960
uh and pulling it up together so

00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:58,159
uh if this is at all um

00:33:55,039 --> 00:34:00,159
interesting uh then you can thank joe

00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:03,600
marks otherwise you can blame them

00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:06,720
uh so anyway so i

00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:08,000
uh my name is owen shardle um i've been

00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:11,839
working around

00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,919
uh you know tampering with arduino

00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:16,480
projects a lot over the years

00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:18,639
and recently i've been working on a

00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,800
couple things related to

00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:22,159
like automating things with music and

00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:25,280
and stuff like that or

00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:26,639
uh little gadgets and guitar pedals and

00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,000
i wanted to try to share a little bit of

00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:35,839
it

00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:35,839
um let me go to present

00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:41,040
all right so arduino if you're not

00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:43,040
familiar it is um an open source

00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,960
electronics platform based on easy to

00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,639
use hardware and software

00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,000
um definitely check it out if you

00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:50,879
haven't yet

00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,760
um so when i'm starting a project with

00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:53,760
arduino

00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,800
um you know little microprocessors

00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:58,320
circuit boards

00:34:54,800 --> 00:35:01,440
i i want to find an idea something i

00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:05,680
wish i could automate um and

00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,680
you know where where do you start um

00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,119
oftentimes i like to start with the code

00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:11,680
once once i have

00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:12,880
any idea at all recently one of the

00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:17,200
things was

00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:20,640
uh keeping a tempo controlling a tempo

00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:22,800
on a uh of a guitar pedal if

00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:24,000
you're familiar so how many beats per

00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,760
minute

00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,280
you would like a delay or a loop or

00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:30,480
something to happen

00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:32,560
um and there are ways to

00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:34,240
to tamper with that so i'll jump into

00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,280
code i'll try to get like some pseudo

00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:38,320
code in there

00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:40,079
just to have anything and then i'll jump

00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:43,520
over and i'll start some schematics

00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:47,680
on on some some of the

00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:48,880
uh uh some of the circuitry that i that

00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:52,560
i'd like to play around with

00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:54,800
um once you start getting that together

00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,680
you can actually pull out your arduino

00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,359
uh you

00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:01,760
you start putting all the pins and the

00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:01,760
circuitry together you upload your code

00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:08,320
which again arduino has an open source

00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,320
ide

00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,359
which is mostly c plus plus you'll see

00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,200
uh

00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:18,160
but there are ways to tamper with other

00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:20,320
things in there um

00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:22,000
so yeah you just you work on your code

00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:24,400
uh you could pilot you

00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,079
you upload it to the board and you get

00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,560
your pins all connected

00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:30,480
uh how you want things to work you're

00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:33,920
kind of working iteratively

00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:37,760
uh over and over um until eventually

00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:39,920
you have uh more of a product

00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,599
that you're getting to so here's a

00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,160
couple pictures of things i've soldered

00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:43,599
together

00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,359
and i've actually gone through the steps

00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:48,400
of getting a pcb which is a

00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:50,000
printed circuit board um so after you

00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:53,119
get your schematics

00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:57,040
something i've used is

00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:58,400
easy eda um i can share all this stuff

00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,480
later at some point if anyone wants it

00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,960
but here's where you can make

00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:04,400
schematics there's a couple tools out

00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,599
there on the internet

00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,440
and then you can get them actually

00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:08,880
printed out so you don't have to worry

00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,640
about your prototype board like this

00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,960
picture in the top left

00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,960
um

00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:17,760
like having wires everywhere you can

00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:20,880
actually get the nice uh

00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:22,960
nice copper lines um so this this thing

00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:26,960
here was actually to control

00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:30,000
automated lights to music um basically i

00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:33,119
send it midi control messages to control

00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:36,800
turning off devices and also controlling

00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:36,800
dmx controlled lighting

00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:42,640
which i don't have enough time to talk

00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:42,640
about that stuff but basically

00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:48,240
my process has just been

00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,520
build it document it try it build a

00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:52,640
document and try it

00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:57,760
over and over and over

00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:57,760
um i recently just uploaded a

00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:03,359
project to github if you want to check

00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:06,880
it out so it's a midi tap tempo pedal

00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:10,640
um basically you can either send it

00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:13,200
midi messages which are just um like uh

00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:14,400
that's type of like instrument

00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,800
communication

00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,520
so so basically musical instruments can

00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,160
communicate

00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,520
using computers how to represent things

00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:24,720
like notes or

00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:28,000
or or modulation

00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:30,240
in this case it's going to

00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,560
allow you to automate the tempo of

00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:35,839
pedals that used to not be automated

00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:36,160
um using a 5 volt signal but it'll also

00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:38,480
tap

00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:40,320
into newer devices that do support midi

00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:42,560
directly

00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:44,400
and along the way again like i said you

00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:46,000
want to document it so so you can come

00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,720
back to it if you get stuck

00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,720
on your project

00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:54,000
and yeah get your schematics together

00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:57,839
get your code together

00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:00,880
document it get up there on open source

00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:03,280
and get your projects built it's totally

00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,280
worth it

00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,320
all right

00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:18,480
that was fast

00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:22,560
that's the magic of five minutes

00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,560
it comes in yeah

00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:29,040
just made that presentation at 3 30 so

00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:31,119
uh critique lightly

00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:32,800
thanks everybody you're not the only one

00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:35,359
to do that i once was

00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:36,480
out at oscar somebody said a regular

00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:38,160
lightning talk speaker

00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,440
from other conferences sat in the front

00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,400
row with the speakers they said you're

00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:43,760
not on the schedule

00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:45,839
he said put me on again and

00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:48,160
about an hour later he had his five

00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:50,000
minutes and he went up

00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,839
most people can't do that quite so

00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,079
quickly but anyway

00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:56,240
thank you for speaking thank you to all

00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:59,520
six of our speakers who did our house

00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:02,160
seven speakers and six lightning talks

00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:03,280
i will be putting the information on

00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:06,800

00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:11,599

00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:29,839
kilometers doing lightning talks so

00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:31,359

really i just like to start off by

00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,640
saying reiterating once again

00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,800
thank you all so much for working with

the entire cpas team this year with all

00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,200
tremendous job and everyone who's been

together

00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:37,440
there's really been two incredible mvps

00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:39,119
to make this conference possible first

00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:41,599
off is the cpas director

00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:43,119
that's mel wall who really has put in a

00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:45,440
tremendous amount of effort

00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:47,359
to bring this event to you today and

00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:49,440
also elise ewing who also

00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:51,440
just put in so much time and energy it's

00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:53,119
just it's if you've not organized an

00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,880
event like this

00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:56,880
it's it's kind of hard to understand

00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:59,280
just how much energy

00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,880
and uh commitment and uh and time you

00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,640
have to bring to an event so i just like

00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,359
to call out those two ladies for once

00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,599
again

00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:07,119
an incredible incredible effort to uh

00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:09,200
bring this event to you

00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:12,000
and just in closing i'd like to say this

00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:15,200
is a uh this is a small community

00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,800
but don't underestimate your role in

00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:18,240
creating big waves so

00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,839
not just the speakers but everybody

00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:21,680
who's been in attendance

00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:22,960
it's a small but it's a powerful it's an

00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:25,680
open community

00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:27,359
and it's not only educators like myself

00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:29,760
that can make a dramatic

00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:31,839
uh imprint or difference in the world

00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,480
you know all of your skills all of your

00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:36,160
talents

00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:38,160
your creativity your your ability to

00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:39,359
to create new things and to create

00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:41,599
connections

00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:43,280
that can be a force for good so i think

00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:44,880
if you've learned anything today i hope

00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,640
you've picked up new tricks and tips

00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,560
you've made great connections with old

00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,920
friends and new friends

00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:51,760
but i hope that you don't forget that

00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:54,000
you have the ability to go out and

00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:55,599
and make the world a better place so if

00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,319
there's any message to leave you with i

00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:57,920
hope that's it

00:43:56,319 --> 00:44:00,240
you know this has been an extraordinary

00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:02,160
year it's been an extraordinary time

00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,920
don't underestimate yourself don't

00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:05,119
underestimate the power of a small

00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:07,440
community

00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:09,200
and those are our parting words for you

00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,720
today so once again thank you all for

00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:12,240
participating with us on behalf of the

00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:14,560
entire cpas team

00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:16,560
thank you to our speakers our attendees

00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:18,560
