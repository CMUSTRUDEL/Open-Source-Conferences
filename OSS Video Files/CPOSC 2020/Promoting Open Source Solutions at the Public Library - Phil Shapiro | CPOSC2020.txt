hi

00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,639
this is phil shapiro welcome to my talk

00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:10,160
promoting open source solutions at the

00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:13,040
public library

00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,719
at the central pa open source conference

00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,199
2020.

00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:18,240
so i work at a public library in

00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,439
maryland

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:24,880
and i'm very fortunate that my library

00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,920
is a linux public library we are very

00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,920
strongly

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,000
uh in favor of open source at this

00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:34,320
library we have 27

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,079
linux stations available to the public

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,760
and i've been working there 15 years

00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,520
people just come in and get their work

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,719
done and they don't even know they're

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,879
not using windows

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,079
we have libreoffice and firefox and

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,120
chrome

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,680
and my job

00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,199
is pretty much like an open source

00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,719
genius bar

00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,640
people come to me with any kind of

00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,840
question and

00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,600
and i give them answers to their

00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,399
questions and i help them use the

00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,800
computers

00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,640
and people trust me because i'm not

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,760
selling them anything

00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,240
so um i'm creating this i wanted to give

00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,240
this presentation today

00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,159
to help pass along tips and ideas for

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:18,000
how your public library

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:22,640
can become more promoting of open source

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,799
so uh that's the purpose of my talk to

00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:28,000
help give you some tips and ideas

00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:30,000
uh there are uh easier

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,759
more accessible tips and more kind of

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,799
medium and more advanced tips

00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:37,200
i'm going to cover all of them

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,920
libraries are places where the possible

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,000
lives

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,159
so you've heard it from other people

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,040
books are like a doorway to a whole new

00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,040
world

00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,320
and books can give you education which

00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,520
can improve your life

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:52,159
and your livelihood but open source is

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,799
so much like that open source can give

00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,159
you

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,439
doorways to opportunities can can it

00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,520
might sometimes help you with your

00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,840
livelihood

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,840
so

00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,119
you probably already know that different

00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,039
public libraries have different levels

00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,640
of commitment to open source

00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:12,400
so at my library we have a strong

00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,120
commitment to open source

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,599
it's part of our kind of practice of the

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,599
library

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,760
but your public library can have a

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,319
greater

00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,239
commitment to open source through your

00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:29,360
involvement

00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:31,200
you yourself can help um

00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,640
increase the library's commitment in

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,239
lots of small and bigger ways

00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,519
so what are the easiest steps you can

00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:41,599
take what's the low hanging fruit

00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,599
well one thing i think that you ought to

00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,000
think about is teaching libra office

00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,599
draw

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,959
program and you could teach it via zoom

00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:52,959
or in person after the pandemic

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,200
libra office draws a simple vector

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,120
drawing program

00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,959
and this is what i like to do i like to

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,159
find funny photos of animals on the web

00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,319
and i make them speak

00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:03,599
using these speech bubbles kind of like

00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,599
a cartoon thing

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,840
and then you can ask youth what do you

00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,840
think this animal is saying

00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,879
so if you ask that to a use if you find

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,400
a funny photo

00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,239
the youth will tell you a very

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,920
interesting story about what that animal

00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:19,680
is saying and so what it comes very

00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:23,440
playful way of

00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:26,319
bringing technology skills to somebody

00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,120
using a free software tool and it's also

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,840
a literary

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:34,560
it's a it's a language arts uh

00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:37,040
activity um so here is something that i

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,799
found just to show you what you can do

00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,000
and i made a presentation on this very

00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,560
topic at the american library

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,680
association about 10 years ago

00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,000
how to use libreoffice draw with these

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,040
call

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,319
outs uh in language arts so

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,840
um that was in philadelphia about 10

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,239
years ago

00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,840
so i found a creative commons photo of a

00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,519
camel here

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,200
and i added a speech bubble isn't that

00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,120
an attractive speech bubble

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,280
the really neat thing about libreoffice

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,200
draw is that you have very good control

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,959
of the speech bubble like where you put

00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:12,400
the the bottom

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:14,080
part of it um and then i

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,639
changed the background of the speech

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,320
bubble to kind of a sand color

00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,239
but since this is we were camels and

00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:23,600
this is maybe the sahara desert

00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:24,960
um so and then i also put in the

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,639
creative commons license

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,759
so there's the creative commons license

00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,040
i put that right here into the

00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,840
presentation

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,320
and uh so this nice photo was shared by

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,160
uh

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,160
charles fred his that was

00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,080
so this is also an ideal opportunity to

00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,759
teach the creative commons when you're

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,400
teaching libra office drawing with

00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:49,360
photos and speech bubbles

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,160
the creative commons is an ally of open

00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,520
source

00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,720
because it's its mission is to promote

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,160
creativity

00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:01,680
and the sharing of uh the best of our

00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,680
the best creative work that we can

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:10,560
here's another idea of what you can do

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,280
very simply to get your public library

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,560
to be more

00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:17,199
promoting of open source find find the

00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,560
the interesting books on open source

00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,800
related topics

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,600
a good starting point is the book of

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,919
audacity

00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,720
it's an excellent guidebook very well

00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:27,680
written

00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,080
i did a book review for make magazine

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,759
and

00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:33,680
this is a 2013 book review you could

00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,840
recommend that your public library buy

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,400
this book it's still being published

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,240
and send them a copy of this review copy

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,000
and paste the url and say

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,160
i think our library ought to buy this

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,240
book

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,520
audacity is such an interesting program

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:52,320
i use it quite often

00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,199
for different multimedia projects i'm

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,199
working on

00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,600
and digital storytelling projects i'm

00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,600
working on

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,639
another thing that you can do at your

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,479
public library is

00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:08,720
ask the library managers if

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,840
libreoffice is installed on the public

00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,080
access computer so

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,680
you might have windows computers with

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,360
microsoft office but there's no reason

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,680
why you can't have microsoft office

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,960
and libreoffice installed on the same

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,720
computer

00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,000
ask them if tux payne is installed tux

00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,400
paint has been downloaded

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,680
millions of times it's a drawing program

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,680
for young kids

00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,600
they say they say it's suitable for like

00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,919
four to ten year olds or four to twelve

00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,880
i've seen three year old kids just adore

00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,960
tux pain

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,319
and my public library the three-year-old

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,000
kids they gurgle

00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,440
with delight when they sitting at a

00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,759
computer with tux paint

00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,960
tux paint is so well designed and so

00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,520
playful

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,240
and enjoyable and of course adults can

00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,960
also use

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,479
software that's for kids to you know

00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,199
there are some adults who might have

00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,919
some

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,680
uh phobias about using computers or

00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:57,039
computers are not their thing but if you

00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,039
get them drawing

00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,639
uh with a fun program maybe get them

00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:03,440
drawing with the kid have the kids sit

00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:05,120
on the adult's lap

00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,199
ask ask your library if they have

00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,120
inkscape installed so inkscape is an

00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,599
equivalent of adobe illustrator

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,960
it's outstanding software keeps getting

00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,840
better so it's not only

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,919
free but every year it keeps getting

00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,599
better and

00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:22,720
i've heard that some features of

00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:25,599
inkscape go beyond adobe illustrator

00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,440
 is the equivalent of photoshop uh

00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:29,280
it also keeps getting better

00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,440
it's very powerful tool you can learn

00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,440
all about go to youtube this

00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,520
there's thousands of tutorials about

00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:38,800
 you can learn those

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,800
learn how to use for free

00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,400
another thing you can do at your public

00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:46,800
library is to

00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:48,960
ask and organize ask the library staff

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,560
if they're interested in hosting an

00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,560
install fest

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,720
and you can find volunteers in your

00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,720
local linux user group i hope you belong

00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:00,080
to a linux user group

00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:02,400
and um or just find a couple of friends

00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:05,840
of yours who love open source

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:09,280
and um you can install if you this is

00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:11,120
post pandemic typically or maybe even

00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:14,160
during the pandemic but outdoors

00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,879
you know in a safe uh um you can have

00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,160
windows you

00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:20,879
change update windows xp or upgrade to

00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,319
linux and uh all of a sudden the

00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,080
computer has new life

00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,400
windows vista computers if you have a

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:29,120
vista laptop it runs twice

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,400
as fast sometimes three times as fast

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,760
with linux installed

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:36,320
as it does with with with vista i put

00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,800
linux and old macbooks i sometimes

00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,279
install

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,399
cloud ready that turns a macbook into a

00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,919
chromebook

00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,640
and sometimes i'd like to put on linux

00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:47,120
mint i adore linux mint

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,160
so those old macbooks from like 2006

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,959
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,160
you can't put on like a new uh a current

00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:55,839
web browser

00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:58,720
so the best way of of refurbishing them

00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:02,399
is to put linux on them it might give

00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,399
them two or three more years of life

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,320
okay your public library needs to have

00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,160
some

00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,760
uh involvement with the raspberry pi

00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:13,200
it's such a fascinating computer

00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:14,800
millions have been sold and um

00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,399
so some public libraries i believe are

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,800
loaning out raspberry pi's they loan

00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,120
them out

00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,480
with a little kit or something but you

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,959
can also have classes

00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,760
or trainings at the library you could do

00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,519
your trainings by

00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,640
zoom you could have some zoom kind of

00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:31,279
thing where you can explain about

00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,000
computer programming on the pi or any

00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:36,560
kind of

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:40,080
uh hardware project with the pi

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:44,000
um my very favorite raspberry pi

00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:45,519
project uh that i happen to hear about

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,760
is called the trivia vending machine

00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,920
from the dallas makerspace

00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,360
and you can find it on youtube look up

00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,000
trivia vending machine

00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,959
so here we have a couple of people who

00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,120
have built

00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,959
they took a vending machine that they

00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,480
bought on craigslist

00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,480
they took out the money part and they

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,560
put in a raspberry pi

00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,600
and the only way to get the food out of

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,600
the machine

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,680
is to write science questions is to

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:13,519
answer science questions

00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:15,440
so um uh what a very interesting

00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,880
invention and they give away

00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,880
the people who made this they made it

00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,959
just for fun there is no

00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,000
patent they they're not intending to

00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,920
market it

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,720
uh or sell it they just wanted to invent

00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:29,279
it but it's a very interesting prototype

00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,720
i'd love to see a portable version of

00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,240
this

00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,160
put together by different communities

00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,880
where you could you could take it around

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,320
from

00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:41,519
place to place and people could um

00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:43,680
not only not only earn food

00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,519
by answering questions but what we want

00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,120
is we want our students to be writing

00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,079
the questions for the trivia vending

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,120
machine

00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:51,519
and it doesn't have to be science

00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,240
questions it could be literature

00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,519
questions

00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:59,279
or any kind of interesting thing maybe

00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:02,320
maybe a timed math thing or a puzzle or

00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:04,959
there's just a thousand possibilities

00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,320
um you can buy these little vending

00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:08,240
machine the motors that

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,440
turn the thing you can buy those like

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,120
second hand so

00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,560
you could hack together a portable

00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,760
version of this

00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,480
uh invention and it wouldn't wouldn't

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,000
take too much

00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:22,000
effort um and if you track down the

00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,079
people who made it they might have

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,279
the the source code might be on github

00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:30,480
it might be freely available source code

00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:32,640
for uh this little

00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,839
homebrew robotics or not robotics but

00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:37,120
raspberry pi project

00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,440
trivia vending machine so i'm gonna ask

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,360
you

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,720
you're watching my presentation tell

00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,399
people about this tell

00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,040
tell your local library staffer now i do

00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,760
recommend

00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,760
that people establish a relationship

00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,760
with people who work at your library

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,519
so some of the people who work at your

00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,480
library are interested in open source

00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,560
and some are less

00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,120
interested you got to find the ones who

00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,800
are interested and talk to them

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,480
it really does no good to be talking to

00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,279
people who aren't interested in

00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,160
something

00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:07,279
uh it's uh if they're not interested

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,040
that's just a fact

00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:10,800
and then you you talk to the people who

00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,160
are interested and you cultivate that

00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,000
relationship

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,680
and then some sometimes very interesting

00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,480
things can happen when you cultivate

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,480
relationships

00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:26,000
oh and i ought to mention that um

00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,440
perhaps the most powerful thing i can

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,720
tell you today is

00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:32,880
ask questions so send an email to

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,320
your local library or your local library

00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,880
system

00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,399
and ask them if they have raspberry pi's

00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,120
on loan

00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,079
ask them if they have a raspberry pi 400

00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,000
on loan

00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:45,440
so that people can take it home and try

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,440
it out

00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,440
some libraries are going to be

00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,240
responsive to that kind of

00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,959
inquiry and some libraries are less

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,959
responsive

00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:59,360
but uh the library is going to be

00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,000
non-responsive if nobody asks about it

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,200
so

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,320
we do i do want you as an open source

00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:08,160
believer

00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:10,000
to be asking questions send email uh or

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,839
uh if you're visiting the library in

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,399
person talk to people and say

00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,519
uh i'd like to try out a raspberry 5 400

00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,360
it's a

00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:19,440
keyboard with a computer it sounds very

00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,639
interesting you say i want to try it out

00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,480
before i buy it

00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,160
does the library own one is there one

00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:27,440
here at the library that i can try

00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,880
can i take it home so ask those

00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,399
questions

00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,240
let me talk quickly about inkscape

00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,959
because i adore escape

00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,760
i made this video this promotional video

00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,360
um

00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,279
why i love inkscape drawing program i

00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,320
made this way back in 2007.

00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:44,240
inkscape was pretty young back then um

00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,360
but this is another strategy that you

00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,720
can connect

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,839
um to your public library is to maybe

00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,639
set up

00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,920
uh public access stations that are just

00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:57,519
for graphic design

00:13:53,920 --> 00:14:00,720
using and inkscape and blender

00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:02,240
and krita k-r-i-t-a so

00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,000
you could have maybe just a graphic

00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,560
design workstation

00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,680
at your library that's all open source

00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,600
software

00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,279
and so somebody who's never heard or

00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,720
seen of these programs

00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:17,360
um can sit down and

00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,240
uh what you what you as an open source

00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,839
believer can do

00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:23,440
is assemble a playlist of youtube videos

00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,120
that are tutorials about inkscape

00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:29,360
tutorials about blender

00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:31,040
um and or maybe put together a dvd

00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,120
that people can take out and take home

00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,120
and it's got a bunch of youtube videos

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,639
that have been saved or whatever

00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,279
there's lots of different ways that you

00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:42,320
can do things to organize

00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:43,040
so that other people can have a gentle

00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:47,120
ramp an

00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,120
entryway to this

00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:53,839
open clipart website is a a website that

00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,399
collects

00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,760
public domain clip art and libraries

00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,800
ought to be promoting this

00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:03,360
this is public domain clip art

00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:05,680
so your library staff may or may not

00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,519
know about the open clipart website but

00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:10,639
i adore this website

00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:13,440
um i visit often for different

00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:16,160
of graphic design needs my my graphic

00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,160
needs you know

00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:23,600
openclipart.org here's my

00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,399
very favorite piece of of arch there

00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,600
this is called

00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,800
african women with vessels and it looks

00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,800
three-dimensional but it's a

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,600
two-dimensional drawing i think it's

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,399
from somebody in

00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,040
england who has incredible artistic

00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,800
talent

00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,320
and this was made with inkscape this was

00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,160
made with the free vector graphics

00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:43,040
drawing program

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,240
it's an svg scalable vector graphics

00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,759
drawing

00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:51,519
and it just shows you the possibilities

00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:53,040
uh another thing on open clip art

00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:55,360
open clip art is a very practical

00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:58,240
website so it helps you answer

00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,040
practical questions such as what if you

00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,279
were stranded

00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,360
on a desert island if you were stranded

00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,639
on a desert island

00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,160
you know that's an important question

00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,880
that all of us should ought to think

00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,639
about

00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,360
and this is what a dessert island looks

00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:14,320
like

00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:17,600
d-e-s-s-e-r-t what happens if you were

00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,600
on a dessert island

00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,440
you might not have heard about this new

00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:25,680
android phone that cost thirty five

00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:28,399
dollars

00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:30,079
and it's called the weco ride two i

00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:32,160
believe it's designed in france

00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:34,160
thank you france it's available from

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:37,199
boost mobile here in the united states

00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,639
but this is a really nice smartphone for

00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:41,279
35 dollars

00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,639
uh i bought one just to try it out it's

00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,240
two gigs of ram

00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,639
i'm gonna be installing ubuntu linux on

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,759
this thing uh look it's got 32 gigs of

00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,800
storage

00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:54,079
um but your public library could have

00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:56,160
one or two or three of these on hand uh

00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:58,480
that people can try them out just to see

00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,279
how responsive they are because this is

00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,639
a 35

00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:06,559
phone but um five years ago 35

00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:08,720
phone would be barely usable

00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:10,400
but today it's actually a pretty nice

00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,799
phone

00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,880
and it costs less than the it costs less

00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:18,799
than a case if you buy a case for an

00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:22,000
iphone the case costs more than 35

00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:23,679
so here you get the whole phone but this

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,760
is the role of the public library is to

00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:28,799
show that this is possible

00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:33,600
because the library needs to

00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:36,720
bring this possibility to people's view

00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:38,799
people who are unemployed or in other

00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,720
ways vulnerable

00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:42,559
they need information that can empower

00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,400
their lives and that's the purpose of

00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:45,679
the public libraries to empower people

00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,320
in their lives

00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,840
so you could send a question to your

00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,559
public library and say does

00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:54,400
does our library have one of these new

00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:57,440
android phones for 35

00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,440
that i could try out

00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,000
either at the library or if the library

00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,880
is very forward thinking you could take

00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,280
it home

00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,280
try it out take it home and um

00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:15,840
here's another uh of uh of us

00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,840
so now now we've we've kind of bypassed

00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,559
the easier things to do

00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:23,280
that you can do for your library or with

00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:25,760
your library to promote open source

00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,200
the there's other things you can do you

00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,360
can make screencasts

00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,240
so i made the screencast about gallium

00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,039
os

00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,559
gallium os is the software that takes a

00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:35,760
chromebook and makes it into a full

00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,600
linux laptop

00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,039
it doesn't run on all chromebooks but it

00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,200
runs on many

00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:43,520
especially chromebooks from about 2013

00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:46,000
onwards the earlier chromebooks

00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:48,000
italian os won't install i don't think

00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,400
but you can convert a chromebook to a

00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,880
whole linux laptop

00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,640
using this software called gallium os

00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,400
and

00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,400
and people might not know that this is

00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,320
possible so

00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,480
you can contact your local library staff

00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,799
and say i want to help

00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,840
people in my community understand what's

00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:08,880
possible

00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,440
with chromebooks that have expired so uh

00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,360
when

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,559
when chromebooks are no longer getting

00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,520
updates from

00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:16,000
google then the browser becomes more and

00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,640
more

00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,360
outdated and it becomes less safe to use

00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,880
it

00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:25,919
um and so if we can install

00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:28,559
a full linux on a chromebook then uh

00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,480
the chromebook is detached from google

00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:32,240
and we can install the latest version of

00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,080
chromium browser you can put on the

00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:37,360
latest firefox

00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:39,760
and we can extend the use of these

00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,799
chromebooks which would otherwise be

00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,720
discarded

00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:44,720
you know a chromebook that's no longer

00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:48,160
getting updates at a certain point

00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:50,320
is discarded but um

00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,160
knowledge is power and at the public

00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,160
library we give away knowledge

00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,679
and that's why i make screencasts like

00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,880
this screencast

00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:01,120
um you can see i had 30 30 000 views

00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,000
now that's not a lot but it's also not a

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:05,039
little

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,400
and i believe that i've done my part to

00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:12,159
uh to both support and promote this

00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:14,880
very interesting software solution um

00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:16,720
but other libraries ought to uh other

00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,080
libraries could take what i've done

00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,840
and just have a link on their library

00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:22,080
website and they say do you have an

00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:24,400
older chromebook have you considered

00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:27,120
upgrading it to gallium os

00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:29,280
so that's a very simple thing that a

00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:31,760
library could have on their blog

00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,840
linking to this video and the only

00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,440
reason they have it on the blog is that

00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:38,320
one of their community members

00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:40,720
which is you tell them we should maybe

00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,000
have a link to this on the blog

00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,440
and they'll either think it's a good

00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,320
idea or they won't think it's a good

00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,120
idea

00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:49,120
but i can tell you it's a good idea for

00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:54,080
you to suggest it to them

00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:57,440
so i have another video i made

00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:59,280
um called my 20 ebay laptop i bought a

00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,919
laptop from somebody in new jersey for

00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,280
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:04,880
it's a 2002 dell laptop and believe it

00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,799
or not it actually works pretty well

00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:10,159
with linux mint installed

00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:13,600
um i made this video about six years ago

00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:17,919
but this 2002 laptop um

00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:21,120
is up and working 15 or more years later

00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:24,400
um if you asked 99

00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:26,320
of technology professionals if a 2002

00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:30,000
laptop is obsolete or not

00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:31,840
they would say it's obsolete but the

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,520
person who's saying it's obsolete

00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,760
they've never lived without a laptop in

00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:39,280
their life and so

00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:41,039
their perspective is a privileged

00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,799
perspective

00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:44,320
they don't know what it's like maybe to

00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:46,159
come to

00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,000
another country maybe maybe there's a

00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:49,440
refugee from a war-torn country who

00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,960
comes to united states

00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:55,360
and they they show up here and they

00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,320
need a laptop to get their graduate

00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,600
degree

00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:02,400
while a 20 laptop from 2002

00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,159
it might suit their purposes for them to

00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:07,360
write their master's thesis

00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:08,960
and and do some research online now a

00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:12,640
2002 laptop is not

00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:14,640
fast but it is functional and so

00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,760
we need to be able to move beyond our

00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,080
privilege

00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,280
and try not to use words like obsolete

00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:22,559
technology

00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:24,840
that's a it's a pejorative and and it

00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:26,000
diminishes people who are more

00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:28,080
vulnerable

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,039
so i work at the library where i try to

00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,480
be aware

00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:33,760
of the subtle uses of words in the way

00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,880
that it might diminish

00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:38,640
or empower people so i'm i'm going to

00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,039
suggest that people try not to use the

00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,640
word

00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:44,480
obsolete quite so much

00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,679
people get enough of it when they walk

00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,280
into a store

00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:48,799
they get enough of the word obsolete

00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:52,559
from the sales people so

00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:52,559
they don't need to hear that also at the

00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:56,480
library here's a philosophical question

00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,640
i want you to

00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,320
think about and consider who owns the

00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,320
public library

00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,919
are librarians the landlord of the

00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:07,200
library building

00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:10,080
or are they servants to the community

00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,440
so sometimes when you walk into a

00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,720
library and you're talking with

00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:16,240
library managers uh the

00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,760
uh the relationship between the

00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:21,520
community member and the

00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:22,960
library managers it could be like um

00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,360
the people who are in charge of the

00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:27,919
library they make all the decisions

00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,200
and they don't see themselves as a

00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,520
servant of the community

00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,039
they see themselves more as the landlord

00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:36,240
of the building

00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:39,760
so you have to kind of

00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:41,679
figure out how the uh

00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,600
your library managers how do they feel

00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:46,799
about themselves in their role

00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:49,120
at the library and um

00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:50,880
what we want to do step by step what we

00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,480
want to do is move from the former to

00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,960
the latter

00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,960
over here

00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:00,240
now this particular ted talk is how i

00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:03,120
came to the question

00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,880
that i just asked in the previous slide

00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:07,039
here in the presentation

00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,240
so there's a library near denver called

00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:11,120
the any think

00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,159
library a-n-y-t-h-i-n-k the anything

00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:15,039
library

00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:16,320
near denver and that's an intentional

00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:19,679
spelling of the word

00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:20,640
and you think and i'd like you to look

00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:24,000
up this video it's

00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:27,360
very very interesting about uh how

00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,120
libraries see themselves as servants of

00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,200
the community

00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,240
and here's the director of the library

00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,159
giving a very

00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,960
interesting and thought-provoking talk

00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:39,520
i'd like you to watch this talk and then

00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,600
even though pam sandley and smith even

00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:44,240
though she doesn't mention open source

00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:46,799
i want you to think about what her

00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:49,919
attitude towards open source might be

00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:53,440
given her this particular talk and

00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:53,440
um so

00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,080
the main point she's making in her talk

00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,799
is that librarians ought to default to

00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,400
yes

00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:05,840
so if somebody brings an idea to the

00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:09,279
library a library is a house of ideas

00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:12,320
and the librarians ought to be

00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:14,080
interested and encouraging of ideas that

00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,600
walk in the library

00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,039
and people librarians should be thinking

00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,799
don't think about the reasons something

00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:21,360
can't be done think about the reasons it

00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:23,279
can be done

00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,640
so this is a shift in philosophical

00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:27,120
perspective

00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,720
and you as a somebody who's watching

00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:32,240
this presentation of mine

00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:35,200
you have a role to help your community

00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,400
see the shift in perspective of the role

00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,880
of the public library

00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,600
in their community it's much more than

00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,640
books

00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:44,559
it's much much more than books uh

00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:47,440
historically libraries that was their

00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:51,679
purpose was the distribution of books

00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:55,840
i like to think of libraries as um

00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:56,640
zones of uplift it's a zone of uplift

00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:01,279
and

00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:03,039
i use the phrase digital empowerment and

00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:04,880
there's lots of different ways that

00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:08,159
uplift can happen at a library

00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,559
books are one tool for uplift and then

00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,880
there's

00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:12,080
many many other tools that we ought to

00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,960
talk about

00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:17,360
and put into practice at the public

00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,360
library

00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,799
um i want to talk a little bit about

00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:23,200
moodle

00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:24,799
the learning management system what's

00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,200
its role at the public library

00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:28,240
so we're living in a knowledge economy

00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,720
moodle is

00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:32,320
open source free software that's totally

00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:35,679
high quality

00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,559
it was designed by a very very smart and

00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:39,279
generous person

00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:40,640
in australia martin du gianas it's 20

00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:42,400
years old moodle

00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,240
it's used in every single country in the

00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,799
world and

00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,279
you may or may not be a fan of moodle

00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:49,440
yet

00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:51,120
but i encourage you to look into it

00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,279
because

00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,720
moodle and your public library means

00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,480
that you could be

00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:59,520
community members in your community can

00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:03,520
be teaching each other stuff

00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:04,240
and this is the moodle website i want to

00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,320
just

00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,720
give a quick screen grab so you get to

00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,720
see it

00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:14,640
i'd like you to visit stats.moodle.org

00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,720
these are the statistics

00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,320
of how much moodle is used around the

00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,640
world

00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,440
there's 33 million courses have been

00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,960
made

00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:26,159
in moodle uh and a quarter of a billion

00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,760
a quarter of a billion people have

00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:31,520
registered on moodle that's a big number

00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:34,000
i love the moodle quizzes look at that

00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:37,039
they have uh is it three billion quiz

00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,960
questions in moodle uh you can have

00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:42,240
timed quizzes in moodle

00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:44,480
uh if you if you haven't thought about

00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:46,320
how moodle fits into your community

00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,760
i encourage you to think and talk with

00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:51,279
other people in your community

00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:54,799
how can moodle be used to

00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:57,039
for civic purposes uh to teach

00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:58,640
uh moodle is used in colleges and

00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:59,840
universities is used in businesses and

00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:03,440
government

00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:06,000
it's a very flexible tool for uh

00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,880
for teaching it was designed that way

00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,880
and so

00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:11,039
i'd like you to think about it i just

00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,919
recently set up a moodle myself

00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:15,440
i use a website a web web hosting

00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:18,320
service called lenode

00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:20,640
i pay five dollars a month and my friend

00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:24,159
kevin cole helped me set it up so

00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:27,120
i have a friend who is i'm pretty

00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:27,440
knowledgeable about linux in general but

00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,880
i

00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,039
i choose friends who are more

00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,960
knowledgeable than me so kevin is

00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:34,240
uh work retired as a system

00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:37,360
administrator

00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:39,120
uh with very strong background in linux

00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,919
so i asked kevin to help me set up a

00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,000
moodle

00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:43,200
and it took him a little time moodle is

00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,640
free but

00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:48,080
um um the web hosting you have to set it

00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,279
up yourself or you have to pay somebody

00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:52,960
to set it up

00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:55,039
um so i want to show you that

00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,880
here's my here's what kevin made for me

00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:58,080
welcome to phil shapiro's no room

00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,159
schoolhouse

00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,760
so he came up with that name and i love

00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:04,720
the name

00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:07,440
he's he's uh well attuned to my wacky

00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,440
sense of humor

00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,399
so um i should also mention a couple

00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,000
more things about moodle

00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:15,919
moodle can you be used without the

00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,399
internet so you can set up

00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:19,279
like a classroom someplace uh in a

00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:21,039
school that's

00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:22,720
outside of the zone of the internet they

00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:24,480
might not even have internet in this

00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:27,440
geographical location

00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,799
and um and so and students could be

00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:32,320
using moodle

00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:34,559
uh within a local network at a school

00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:36,799
so that's a that's a pretty big deal

00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:39,120
people don't know about that

00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:40,080
not enough people know about that and i

00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:43,120
have a quick story

00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:44,720
i gotta share about moodle uh from an

00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,760
educator colleague of mine sheila

00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,520
gatling

00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:50,480
from brooklyn new york i think she's up

00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:53,039
in brooklyn and she told me

00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,000
that middle school teacher retired

00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:56,000
middle school teacher

00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,320
she told me one of her fifth or sixth

00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,200
grade students moved from new york to

00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,320
georgia and in the middle of the school

00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,520
year moved

00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:08,399
and continued handing in assignments

00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:10,880
on uh sheila's the moodle that her

00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:13,279
brother had set up in her classroom

00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:15,440
uh the student in georgia wanted to

00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:17,760
continue participating

00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,679
that the student loved moodle so much

00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:21,679
and loved this particular teacher

00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:23,440
that even though they were physically at

00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:25,200
a different school they continued

00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:27,760
handing in assignments

00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,039
so that's a testament to two or three

00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:31,279
different things

00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:32,880
first is a testament to the how well

00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:34,799
moodle is designed

00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,640
it's also a testament to sheila gatling

00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:38,399
who's incredible teacher

00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,840
and maybe also a testament to this

00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:44,480
particular student who

00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:48,559
who was so much enjoying the process

00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:53,279
of expanding their mind via

00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:53,279
this tool called moodle so

00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:57,039
your homework assignment is to think

00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,880
about what steps you can take this week

00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:59,919
to make your own public library more

00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,799
open

00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:04,320
so you should if you don't have

00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:04,799
relationships with some of your library

00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,279
staff

00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:09,039
this is you need to start building those

00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:12,399
relationships

00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:14,640
as i mentioned previously um and

00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:16,480
and also build the relationships by

00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:19,760
offering to do something for the library

00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:21,840
offer to teach a workshop online

00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,840
choose whatever is your passion that's

00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:27,039
connected to open source

00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:28,559
or any of the any of the topics

00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:30,720
related to open source so creative

00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:33,679
commons is not open source but it's

00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:35,919
it's related to it so people need to

00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:39,760
teach and learn creative commons

00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:41,039
um privacy i mean somebody needs to be

00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,760
teaching privacy

00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:45,279
so privacy is connected to open source

00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,440
as you might know there's

00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:48,880
some fantastic open source tools that

00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,039
promote privacy

00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,960
uh so maybe privacy is what you want to

00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:56,640
teach at your public library

00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:58,880
via a zoom workshop like steps to

00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:02,960
protect your own privacy or

00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:04,960
um whatever you choose to share

00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,960
so this is phil shapiro thank you for

00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:09,600
coming to my presentation

00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:10,480
and i hope i've given you some ideas and

00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:13,600
tips

00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:17,120
about how public libraries

00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:18,480
can be promoting open source and all the

00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:21,120
goodness that open source

00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,159
brings to our communities as i mentioned

00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,320
in the beginning

00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:25,519
open source does not have a marketing

00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,919
budget

00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:29,600
and too many people in our community

00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:33,279
have never heard

00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:34,480
of the many wonderful aspects and tools

00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:36,240
in open source

00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,559
so the only way they are going to hear

00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,080
it is if somebody tells them

00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:41,679
and it's either going to be you in

00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,519
person or

00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:45,919
your local institution the public

00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:47,440
library the place where knowledge is

00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:50,559
distributed

00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:51,360
so um i'd like you to think about how

00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:54,480
you can be a

00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:57,279
catalyst for

00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,399
helping the goodness of open source

00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:01,360
reach

00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:01,840
a broader audience in your own community

00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:06,240
and

00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:10,000
it makes the community stronger um

00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:13,200
and maybe more thriving um

00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,159

00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,640

a role for themselves and for their

00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:10,960
family and friends to make the world a

00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:11,599
little bit better place using open
