	00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:11,120
i'll be dropping off video here

00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:14,400
uh just in sec in a second um and uh

00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:17,920
turning it over to aaron aldridge who

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:21,439
uh has graced us with his presence today

00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:23,600
uh he works for red hat recently uh

00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,199
as of recently i should say uh he's the

00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,080
founding organizer for devops day

00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,720
hartford

00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:33,840
uh and let's just say he is

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,840
done the speaker circuit

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,840
so aaron thank you very much for

00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,280
chatting with us today uh he'll be doing

00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,399
a talk on sticking together while

00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,800
staying apart

00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,960
resilience in the time of code so aaron

00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,760
take it ah thanks so much

00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,480
for the introduction um yeah i'm looking

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,559
at the

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,760
session i've got my monitors set up so i

00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:53,920
should be able to see

00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,840
multiple things at once uh and since it

00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,800
looks like there's like a

00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,440
about a dozen folks in the channel like

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,280
feel free to

00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,239
to interact in the chat channel while

00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,440
i'm going through and i'll try and keep

00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:05,119
an eye on it and

00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,799
respond to stuff if i'm going so feel

00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:09,040
free to ask questions in line uh

00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,080
as well since there's a handful of us

00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,240
here

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,840
um so yeah so i'm talking about uh here

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,720
we go resilience in the time of global

00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,159
pandemic

00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,520
uh specifically around resilience

00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,880
engineering is how we're going to be

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,280
using that term

00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,600
uh so let's see if i can advance the

00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,720
correct window here oh hey there we go

00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,320
uh so i want to start out with this

00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,040
quote from terry pratchett if you don't

00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,640
know his author

00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:32,560
of uh the discworld novels um

00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,159
who says million to one chances crop up

00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,520
nine times out of ten or

00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,040
to put another way i like to say

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,960
everything's a little bit broken all of

00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,960
the time but it keeps working anyway

00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,399
right like you know u.s east one goes

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,840
down every other time that it rains and

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,720
yet you can still stream all of your

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,360
netflix

00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,479
uh while we're stuck inside and all that

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,320
has to do with

00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,880
resilience right this is what we're here

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,759
to actually talk about and discuss today

00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,640
and now since resilience is a great word

00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,320
but it has

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,240
an academic definition in the world of

00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,240
resilience engineering as well as being

00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,439
just a common word that we happen to use

00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,119
every day

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,399
so to avoid the fact that we all have a

00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,520
different definition in our head right

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,959
now

00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,720
we're going to nail down what we're

00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,480
actually talking about here

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,760
so david woods has published a paper

00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,360
that basically says we're talking about

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,840
resilience we're generally talking about

00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:23,680
four different things one is rebound

00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,840
robustness graceful extensibility

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,040
uh and sustained adaptability uh we'll

00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,120
understand all these pictures i

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,160
i go through here so the first one is

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,680
rebound

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,440
rebound is the concept of getting back

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,000
to normal right so when something goes

00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,560
wrong you have a surprise or an incident

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,680
that disrupts normal operation rebound

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,280
is that

00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,879
oh no something happened how much can i

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,319
get back on track

00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:46,400
now the interesting thing about rebound

00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,920
is that even though it's a measurement

00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,519
of what happens in the moment

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,760
the only way you can prep for it and get

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,280
better at it is work done before

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,120
an incident occurs right it's it's

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,800
retrospective afterward and doing work

00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,480
before the next incident to get better

00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,840
at this sort of thing

00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,360
no one practices the rebound or works to

00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,840
get better at it during an incident

00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,840
itself

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,519
robustness right this is our ability to

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,280
stone and absorb well-modeled

00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,760
disturbances so this is your classic

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,959
like

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,959
how do i set this up for high

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,080
availability or you know

00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,360
i'm going to build a house in the

00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,280
caribbean i should make it out of

00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,480
concrete and not put glass windows in it

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,920
because we're going to have a hurricane

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,599
every other wednesday

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,200
right they're all about known knowns

00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,599
you're preparing for known failure

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,599
models

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,879
and graceful extensibility right the

00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,400
picture of the waffle house here is it's

00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,000
all about the ability to stretch within

00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,840
your operational boundaries

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,280
uh and if you if you haven't heard by

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,040
now that we've gone through a pandemic

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,200
and like fema has been mentioned

00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,959
uh waffle house is famous for never

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,120
never closing they are always

00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,879
open uh and that includes national

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,640
disasters to the extent that fema has a

00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:53,599
waffle house index

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,720
uh and if you know based on waffle house

00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,400
if they are open

00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,760
uh and serving their full menu right

00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,720
everything is good if they're open on a

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,159
limited menu

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,840
we probably have a major disaster in

00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,760
that area need to look at relief

00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,360
uh for like electric or water like why

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,040
are they running a limited menu

00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,959
uh and if they're closed it is

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,280
considered a either a

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,040
a you know it's like code black it's

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,480
either the area is

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,400
inaccessible or there is a global

00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,199
pandemic uh guess which one we hit this

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,079
here

00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,840
uh so so yeah graceful extensibility is

00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,800
all about like things have changed right

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,520
i don't have water i don't have

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,520
electricity

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,560
but it doesn't mean i can't not cook i

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,240
can still cook stuff

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,600
even without fresh water electricity

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,320
have other things on my menu that are

00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,280
available to us or this looks like when

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,600
netflix hits

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,440
a large capacity of streaming they don't

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,759
just stop working for a number of people

00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,800
they might degrade the quality for folks

00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,360
so they can continue

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,960
to operate and continue to serve uh

00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,479
their customers even though they're not

00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,919
at you know tip top they're still

00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,280
continuing to operate

00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,639
this is often opposed with brittleness

00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,199
right where you hit your edges you fall

00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,479
apart

00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,560
this when you hit your edges you stretch

00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,240
a little bit

00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,919
and finally the last form of resilience

00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,000
is sustained adaptability

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,960
um this is talking about changing

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,400
adaptive capability

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:06,639
ability words are tough recognizing and

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,840
managing adaptive capabilities over long

00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,440
time scales

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,960
uh this is often where we're involving

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,720
humans at this point we're talking about

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,720
systems changing over time

00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,080
we're talking about adapting new normals

00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,919
how do we do things differently from

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,240
here on out that type of stuff

00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,199
uh is sustained adaptability uh my

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,960
example of

00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,639
uh these are the portland area i believe

00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,639
it's portland area protests

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,000
um there's actually a fantastic podcast

00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,199
that dives into specifically the

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,280
uprising in portland

00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,720
and the second episode dives into the

00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,160
really talks about the resilience of

00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,120
this this protest and how they've

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,240
adapted

00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,560
uh over the past hundreds of days

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,320
that they have been out there so that's

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,759
a really interesting uh concept to dive

00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,800
into

00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,400
there's actually a really good example

00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,160
of how some of the mutual aid groups

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,840
during the wildfires retooled from

00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,759
providing

00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,120
protest medic support like providing

00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,720
medical support for protests

00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,280
and immediately adapted to providing

00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,400
relief for uh the wildfires and shifting

00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,840
where they were and how they were

00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,039
providing support to deal with that so

00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,199
really interesting stories to follow

00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,199
there

00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,880
okay so that's a lot of academic

00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,720
definition

00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,919
um but that's kind of hard to fit in our

00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,319
heads and understand

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,199
a good example so i want to use the uh

00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,360
bone

00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,960
as the archetype for resilience this

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,160
isn't my idea this is credited to dr

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,440
richard cook

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,720
um and uh he calls bone the archetype

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,560
not just an example

00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,280
and the reason why roughly is bone is

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,960
continuously created and destroyed

00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,479
uh the reconstruction is directed by

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,440
mechanical strain so the way that your

00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,520
bones

00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,199
um you know break down and rebuild is

00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,400
based on the amount of strain that we

00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,919
put on them

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,479
and that's directed by signals through

00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,840
layered loose loosely coupled layered

00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,960
networks at the cellular level right

00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,400
lots of small bits

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,360
all communicating in order to make this

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,280
happen um that's not the extent of that

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,639
talk this is a whole like 45 minute

00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,840
keynote that i'm trying to condense into

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,440
about two slides

00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,440
so you should watch the talk yourself

00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,400
because it is absolutely fantastic

00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,160
but here are the takeaways for

00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,440
resilience engineering resilience

00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,479
engineering comes in about two different

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,560
flavors

00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,840
one is that we've been doing for about 3

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,599
500 years

00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,440
it's talking about how bones are sort of

00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,080
naturally resilient they naturally

00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,720
encompass

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,639
resilience um but we've learned that if

00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,720
we set the bone in such a way

00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,080
when it breaks it will heal better but

00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,960
it'll heal on its own it'll it'll do

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,039
that completely

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,360
uh so let's try to what we've learned

00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,800
how to do is create the environment

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,400
that the bone will be the most

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,000
successful and allow its natural

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,360
resilience to shine through right let

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,319
the systems that are already in place do

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,599
their thing

00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,960
we're just going to manipulate the

00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,039
environment to give them ideal

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,240
conditions for doing so

00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,319
uh the new thing that we've been doing

00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,039
which is about five-year-old five years

00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,800
old

00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,240
at least in the medical industry here

00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,080
that he's talking about

00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,000
uh talks about actually manipulating the

00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:47,280
signals that all these cells use

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,280
to communicate and uh build the actual

00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,199
resilient mechanisms themselves

00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,879
so this is where very small changes can

00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,080
have massive effect

00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,840
and this is where they're looking at

00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,440
like reversing osteoporosis and folks

00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,479
and things like that so

00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,319
check out this talk but the main

00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,440
takeaway is the first one because that's

00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,160
what i'm going to dive in here today

00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,759
resilience

00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,960
is sort of inherent in certain systems

00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,520
and we want to create ideal conditions

00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,520
to bring that out

00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,199
so this is sort of the systems that we

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:13,280
deal with on a daily basis actually

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,240
uh this is a modern uh system

00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,479
architecture i believe

00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,919
this is old and was stolen from the

00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:19,599
slides that you would hear whenever

00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,039
someone from netflix would talk and

00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,400
they would say people always ask us what

00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,240
does netflix look like and i believe

00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,120
this is a diagram of netflix about five

00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,720
or six years ago

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,240
but suffice to say we're getting to that

00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,840
point right they're complex

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,800
coupled networks they're loosely coupled

00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,599
tied with all this different

00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:39,440
interconnected signaling

00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,000
um now i've got to make sure i've got

00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,000
the right

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,279
slides here okay so what this is built

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,640
into we're talking about a system that's

00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,880
built into

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,560
uh has rebound graceful extensibility

00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,320
and robustness are baked into that

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,519
system design right when things go down

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,839
something else comes up

00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:56,240
we're going to degrade we have no known

00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:58,160
failure cases for high availability

00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,000
um and that's the type of stuff you can

00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,839
actually build into your software right

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,200
so this is my you know bear with my

00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,800
moment of commercial pitch that if

00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,320
that's all we're talking about that's

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,240
the type of thing you can deploy

00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,320
openshift and you'll get all of that

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,600
sort of stuff baked in but you're not

00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,399
going to get real resilience until you

00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,720
have a change

00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,480
in human practice and it's something we

00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,160
say here too you're not going to adopt

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,920
this platform unless you actually change

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,600
the way your teams are interacting your

00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,279
team

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,640
is operating to improve the resilience

00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,360
that you have

00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,240
all of the systems that we have are

00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,240
socio-technical systems right there's a

00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,640
reason we say this a lot in devops is to

00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,880
put

00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,640
the emphasis on the fact that all of our

00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,600
software starts with people

00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,080
whether you're the ones that have

00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,480
designed it or are operating it or

00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,440
thought of the need for it and it ends

00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,680
with people that are up

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,920
that are using it at the far end right

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,360
so nowhere in the system is it possible

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,800
to exclude humans

00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,720
right humans are part of the systems

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,680
that we design and that's great because

00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,680
the humans actually

00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,040
build the resilience into our systems

00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,000
right that's where all of this

00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,000
resilience comes from

00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,600
there's a concept called conway's law

00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,079
which roughly says we design

00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,360
systems uh representative of how our

00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:09,360
organization communicates

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,120
which i think is absolutely true and

00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,680
this is why i talk about and can show

00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,279
you

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,720
you know open shift all day long but if

00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,800
your team is still operating in these

00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,640
heavily siloed environments

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,920
um where you know your devs aren't

00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,519
really talking to ops folks you're

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,839
tossing stuff over the wall

00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,640
or you've got very strict change

00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,920
controls

00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,839
you're often going to struggle with

00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,200
adopting these new systems and adopting

00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,959
things like containers and adopting

00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,440
things like microservices

00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:35,120
because the organization isn't built to

00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,880
handle that style of communication it's

00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,560
difficult for the applications you build

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,600
to handle that style of communication

00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,519
because you're going to want to bake in

00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,640
the same safety nets the same safety

00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,480
levers and the same

00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,480
change controls into the software which

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,839
may or may not actually work that way

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,839
if you want them in microservices

00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,040
um so i believe this see the problem

00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,399
with presenting and sharing my screen is

00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,920
i don't get my up next slide so i have

00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,200
to guess that this is the correct blank

00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,839
slide

00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,800
so i want to take a moment here yeah

00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:06,079
perfect

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,680
uh and anyone who's here

00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,880
take a moment to step back and uh

00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,680
hopefully you're not like driving and

00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,920
listening to

00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,360
a conference um so you have the option

00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,079
of if closing your eyes helps you

00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,800
imagine things

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:18,880
go go there and imagine like the last

00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,680
major incident that you had

00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,040
um whether you know whatever it was

00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,920
whatever the last major incident you had

00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,120
to get called in

00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,040
you know it's a surprise at work we've

00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,640
gotta fix stuff sev one that type of

00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,839
thing

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,959
and once you've got that moment in your

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,079
head i want you to think about a few

00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,360
questions

00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,200
the first thing is who or what

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,640
recognized this as a problem

00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,240
was there a system that alerted you and

00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,600
told you hey this is a major deal and is

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,560
this f1 we need to get 10 people

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,160
involved

00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,760
was there an alert that someone had to

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,279
investigate and that person

00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,800
found the problem but they were still

00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,519
kind of alerted by a system

00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,040
sort of something to think about there

00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,480
and how surprising was this incident was

00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,920
it something you kind of expected or

00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,480
something that came out of nowhere like

00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,079
the right

00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,480
the wrong things had to go wrong the

00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:01,040
right way for it to really be a problem

00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,800
um and think about all the overlapping

00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,639
systems and networks and people that

00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,160
were involved you have engineers and

00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,680
folks that responded to it

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,519
you might have had managers involved it

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,480
was a major incident food delivery

00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,480
possibly

00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,920
uh was your home life disrupted people

00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,839
that had to be you know kicked out of

00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:19,120
rooms or had to change or you had to

00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:20,480
cancel your plans that impacted somebody

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,000
executives might have been involved and

00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,360
probably customers were involved in that

00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,639
as well right all these different people

00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,560
got involved

00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:29,040
in an incident that occurred with

00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,720
whatever it is we built

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,560
uh and ultimately i wanna finally think

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,399
of where did the resolution come from

00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,920
was there some policy that got put in

00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,160
place to fix the problem

00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:40,079
or was it some engineer right in the

00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,600
thick of it who said oh i found it and

00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:44,480
processed a change and put it through

00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,519
and resolved the issues

00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,519
um so i'm going to bet it was the

00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,639
engineer but we're going to talk a

00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,079
little bit more about that because that

00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,920
dives into the concepts

00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:53,440
of the sharpened and the blunt end of

00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,120
the systems that we build

00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,680
uh these are kind of important concepts

00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,360
when we dive into resilience and safety

00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,440
uh these come out a lot in the realm of

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,959
safety and like safety the new way or

00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,800
safety 2.0 or you might have heard some

00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:06,240
of those terms before

00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,000
the sharp end are folks who are closest

00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,440
to the work these are the practitioners

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,200
who are actually in

00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,720
in building apps and responding to

00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,160
incidents

00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,760
and your blunden are folks who are

00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,839
removed from the experience upstream

00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,279
decision makers

00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,320
uh the thing about folks at the sharpen

00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:22,000
that's kind of interesting is they're

00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,839
often constantly building and destroying

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,600
systems

00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,120
there's strong signaling between folks

00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,680
at the sharp end they're usually in the

00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,040
same teams or they communicate regularly

00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,760
they might even have community outside

00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,519
of that group they improve systems

00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,360
usually based on strain right

00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,279
when an incident happens that's the

00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,600
thing that you're going to fix

00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:43,120
uh and given ownership of the systems

00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,279
folks will naturally improve that

00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,279
situation there's a whole

00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,959
study it's called the woolworth study

00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,399
that was done i want to say sydney

00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,639
decker

00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,160
during a lot of the the like safety 2.0

00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,000
stuff where they took

00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,279
woolworth stores or grocery stores in

00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,800
australia

00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:02,480
and um changed up the way they do safety

00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,160
instead of policies mandated from the

00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,600
top and say you know you have to do x y

00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,600
and z in order to be safe and have

00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,720
safety officers that give the new policy

00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,120
every day

00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,720
uh they said this the the cliff notes of

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,880
this is they said to certain stores

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,560
hey you own safety here are the outcomes

00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,440
that we want but you decide how we get

00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,440
there

00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,959
and that group generally improved far

00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,040
and above by giving the actual ownership

00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:24,639
to the people that were doing the work

00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,279
they naturally improved the safety of

00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,639
the system they were working in

00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,320
and i'll provide resources to a lot of

00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,440
this stuff all the academic papers and

00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,760
studies and things

00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,720
um actually let me just quickly put in

00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,320
here

00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,120
oh can i type at the same time i'm

00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,560
talking let's find out

00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:45,839
if you go to of course it didn't

00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:45,839
hyperlink let's try it one more time

00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,079
there we go if you go there this talk

00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,920
should be the first one listed

00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,279
uh for today and there's a resource

00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,600
section that'll include links to a lot

00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:59,279
of these studies or

00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,240
white papers and things like that so if

00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,199
you want to follow along with all the

00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,279
resources

00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:05,279
you can get there now or afterward

00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:09,920
um cool so there was a conference

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,560
earlier this year called failover comp

00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,480
from gremlin the chaos engineering folks

00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,079
and jay paul reed a senior applied

00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,440
resilience engineer netflix said teams

00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:19,760
that do well dealing with

00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,120
impact which is surprises and incidents

00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,399
are those that have a strong common

00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,240
ground

00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,560
okay cool so if you want to improve

00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,920
resilience on our team we must build a

00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,600
strong common ground that's that's me

00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,880
just just now i've i've made this quote

00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,320
so you can say this to people later and

00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:35,040
put my name on it

00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,000
um which seems to be the way that grows

00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,519
out of that so

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,560
again now common ground is something we

00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,639
kind of think of we have an

00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,480
understanding of it but how do we make

00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,600
sure that we have the common ground with

00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,160
our group what do we actually mean when

00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,920
we say that

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,160
uh so common ground team starts with the

00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,360
basic compact uh this is important this

00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,720
is largely like

00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,560
understanding that you're in and you're

00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,240
part of the group um this is most

00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,920
important later if we talk about not

00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,600
um being able to fulfill that and i'll

00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,199
get back to that in a second

00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,720
uh there's some goal alignment or

00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,480
commitment right you're largely you're

00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,360
on the same team or your goals are

00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,639
roughly aligned

00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,399
you know you're working and moving the

00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,240
same direction right we understand we're

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,639
working towards the same things

00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,639
this is a lot of the times why uh devops

00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,480
teams talk about realigning towards

00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,240
business outcomes from our individual

00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,639
goals right because naturally

00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,720
uh ops folk are are incentivized to

00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,240
maintain stability and dev

00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,680
are incentivized to build innovation

00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,199
which are inherently at odds so if we

00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,959
can realign both of those

00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,480
along a common goal we're going to do

00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:31,920
better right

00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,160
there's interpretability there's an

00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,000
understanding that we kind of know how

00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,759
we're going to interact with each other

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,120
this is like if you go to starbucks and

00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,800
order you know

00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,920
a coffee you kind of expect how the

00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,040
interaction's going to go you're going

00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,160
to say some words

00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,279
they're going to ask you for money

00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,480
you'll pay for it you'll get the thing

00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,920
that you asked for

00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,880
if you went up to the front and said you

00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:54,160
know i want a uh

00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:57,360
i'm forgetting starbucks words uh venti

00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,399
latte and they uh scream the sky is

00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,600
falling in your face

00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,720
rip off their apron and run out the

00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,240
front door like we have poor

00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,600
interpretability about what's gonna

00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,079
happen here that's we're clearly not on

00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,079
the same page

00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,600
and these will sustain and repair

00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:13,199
themselves as well so when we

00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,880
have a misalignment when something goes

00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,400
on in a group

00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,240
and we disagree like either under

00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,959
predictability fails or our goals aren't

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,480
aligned

00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,160
we want to get those back in order to

00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,760
maintain that common ground

00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,439
and this is where basic compact comes

00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,120
into play like if for instance

00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,400
uh there's a global pandemic going on

00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,520
and for whatever reason you need to take

00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,880
some time off

00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,280
and even though you're in slack you're

00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,080
not really available that's important to

00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,960
communicate

00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,720
with your team if you're going to

00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,679
maintain resilience they need to know

00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,120
when you're in

00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,400
and need to know when you're out more

00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,120
importantly like when you are not

00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,640
reliable

00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,080
that's what's going to maintain that

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,799
inner predictability right if they send

00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,919
something to you they have an

00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:48,320
expectation for how that's going to be

00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:48,320
handled

00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,440
so there's a lot of ways we can build

00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,720
common ground because that's kind of

00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,120
what you think about okay so how next

00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,039
can we

00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,720
we go from there and these are going to

00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:59,200
sound like a lot of the practices

00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,480
that you'll preach often we'll talk

00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,160
about blameless or blame aware

00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,679
postmortems right following up after

00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,600
incidents and figuring out

00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:07,360
you know what occurred how can we learn

00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,240
from that going forward and make things

00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,240
better

00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,919
uh chaos engineering is a whole other

00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:15,440
concept and discipline

00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:17,280
uh about you know introducing

00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,799
failures into our system so we learn how

00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,679
to deal with them having game days to

00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:22,000
practice

00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,440
uh incidents and practice uh things

00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,760
going wrong and how do we deal with it

00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,080
when

00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:28,480
when we run into the edges of our system

00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:30,000
right we want to build those into it

00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,679
and modeling vulnerability is a big part

00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,720
of it as well you know as

00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:37,120
leaders in groups especially uh being

00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,640
open and being vulnerable improves that

00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:42,640
reliability of your team

00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,919
um you know interacting

00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,400
people who are never reliable maybe a

00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,760
whole other story altogether

00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,960
and that that leads into you may have

00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,720
seen this study before this was the

00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,160
study they did a big study at google

00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,679
and said what were the hallmarks of our

00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,280
our top performing teams and number one

00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,000
was inevitably psychological safety

00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,720
right this gets back

00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,320
to our uh moderating vulnerability and

00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,760
uh psychological safety is more than

00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,280
just feeling nice although that's a good

00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,080
part of it

00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:07,440
a large part of his diving in and and

00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,960
being safe like i said safe to take

00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,320
risks and being vulnerable in front of

00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,480
each other so not just

00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,320
feeling good but being able to say hey

00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,360
yeah i flubbed that or i forgot about

00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,320
this thing and knowing that you can

00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,559
bring that forward

00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,720
so we can learn and improve without

00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:22,559
judgment that's coming down because

00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,080
uh you know like they say if sanctions

00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:26,559
follow these acts all the time

00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,360
people become subject matter experts and

00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,160
not telling you

00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:32,160
 and this isn't just a google thing

00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,679
so accelerate the study in 2019 the

00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,120
state of devops

00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,640
they found their analysis found that

00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,919
this culture of psychological safety is

00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,640
predictive of software delivery

00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:39,919
performance

00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,000
organizational performance and

00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,960
productivity so psychological safety

00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,960
doesn't just feel nice

00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,080
because you feel like you belong where

00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,200
you're going and you feel like you can

00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,280
talk to everyone on your team

00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,480
it actually improves delivery

00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,760
organizational performance and

00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,280
productivity

00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,760
so it's it doesn't just feel good it's

00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,760
good for you

00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,200
uh so if you want to dive in so this

00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,960
this talk was originally given at

00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,600
deserted island devops which was uh if

00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,600
you don't

00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,880
didn't follow that was a conference that

00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,080
happened entirely inside of animal

00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,919
crossing

00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,080
and so matt stratton at that same talk

00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,679
happened to give a conversation that's

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,280
largely about psychological safety on

00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,799
your team how to work with that and how

00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,799
to build that so

00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:18,720
check out this talk again linked in my

00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:20,880
resources as well

00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,159
which dives in more deeply into like

00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,840
what things can you do

00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:26,640
to improve and work with psychological

00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,640
safety on your team

00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:31,039
uh so reign heinrichs uh also has this

00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,000
quote on uh the greater than code

00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:34,000
podcast

00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,120
devoted to resilience larry said

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,880
resilience is about creating the

00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,760
conditions that maximize everyone's

00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,440
potential

00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,440
and i i absolutely agree this is right

00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,039
in line with uh what we're talking about

00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,200
with bone and how does resilience

00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:46,720
engineering come into place with this

00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,320
when you're building resilient teams

00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,159
largely it's making sure

00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,280
that everyone knows that they can

00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:51,840
operate at peak performance when

00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,080
everyone

00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,360
will naturally be resilient we naturally

00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,840
want to make sure our systems are

00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,440
working

00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,960
and reliable and we don't get paid in

00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,120
the middle of the night so if we can

00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:04,320
maximize everyone's potential to do that

00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:06,559
that's how we get good at it

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,600
so this actually led to a theory as i

00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:09,760
was was sort of

00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,200
rolling the ideas of loosely coupled

00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,080
networks around in my head and i had

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,480
this

00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:18,320
thought as recently as march this year

00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,320
would you believe uh my initial thought

00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,919
is that systems largely fail outwards

00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,080
right so i was thinking

00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:25,360
uh thinking of of a model of an incident

00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,799
right you kind of have something goes

00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:29,360
wrong in the system and it might try to

00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:30,799
self-heal and if it can't do that

00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,720
it's going to page somebody and go to

00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:34,000
the the next system out

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,960
right and hopefully that on-call

00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,120
engineer can fix it using their

00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,400
level of resilience to be able to human

00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,760
interact with the system and if that

00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,880
doesn't work maybe they'll call the team

00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,960
or become sev1

00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,159
or the whole organization gets involved

00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,960
or you might have a night capital

00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,400
incident

00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,880
which if you don't know knight capital

00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,640
was the trading company that

00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,640
flubbed production and accidentally lost

00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:57,760
like millions of dollars per second

00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,960
they did not survive that mistake it is

00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:02,640
a it's a tale of woe

00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:04,240
in the devops world and uh yeah

00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,760
it fails the whole organization to an

00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,520
extent that they have to

00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,039
uh probably get the government involved

00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,480
right if you're declaring bankruptcy

00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,919
we've got even bigger system involved

00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,679
you're now failing back to government

00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:17,360
systems that are taking over that org

00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:18,559
and fixing the problems that you had

00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,760
but then sort of something interesting

00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,960
happens what happens if it goes the

00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,720
other way

00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,000
right what happens if the large systems

00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,799
aren't doing the thing they're supposed

00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,880
to do

00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:28,880
or what happens when governments fail

00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,679
i don't know what happens when say you

00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,960
have the largest amount of unemployment

00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:37,039
and everyone stuck home

00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:41,840
an entirety of twelve hundred dollars is

00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:41,840
all you're given for about six months

00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,360
all right it's left to us right if the

00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,280
big systems fail

00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,480
it is left to these small loosely

00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:51,440
coupled networks

00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,440
to pick up the pieces

00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,720
so community building i put forth is

00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,880
resilience engineering

00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,240
all this work that folks do putting

00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,240
these conferences together and going out

00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,559
into communities and trying to

00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,919
uh build a group of people who care

00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,480
about all this stuff whether it's open

00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,559
source

00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,320
whether it's devops whether it's you

00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:12,159
know people who like get lab

00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:15,280
right all that community building is

00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:15,280
resilience engineering

00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,919
and if you look at the the the contents

00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,120
of a strong community they're usually

00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,240
diverse right you've got all these

00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,679
different views

00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,360
and different capabilities that are

00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:27,360
coming together

00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,200
you have a high trust and safety inside

00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,520
of your communities or we hope to that's

00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,240
what

00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:35,039
we're after they naturally will sustain

00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,880
and repair themselves

00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,480
there's interpretability we know how

00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,919
we're going to interact with each other

00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,600
in this community

00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,600
and even strong communities are made up

00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:46,000
of even smaller loosely coupled

00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,919
layered networks of people so even the

00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,919
communities themselves that we build

00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:52,799
naturally encompass all of the things

00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:52,799
that we're talking about

00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,679
so some examples of what happened here

00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,279
so this is

00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:00,960
slightly early in covid because that's

00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:02,720
when i gave this talk first was april so

00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,440
that's where the majority of my examples

00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,799
come

00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,279
because i am a hack and a fraud and did

00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:08,159
not fully update this uh every month

00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:11,520
because that would have been a lot of

00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,480
work uh there was a lot of news this

00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,799
year

00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,000
um so anyway marcel chi the missisquoi

00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,400
valley school district this is where i

00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,880
live

00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,960
in uh in rural vermont uh there's about

00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,120
you know six thousand people in my town

00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,039
and uh of the people in the school

00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,240
district there's something like forty to

00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:28,799
fifty percent rely

00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,400
on uh free or reduced lunch uh so they

00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,679
just automatically decided everyone

00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,880
every child in the school district under

00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,400
18 gets meals

00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,679
no questions asked this is the easiest

00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,279
way to make sure the people who are

00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,799
vulnerable get served

00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:40,320
and they started just giving out free

00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:41,600
breakfast and lunch in fact if you were

00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,360
on the bus route they would deliver it

00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,120
for you

00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,200
this has changed since we've had time to

00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:49,039
adapt that but it was amazing right

00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,640
their first reaction was to make sure

00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:51,840
everything stays up just like what

00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,240
that's our first reaction for systems

00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,679
right make sure everything stays working

00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,120
uh stores offered shopping time for

00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,720
vulnerable customers like as much as i

00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,400
hate to say that target aldi and walmart

00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,159
did the right thing like

00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,840
whether motivated by dollars or

00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:05,440
motivated because it was right

00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,600
they allowed the vulnerable population

00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,279
to get access to the resources they need

00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,960
and there was no policy that dictated

00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:12,400
that right that was a decision

00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:15,840
by those companies to serve the

00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,840
communities that they serve

00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,960
right shortage of ppe and so the

00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,200
community shows up

00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,559
and works to provide that with the

00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,720
resources that they have available for

00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:28,320
them

00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,760
and rent strikes i think are a huge

00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,120
example of this which happened and this

00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,679
one was in new york right because as

00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,559
folks

00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:36,080
were laid off and didn't have money we

00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:38,720
could all stick to ourselves but

00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:40,400
if the community rallies the community

00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,760
can push for fairness and the community

00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,760
can say it is not right

00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,360
that a handful of us who got unlucky get

00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,960
kicked out of their homes

00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,480
we're all standing beside that right the

00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,600
power of the community comes and keeps

00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,360
those people safe

00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,559
and builds the resilience that they

00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,159
didn't have right when something went

00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:55,520
wrong they lost their job the community

00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:57,840
steps up to make sure they have a place

00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,840
to stay

00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,080
and it continues further this is

00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,000
actually what i talked about the

00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:04,159
portland ewoks because they're a fan of

00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,760
hilarious acronyms first mobilized for

00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:07,120
protests offered disaster relief during

00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,960
wildfires

00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,720
right again this is mutual aid group

00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,559
this is entirely community run

00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:16,000
there is no government organization here

00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:18,559
it was people saying how can i help

00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,559
um people stopping and protesting mass

00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:21,679
evictions in boston literally protesting

00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:23,120
in front of the courthouse so that

00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:24,320
people cannot get there and file

00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:27,919
evictions

00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,919
that is community resilience

00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,279
uh so there's a great podcast this

00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,960
podcast

00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:36,559
turned out to be the the most aptly

00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,039
named podcast of the year worst year

00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:39,279
ever

00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:40,559
podcast they had an episode back in

00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:42,720
march how to save your community when

00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:44,400
the government fails all about

00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,760
how do we build common ground in our

00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,919
communities how can we build strong

00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:50,720
resilience with each other

00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:52,880
when the government doesn't it doesn't

00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,159
help out for us uh there's lots of great

00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:57,520
episodes in this podcast

00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:57,520
but this is definitely one to check out

00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,400
i have a blank slide but i don't know

00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:06,240
what my notes are for it all right well

00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,080
that's fine

00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,640
um i think i know where i'm going now

00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,640
that i looked ahead

00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:14,720
so all of this is all about the group

00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,320
and uh as i was thinking about this and

00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,399
i constantly need reminders

00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,520
throughout the year uh that resilience

00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:21,840
doesn't just start

00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:23,360
uh at the big the big end we also have

00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,080
to start small

00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:28,559
and as i was prepping this originally uh

00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,919
a tweet from my friend came through

00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:31,679
saying sometimes the first thing we have

00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:33,120
to do to take care of our communities is

00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,240
take care of ourselves be gentle with

00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,600
yourself

00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,120
and uh you should definitely follow the

00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,159
caterertot on twitter that is like the

00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,640
most wholesome

00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:42,720
twitter dev advocate follow you can do

00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:45,840
and you will constantly be delighted

00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,440
um yeah katie's awesome and is a great

00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,080
friend and will constantly remind me of

00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,679
these things

00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,600
uh so yeah that that was an important

00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:53,440
one another friend of mine

00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,520
uh tiffany comes up and says you can't

00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,200
pour from an empty cup

00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,240
uh and further it's hard to fill the cup

00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,080
if it's cracked and leaking which is

00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,520
just the perfect metaphor for ourselves

00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:04,000
and everything that we devote to this

00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:06,080
and as a serial event organizer

00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,679
um who cannot help but because i wasn't

00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,440
running devops days hartford

00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:11,120
this year i ended up organizing three

00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,679
conferences instead

00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,120
uh this this this reaches with me right

00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:17,840
like it's important to put our own masks

00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,840
on first

00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,240
uh and this this is is from jay paul

00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,200
reed's talk at failover conf i i forgot

00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,799
about this slide so i

00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,799
had to grab it he talks about dealing

00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:28,080
with cognitive load and this is how

00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:30,320
we this is how we deal with stuff

00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:32,880
whether it's individually or in teams

00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,399
um part of it is is shedding load we

00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,600
reach capacity right so you've got only

00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:36,960
so much room

00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,960
and at a certain point you have too many

00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,240
things uh and when you have too many

00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,279
things you do within one of four ways

00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,600
either shed load

00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:44,880
trade thoroughness shift working time or

00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,080
recruit more resources

00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,919
and the more important one i wanted to

00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,120
say was this trade-off thoroughness in

00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:51,440
each task and

00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,320
the comment that stuck out to me in this

00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,120
talk

00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:56,159
was a completely often comment that said

00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,080
all of us right now

00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:00,320
are probably trading off thoroughness in

00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,520
every task that we do

00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,520
and that's probably right i mean is

00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:05,279
anyone is anyone not is anyone operating

00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,720
at peak capacity during covid

00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,840
i think all of us have things that we do

00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,880
a little bit less it's not conscious

00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,640
we're not saying

00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,240
you know i'm gonna i'm gonna skimp on

00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,760
this code review just maybe we don't

00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,399
look as closely as we used to maybe we

00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,720
don't

00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:18,240
um you know i mean we don't do five

00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,360
edits we do four and a half right like

00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,720
there's little bits here and there that

00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,679
we do a little bit less than we're used

00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,880
to

00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:24,960
which just really weighed on me because

00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,480
thinking about that if we're all trading

00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,760
off thoroughness that means we're all

00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,480
operating right now

00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:31,120
at maximum cognitive load all of the

00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,000
time

00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:35,440
which is not great i don't know if

00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,240
there's an answer for what you do about

00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,039
it right now

00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,960
because like times being what they are

00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:42,559
um

00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,840
but it was something to think about uh

00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:44,640
furthermore he dives in the fact that

00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,080
these first two

00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,399
are often tactical decisions they're

00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,760
kind of a decision you can make yourself

00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:51,360
where the other two are more strategic

00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:53,039
because they often involve impact to the

00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,399
organization

00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:55,840
but one of the things i talked about

00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:57,360
thought about was shifting work and time

00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,200
recruiting more resources more

00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,720
than ever is stuff that we can do

00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:04,159
individually

00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:05,440
um and uh i wrote a blog post about it

00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:07,039
which is completely unrelated but i

00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,640
think it's important to stick in here

00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:10,880
like if you want further reading

00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,320
and further thoughts on this i wrote a

00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,600
concept on borrowing from ourselves i

00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,279
think one of the things we've enabled

00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,720
ourselves to do since a lot of us

00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:18,720
especially in software

00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,960
development and delivery are working

00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,520
from home is our sort of home and mixed

00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,279
lives

00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:26,000
are are being squished together and

00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:27,919
meshed and it's very easy to borrow

00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,080
resources from yourself without thinking

00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:31,600
about it right it's really easy to say

00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,360
if i just keep pushing a little bit

00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,919
longer tonight maybe i can get ahead

00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:37,520
and then i can relax and we never do and

00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:40,240
it's very easy to keep taking time

00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,640
from ourselves without giving it back uh

00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,480
so

00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,760
anyway just something to think about i

00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,640
wrote a blog about that if you want to

00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,279
hear more

00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,000
um and this is the exact quote that i

00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:50,559
feel

00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,919
uh in my bones but i can't carry

00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:52,559
anything else should i swap it with

00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:55,600
something

00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:57,840
and the world says no do it all um

00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,640
anyway uh one of the things we can do

00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,039
too is like

00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,799
enjoy whimsy and enjoy those things that

00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:05,120
give us joy this was

00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:06,000
um also a moment hanging out with

00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,600
friends and

00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,360
uh my friend rich who's an organizer for

00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,720
devops days portland happened to be

00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,440
wearing his portland shirt and this

00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,200
black

00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,480
uh i don't know if it's a hoodie or if

00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,720
it's a fleece

00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,720
pull over here and so my other friend

00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,279
jason who happened to be wearing also a

00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,840
black

00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:22,799
uh outerwear and the red devops days

00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,240
portland shirt

00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:25,519
took his screenshot set of his

00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,640
background for the rest of the

00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:28,480
conversation

00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,919
to which tiffany quickly hit her camera

00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,159
ran away came back and

00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:32,960
dressed the same added a third iteration

00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:34,880
of this so

00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,480
like have fun like that stuff needs to

00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,399
happen and when we're just being very

00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:41,919
serious about meetings all the time

00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:44,640
uh we will explode

00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:46,720
uh spend time with friends in uh in

00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,480
virtual spaces like create

00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,919
spaces that are outside of the zoom call

00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,760
outside of the thing you do for work

00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:53,600
or you get to meet people you know like

00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:55,039
this was me and maddie stratton hanging

00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,120
out in animal crossing and that was

00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:58,399
infinitely more meaningful than like a

00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,840
zoom call that we could have had like

00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:01,600
the dozen that we've had before then

00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:03,200
just something about sharing that weird

00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:06,000
space where we could both interact on a

00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,760
thing was really nice

00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,360
uh do virtual karaoke that's a thing you

00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:13,120
can definitely do

00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:14,399
ask me how so yeah this whole conference

00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,200
i thought was a great example of that

00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:17,039
this is like

00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,320
doing work you need to do having a tech

00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:21,120
conference and injecting

00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:22,000
that level of like joy into it and

00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,480
camaraderie

00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,519
and just how can we do it with a little

00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,799
bit more fun how can we bring a little

00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:28,000
bit more joy into people's world i think

00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:29,519
is something to think about so this

00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,880
whole conference happened in animal

00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:35,120
crossing because

00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:37,039
uh that would be funny and so it did

00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,559
and uh yeah it's great it's totally

00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:40,240
worth checking out you get really

00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:42,080
high quality talks and really good

00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,519
technical content except everyone has

00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:46,480
their own little avatars and it's it's

00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:46,480
adorable along the way

00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:50,960

00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:56,080
uh if you're feeling crappy and alone uh

00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:59,279

you'll feel better so to leave you with

00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:02,159
this thought the the large thing that i

00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,840
want to gather here

00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:05,440
is resilience engineering is about

00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,840
enabling potential and getting out of

00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,760
the way

00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:09,519
right it's making sure that people who

00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:11,679
are sort of naturally resilient

00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:12,799
are equipped and in a place to use that

00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:14,799
resilience

00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:17,679
to make things better that's the one

00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:19,679
