	00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,639
today

00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,440
uh we're fortunate to be hosting carl uh

00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:11,840
spataro

00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,880
he's the vice president of legal at

00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,679
elastic

00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,720
um he's someone that i actually work uh

00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,240
closely with uh

00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,920
and uh if you have any questions about

00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,519
his technical credentials let's just say

00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,320
that he probably knows more about git

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,599
than i do

00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,840
uh so uh with that i'll

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,199
let him dive into something a topic that

00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,719
i know is near and dear to him

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:37,040
a field guide to open source licenses

00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,160
great thank you so much can anyone hear

00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,800
me yes

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,320
um so um first of all i just want to say

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,960
thank you to the cpas

00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,879
committee in general um this has been

00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,399
such an incredible experience for them

00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:51,600
to pull together

00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:53,840
uh this conference um

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,600
just an incredible incredible effort and

00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,280
i really do want to give them

00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,719
um give them credit and give them thanks

00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,879
for doing that um

00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,920
as court said i'm vice president of

00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,440
legal adolescent

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,119
and um we're going to cover a lot of

00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,439
territory today

00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,880
so um you know we'll get hopefully we'll

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,280
get through it all if we don't that's

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,720
fine

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,799
um we'll get through the important

00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,600
things um

00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:17,360
i started with elastic four years ago

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,520
and i actually did not have

00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,400
much open source background at all even

00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,360
though

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,560
i had been practicing law for nearly 20

00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,240
years at that point

00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,479
and even though i had actually started

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,320
my career in menlo park

00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,600
in the heart of the silicon valley uh

00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,680
working with startups

00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,360
and even though i at one point had been

00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,159
the general counsel of what in those

00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,280
days was called

00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:41,759
antivirus an anti-virus software company

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,479
um so the last four years that elastic

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,840
have been just

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:47,920
amazing for me to learn open source um

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,320
and to learn more about the community

00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,479
and about the variations of the licenses

00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,640
and it's it's certainly very humbling

00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:58,159
but also extremely exciting

00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:00,719
so um let me jump into uh i'm sure

00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,479
most folks know who venus forever is um

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,880
i often compare open source to science

00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,240
that's

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,080
the quote of the day and um we'll talk

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,840
about a few objectives here so

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,280
i'm going to get to some real basics

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,440
like what is a license

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,920
and how does it work and then we'll talk

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,680
about the open source license itself

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,840
some of the common elements that apply

00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,040
across all licenses

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,800
i will touch on this notion of copyleft

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,239
and i cringe when i hear people talk

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,720
about viral code

00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,440
um so we should always refer to it as

00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,959
copyleft

00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,800
and we'll talk a little bit about what

00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,840
that means um

00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,360
we'll talk about compatibility which is

00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,120
when you're combining

00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,400
code that's licensed under different

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,040
licenses how

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,800
you get them to play together nicely

00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,200
talk about compliance which is something

00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,680
that

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,160
lawyers worry about when we go to market

00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,599
with open source code in our project

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,959
and then hopefully if we have time we'll

00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,080
talk about some open source business

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,920
models because

00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,599
not all of us you know we're born

00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,120
wealthy so some of us have to make a

00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,560
living

00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,400
you know open source is great but we

00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,640
need to find a way to commercialize it

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,599
um a key on this i want to say at the

00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,959
very outset

00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:11,920
um when i started practicing

00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,920
uh in open source you know gpl v2

00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,920
actually had just been published

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,200
everyone was terribly afraid of open

00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,519
source um

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,959
and 20 some years later i still see some

00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,840
of the legacy

00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,440
and and um ignorance for lack of a

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,000
better word and confusion around open

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,840
source

00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,440
so one thing i'll say at the outset

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,120
hopefully everyone knows this

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,560
you don't really have to worry about the

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,640
open source license

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,159
if all you're doing is using the code

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,480
for your own purposes

00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,360
or for internal purposes i mean i've

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,920
i've

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,640
taken a course in udemy of all places on

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,400
python

00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,319
and like i never even knew that python

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,159
had its own open source license because

00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,920
it didn't matter to me i was just taking

00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,840
the classroom purposes

00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,560
um as long as you're not distributing

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,959
the code you just don't have to worry

00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,760
about

00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,120
it and what's fascinating as a lawyer

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,200
who does deals

00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,799
with sophisticated companies including

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,519
in some cases sophisticated software

00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,480
companies

00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,519
is i still from time to time will get a

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,360
contract

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,959
that will state that we're not

00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,439
delivering any open source

00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,879
code in software that we're making

00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:17,040
available to our customers

00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,919
for their own internal use so there

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,680
remains a lot of

00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:20,959
ignorance around the front around open

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,199
source and hopefully

00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,479
over the years we'll be able to buy that

00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,400
um so

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,600
what is a license um the best way to

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,400
think about a license

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,320
is it's like a lease on an apartment um

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,520
you know the landlord doesn't sell the

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,520
apartment the landlord

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,199
leases the apartment and the same is

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,800
true of the license you're granting

00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,960
someone

00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,120
some rights in something that you've

00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,639
developed for the licensors granting

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,000
rights and something they've developed

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,919
so it's not a sale

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,160
the licensor retains the ownership but

00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,040
all licenses are conditional and the

00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,960
conditions

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,639
are where the rubber meets the road and

00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,759
in the case of like a lease as an

00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,600
example

00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,960
you know your performance obligation

00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,360
when you're a tenant

00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,120
is to uh pay the rent that's your

00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,960
performance obligation but there are

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,120
other conditions associated

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,639
with the police for example you're not

00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,479
supposed to you know some leases may or

00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,960
may not allow you to have pets

00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,680
some may require that you pay the water

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,000
or

00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,080
utilities some will require that you

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,880
can't sign the lease and similarly in a

00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,240
license

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,840
there's conditions as to how you're

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,199
going to use the code that's subject to

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,120
that license

00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,320
and so what rights need to be licensed

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,360
and i only want to

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:32,800
touch this because i want you to be

00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,479
so um versed in intellectual property

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,160
terminology at least

00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,600
that when you talk about these terms

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,400
these variables if you're

00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,000
developing developer and mindset um that

00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,720
you're using them accurately

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,400
um because it's kind of embarrassing if

00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,280
you use them inaccurately so hopefully

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,759
if you walk out

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,520
nothing this this session you'll first

00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,759
of all understand open source licenses

00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,720
are

00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,000
valuable or implicated uh with regard to

00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,600
distribution only

00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,120
and then second you'll have a really

00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,039
good understanding of what these terms

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,520
mean when you hear them spoken

00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,880
so there's four uh intellectual property

00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,919
rights in the united states

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,840
these are the only four you need to

00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:08,800
worry about there's patents which cover

00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,800
inventions

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,639
there's copyrights which cover original

00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,319
expression and you know without

00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,000
disposing too much in advance

00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,479
copyrights for what open source is all

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,319
about there's trademarks

00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,000
uh which identify the origin or the

00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,520
source of a product or service

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,440
and then their trade secrets which

00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,840
recursively are secrets that have value

00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,520
because

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:31,280
they are secret so a patent is

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,120
first of all the other thing you should

00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,600
know is ideas

00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,560
in and of themselves are not protected

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,319
so a patent

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,759
is an idea that's been reduced to

00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,800
practice and in the case of

00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,800
software um uh and actually um

00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,880
court that actually has uh some patent

00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,759
applications and processed himself so he

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,479
can also

00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:52,400
attest to this it's it's transforming

00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:55,039
it's a transformation of the system or

00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,960
data that's being worked on a machine

00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,800
but it has to actually do something

00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,080
it can't just be an idea and it can't be

00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,000
an algorithm

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,680
they are patent applications are very

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,800
tedious um

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:09,599
but it must be useful non-obvious

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,240
and novel um like it must be reduced to

00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:13,199
practice

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,560
and a patent gives the patent owner the

00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,039
exclusive right

00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,680
these are the key words to make use and

00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,919
sell

00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,039
that invention and patents are not

00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,599
automatic

00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:25,039
uh you must apply for a patent finance

00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:27,599
court again in a test

00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,400
it's not an easy process there's you

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,560
know patent

00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,479
officers who review the patent and will

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,160
usually go back over the course of 18

00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,400
months to two or three years

00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,199
back and forth as to how you narrowly or

00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,000
broadly

00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,919
identify what you're claiming to be

00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,039
covered by the patent so patent is not

00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,680
automatic

00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:47,199
um but patents generally are covered by

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,720
open source licenses although

00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,599
sometimes they're expressly granted

00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,280
sometimes they don't but um

00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:55,199
the thing that's really covered in open

00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,720
source licenses the heart and soul of

00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,479
the open source license and what

00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,199
actually gives rise to copy left is

00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,000
copyright so copyright is original

00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,520
expression

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,560
so copyright is how you express an idea

00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:11,520
so it can be a story that you tell

00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,000
photographs art and in the case of

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,599
software

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,759
it's the code it's how the code is

00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,319
written and you'll find this fascinating

00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,240
i do

00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,680
not only is the source code itself

00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,800
copyright protected but also the

00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,319
binaries are

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,759
copyright protected it's kind of

00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,039
fascinating because you think about

00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:28,319
zeros and ones but

00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:30,560
um the key with copyright is it attaches

00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,240
upon expression in other words once you

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,440
create that expression

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,560
you own copyright whether you want to or

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,200
not

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,000
and it's automatic and it's there and

00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,640
copyright gives

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,720
the copyright owner the exclusive right

00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:48,080
to among other things reproduce

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,560
copy their expression prepare derivative

00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,440
works

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,480
of that expression and distribute that

00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,320
expression

00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,920
again copyright is the heart and soul of

00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,839
an open source license

00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,959
touch briefly on trademarks trademarks

00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:02,480
are not licensed

00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:03,920
an open source mark is a logo or a mark

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,120
or a name or a brand

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:09,279
that tells the buyer that the that

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,800
who the source of that good or service

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:14,160
is and it's a it's a

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,200
proxy for you can imagine why you'd

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,600
never want to

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,120
grant a trademark as part of an open

00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,959
source license because

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,440
if you're elastic for example we want

00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:26,480
people to know that when they get code

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,880
even if it's open code um that is coming

00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,959
from us and not coming from someone else

00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,800
um because otherwise it's going to

00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:36,080
destroy our reputation

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:38,000
so um they're they are not um

00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,240
licensed and then finally trade secrets

00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,760
we'll just talk about them

00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,480
um even though they aren't really

00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,760
relevant um to open source because

00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,000
basically if you're making the code

00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,519
available then it's no longer secret so

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,560
you no longer have the benefit of the

00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,000
trade secret but

00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,839
you know something like the classic

00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,480
trade secret is the recipe for code

00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,680
it's not published um it's kept secret

00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,120
and because it

00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,600
efforts are made to keep it secret in

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,560
this value by by being secret

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,240
there's a right to it so four rights are

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,240
patents copyrights trademarks and trade

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,760
secrets the ones that really matter for

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,720
the purposes of open source

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,320
licensing are copyrights so let's talk

00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,120
about the open source license

00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,160
um i want to digress just a bit um and

00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,160
um

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,680
you'll have a lot of fun uh with the

00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,040
whole notion of what open source is

00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,560
because

00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,079
i gave a course once on the history of

00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,240
open source for class

00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:29,680
um and i like to say before there was

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,079
open source software

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,360
there was free software and before there

00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,760
was free software

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,640
there was open source software and by

00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,160
that i mean

00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:42,720
in the like 50s 60s

00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,440
even in the early 70s to some extent the

00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,079
code

00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,680
was specific to the machine and so you

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,040
programmed the machine no one really

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,279
thought about programming

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,880
the code and the folks that sold the

00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,640
machines made a lot of money by

00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,079
encouraging people to buy the machine so

00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,680
it was in their interest to make the

00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,880
code available to everyone and

00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,279
programming groups

00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,800
shared innovations in the code and the

00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,880
machine makers were happy because that

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,680
encouraged more sales and machines

00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,399
it wasn't really until the mid 70s early

00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,160
80s

00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:13,600
for a variety of reasons which i won't

00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:15,760
go into now the code became proprietary

00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,880
and the backlash to that proprietary

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,720
nature of the code

00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,720
was the free software foundation which

00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:25,120
was started in 1985

00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:27,040
which eventually led to

00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,800
the further development of code in the

00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,240
open but because it was unable to really

00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,680
commercialize under the free software

00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,560
foundation the open source initiative

00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,200
was founded

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,880
um and so now we have these two various

00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,240
um trains of thought about how about

00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,800
what open source is

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,079
um that's a lot for a very short period

00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,079
of time but the key i want to walk

00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,600
talk through now is um it's a

00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:47,680
development methodology

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,279
it's a licensing model and it's also a

00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,360
fork in ideology

00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,720
so as everyone here knows um i'm

00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,680
assuming most everyone here is a

00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,680
developer

00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,760
it's you're developing the code right

00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,560
the code is is made available to the

00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,560
community

00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,839
and it's published and that's that form

00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,760
of methodology

00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,839
um if you haven't ever read the

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,600
cathedral in the bazaar definitely worth

00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,200
reading it's got historical significance

00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,680
now because it's about 20 some years old

00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,680
but

00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:14,240
um it was really the first time that

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,800
anyone took a look at

00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:19,040
the the benefits of a well-run open

00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,560
source project and how it could expedite

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,839
and lead to fast

00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,720
development um so it's a development

00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:27,760
methodology

00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:30,000
it's also a form of a licensing model um

00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,959
remember i said when when a software

00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,440
developer

00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,800
writes code and it makes that expression

00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,279
copyright attaches

00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,440
the moment it's expressed so if you want

00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:40,480
that code to be available to others for

00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,680
them to use

00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,440
you have to do something with this

00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,880
copyright whether you wanted it or not

00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,079
you've got copyright you have to figure

00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,320
out what to do with it

00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:50,000
um and there's two choices you can just

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,000
contribute it to the public domain

00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
which is fine but you actually expressly

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,720
have to do that you have to say like

00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,200
i give up all my rights and copyright um

00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,680
or alternatively you can license it

00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:04,079
and the open source initiative the osi

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,560
and the free software foundation the fsf

00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:08,639
have models of software licenses that

00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,959
you can use if you want to create

00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:13,120
um a venue for your software to be

00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:16,240
available for other folks to use it

00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:20,639
um it's also a fork and ideology

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:23,120
and this is critical um to to consider

00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,880
um mostly from a theoretical point of

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,760
view but it also plays out in the

00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,000
licenses

00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:30,320
when you actually try to to implement

00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,680
them so the free software foundation was

00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:35,120
formed by richard stahlmann

00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:36,639
in 1985 um i'll digress on the story

00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,120
just briefly because it's kind of a fun

00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,600
story

00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,720
he was working as a researcher at mit

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,639
and they had a

00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,959
xerox printer i believe that ran on a

00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,360
form of unix that previously had been

00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,399
made

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:51,519
open and then with the breakup of

00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:54,480
um att um unix became closed

00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,920
and the printer would consistently jam

00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,079
and what stalman wanted to do

00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,760
was to try to fix the printer jam he

00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:01,360
didn't think he needed to do that what

00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,079
he really wanted to do was he wanted to

00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,320
just

00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:06,079
be able to have the printer send a

00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,440
message to all the recipients of the

00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,000
shared printer that the printer was

00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,680
jammed

00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,680
so that somebody could go on jam the

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,440
printer and he found that

00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,600
he didn't have access to code to make

00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,880
that simple change and it infuriated him

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,839
so he formed the free software

00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,320
foundation

00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:22,560
but the perspective of the free software

00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:25,600
foundation is that software

00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:28,480
is a public good and what i mean by that

00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,680
is that there are no such things as

00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:33,760
proprietary rights

00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:37,199
in software you cannot withhold the code

00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:38,639
for anybody ever um uh

00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,320
you know and if you're going to

00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,279
distribute the code or modify code and

00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,279
further distribute it

00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:45,040
you can't withhold those modifications

00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:47,279
from anyone so the source code must

00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,519
always be available and nobody has the

00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:51,360
power to tell anyone else what they can

00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,639
or cannot do with the code

00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,040
that's a method that's that's an

00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,480
ideology the open source initiative is a

00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,079
little more commercially minded and

00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,680
there's an understanding that

00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,519
you know some of us again weren't we're

00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,600
born rich we have to earn a living we

00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,279
want to use this open source methodology

00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,040
to expedite development

00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:09,839
but we also want to figure out a way how

00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,920
we might make some money on the code um

00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,880
and hopefully improve you know improve

00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,279
overall

00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,480
uh the development process uh by virtual

00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,480
open source

00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,920
um so then what are the common elements

00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,959
of an open source license

00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,440
um and we're gonna talk in about seven

00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:25,839
minutes

00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,760
about the spectrum of licenses but

00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:29,440
whether a license is like

00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,959
really really copy left or whether it's

00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,639
really really permissive

00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,240
um there's certain things that are

00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:38,079
always applicable in an

00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:39,920
open source license um the first is

00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,120
you have the right to the software now

00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,680
both an object code

00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:46,000
and in source code um that includes the

00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,440
right to reproduce and use

00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,680
the right to modify and the right to

00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,120
distribute the code that's in every

00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,839
software license open source software

00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:56,079
license there's also

00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:57,120
disclaimers um oh the software's always

00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,720
provided as is

00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,160
there no reps or warranties as to the

00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,680
functionality of it and there's no

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,399
intellectual property warranties no

00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,399
one's going to

00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,920
give you protection against the lawsuit

00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:07,040
um if somebody claims that the code

00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,199
infringes

00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,320
and then there are minimum contributions

00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:12,399
on distribution

00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,920
of attribution and the notice file

00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,199
including the copyright and a copy of

00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,800
the license

00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:18,399
frequently and i think almost in every

00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,079
case it needs to be included

00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:21,839
these are common to all open source

00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,519
licenses and here's here's a great

00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:26,639
example this is the mit license

00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:28,079
extremely permissive license um and

00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,839
remember i talked about patents and

00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:32,160
copyrights i just bring this up because

00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:34,320
i tried to code some of the um

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:37,199
the words so you can try to tie them

00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:39,600
back to the intellectual property rights

00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:41,759
so if you remember patents give the

00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,680
inventor the right to make use in cell

00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:45,519
so here you see the word use which is

00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,759
patent merge which

00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:49,120
maybe is patent i don't know cell which

00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,720
is definitely a patent

00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,120
but then you have under copyright the

00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,040
right to copy uh which is copyright

00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,560
modify and to publish and then

00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,399
distribute as sort of both right you

00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,199
could argue distribution is a sale but

00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,079
it's also

00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:02,880
a publication um so the mit license i

00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,880
don't think they

00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,640
really went into the specific language

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,000
of the intellectual property rights but

00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:11,039
it sort of covers

00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,079
um this very broad general license

00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:15,199
but notice it's still conditional if you

00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,480
notice the very last

00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,199
line says subject to the following

00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,559
conditions um so the licenses are always

00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,799
conditional

00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:25,039
sometimes there are tiered licenses um

00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:27,439
this is agpl 3.0 which is

00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:28,319
we just went from the permissive end of

00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:30,320
the spectrum

00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,000
to the most non-permissive and most copy

00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:36,640
left end of the spectrum

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,240
help v3 is extremely non-permissive

00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,240
and what it does is it breaks the

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,640
license into components so the license

00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,039
has

00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,760
first a license to run the unmodified

00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:46,880
program

00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,480
um and and actually remember i

00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,919
talked about not having to worry about

00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,280
open source code if you're

00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,200
just using it for your own internal

00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:56,080
purpose this is a great example

00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,679
even the most copy left license has no

00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,840
implication to you whatsoever if you're

00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:00,880
just running it for your internal

00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,960
purposes but then there's also the

00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,160
ability to convey which is their form of

00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,559
distribution

00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,080
so that great sounds in copyright convey

00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:10,960
the verbatim copies

00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,320
or to convey modified source versions um

00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,240
i won't jump too far ahead but the

00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,200
notion there is that there are a lot of

00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,360
conditions though

00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,960
associated with any of those conveyances

00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,640
or distributions

00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,799
um we talked about the notice and

00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,120
attribution um the distributions must

00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:27,039
always contain a copyright notice

00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,880
and include a copy of the license um

00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:30,080
here's an example from apache version

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,840
2.0

00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,600
and this is only fair right because

00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,360
somebody wrote that code

00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,200
it's only fair that they should be given

00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,880
the attribution for having written it

00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,360
and it's only fair that their copyright

00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,960
gets propagated so that folks know that

00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,559
it is protected

00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,240
there's also a disclaimer of reps and

00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,919
warranties again if you're making

00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,240
software available for free

00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:52,240
um you're probably not that interested

00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,000
in having somebody sue you because

00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,000
software didn't work the way you wanted

00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,840
it to work or sue you because

00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,840
they felt like they didn't find some

00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,520
third-parties rights

00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,440
and finally we talked a little bit about

00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:06,720
patents i won't go

00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:08,240
too far into this but licenses tend to

00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,320
either have no patent

00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,919
representation at all or if they have a

00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,799
patent license

00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,360
it tends to be conditional and i really

00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:17,200
like

00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,720
the way that the patent license is

00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,679
treated in the apache

00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,520
license version 2.0 essentially it says

00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:26,640
it has a licensee

00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,600
i decide i want to sue some other

00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,360
licensing

00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:33,600
from arguing that their use of this code

00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,960
that i'm benefiting from infringes one

00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,799
of my patents

00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,240
then any of the patent licenses that

00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:40,799
were granted to me

00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,160
and under that same piece of code are

00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:45,440
automatically revoked

00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:48,799
so it's a disincentive for folks to sue

00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:51,760
each other for patent infringement

00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:54,240
so um let's talk about copyleft or

00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:56,559
permissive versus non-permissive code

00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,760
so the ideology of copyleft and i'm sure

00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:00,799
everyone's heard this

00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:03,120
is free as in freedom not as an ear and

00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:06,400
the notion here again is that software

00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,960
is a public good what's clever about

00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,799
this

00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,159
to some extent i guess i won't probably

00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:12,640
know this is richard stallman

00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:13,440
founder of the free software foundation

00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,880
there's a

00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:19,679
cleverness to it i suppose which is that

00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,000
what solomon has done is taken copyright

00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:23,679
which

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,760
is which is you know again it's right

00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,360
it applies as soon as the code is

00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,919
expressed

00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,520
he's using his own copyright in the

00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:34,159
software that he's written

00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,880
um or software in projects that he

00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:37,679
started

00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,440
um he's using the copyright power of

00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:41,440
that to condition

00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,480
further use for distribution of that

00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,720
same code

00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,799
and the further use of distribution of

00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:49,679
that code requires

00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:50,400
that anyone who modifies that code make

00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,400
available

00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,240
under the same exact license their

00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:57,360
modifications to that code

00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,240
um so the idea is i like the last line

00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,080
of the quote

00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,960
of the quote thus the code and the

00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,760
freedoms become legally inseparable so

00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,159
again

00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:08,000
for free software foundation or copyleft

00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,799
the notion is that software is a public

00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,240
good

00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:16,000
but copyleft does not cover all software

00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:18,159
and not all copyleft is alike in fact

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,080
um if you had done a survey about 10

00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:23,200
years ago probably

00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,000
72 to 80 of all software would have been

00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,960
licensed

00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,919
under gpl or some variation of gpl at

00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,120
gpl

00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:33,280
um mpl maybe but

00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,760
actually a survey was done recently and

00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:37,919
about 52 or 54

00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,760
i believe now of all software that's

00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,200
licensed under open source licenses is

00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,240
actually licensed under permissive

00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,360
licenses

00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,159
um so the preponderance of of copy life

00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,280
licenses

00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:52,720
has um is beginning to wane

00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,120
i would also note that um not all copy

00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,240
left

00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:58,320
is the same um copy left varies and the

00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,480
amount of popular ferries based on the

00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:03,120
type of the license itself

00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,600
um i do want to make a couple of notes

00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:08,400
here

00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:08,400
um one is um that

00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,039
you know if you think about the best way

00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:15,440
to put this

00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:16,159
the notion of copyleft is that when you

00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,039
modify

00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:21,600
the code and you further distribute that

00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:23,679
modified code you must

00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:25,039
distribute the modifications under the

00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:28,159
same terms under which you

00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:31,440
licensed it for example gpl version 2.0

00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:35,120
or a gpl or lgpl um

00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:36,799
what varies uh is the scope of

00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:39,520
the what's considered to be a

00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:41,600
modification or a derivative work

00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,840
um the reason why there are whole

00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:47,440
chapters on traditions devoted

00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:49,760
to gpl version 2.0 and why um

00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,360
actually i saw greg back is on this call

00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,840
too why we spend

00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,120
one hour a week every week like going

00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,200
through licenses

00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:59,520
is because some of the licenses

00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,000
especially the gpl version 2.0 is not

00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,240
that

00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,840
precisely written they reference what's

00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:07,520
called a derivative work

00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:08,240
as being also covered by gpl version 2.0

00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,000
but

00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,760
they then go on to describe something

00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,720
that under copyright isn't really a

00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,840
derivative work

00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:19,360
it's sort of like they combine

00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:21,360
combined with or containing uh the code

00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:24,760
which creates a lot of concern

00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:26,240
because gpl version 2.0 was written like

00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:28,960
1993-94

00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,799
um when code was distributed by you know

00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,200
hardware by disk drives

00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:34,320
um it hasn't it never contemplated the

00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,720
internet and certainly never

00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:39,520
contemplated

00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,720
github so um that's where a lot of

00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,840
concern runs into

00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,000
that's that's where there's a lot of

00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,679
concerns so um

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,159
not all copy left is the same there are

00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:52,000
varying degrees the strong copy left is

00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:53,520
you know aero gpl the 3.0 uh gpl

00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
and then we copy left would be something

00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:57,679
like gpl well b2 is the class path

00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,200
exception where they allow modifications

00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:00,000
to be distributed under proprietary

00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:03,200
license

00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,559
and in the middle you have lgpl and mpl

00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,919
and essentially what they do

00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:10,640
is they say um you can do

00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:12,240
works that are not combined and

00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,840
distribute those under any license that

00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,080
you want all we care about

00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,760
is that if you modify our source code

00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,279
just our source code

00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:22,320
that you make those modifications

00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:24,880
available under the same license

00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:26,960
um i want to contrast copyleft with a

00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:30,000
very permissive license

00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:32,159
so um the notion of a copyluck license

00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,679
is you're controlling

00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:36,240
the licensees used to establish the

00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,559
license

00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:41,039
under which they're going to distribute

00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:44,960
modified versions of the code

00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:47,360
a permissive license says here's my code

00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,320
you can do what you want with it you can

00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,480
modify

00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,760
the code and you can license those

00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,600
modifications under

00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,880
any license that you want so we're not

00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,279
going to control

00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,039
how you downstream license your

00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:00,640
modifications of the code

00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,240
however of course we still want to make

00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,440
sure that you give us

00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:07,039
that you attribute the code to us and

00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,480
you make those modified versions

00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:10,400
available

00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,000
for viewing so that people can see what

00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,440
you did to the source code that we

00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,679
allowed you to use

00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,039
so a permissive license doesn't try to

00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:19,200
impact or control

00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:20,640
downstream licenses and that's the

00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,039
difference between copyleft

00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,640
and permissive copyleft tries to control

00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,520
the licensing terms for downstream

00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,960
licenses

00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,279
permissive licenses don't um and there's

00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,840
this

00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:32,480
uh interesting little chart here that i

00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,520
borrowed

00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:37,760
um which kind of puts a map and shows

00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:40,880
from the spectrum of a very permissive

00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:43,600
to strongly protective or very copyleft

00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:45,360
and the arrows here uh begin to

00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,840
contemplate the next

00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:49,440
uh topic which is compatibility um

00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,760
you'll see that on the left

00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,200
you can go from very permissive licenses

00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,799
which don't try to control the

00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,279
downstream licenses

00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:58,799
to very protected licenses which

00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:02,720
absolutely control

00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:04,880
what downstream licenses apply

00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,400
so let's talk about compatibility and i

00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,520
also like to remind you again this is

00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,960
the asterisk here

00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,799
it really only matters if you're

00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,600
distributing code because these

00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:14,240
conditions

00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,440
on downstream licensing if you're not

00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,679
downstream licensing

00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,039
they're not melting so the notion of

00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:21,200
compatibility

00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:22,880
is that the least permissive license

00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,880
will prevail

00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,480
so in this example which is taken from a

00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,559
wonderful book and actually have a list

00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:31,520
of resources at the end of the month

00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:32,640
um heather.com i'm sorry heather meeker

00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,039
has a great website

00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,559
um and even within her website you can

00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:38,240
get a free copy of her book

00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:40,400
open source for business and this chart

00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:43,679
is taken from that book

00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,559
but remember we talked about um uh if

00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:48,000
you want to

00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:50,080
use apache 2.0 for your project apache

00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,240
2.0 is a very pervasive license right

00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:54,320
you're allowing your licensees

00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,440
to modify the code and redistribute

00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,520
those licenses and

00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,640
redistribute that modify code any way

00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,279
that they want

00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:03,039
well if you've got gpl software in that

00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:05,120
project or in that package

00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:06,240
it's going to be a problem because dpl

00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,159
doesn't permit

00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,600
the downstream licensees to do what they

00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:13,120
want in fact gpl

00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:16,640
requires you to license your target

00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:18,960
under under gpl so you would have

00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,000
an error for an incompatible license

00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,559
instead what you would

00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,039
have if you've got and this is that

00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,559
again

00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:26,080
the notion that the least principal

00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:28,320
license prevails

00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,760
if you have in a project multiple

00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,679
bundles of licenses

00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,039
you have to go to the least permissive

00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,559
one essentially

00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:36,960
and that's the one that's going to apply

00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:38,640
to your subsequent licensing of the code

00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,200
and it if it were only that simple

00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,720
there's also entire charts devoted to

00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,440
compatibility

00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:48,640
because of the way that gpl version 2

00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:50,880
and gpl version 3 and then adpl v3

00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:53,760
evolved it's not always quite that clear

00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:56,320
cut but the general principle is

00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:58,159
you can only license your project under

00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:00,720
the least permissive license

00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:01,440
in the package that you've got which of

00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,520
course

00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,559
triggers the notion of compliance

00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:08,080
because

00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:08,880
um if you're a lawyer like me you worry

00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,919
about

00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,440
um violating somebody's uh

00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:15,520
license rights because if you do that

00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,039
then you're violating their copyright

00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,960
and in addition to having reached a

00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:20,320
contract that person can sue you for

00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,159
copyright infringement

00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,679
um and if it's a willpower for instance

00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,880
there's trouble damages but even if it

00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:26,399
isn't local infringement

00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,799
they can stop they can actually

00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:30,480
literally prevent you from further

00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:32,799
selling or even supporting that software

00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,480
until you fix the incompatibility so

00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:37,120
it's something that lawyers do worry

00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:41,760
about a lot is being compliant

00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:44,799
um but before i talk about compliance

00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:46,480
in the notion of you know people being

00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:48,320
mean for lack of a better word

00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,600
i do want to talk about the softer side

00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,840
of compliance which is

00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,960
why we should why we should comply

00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,200
anyway

00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:57,520
and this gets to um i think a happy

00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:01,039
marriage of the principles of the fsf

00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:02,559
and the osi which is you want to honor

00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:04,000
the code right you want to honor the

00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:05,760
person who wrote the code and you want

00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,399
to comply with their wishes so if they

00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,600
have

00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:09,840
you know the desire to control

00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:11,039
downstream licenses we should we should

00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,360
respect that

00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:14,880
i think you also want to um you know

00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:17,919
preserve the copyright

00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,760
um but for a lot of folks

00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:21,360
um and actually one of the greatest

00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,640
examples of this was a commentator in a

00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:26,240
seminar i attended once

00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:27,279
who had a pacemaker and um the pacemaker

00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:30,399
that controlled her heart

00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:31,600
had software built into it um and it was

00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:33,279
closed source software

00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:35,360
and she was saying like this is really

00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:36,799
interesting there's this code

00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,039
that controls my pacemaker that

00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:41,360
basically controls my life

00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:42,960
i'm a developer i'd like to read that

00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,760
code so i could figure out what's going

00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,240
on there

00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,440
but i can't because it's closed so the

00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,600
notion

00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,640
of of compliance is that if somebody

00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,799
wants their code

00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,080
to be available to the marketplace we

00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:56,559
should honor that

00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,919
um and then many times even some of the

00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:00,720
organizations that

00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:02,240
um enforce copyright compliance or

00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,760
enforce license compliance

00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,360
they're not out to make money they're

00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,360
not out to ruin your business model they

00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:09,360
just really strongly believe

00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:11,360
that code and modifications to the code

00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,880
should be made available to the public

00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,320
so i do want to say that's the softer

00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,120
side of compliance and i think it's

00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,440
important

00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,559
you know as as developers and as lawyers

00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,640
to honor that

00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:22,720
um so a couple things we look at when

00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,880
we're trying to deal with

00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,320
distribution is you know provide the

00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,840
attribution provide the notice

00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,360
identify changes to the code if the

00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,120
license requires it

00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,799
if it's a weak copy left you preserve

00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,600
the progeny of the source code which is

00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:34,960
to say that you

00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,799
you know make sure that any

00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,440
modifications that you've made are

00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:39,760
available

00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,120
to uh to be viewed and are subject to

00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:43,360
the same license

00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:45,039
as the original source code it's a

00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,799
strong copy left you have to preserve

00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:48,559
the freedom of the code which is

00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:50,159
again you know everything gets licensed

00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:51,840
under the least permissive license

00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:53,919
um but and then how do you make sure

00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,480
that your project has the right license

00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:56,320
for

00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,000
that you didn't bring a component into

00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,519
your project that's going to

00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,840
basically conflict with the license you

00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:04,080
want to go through so i'm just giving an

00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:06,080
example of how we do this at elastic

00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,760
people have various ways of doing it

00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:09,840
this is the way we do it

00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:11,840
we established an open source policy and

00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:14,640
this was primarily driven by

00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,679
our engineering team with lawyers just

00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,799
kind of helping out

00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:20,399
on the side but we took a look at the

00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:20,960
various licenses that were available

00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:23,039
through

00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:25,039
the osi in particular and we came up

00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:26,000
with the red list which is licenses we

00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:28,640
could never

00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,480
license because we wanted to license our

00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:33,919
code under apache 2.0

00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,799
so for example if we have a gpl or a gpl

00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:36,480
v2

00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:38,000
project within our component within our

00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,880
code it's going to create a problem for

00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,720
us because that's going to

00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:43,600
prevent us from being able to license

00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:45,360
under apache 2.0

00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:47,200
so we have a red list we have a yellow

00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,640
list which are licenses that we might be

00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,480
able to include

00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,240
with some caveats and then we have a

00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,919
green list which is software that you

00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:56,480
can include because the licenses are

00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:58,320
entirely compatible with apache 2.0

00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,840
so our policy talks about what license

00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:02,240
are compatible and then

00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:04,240
also talks about what has to be required

00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,919
in each of the license files

00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,799
and the headers and the notices to make

00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:12,159
sure that we're honoring the attribution

00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:14,320
obligations that we have we also have a

00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:16,799
due diligence component which is

00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:18,000
a tool called fossa which and there are

00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:20,240
other tools out there but it's an

00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:24,000
automated tool that scans the code

00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:26,000
and identifies the license that applies

00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,440
to each of the components that have been

00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,880
vendored or built into

00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:33,840
the project and not only does fossa

00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:35,279
identify the license that applies to the

00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,880
snippet or the code that might be

00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:40,320
included within our

00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:41,600
within our code it also is able to

00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,279
revert back to github

00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:46,000
and look back like two or three

00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:49,440
generations to make sure that

00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,640
the person or entity from whom we

00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,559
obtained that code

00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:54,559
may have licensed it under one

00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:56,720
particular type of open source license

00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:58,399
say the mit license but we have to make

00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,159
sure that they didn't actually

00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:01,600
violate a license policy with some of

00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:02,559
the components that they built into

00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,559
their project

00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:06,240
so it goes back two or three generations

00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:07,919
to ensure that there's consistency of

00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:11,519
licensing throughout

00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:14,480
um it's pretty pretty remarkable um

00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:15,120
and then in our proprietary licenses

00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,640
where we

00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:19,360
you know we take advantage of the apache

00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:22,559
2.0 license to license some of our code

00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:24,640
under proprietary terms but we make sure

00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:26,159
uh in those licenses to call out the

00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,720
fact that we do have open source

00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:29,840
software

00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:31,840
in our project or in our code and that

00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:34,240
those components are available under the

00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:36,799
terms of those open source licenses

00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:38,399
and we also provide a location where

00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:41,120
individuals can find out what

00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:42,960
third-party dependencies is oh seven to

00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:46,480
seven levels that's pretty cool

00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:48,320
um so um and this is the last part of

00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,480
our compliance program which is

00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,440
you know we publish we publish a list of

00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:54,240
all of

00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,720
the open source components that we have

00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,000
um

00:33:54,720 --> 00:34:00,000
and i'm guessing probably not

00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,360
every single license requires us to do

00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,080
that but we just think that's the right

00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:05,679
thing to do

00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:07,840
so um if you go to our open source

00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:09,200
disclaimer page you'll see a list of

00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,760
literally every component

00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,560
that is licensed in from a third party

00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,480
by the version

00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,800
the license and the url where you can

00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,079
actually get that component

00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,240
finally we'll talk a little bit about

00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:23,200
open source business models

00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:25,440
uh so um there are various ways of

00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:27,679
making money in open source because

00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,599
um sure the code might be freely

00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:31,280
available right we might make the code

00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:33,599
available for free and we may

00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,720
we may make a license to that codeword

00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:37,119
code available

00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:38,240
for free but that doesn't mean we aren't

00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:40,560
going to make

00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:41,839
any money on it um and i'll you know the

00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:44,320
greatest example i can

00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:46,159
come up with is my own company elastic

00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:49,040
um it was an open source project that

00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:51,760
was started by our now ceo

00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:52,560
when he was an engineer in 2009 i

00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:56,079
believe

00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:58,960
he wrote the elasticsearch software

00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:00,720
and made it available under apache 2.0

00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,920
which is a very permissive license right

00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,440
so he wasn't trying to control

00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:05,839
downstream licenses

00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:08,000
um and his you know when there was no

00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:10,240
model for making money at that point

00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,520
but ultimately he was able to eventually

00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:14,320
turn that into

00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:16,320
a business a very powerful business um

00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:19,440
we're on target to do

00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,480
about five between 550 and 570 million

00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,760
dollars a year i think that's what our

00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,680
latest earnings

00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,680
announcement stated and we have a market

00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:27,680
cap of around 10 billion dollars

00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:29,359
so obviously you can be successful in

00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:31,119
open source and in fact

00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:32,800
um there are venture capitalists found

00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:35,440
with silicon valley who focus

00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:37,040
almost well they do focus exclusively on

00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:39,040
open source based companies

00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:40,160
because the development methodology is

00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,920
so powerful

00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,359
and because the communities that develop

00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:47,040
around open source projects

00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:48,320
are so are so tight um so there are ways

00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:51,040
to make money at it

00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,440
one of the ways is to do a license i

00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,359
don't

00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:55,119
think this is a viable license in a

00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,680
viable model in the long term but it

00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:58,560
certainly

00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:59,440
has been a viable license oracle has

00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,119
used it

00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,440
essentially you have separate code bases

00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:05,920
you have an open source

00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:07,440
code base which is available for free

00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,680
and then you have

00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,880
additional features and functions that

00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,839
aren't included in the original

00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,599
distribution

00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:16,240
sometimes it's even an entirely separate

00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:17,599
code base which if you're not available

00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,760
so i'm not going to dwell too much on

00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:22,079
that the more

00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:24,000
evolving business model that i see i

00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:25,200
think most of us see is the notion of a

00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,680
value add

00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,960
on top of the open source and this works

00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,000
really well when you've got like a

00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,240
platform

00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,920
so elastic is a great example red hat

00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:36,960
actually is a wonderful example they

00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,359
license version of linux under even gpw2

00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,280
but

00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:41,280
they still make are able to make money

00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:43,920
because they add support

00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:45,520
on top of the code because when you go

00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,400
to production as most of you may know

00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:49,440
having actually

00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:50,800
um having actually um

00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,359
doing this for a living when you go to

00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,960
production the last thing you want to do

00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:56,400
is not have a supported version of your

00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,079
software so

00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,599
a lot of times folks will take an open

00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:01,040
source project

00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:02,320
get it through the lab and decide to go

00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,520
into production with them and that's the

00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,560
point at which they'll reach out to

00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,160
elastic and say

00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:08,640
you know support this because i really

00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:10,960
want to have this project supported

00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:12,800
and then in addition you can build

00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,079
additional features and functions on top

00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,160
of the platform

00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:17,680
that rep and you you charge for those

00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,960
but that's a representation of the fact

00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:21,599
that you've created

00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,640
um you know significant value above and

00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:26,079
beyond

00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:27,200
the platform itself um i do want to talk

00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:29,359
a little bit about the difference

00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:31,599
between open core and open source

00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:32,560
and at the end of this presentation in

00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:34,800
the slide

00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:36,880
in the resources slide you'll see a link

00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,160
to an open court uh seminar that's going

00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:40,720
on later this month

00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:42,480
that is free and i would love to attend

00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:45,280
i encourage other folks to attend

00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:46,079
um but the difference between open court

00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,000
open source

00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:50,320
is that remember i talked at the very

00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,280
beginning about like what is open source

00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:55,200
like open source

00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:57,599
is a form of development um

00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,720
so open source is a form of development

00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:02,640
you can actually have an

00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:05,440
open core development um which is that

00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:06,000
the code is made available to the public

00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,400
and

00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,240
the community is invited to participate

00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:13,119
in development of the code

00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:15,280
um it's just that open source licenses

00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:15,839
won't apply to the entirety of the

00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,920
project

00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:20,400
so open source will apply to some of the

00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:23,440
project but not necessarily to follow it

00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:26,240
um and so open core model is intended

00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:27,359
to try to preserve some value to the

00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:30,240
project manager

00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:32,240
um associated with the the value add

00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:34,160
features and functions um

00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:36,400
it really evolved i don't think i have

00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:40,240
it well i'll jump forward

00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:43,040
it really evolved um largely out of

00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,760
um the fact that that companies like

00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:46,880
amazon

00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:48,079
are able to offer a software as a

00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:51,280
service version

00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:53,680
of a permissive permissively licensed

00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,520
open source without contributing back to

00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:58,079
the community and so they can make

00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:59,200
they can leverage essentially their

00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:01,760
monopoly or

00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,960
large market power as a provider of the

00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:06,000
sas platform

00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:09,520
to offer um you know

00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,200
the open source code as a service

00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,560
and and make a lot of money on it but

00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,280
not contribute anything back to the

00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:16,800
community

00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:19,839
and of course what um what folks like uh

00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:21,280
elastic mongodb and time scale uh do

00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:23,839
themselves is we figured

00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:25,359
we can make this available ourselves as

00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:27,359
a value-added business model to our

00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:29,440
community so the code is still open

00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:30,880
people can still see it and develop it

00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,720
but we just make available the

00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,960
convenience of the sas platform

00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,760
for for bringing it into production and

00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,640
as

00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:39,760
solutions evolve like ours from open

00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:43,440
source to

00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:45,680
you know more fully baked uh solutions

00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,520
our customer base changes and our

00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,839
customer base might be driven by folks

00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,280
who

00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:50,960
really don't want to try to build the

00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,640
infrastructure to host the software

00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,720
they just want to plug and play or turn

00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:56,320
it on and that's what a sas model does

00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,839
so that's another version of an open

00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,079
source business model that's

00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:00,960
gaining a lot of traction um i think i

00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:02,320
mentioned this but

00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,079
i'll reiterate there's a company called

00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,839
time scale db

00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:07,760
and they changed their business model

00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:09,680
about three months ago

00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:11,040
they are only monetizing through their

00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,480
sas offering now so

00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:14,400
you know they still make the open source

00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,400
available um for self

00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:18,319
management purposes but they're

00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,960
dedicating themselves entirely to

00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:22,960
sas as a business model so this is going

00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:26,000
to be a really exciting

00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:27,359
area to uh to see over the next few

00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,200
years as people come up with

00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:31,119
increasingly creative ways to

00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:32,480
take you know basically the power of the

00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:35,119
collaborative development

00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,839
and uh and turn it into a business so

00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:37,680
with that

00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:38,880
um i promise that there would be a list

00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:41,680
of resources

00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,720
um here's the list um a few that jump

00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,480
out at me but but

00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,760
i think these fives will be available um

00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,760
heather meeker is really

00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,960
just a great source of knowledge go to

00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,800
her website um

00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,720
there's all the information you ever

00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:55,760
want there um tldr

00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:58,960
legal is a great uh source

00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:00,319
of uh really synopsis of the various

00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,440
licenses that are out there so if you

00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:02,720
have a licensing you

00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,560
kind of want to not have to read the

00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:07,040
legalese and figure out what it means go

00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:11,000
to tldr it's a great resource

00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:12,880
um and then um a few others are there

00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,839
linuxfoundation.org is a great a great

00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:16,400
resource also

00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:17,760
um and then finally um uh the open

00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,280
course summit i mentioned this at the

00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,800
bottom of the resource list there i

00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:24,640
think it's going to be an interesting

00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:34,319
and fun seminar and so with that i will

00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:36,720
take any questions or comments

00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:38,000
go ahead eli howdy thanks for the talk

00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:40,319
carl it's very

00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,560
uh educational i feel like it connected

00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:45,280
a lot of dots for me because i've heard

00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:46,640
the ideology of say free software but

00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:49,680
the practical

00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:51,520
uh emphasis from open source and how

00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:53,680
they kind of interact so that that's

00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:55,359
light bulbs um one one thing i was

00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,240
curious about is if you could speak a

00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:58,400
little bit more on

00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:59,920
compliance i guess you know i am a

00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,720
software developer i work for a small

00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:03,599
company i

00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:05,520
used fosa because i thought well this is

00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:06,640
clearly beneficial because we are

00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:10,160
selling software

00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:11,920
as proprietary but we use

00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:13,280
open source software so we should be due

00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:16,400
diligent but

00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:18,000
part of me still wonders are there do

00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:21,920
you know of any examples

00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,800
of prosecution of violation of license

00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:25,200
terms

00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,920
so i guess in a case where somebody has

00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:30,240
that kind of

00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:32,640
invalid chain and somehow it's it's

00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:33,920
prosecuted i i guess it's

00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:36,319
i'm kind of lost there because i also

00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:38,319
wonder how would they know

00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:39,680
too and i guess that kind of gets into

00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:40,079
intent but yeah if you can maybe just

00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:43,040
speak

00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:43,040
a little on that

00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:50,560
um sure i'll i'll um i'll do my tests

00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:51,280
oh two or three things come to mind one

00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:54,400
is actually

00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:57,520
um this is this is this is quite um

00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:59,920
anecdotal um one of our

00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:01,599
customers is a german i won't give it a

00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:03,440
name away but it's a german company

00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:05,040
um and we actually one of the things

00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,240
that triggered our whole open source

00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:10,319
compliance program

00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:13,520
was um in in europe in particular

00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:14,800
there were some um gpl trolls for lack

00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,520
of a better word they were open source

00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,040
trolls

00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:19,520
um and i can't remember the exact name

00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:21,920
exact project but essentially

00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:24,079
there were on trolls who were making

00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:27,359
their code available under gpl

00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:28,319
two um and then looking to see

00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:30,720
distributions

00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:31,839
where they could tell that someone had

00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,359
brought their code in

00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:34,480
much exactly how they could talk because

00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:36,079
they didn't have access to the source

00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:37,119
necessarily or if it's licensed under

00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:38,720
patchy 2.0

00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:40,640
they absolutely wanted access to the

00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:41,280
source and then they would go out and

00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:44,319
basically

00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:46,079
you know hold up proprietary or you know

00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:48,880
apache 2.0 license

00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:49,680
projects um for the sake of extracting a

00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,880
toll

00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:54,160
um those seem to be not as

00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,680
not as prevalent as they were maybe

00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:56,400
about five years ago but this german

00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,319
customer

00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,520
was really concerned about that and they

00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:01,119
were actually

00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:03,520
we had a really good discussion with

00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:04,319
them and their concern actually prompted

00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:09,200
us to kind of

00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:11,359
accelerate um our um

00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:13,119
publication of components so that they

00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:14,960
could have greater confidence that we

00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:17,839
were not including anything in that code

00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:19,200
that would create a problem i think that

00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:21,359
most of the folks on this

00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,960
call are probably familiar with i think

00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:24,480
it's now google versus oracle because

00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:26,640
it's gone to the supreme court

00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:27,680
but that's truly an example where oracle

00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:30,720
essentially sued

00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:33,040
google claiming um that google

00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:34,800
violated the terms of their license when

00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:39,280
they created android

00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:41,839
and the basis of that claim is that um

00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:43,040
that google uh re-licensed android i

00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:45,520
can't remember the license now but

00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:49,200
essentially that google had copied

00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:51,839
um the apis and therefore anything that

00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:54,240
that derived from those apis uh had to

00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:55,680
be licensed under gpl v2 and therefore

00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:57,599
the entirety of android

00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:59,839
uh was was mislicensed and they're

00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:00,640
seeking billions of dollars of damages

00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:03,680
um

00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:04,319
so that's a probably a pretty relevant

00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:07,119
example

00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:09,280
um but actually i know also in my

00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:11,119
previous company not elastic

00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:12,880
but our previous company our developers

00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:16,240
had work

00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:17,599
basically oracle well i won't say

00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:20,480
mean things about oracle but oracle

00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:24,240
basically came after us because

00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:25,920
um they they they regularly would just

00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:27,520
go to anyone who would license the

00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:30,000
community version of my sql

00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:31,040
and they would demand an accounting to

00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,359
determine

00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:34,720
the specificity that you weren't using

00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:36,720
an enterprise version

00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:38,480
of because it was made available at the

00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:41,280
same repo right so like

00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:42,800
um and frequently you know developers

00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,640
either in early stage companies they

00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:46,079
aren't necessarily as careful as they

00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:47,599
probably or should be or they just

00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:48,560
figure like well i'll fix it you know

00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:50,720
down the road

00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:52,800
um and so we had to actually negotiate

00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:54,400
with oracle to get a license to their

00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,920
enterprise version because it turns out

00:45:54,400 --> 00:46:00,880
we were actually using the construction

00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:03,760
so it does happen

00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:03,760
yeah it's interesting

00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,880
yeah i the google the oracle case is

00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:11,280
fascinating

00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:12,480
it's been going on forever um and it

00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,240
actually went to the supreme court we're

00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:16,880
still waiting for the supreme court

00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:18,400
to um to issue a ruling on that but the

00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:19,839
issue there isn't necessarily the open

00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,920
source component it's whether

00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:23,440
whether apis themselves are subject to

00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:25,040
copyright um

00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:27,280
but nevertheless the entirety of the

00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:28,880
case is is quite interesting

00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,800
you know i think you could probably

00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:34,240
teach a whole not a whole bunch

00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:36,640
like a four or six week session

00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:38,480
he's curious about the fight the

00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:40,720
financial aspects of that too

00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:43,280
like how lawsuits been going how much

00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:47,359
they're spending how much they hope to

00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:48,960
eat but but so yeah

00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:50,400
billions and millions of pounds is what

00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,440
i think the jury is i think they're

00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:54,319
looking at billions and millions of

00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:54,319
dollars on energies

00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:58,319
that's one of the the debate there or

00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:01,680
the

00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:05,359
litigation is around whether that's um

00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:06,310
intellectual property so that was

00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:09,359
infringed upon

00:47:06,310 --> 00:47:11,359
[Music]

00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:12,960
yes yeah that um going back to the

00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:15,040
notion of copyright so copyright

00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:18,240
protects original expression

00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:18,720
but if something is required um in order

00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,559
to

00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:22,800
if something is an instruction versus an

00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:25,200
expression it's not copyrightable

00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:26,240
and so an example would be um it's

00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,040
really hard to come up with a great

00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:30,640
example

00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:33,200
um but an example would be like

00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:34,319
how to turn a screw in a screwdriver if

00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,920
i'm just describing that

00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:37,520
there's probably not much original

00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,640
expression associated with that because

00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:41,359
they might be only

00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:42,960
one way to do it um now of course

00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:44,000
somebody may have yeah recipes is a

00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:46,240
great example

00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,400
it's one where yeah you know there you

00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:50,400
go aaron aaron's got another example

00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:51,520
it's they're just instructions on how to

00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,440
do something

00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:55,359
and so the notion of an api is it tells

00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:56,800
you how right to

00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:58,559
you know how to interact with this

00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,440
program how can that possibly be

00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:02,559
copyrightable

00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:05,920
um but the notion is that there might be

00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:06,160
some unique expression associated with

00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:10,480
it

00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:11,599
um and and the the case history there is

00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,200
that

00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:15,119
the the first trial for it held they

00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:18,319
weren't copyrightable an appellate court

00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:20,160
held that they were copyrightable

00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:23,520
interesting so there's also that yeah i

00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:26,160
guess traversal of the

00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:26,880
authorities like who who's interpreting

00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,960
and sensing

00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,920
yeah i guess to kind of comment on too

00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:32,480
everyone's

00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:34,319
examples recipes the recipes are not

00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:36,400
copyrightable my sugar drink

00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:37,920
i could not make a copyright for yet

00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:42,160
coke is because it's a

00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:42,160
unique expression

00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:48,319
so actually coke is a trade secret if

00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:49,119
coke were to make if coke were to

00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:51,920
describe

00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:53,440
how to make coke they would lose all the

00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:55,119
it would be i see so

00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:56,640
yeah again it's a form of intellectual

00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:59,760
property but i'm wrong in thinking

00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:03,760
it's um an expression because it's the

00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:05,599
secret because it's secret

00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:08,319
right it has value because it's secret

00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:09,680
right right which as a which you know as

00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:12,079
a developer that's

00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:13,599
i probably should give that more this

00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:14,640
being open source i didn't go into that

00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:16,559
but

00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:18,319
that's actually if you have proprietary

00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:19,280
code right and you don't make the code

00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:21,520
available

00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:23,200
and somebody reverse engineers that code

00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:24,880
and you specifically say in the contract

00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:26,559
you're not authorized to decompile or

00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:28,319
reverse engineered code

00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:30,079
you have a trade secret claim against

00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:31,359
them because you made efforts to keep

00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:34,480
that code secret

00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:36,559
and they violated it um so

00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:37,839
um so certainly in the case of

00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:41,359
proprietary software

00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:44,079
trade secrets do apply well this is

00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:45,839
uh carl thank you very much we're out of

00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:46,720
time here so i apologize if folks had

00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:49,920
more questions

00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:52,720
um uh but uh a

00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:53,359
very interesting insight into uh

00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,880
licensing

00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:56,640
