somebody who wants to actually

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:17,119
work you know their own as a consultant

00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:20,560
or start their own consulting business

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:22,640
um usually i do this talk in person and

00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,200
there's more direct communication

00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,680
they're more q a and i ask people you

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,000

if they are in the room they are all

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,840
software developers full-time job or

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,280
they're working as a consultant or they

00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,680
have their own companies

00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,320
so right now it's a little bit hard for

00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,560
me

00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,000

so we're gonna run through some of these

00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,200
topics understanding the difference

00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,040
between consultant versus full-time job

00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,960
we're gonna learn about risks and

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,479
rewards for being a independent

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,240
and i believe we have 45 to 45 to 50

00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,479
minutes

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,080
so first let me i'm going to run through

00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,039
these different slides and share my

00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,880

and the court will come and we'll go

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,960
through those questions

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,440
so let's start with that you know when

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,360
we are in software development usually

00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,639
you know we have two kind of employment

00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,360
right either you are a full-time

00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,039
employee

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,199
you work for a company and you get a

00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,240
salary and obviously you get you know

00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,400
bonuses

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,360
increments over time and so on so forth

00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,440
and then other one is

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,960
independent contractor independent

00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,080
contractor they're also called

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,479
consultants you

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,160
name sub doesn't matter point is that if

00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:17,120
you work your own

00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,080
if you work your own and you work for

00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,560
different either a

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,639
another consulting company or recruiting

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,639
company or you work your own

00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,400
um that's kind of what is the major

00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:29,039
difference here right

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,240
so and what are the basically advantage

00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,840
this event that's what we're going to

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:36,080
talk about that

00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:39,360
um independent contractors are usually

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,720
um you you know you get a contract

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,800
you work with a company you get a

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,400
contract so usually you know

00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,960
let's say it's a six months contract you

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,440
get a rate rate is fixed it's a hourly

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,919
rate

00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:52,400
or it's a fixed contract we do you know

00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:54,720
i work on different projects sometimes

00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,599
it's hourly rate so we have you know

00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,880
including me

00:06:55,599 --> 00:07:00,880
we place these contractors um

00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,080
um on the client side and there's our

00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,319
rate for that sometimes

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,240
there are project fixed cost projects

00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,319
where you know companies like some of

00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,000
our clients say comcast for example or

00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,720
american water and these companies they

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,400
will say

00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,720
okay we have this project can you help

00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,840
us build it so we bid for that we look

00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,319
at that and then

00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,520
obviously we'll say okay six months it's

00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,199
gonna cost this much

00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,880
so that's kind of pretty much you

00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:26,000
working there

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,840
um and then when you're working as

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,360
independent contractor you can

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,400
sometimes work as a gw2 employee as well

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,560
as 10.99

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,560
the difference here is when you are w2

00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,039
you can even though you are working for

00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,280
a

00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:41,759
consulting company you are working as an

00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:44,000
hourly you can't restore an employee

00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,680
that means a lot of legal things are

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,240
taken care by your company

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,160
but when you're working as a 1099

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,680
contractor with the company then you're

00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,800
responsible for

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:57,680
your own taxes and your own

00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,039
filing paper and make sure you you're

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,479
invoicing those uh

00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,400
companies and clients you're working

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:05,599
with um

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:07,360
so most cases what i'm here talking

00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,039
about in this session is

00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,680
when you are working as an either

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:14,080
independent consultant or contractor

00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,039
or you're starting your own consulting

00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,199
company

00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,240
regardless you work your own just

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,479
one-man show

00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,560
or you have more than one person either

00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:25,280
your friends or your employees

00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,280
you still have to register a company

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:30,160
that's i highly recommend that

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,840
you don't just work you can work on your

00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,560
name you can use your social security

00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,159
number

00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,320
but the reason i'm saying you start your

00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,039
own company is that's exactly i'm going

00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,039
to talk about

00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:42,159
and advantage and why you should be

00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,159
registering as a company

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,440
so before i start with that let's think

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,360
about risk of being independent

00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,600
consultant right so you are independent

00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,160
consultant you work your own what is the

00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,519
biggest

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:59,440
risk um you know we run through that

00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,360
um if you're already working you know if

00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,600
you have work for a company

00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,440
you i'm sure you already know about that

00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,040
but if you have not

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,560
you've been full-time employee your own

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,560
life and you want to go say you know

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,640
what i want to venture out myself and

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,760
i want to you know work my own what are

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,519
those risks

00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,040
well let's start with a few points here

00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:20,240
first first risk is

00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,760
there's no job secured okay

00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,839
like if you're a full-time employee you

00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,600
know there is a job there i'm gonna get

00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,600
paid every month

00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,200
regardless of you know sometimes you may

00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,519
be sick sometimes you have

00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,800
you know vacation uh sometimes so and so

00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,760
forth but you're gonna get

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,040
that paycheck every month and it's a fix

00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,120
so you already know

00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,640
my salary is this much i'm getting every

00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,320
month this much

00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:45,519
but when you work on it as an

00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,279
independent consultant you don't know

00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,040
sometimes you get a contract say you got

00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,839
a six month contract you get a one year

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,560
contract

00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:54,959
you get two a contract but some in

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,920
sometimes contract go as you plan but

00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,680
there are some

00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,959
once in a while there will be a contract

00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,880
where it may be

00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,399
done early this happens all the time

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,760
right so

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,600
there is no job security number two

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,279
there's no benefits most cases right

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,720
there's nobody's giving you health care

00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,320
there's no health benefits there's no

00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,640
vacation there's no perks

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,399
it's pretty much more you work more you

00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,920
are unless you work less you are right

00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,040
if you're taking vacation nobody's going

00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,120
to come and pay you

00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,560
so this is you know you have to think

00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,959
all these things and again

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,800
this all depends on person to person and

00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,880
this is only

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,720
if you're trying to build your own you

00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,240
know say i want to go my own

00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,760
i want to build my own consulting

00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,200
company or i want to start just an

00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,480
independent construct and these are some

00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,680
of the challenges you have to run

00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,320
through

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,880
it and third point is delayed or no pain

00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,040
sometimes

00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,040
i work on projects i work on clients

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,480
usually smaller clients

00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,959
if you're working for a big large

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,320
corporation they already have a process

00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,640
okay they have a process

00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,079
you have to submit invoice after 30 days

00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,959
you're going to get paid or 60 days

00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,880
you're going to get paid

00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,720
but when you are dealing with a small

00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,600
company small clients you have to be

00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,720
careful

00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:05,200
um and i work with a lot of small

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,240
startups in small companies small

00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,920
businesses

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,680
where you know sometimes

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,040
they they think they have budget then

00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,399
they don't have budget sometimes they're

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,920
going to pay you late so when you're

00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,200
dealing with the small businesses you

00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,600
have to be careful

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,600
make sure in your contract in your

00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,519
contract you clearly identify

00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,800
when are you are going to get paid what

00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,440
are the terms

00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,839
and just stick to those terms okay try

00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,240
to negotiate with the company

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,959
so you get you don't fall behind too

00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,079
much don't

00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:38,720
don't go like a 90 days of payment 90

00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:39,200
days terms right try to do 10 days 15

00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,360
days

00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,360
or sometimes even like as soon as you

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,200
invoice try to get paid sometimes these

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,959
good things with smaller companies is

00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,120
they may even pay you right away or

00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:50,800
sometimes even upfront

00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,880
so for example i'll give an example

00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,600
right if you have a three months

00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,279
contract

00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,079
and you have some deliverables you can

00:11:55,279 --> 00:12:00,160
say if i deliver can i get paid on my

00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,000
deliverables because then also it makes

00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,720
sense you can deliver early and we get

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,760
paid earn

00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:08,880
that's also possible so try to do that

00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:12,399
um try to not fall behind i remember

00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:14,160
um on one of my clients you know i

00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,480
you know i became a friend i was working

00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,639
with this guy and then he didn't pay me

00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,079
30 days then he didn't pay me in 45 days

00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,240
he played 60 days

00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:24,720
and end of the day i never got paid so

00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,560
that's kind of thing you have to avoid

00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,000
if some you know client is not paying

00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,000
for whatever reason maybe

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,079
you want to stop working okay you have

00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,680
to be careful with that

00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:36,720
um and then if you are an independent

00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,519
consultant

00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,040
there's more there's a lot of legal work

00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,360
also and you know we are software

00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:47,200
developers my background is software

00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,959
my whole life i've written code okay my

00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,120
you know my master's degree in

00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,160
programming so i'm a program and i know

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,560
how much

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,000
we hate legal work in accounting in

00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,399
texas it's just because

00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,760
it doesn't interest us so that's another

00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,240
thing you have to keep in

00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:04,320
account when you work your own is uh

00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,839
make sure you have to

00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,240
learn all those things and i have on you

00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:11,920
know the slide more talk about those

00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:13,040
um and then if you are independent

00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,000
consultant

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,519
you always have to continue learning new

00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,480
things and you have to establish

00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,360
yourself as an

00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,680
expert in at least one of the areas you

00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,560
can you know if i'm a full-time employee

00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,600
i'm working on a company my company only

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,920
does you know

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,880
say react development and there is your

00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,880
mongodb

00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:35,600
and they're using express and so on so

00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,320
forth i know all i have to do is learn

00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,839
these things

00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,959
okay and then i'm safe at least my job

00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,720
is safe because

00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,720
that's all we are building our new

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,880
products in but if you are an

00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,320
independent consultant even though your

00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,480
expertise in say

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,600
you know i don't know where front-end

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,279
development

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,760
or let's just say front-end development

00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,480
using react or angular you may have to

00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,040
still

00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,800
continue learning new things because

00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,240
chances are you may not have those

00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,240
projects available in the

00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,279
you know the what you're looking for so

00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,560
you have to kind of

00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:10,720
expand your expertise in that

00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,000
while it's expanding expertise you also

00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,040
have to establish yourself

00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,040
expert in at least one of those so give

00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,199
an example

00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:21,519
you know one of my friend he's an expert

00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:22,560
in just pwa progressive web app that's

00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,800
all he does

00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,959
so if you look at every time he talks

00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,760
every time on his profile every time he

00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:31,040
writes

00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:33,839
or anybody all he talks about pwa and we

00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:36,800
all see him as a pw expert so in one of

00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:38,240
our projects when we need pa pwa we know

00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:41,199
we can go to chris

00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,839
so that's how you have to think at least

00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,720
um

00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:46,160
and obviously as you can see my note

00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,839
here at the bottom

00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,000
i am going to talk about how do you

00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,639
mitigate these risks going forward like

00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,240
so you

00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,639
make sure you have job security make

00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,920
sure your if you don't have benefits how

00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,839
you take care of this make sure you

00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,600
don't have delayed payments and so on so

00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:01,519
forth

00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,040
so looks like so far we're doing good

00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,720
guys just you can let me know if i'm

00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:07,199
going too fast too slow

00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,519
feel free to you know post comment in

00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,519
there

00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,279
so we just learned what are the risks of

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,199
being

00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:17,360
an independent consultant but what are

00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:19,839
the rewards and i'll go back

00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,839
like why did i start my own consulting

00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,120
right why didn't i not work for a

00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,600
company

00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,680
well um and it happened with me and i

00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,240
just kind of just happened to me that

00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:32,160
you know i i was a single dad i'm single

00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,320
that for a while now

00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,480
and i had a young son and he really

00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:39,199
liked to play basketball

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,000
and he really liked to play basketball

00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,639
and as we know

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,160
if you have children and your kids are

00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,079
really good and you're playing you know

00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,560
varsity or au sports

00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,759
you have to spend so much time traveling

00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,600
you know driving them

00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,440
traveling with them every evening and

00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,839
weekend there's something

00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,360
and me being as a you know single dad it

00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,839
was really hard for me

00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,519
to work full-time in a company because

00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:03,600
you cannot leave it's like pretty much

00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,600
eight to five sometimes it's six

00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,279
and i was young at that time you know

00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,480
you you're not at the position where you

00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,000
can leave right

00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:13,199
so i was like you know what's hard for

00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:16,320
me i'm just gonna find the job

00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:19,759
that kind of gives me the flexible hours

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,240
right so that's really how i started my

00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,120
own

00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,240
and that kind of got me into that and i

00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,639
was lucky enough

00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,560
that i had some good friends they were

00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,399
able to get me some you know

00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,720
interviews in the very beginning and i

00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:35,040
also had a good profile set up so

00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,320
everywhere i went people already kind of

00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,160
knew me because i have written

00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,959
programming books by the time

00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,639
c-sharp programming language and dot-net

00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,920
was really new at that time you know i'm

00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:47,120
talking about 2000

00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:49,199
2001 and 2002

00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,959
dot net was so new nobody knew it and i

00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,079
was the only one i've written a book by

00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:55,120
the time

00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:56,800
so whenever i walked in in any company

00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,720
they thought i'm an expert even though i

00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:01,120
didn't know anything about it

00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,160
so sometimes you know your profile helps

00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,400
a lot you know

00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,679
but i remember i went to one my first

00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,919
contract job

00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,520
in the project manager who interviewed

00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,079
me he's like oh my gosh i already know

00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,039
you

00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:14,079
i wrote i i read your article on c sharp

00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:16,240
corner

00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:18,000
and i we don't know what to ask you

00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:21,360
because dot net was so new at that

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,760
time so that's another thing is when

00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:26,079
i'll talk more on other slides as well

00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,959
how do you build your profile so people

00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:30,080
see you

00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:32,880
as an authority in specific area

00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,799
once they start seeing an authority then

00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,360
you'll become getting a new project

00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:39,520
getting a new job or getting new client

00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,840
it's become so easy

00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:44,000
and that's what i learned throughout my

00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:46,559
my whole process

00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,760
um other reward of being an independent

00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:50,960
consultant

00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:53,840
um it's it's is what i like is that

00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,880
it's always interesting in challenging

00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,280
work

00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,799
it's not same board project all the time

00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,760
you just sometimes you go to these

00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,440
clients

00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,799
and you just learn you learn about

00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,200
people you learn about

00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:08,080
work like how these companies work i

00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:10,160
work i work with fortune 500 companies

00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,480
with small companies i work with the

00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,240
startups it's just so much fun learning

00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,360
and solving this problem

00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:20,160
but sometimes sometimes it gets boring

00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:23,600
too sometimes i remember one company

00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:27,280
um i was hired as a dot net architect

00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:29,520
but they gave me work on excel and vba

00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,960
so that's another thing you know working

00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,600
with when you are working as an

00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,240
independent consultant sometimes clients

00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,960
see

00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,520
client sees you as the expert in problem

00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,280
solver

00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,440
so they'll ask you to help them with

00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,720
anything and that's where it becomes

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,400
interesting is if you are

00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,520
able to help that client on the problems

00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,360
they are having

00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,200
out of certain that's how you build the

00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,400
trust and that's how they're going to

00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,679
keep coming to you

00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:58,640
every time they run into a problem um

00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,840
and um other other you know rewards here

00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,600
as you can see

00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,039
is sometimes you know you're working as

00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,960
independent consultants sometimes you

00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:07,039
get really good rates and you can work

00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,679
more hours you can work weekends depends

00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:09,200
on your

00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:11,360
you know and sometimes you can work on

00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,440
multiple projects so you can and

00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,720
really really increase your income

00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,960
frankly speaking

00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:20,160
um i was working full-time employing

00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:23,520
down in town pa which is not far from

00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,640
you know lancaster by the way i'm local

00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,600
guys so even though

00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,960
i don't come to this group a lot i'm

00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,640
local i was you know

00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:35,360
i came from india in 1998 in downtown pa

00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,000
so you know downtown pa salaries are

00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,080
very low

00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,160
i was getting 50k a year that was my

00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,919
salary but once i became

00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,600
you know starting my own my salary

00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,480
almost double or more sometimes in

00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,160
triple

00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,919
because i'm not billing hourly and my

00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,039
rates are good so you have to look at

00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:52,400
all those uh

00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:54,880
you know variables um

00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,880
and then last thing very important here

00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,320
is that when you work as an independent

00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,559
cultural consultant

00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,559
and it's illegal and it's allowed as you

00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:05,120
write up a lot of expenses

00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:07,120
and i will talk more about on this i'll

00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:10,159
take all your questions as well

00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:12,799
but what in legally what government

00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:14,960
says is that if you are earning some

00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:17,200
money you are making some money

00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,559
and you are using your home you are

00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,799
using your car

00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,240
you are using some of the you know

00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:24,559
utilities

00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,000
for earning that money you are allowed

00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:28,640
to write off some of these

00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,360
expenses and that this can this kind of

00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,600
adds up

00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,960
because so many taxes right so for

00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,640
example if you are working

00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,480
as independent consultant you can you

00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,960
always mostly working from home

00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,080
even though you go to the client side

00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,080
sometimes

00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,520
um even though you're full time there

00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,159
you still work at least some part of

00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,000
your home

00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,440
is you being used for businesses like

00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,039
either you're doing taxes

00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,880
you're getting business meals you're

00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:53,039
getting checks you're invoicing

00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,960
you're doing this you know some of the

00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:57,760
business activities are being done

00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,679
uh from your home so you can literally

00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,960
in your taxes you can write off a

00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,960
portion of your home

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,240
personally it depends on how much you

00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,600
are using it so

00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,400
for example you know if you have four

00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,559
rooms

00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,480
in your house and one of the room is

00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:14,640
just say this is my office

00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,400
you can literally go and write off 20

00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,720
percent of your net income

00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,159
to run business from home and this kind

00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,880
of helps in the long run as well

00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,360
especially

00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:26,000
if you're a small you know business you

00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:29,919
are running as independent consultant

00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,840
um but one thing we have to keep in mind

00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:33,440
when we really working as an independent

00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,559
consultant is that you have to and

00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,400
working from home

00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:38,080
now look at the curve at times right you

00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,960
have to be disciplined

00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:42,720
and this sometimes you know we all go

00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,799
through these phases where you know

00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,679
we don't feel like working hard and

00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:50,559
obviously thanks to this netflix and hbo

00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:52,000
and so many shows coming up i remember

00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:54,159
one time

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,360
um new show you know i never watched

00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:57,360
that uh

00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,200
one of the popular show on hbo i forgot

00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,039
the name uh

00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,480
i think game of thrones so game of

00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:03,679
thrones you know i never watched it

00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,240
until last year

00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:07,840
a year before once i started watching it

00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,000
so tempting and interesting

00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,600
i end up wasting so much time this

00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,039
happens all the time

00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:17,440
so you have to kind of train your brain

00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:18,320
say hey if i am in this room if i'm at

00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,559
this desk

00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,760
i have to just do some work you can't be

00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,679
watching tv

00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:26,080
and still thinking work then what will

00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:26,799
happen is you may not get the work done

00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,240
on time

00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:29,919
so these are the some of the you know

00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:33,039
you have to look into those uh

00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:36,080
your aspects um

00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:36,960
so so far so good uh looks like we're

00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:41,120
doing good

00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:44,159
we um on time-wise feel good so

00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,919
let's think about you say you know you

00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:48,159
know what i'm gonna give it a try i'm

00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:50,000
gonna become my independent consultant

00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:51,280
it's probably right now it's probably

00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,600
not the right time

00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,600
because of the curved you know not too

00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,520
many companies are hiring but plus

00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:00,000
everybody's kind of working from home

00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:02,000
but let's say kovit is over and so i

00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,520
hope it's over in six months

00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,600
it looks like we're going to get vaccine

00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,360
soon um

00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,880
you may say you know what i want to you

00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,640
know take you know i want to change

00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,600
something in my life you know i'm bored

00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,919
at work

00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,760
or i'm not making enough money or i

00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,720
don't like my boss or i don't like my

00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,880
company

00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,240
uh just a lot of people do it they

00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,400
complain a lot you know i

00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,159
we i don't see shark powder on shark

00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,400
corner we have live shows

00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,520
where i hear all the time a lot of

00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,760
people complain about

00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,520
oh i don't like my work i don't like my

00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,200
company i don't like my boss

00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,120
well here's the best part for being a

00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,120
software developer or

00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,360
any part in this software professional

00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,960
is that there's so many jobs available

00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,640
and they're growing they're not just

00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,559
going down okay software

00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,679
field is still growing big time if you

00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:47,840
are willing to

00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:49,279
learn new things go find the job you

00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,039
like go find the job

00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:52,799
you're passionate about go find a

00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:54,880
company you enjoy

00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:56,559
go find your boss where you enjoy their

00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,400
company right this is just

00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:59,679
but you have to do it like you can just

00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,960
be like

00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:03,600
stop you know you can just be

00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:06,080
complaining and don't do anything right

00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:08,000
so that's where really defines you if

00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,600
you are a software consultant material

00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,080
because

00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,840
it's challenging work and not all the

00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,520
time sometimes you'll get easy projects

00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,320
sometimes you may say hey here's a

00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,640
project

00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:20,240
come here sit in the team be a part of

00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,600
the team and you just work as an

00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,240
employee that's simple there

00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:26,000
but from time to time as i said you're

00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,520
going to get this work where you may not

00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,279
even have done before

00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:31,440
where you may or not have agreed with

00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:32,080
the client saying i didn't sign up for

00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,320
that

00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,520
i'm supposed to be doing an architect i

00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,240
cannot do vba

00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,279
right but client don't care they just

00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,880
they just need help

00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:43,600
right they're looking for help and they

00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:45,919
see you as the guy who can really

00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,520
you know who's superman or superwoman

00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:49,200
who can change everything who can help

00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,279
them that's what they're looking for

00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,880
so you may have been you and you may get

00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:54,480
thrown into this work where you

00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,799
you know it's hard and you may have to

00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,000
learn that you have to get your hands

00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:59,919
dirty as i said

00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,760
and sometimes there's pressure as well

00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:03,279
and we all know pressure is the so i

00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,559
don't need to explain you that

00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:06,799
even you doesn't matter if you're

00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:08,880
full-time employee or your

00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:10,480
consultant doesn't matter or contractor

00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,760
doesn't matter

00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:15,520
um one thing obviously i i really

00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:17,440
recommend is if you want to become

00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,640
your independent consultant or

00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,799
contractor

00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,760
you have to be a problem solver and

00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:25,120
think outside of box because sometimes

00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,440
you have to go to these clients

00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:30,720
sometimes they're just thinking one way

00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,919
okay so if you just go with them that's

00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,159
great that's fine

00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:36,159
but you also have to tell them okay you

00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:38,240
want to build this next project to say

00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:40,400
you are building your next website

00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,400
uh it's a large website you want to

00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,159
build this in asp.net

00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,840
maybe that's not a good idea even though

00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,640
they like you have to tell them like

00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,240
that's great

00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,320
but there's new things out there there's

00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,679
a blazer out there there's a react there

00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,919
there's angular there

00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:54,880
so at least try to that's you should

00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,440
become

00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:59,039
like not just one of their employees but

00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,200
also more like a

00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:02,960
thinking outside and also advising them

00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,480
on things that's

00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,559
that's what brings you value to the

00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,320
company right now company out of certain

00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:10,480
is going to think like this guy

00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,520
is not like anybody else he's also

00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,840
telling us you know

00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:16,080
how to do things better how to improve

00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:18,960
and frankly speaking

00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:20,240
when i work in you know um right now you

00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,919
know these days i don't do a lot of

00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,240
coding but earlier days

00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:26,240
when i was working myself just one guy

00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:29,279
single you know one man show

00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:31,520
i used to also train not training and

00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:33,360
teach and take sessions you know every

00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,360
week with the whole company say hey guys

00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:37,840
this.net new feature came out

00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,520
and i'm during lunch time i'm gonna talk

00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,640
to if you're interested just come listen

00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,400
to me

00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,000
that's what brings you that's what you

00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,679
know brings you to the highlight that's

00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,159
what management just started noticing

00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:48,720
you

00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:50,559
that okay this guy's not only doing the

00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,240
work he's supposed to do but he's also

00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:55,440
kind of helping our company to

00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:57,360
get better at things what we do and that

00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,720
also brings my next point you have to be

00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,360
a constant learner

00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,159
you cannot be just you know not learn

00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,320
and

00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:06,000
expect the same work keep coming again

00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,799
and again for over years because

00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,559
they keep in mind companies are looking

00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:12,640
for somebody who can come

00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:14,400
and help them and teach them sometimes

00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,720
you mentor their team

00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,159
to the newer things that in most cases

00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,159
that will make you better

00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:21,760
that will make sure you're always in

00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:24,799
demand

00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:26,720
um and then obviously there are two last

00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:28,960
point that those are very important

00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,720
you have to understand people right and

00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,559
personalities when you are working with

00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,640
different clients over time

00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:36,320
you you will deal with different people

00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,240
you you have to understand them where

00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,640
they're coming from

00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,679
excuse me and then what they're

00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,440
expecting

00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:44,880
and all that thing you have to do that

00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,200
has to be a part of the thing

00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,240
and i know a couple of my friends

00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,000
they've been working as

00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,360
independent contractor for a long time

00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,760
for i'll say 20 years

00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,399
they always struggle they always have

00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,559
they have

00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:58,799
projects but then once in a while they

00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:01,360
struggle a lot and the reason is that

00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:03,679
they just want to go tell the client

00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:06,320
what they think is the right way and

00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:07,039
you know and they sometimes you know

00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,520
they said no

00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:10,159
they clearly talk to clients say you are

00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,320
wrong

00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:13,760
so you have to think from both sides you

00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,600
just cannot be that

00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,440
you know this is my way and this is the

00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,720
best way so you have this

00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,360
that's how you really build a

00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,159
relationship and the last point is you

00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,080
have to be

00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:25,360
you have to have a thick skin right

00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,080
because

00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:29,600
many places i went employees sometimes

00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:32,159
are not going to like you

00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:34,880
it's simple because you know when i work

00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:37,279
i was hired direct by these senior guys

00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,320
to come there and help their team so

00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:40,159
sometimes team

00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:42,000
members going to thank you that okay you

00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:44,480
are much better than them or

00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,399
you may have to and i frankly was asking

00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,440
them to deliver learn new things i was

00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:49,520
asking them to

00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,520
deliver faster whatever they were doing

00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,919
i was asking them to move to like say

00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:55,760
start doing agile and start keep track

00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:57,600
so not too many people are really going

00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:00,000
to like you there will be some employees

00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,520
they're gonna you know push back like

00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,840
and they're gonna actually complain to

00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,600
the

00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,440
management also they'll say oh he

00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,679
doesn't know anything

00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,799
and i remember i work on a you know

00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:10,240
medium company

00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:12,720
small you know there were about 15

00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,240
people in the team and

00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,559
the project the guy was running the

00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,480
project wasn't really technical

00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:20,799
so some of the team members will go and

00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,360
show them old articles and even prove

00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:24,480
them that

00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:26,320
anything i was recommending is wrong

00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,320
so this happens all the time so you have

00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,960
to be ready for that this is a part of

00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,799
the business

00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,799
okay you're working and you're going

00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:34,880
fast and outside or in the company

00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:36,640
you cannot expect everybody to just give

00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,320
you red carpet

00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,080
so these are just some of the things so

00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:42,480
if you think you can do you can

00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:44,880
you know you can take on challenges you

00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,640
can get dirty you can handle pressure

00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,080
and you want to learn and you want to

00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,159
think outside of box

00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:52,399
and you are okay you have thick skin you

00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:54,880
don't care what people think of you

00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:56,640
that's maybe that makes you a really a

00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:59,600
good consultant match independent

00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,600
consultant material

00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:05,840
so we just learned okay what are the you

00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,640
know we just learned few things we learn

00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:09,039
about

00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,559
what are the risks and rewards of being

00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:13,840
independent

00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:16,240
consultant or start your own company so

00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,960
i'm here in my case regardless of your

00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,120
work

00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:20,559
through a company or have your own

00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,080
company i'm thinking about

00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:24,000
you when you're starting as your own

00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:26,240
company um

00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,480
we also learned that what your

00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,880
expectations should be at client side

00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,799
you know this is normal you cannot be

00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,880
the guy who just really get mad when

00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:38,320
people complain about you this is normal

00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:41,200
because you are a nice outsider okay

00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,600
so you already now know at least that

00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,600
yes

00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,200
i am gonna you know i'm gonna start my

00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,600
own consulting business

00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,760
not during the kobe times but you know

00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:53,039
maybe six months or a year from here

00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:54,799
how do i now how do i do certain things

00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:55,919
how what do i should be ready right how

00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:58,559
do i plan that

00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:00,720
how to launch the market so let's look

00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:04,399
at some of those points here

00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:06,399
um by the way the lot of these points i

00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:07,840
learned from which i helped my friends i

00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:09,840
helped some of the you know

00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,880
people i work with they start their own

00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,720
businesses

00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,480
um and you know when we are talking

00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,120
about this is an open source conference

00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,360
we talk about

00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:19,039
open source open source is great you

00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,000
know we are writing code we are sharing

00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:21,919
with everybody

00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,840
but open source doesn't have to be just

00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:24,880
the source code right open source can

00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,640
also be anything

00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,480
you're sharing your knowledge so what i

00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,080
do trying to do it through

00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,720
you know my sharing through either c

00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,919
sharp corner of these events is i share

00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:37,200
everything i learn

00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:38,559
so um the purpose of only that is that

00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,399
so mistakes i made

00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:43,279
things i learned through hopefully it

00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:47,279
will help you move faster

00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:49,760
so that's really i come from um

00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:51,440
so how do you launch so what you have to

00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,360
be ready before you say you know what i

00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,600
want to go ahead and go my own

00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:57,279
first thing is don't just quit right

00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,519
away okay

00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:01,279
you have to have a few months back a

00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:01,919
plan at least three months back a plan

00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:03,440
okay

00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:05,279
first of all you have to have a solid

00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,080
resume and then you have to promote the

00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:07,600
resume

00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,360
now some of the you may say you know

00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,279
what i don't want my company to show

00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,000
that if i'm looking for a job that's

00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:13,840
fine

00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,919
there's different ways to do that

00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:17,679
there's a if you go to the portals

00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:19,760
you can set that up there don't show

00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:22,320
this company to my resume right

00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,960
then you definitely have to build your

00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:26,000
um

00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:28,720
your professional um profile

00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,720
okay that's very important if you don't

00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,200
have a company you just want to go your

00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,840
own

00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,320
at least start with a linkedin start the

00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,320
linkedin

00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:38,159
start with twitter linkedin is actually

00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:40,320
where most of the jobs

00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:42,799
independent contracts these days come

00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:45,039
from a good thing about linkedin is

00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:46,880
a lot of people you already know there

00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:50,000
you know they are you're either cope

00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,960
coworker in the past you or you work for

00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,039
a company

00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,640
or you hired somebody so that's how

00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:55,519
really you build your professional

00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,440
network

00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:59,039
and then once you build your profile

00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,360
make sure it's up to date

00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:02,480
make sure your profile when i look at

00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,159
your profile or any

00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,080
company looks at your profile or client

00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:07,679
looks at profile make sure they get the

00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,760
clear idea exactly

00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:11,200
what your expertise is because

00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:13,360
everybody's looking for

00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,799
you know expert people even though you

00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,480
don't even know

00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:18,240
you may not be expert in anything but at

00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,320
least your profile should say

00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:22,000
what you really do and what you the best

00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:23,600
what you're good at

00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,120
don't put everything is there because

00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:28,080
they're just going to confuse

00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,960
so let's take an example if you are good

00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,200
at say

00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,720
net or if you are good at say you know

00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:36,159
angular make sure you are

00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:38,159
you can say i'm a senior angular

00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:40,159
developer then also make sure your

00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:43,360
projects kind of

00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:44,880
kind of you know validate that all the

00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,000
projects you're putting there should

00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,480
clearly say that

00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
because i did this work in there so

00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,200
don't just i see a lot of linkedin

00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,919
profile they're old

00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:56,000
right so first thing people did they do

00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:58,480
is if i'm hiring independent contractor

00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,120
i will go to linkedin i will search them

00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,720
in google

00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,960
so those are the two things i will do

00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:06,799
and i also look at their twitter profile

00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:08,480
so google searches linkedin and twitter

00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:10,079
that's where you go and start looking at

00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,879
your profiles make sure if somebody's

00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:14,000
searching

00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:15,599
you don't come as a as a you know known

00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,359
experienced person their profile should

00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:19,119
become their google you can also update

00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:22,320
your profile in google as well

00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:24,960
what your expertise are then

00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,399
so don't leave your job yet make sure

00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,639
you have solid resume

00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:30,480
and make sure you have the niche one you

00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,800
know expert is in one area and you have

00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,760
a

00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:35,040
solid profile built on these linkedin um

00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,480
if you're starting your own company

00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:39,679
obviously you're going to build a

00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:41,280
you know website that also says the same

00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:45,280
thing about your expertise

00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:48,639
and so on so forth then what you do

00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:50,399
is now you now start talking to people

00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:51,679
start talking to recruiters start

00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:53,599
talking to your friend

00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:55,359
i start talking to anybody in your

00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:56,000
professional network who you can trust

00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,680
that hey

00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,079
i'm going to start my you know i'm going

00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:01,520
to start my own either my own company or

00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:04,640
i'm going to go my own

00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:06,320
in three to six months what can you do

00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:08,000
let's think of you know so look at that

00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,320
look at your go back to your old

00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,480
contacts go back to your business cards

00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,400
if you still have those deck of business

00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:16,560
cards where you know that

00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,520
you work for this company or you hire

00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,599
this guy

00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,800
or you work with these co-workers where

00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:24,000
are they right go

00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:25,680
go with that and good thing with us is

00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,599
most software developers we are kind of

00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,480
up to date with our professional network

00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:30,400
anyway

00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,240
um so that's a good thing it shouldn't

00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,320
take much time

00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,440
they definitely meet the recruiters who

00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,480
either hired you

00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:40,240
or you hire uh some of their from them

00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,520
whatever recruiters can be your best

00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:43,520
friend in this

00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:45,520
because they're all that's their job to

00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,800
finding the jobs finding the clients and

00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:49,440
placing people right

00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:51,440
so don't feel like recruiters are you

00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,560
the bad guys go meet them have lunch

00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,079
with them

00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,480
and just become friends with them that's

00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:58,400
where you may also get a lot of work

00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:01,280
because they're always in demand they're

00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:04,720
always i mean looking for somebody

00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:06,800
uh once you do all that and then

00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,640
try to get a project side-by-side and

00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:10,320
when you have six months contract where

00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,280
you know that you are really good for

00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,320
six months

00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:16,160
then you really kind of leave um again

00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:18,000
don't leave make sure obviously we all

00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,480
know that but i still want to emphasize

00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,640
that

00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,480
don't leave your company in bedrooms if

00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,200
you have a you know two weeks notice or

00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,400
whatever

00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:28,000
or you have to do some you know uh

00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,320
knowledge and you know knowledge

00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,000
transfer to your next people or you need

00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:34,400
to even help them hire your

00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,599
replacement just do as much as you can

00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,359
because

00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:39,119
chances are you may end up talking to

00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:39,599
them again in future temples all the

00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:41,599
time

00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:42,880
people leave our one company go to other

00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:45,680
company come back again

00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,880
if you look at the history i mean our

00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:50,000
even though

00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:51,599
we feel like it's a big you know big uh

00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,680
space for software development there's

00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:54,960
so many it's still very small we are all

00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,400
connected to each other

00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,720
so make sure your professional

00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,800
relationship is still there

00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:02,340
most of you already know that so i don't

00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,520
need to repeat that

00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:06,160
[Music]

00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:08,000
all right so i think we have covered

00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:10,320
pretty good topics you want to

00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,079
start your own company you feel like you

00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,920
know what i'm done working full time

00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:16,240
this is it i'm gonna start

00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:18,560
how do you start we just learned that

00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:20,720
what you have to prepare for

00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:22,160
the next step comes is that how do you

00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,880
how do you protect yourself

00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:27,200
because when you work yourself a lot of

00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:29,280
legal issues will come direct on you

00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:31,520
okay so how do you protect yourself this

00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:34,800
is very important especially

00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,520
if you are starting a company where you

00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,240
may

00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:39,839
work as a company or you may even hire a

00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:41,760
couple of guys with you either your

00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:45,280
friend doesn't matter or employees

00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:47,040
right um so first thing i

00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:49,119
want you know talk about these points

00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,000
what they are what how they work and

00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:52,240
some it may not

00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,359
be applicable on you so maybe but i want

00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,920
to at least

00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:56,560
put them out there because at least you

00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,560
know them

00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:00,560
and when you you know you have any

00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:02,480
questions and details on specific we can

00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:04,720
go into more details later

00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,480
so i'm sure you've ever heard of nda and

00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,359
it's very important non-disclosure

00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,920
agreements

00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:11,920
make sure you have one place nda every

00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:14,480
time if you're trying to share your

00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,280
your ideas your company details with

00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:18,640
anybody

00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:21,440
especially this is usually the case when

00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,839
um you're trying to build something but

00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,400
if

00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:24,960
you're working for a company or some

00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,560
company

00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,480
especially small business they're gonna

00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,560
ask you to sign an nda

00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,000
so you have to be careful with that nda

00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,839
even if you are working

00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,599
for let's say you want to work through

00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:36,640
as an independent consultant but want to

00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:38,560
work through a recruiting

00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:41,200
staffing company you have to look at

00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:42,560
their their known disclosure as well as

00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:45,599
their known company

00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:46,160
okay sometimes they just write so much

00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:49,520
that

00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:52,000
oh once you work with us in healthcare

00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:54,320
you cannot work with any other company

00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,119
in healthcare within 100 months so you

00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,960
have to be

00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:59,760
especially careful with that what you

00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:01,599
sign that's very important

00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,440
i have two friends actually they went to

00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:05,440
legal issues when they started they

00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,599
left a company they started their own

00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:10,160
company but they were working through

00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:11,599
a recruiting staffing agency and they

00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:13,040
went into legal trouble because they

00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:15,280
were not supposed to work

00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:16,880
in that the contract said that you

00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:19,280
cannot work for any company

00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:20,400
in 50 miles of radius in similar

00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,240
business which means

00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,240
building software so you have to be

00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:26,079
careful with that

00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:27,839
now next thing you say you know what you

00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:29,920
have to even though you want to work as

00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:32,000
an independent contractor consultant

00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:34,320
if both our terms are interchangeable

00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,480
you should register a company

00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:38,320
um don't use your name and the reason

00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,680
for that if you use your name in social

00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:42,079
security direct

00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:43,440
and let's say something bad happens with

00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:45,599
the company or client

00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,200
everything will come to you means you're

00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:49,760
you're personally liable

00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:51,599
your personal house your personal car

00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:54,480
any asset you have that may

00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:55,200
be in and you know that may be coming

00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,040
picture

00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:59,680
so what happened just create a simple

00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:02,000
come register a company simple llc

00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:03,200
llc's are perfect for that it doesn't

00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,400
cost a lot

00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:08,400
um and what happens once you register a

00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,560
company everything goes in the company

00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,599
they can only show you the company not

00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,599
you personally

00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:15,839
so that kind of protects you and you can

00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:17,520
talk to any attorney or your tax guys

00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:19,359
about that that's pretty simple

00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,960
legalzoom is another where you can learn

00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:23,200
online it's pretty it's not

00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,240
costly okay it will hardly cost you a

00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,400
few hundred dollars

00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:27,599
i would say 500 to register the company

00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:30,800
and pay for the fees

00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:31,680
for a year um if you are trying to start

00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,280
your company

00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:35,200
company or you know then you want to

00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,800
probably trademark your brand means

00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,400
let's say you want to call your company

00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:40,960
abc llc

00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,640
make sure that there's no abc llc you

00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,800
have to trademark your name

00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:46,560
so there's no conflict for example if i

00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:49,359
go today and register say

00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:51,119
my company name is microsoft i will get

00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:52,960
sued by microsoft you have to look at

00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:55,200
that company name

00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:56,160
um all the legal contracts you're going

00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,720
to sign

00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:00,640
make sure every company probably going

00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:02,640
to ask you every client is probably

00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:04,160
going to ask you to sign a contract

00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:06,400
you have to really look at seriously

00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,960
sometimes the language can be tricky in

00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,760
that

00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:12,160
i know one client i work for it said

00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:14,960
clearly that once you work with us

00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:16,800
you cannot work with anybody who does

00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:19,280
similar business

00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,560
which means out of sudden if i'm working

00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:24,079
for let's say

00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:24,640
a you know bank i cannot work for other

00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:26,319
banks

00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:28,640
building similar software so you have to

00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:31,040
look at very carefully with that

00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:32,560
um be transparent when signed the

00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:34,640
contracts so anything you

00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,839
don't need to hide whatever it is

00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,440
sometimes you know

00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:39,119
you have to be transparent because that

00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,079
kind of saves you for future legal

00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:44,160
troubles

00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:44,640
um yes and then accounting and finances

00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:47,200
that's

00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:48,640
that that's where a lot of trouble comes

00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,720
you have to make sure you are

00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:52,319
clear on those you are doing what's

00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:55,359
supposed to do legally

00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:57,680
um you know these little problems

00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:59,680
sometimes can become big because

00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:01,040
you know our laws are very strict on

00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:04,000
these

00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:05,839
pay taxes on time sometimes you have to

00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,760
be look at what your accountant is

00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:09,119
telling you if you have to pay every

00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,680
you know three months you have to pay

00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:12,960
that on time if somehow you delay that's

00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:15,440
fine as long as

00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,560
you go through the legal process

00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:18,079
whatever it is

00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:20,400
and that's what i would go for you know

00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:22,240
you talk to your content again cost of

00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,680
all these is not much it's few hundred

00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:25,920
dollars

00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:26,800
uh record everything the best part these

00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,560
days is that

00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,079
if you run everything through say let's

00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:32,240
say books online

00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:34,079
everything you run through that anytime

00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:35,599
you get money it goes in there you

00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:37,839
create invoice from there

00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:39,680
every time you spend any money make sure

00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:41,200
you have a separate credit card

00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:43,440
and just use one credit card for

00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:45,599
business that's i highly recommend

00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:47,119
is then everything on that don't use

00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:49,599
that card for personal right

00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:50,880
so everything is in like one credit card

00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:52,640
this is all business

00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:54,400
when you go to accounting to give him

00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:56,240
the you know this online you can

00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,760
download or you can log in online you

00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,440
can just give them that hey

00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:01,920
this is my credit card i use for

00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:03,040
business try not to mix your personal

00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,920
with business

00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:07,520
uh that kind of will help you you know

00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,960
move things faster and keep everything

00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:12,000
clean

00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:13,760
and definitely yeah um another

00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,440
problem yeah that's a good point i saw

00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,839
you know comment ip is a big

00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:19,520
also uh challenge that some companies

00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:21,599
gonna ask you to sign that

00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:22,720
who wants the ip sometimes if you're

00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:27,280
writing a code

00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:30,240
you have to look into that as well

00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:31,680
so how much is it going to cost me to

00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:34,079
run a business this is where i'll

00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:35,440
spend a little bit more and then again

00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:37,599
the end of the goal is that

00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:39,760
i mean golovkin and i want you to make

00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:41,920
sure if any questions you have

00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:43,599
we can chat put in a chat so after the

00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,319
session you know when i'm done with my

00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:46,000
slides

00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:48,079
we will then go through more of those

00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,839
details in the chat

00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:51,280
and i wanna still run through those some

00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:54,240
of them you may need

00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:55,599
and you may not need it when you

00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,560
register a company how much it's going

00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:58,079
to cost you

00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:00,079
well there's a company registration fee

00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,800
is few hundred dollars i think 250

00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:02,560
dollars

00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,079
then you're going to get federal and id

00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:06,319
and state registration

00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:08,400
and then after that you have to pay

00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:09,200
annual fee annual fee depends on the

00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,680
state

00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:13,599
um and then you have to have an agent

00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:14,880
it's not a lot it's few hundred dollars

00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:16,400
again

00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:18,000
every year once in a year you have to

00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,760
pay that

00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,839
as soon as you register a company you're

00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:23,599
gonna create no bank account that's very

00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:24,160
important don't use your personal

00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:27,119
account

00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:27,760
i highly recommend once you have your

00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:29,680
company

00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:31,359
you know documents came from your state

00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:34,240
say pennsylvania came from

00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:36,240
state go register a company a bank

00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:38,800
account go to bank open an account

00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:40,800
and use that for everything all the

00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:42,960
business expense all the business

00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,839
income comes just use that account

00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:46,480
that's gonna

00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:48,079
make your life very very simple in you

00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:51,440
know long run

00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:52,960
um um and again that's the headache we

00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:55,440
don't want and personally

00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:57,440
i don't want the headaches of those uh

00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,640
managing bank accounts and finding out

00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:01,200
how much i spend

00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:02,880
i know a friend he keeps track of

00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,240
everything like how he received he's

00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:06,480
going to restaurant

00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:08,079
every receipt that's fine government's

00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:10,720
supposed to require that not

00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:11,520
anymore as long as you use one credit

00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:13,599
card

00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:15,520
and then those credit card you know

00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:17,760
statements digitally are there that's

00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:20,480
fine

00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:22,240
if you have a website you probably gonna

00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:24,079
get it build or develop yourself then

00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:25,680
you're gonna have a host of hosting fees

00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:27,359
so that's kind of another feast you have

00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:29,680
to pay for that

00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:30,640
um obviously you're gonna go for pay for

00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:32,640
accounting

00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:34,480
accounting is going to cost you you know

00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,280
depending on your accountant in local

00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,440
areas

00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:39,280
uh usually cost you know a few hundred

00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:40,880
dollars i you know i would say

00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:42,400
depending on how much work they do

00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:44,400
sometimes they charge hourly

00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:46,560
sometimes they do fix and if you're

00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:48,079
really small you don't need accountant

00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:50,480
you will just need accountant at the

00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:52,560
beginning then you can even go file

00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:55,359
these taxes yourself or go to

00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:57,839
some smaller you know those uh in

00:45:55,359 --> 00:46:00,640
companies where you these all shops

00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:01,599
hr hr department you know block or one

00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:03,760
of those

00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:05,280
um it all depends on how much work

00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,960
you're doing really

00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,960
then you probably want to put everything

00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:10,960
in quickbooks if you have multiple

00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:12,720
clients and you're managing more

00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:14,160
it's easy to manage everything get a

00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:16,960
good cook it's

00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:18,000
for one guy i think it's 9.99 a month

00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:20,240
nothing major

00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,680
but if you are growing to a bigger

00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:23,680
company let's say you

00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:24,880
have a big contract you're hiring five

00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,880
guys 10 guys

00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:29,280
you want to start doing peru that's

00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,880
gonna be extra cost for uadp

00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:32,560
but i think in the beginning if you're

00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:34,640
really thinking to start a company you

00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:37,359
probably won't need that

00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:38,480
um and then expense report right then

00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:39,920
you probably wanna

00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:41,760
you know have some kind of expense

00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,000
reporting done either whoever is doing

00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,440
that

00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,520
that's gonna be cost if you're doing

00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:46,160
yourself that's great if you're hiring

00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:48,800
somebody

00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:50,720
that's gonna cost now this all sounds

00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:52,319
like a lot of work if you know you're

00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:53,040
thinking like you know what i'm just one

00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:54,720
guy

00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:57,280
i'm gonna work in a company i'm gonna

00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:59,200
write code or am i going to do all this

00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:00,960
um a lot of this you don't have to do if

00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:03,760
you're just working on your own

00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:06,560
frankly speaking a lot of them are also

00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:09,119
one-time thing and once done

00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:10,960
but once you learn that like for example

00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:12,880
quickbooks for example accounting

00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:14,079
a lot of things right now these days are

00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:16,480
managed through an app

00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:17,760
frankly you can look at the app and a

00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:20,000
lot of things you can

00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:21,599
do through app and these days you know i

00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,680
remember we even do payrolls

00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:25,599
it's through app because we have all the

00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:27,040
employees set up the rates are set up

00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:28,720
their salaries are set up

00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:30,640
all you have to do is just click a

00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:34,000
button and it's done so it's all about

00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:36,079
it's a kind of learning process

00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:39,040
all right we good moving good we are

00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:42,000
good on time um

00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:43,680
so the now comes is you need to build a

00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,359
reputation and that's more like a

00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:47,119
marketing right when you work as an

00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:49,440
independent consultant

00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:50,480
or have your own company it's very

00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:52,559
important to

00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:54,480
have a sale and sales and marketing and

00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:57,200
which is how you build your reputation

00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:58,240
and promote yourself um that's what we

00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:01,920
do here uh

00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:04,559
that's how most projects we get right so

00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:06,000
um you have to definitely clearly if

00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:09,119
somebody visits your website

00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,960
or profile as i said people who are

00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:11,839
visiting it they should clearly get an

00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:14,960
idea

00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:16,640
what you do okay what are you good at

00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:18,839
what you know what your expertise are

00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:21,680
that should be very clear there

00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:23,599
um i see on some website if

00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:25,680
you put everything there then that's

00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:27,200
that confuses everybody

00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,800
you have to be definitely active these

00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:31,040
days on social media

00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:32,240
if you are i'm not saying facebook i'm

00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:34,319
not saying snapchat

00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:36,559
i'm not saying instagram but you have to

00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:39,839
be at least very active on linkedin

00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:42,480
github is also good to be active on

00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:44,319
uh twitter is also good tutorials may

00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:45,920
not bring you business but it

00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:47,520
kind of will bring you a lot of

00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:50,880
connections a lot of

00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:51,760
um you know i get a lot of connections

00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:55,040
in my friends

00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:57,200
and on twitter because i read them and i

00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:59,359
comment and that that's how you get up

00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:01,359
to date also because linkedin people

00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:04,079
don't really update a lot these days

00:49:01,359 --> 00:49:05,359
i mean they have to start growing more

00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:07,280
so you have to look at

00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:08,960
where your friends are your professional

00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:10,160
network is those are three things are

00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:13,520
very important

00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:15,920
um then

00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:18,400
you need to figure out okay so i'm i

00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:21,040
build my profile i build my you know

00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:23,119
expertise now what else can i do what

00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:25,680
else can i do right to promote myself

00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:27,440
and my name and my brand and my business

00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:30,079
end of the day it's our business right

00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:32,000
more you are in front of people more

00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:34,079
you're talking so become a speaker when

00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,280
you start going to speak at conferences

00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:37,599
and events

00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:39,040
um a lot of people they they they're

00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:40,720
sitting there they like they know

00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:41,920
exactly what you do they know what your

00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:43,920
expertise are

00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:45,760
they may or they may tell your manager

00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:46,400
or go back to the company i know a guy

00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:48,960
you know

00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:50,559
so give an example when hololens

00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:54,319
microsoft hololens came

00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:55,599
a few years ago i you know i i was very

00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:57,839
interested i learned i

00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:59,040
we start building hololens apps mixed

00:49:57,839 --> 00:50:02,720
reality apps

00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:04,960
and i think few years back i was even at

00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:06,880
saying this user bro and i went to my

00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:09,520
hololens gave demo to people

00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:11,119
because first of all nobody has that and

00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:13,040
this is how you start now everybody

00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:13,839
start knowing that we build hololens

00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:15,839
apps if

00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:17,680
somebody wants that it's already

00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:19,280
registering in their minds right so that

00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:21,920
kind of helps you a long way

00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:23,280
it's kind of you are selling it but

00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:24,000
you're not really selling it you're

00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:25,839
basically

00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,200
more and more your brand is getting out

00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:29,520
there people know you

00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:31,280
then you go to conferences definitely

00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:32,880
networking events and meetups

00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:34,640
that's the best way you grow your

00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:36,640
professional network and business

00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:38,079
you know you go to conferences and

00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,720
that's where a lot of business happens

00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:40,800
right

00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:42,160
if you look at any successful consulting

00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:44,319
company

00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:46,480
um they will become a state partner with

00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:47,599
microsoft and say silver partner gold

00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:49,200
part or whatever

00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:51,280
then they will have a conf they'll

00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,400
attend the conference and eventually

00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:54,240
when they're bigger

00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:55,520
enough big enough they'll also have a

00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:58,240
booth at the conference

00:50:55,520 --> 00:51:00,160
because that's where most people are

00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:02,640
coming there for

00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:03,520
either connections or help and finding

00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:06,240
next

00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:08,079
gig or finding next products to buy and

00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:10,800
so and so forth

00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:12,720
so definitely start going out there you

00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:15,440
have to become you know talk more

00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:17,119
now you may say you know what i already

00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:18,079
got a two-year contract one year

00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:20,880
contract

00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:22,000
i'm good after once this contract is

00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:25,440
done i'll find another

00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:28,480
one might nothing wrong with that but

00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:30,880
this this you won't grow this limp grow

00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:32,720
there's growth limitation in there

00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:33,359
that's fine if you're just looking for a

00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:35,040
job

00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:37,119
but you still have to do a little bit

00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:39,839
extra make sure you're not just saying i

00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:41,440
you i'm done i'm good i got a client and

00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:42,559
i'm good for two years because keep in

00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:45,040
mind as i said

00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:46,160
on my very first screen what if this

00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:48,960
client says oh

00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:50,160
my i think we're done now why because

00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:52,240
we're going to change the plan

00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:53,760
or we don't have budget or we're going

00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:55,680
to just close this video

00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:57,839
and shut down this project it happens

00:51:55,680 --> 00:52:02,079
you know it happens sometimes

00:51:57,839 --> 00:52:03,280
um again promote your expertise again

00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:05,119
and again just be

00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:07,119
you know just keep telling people what

00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:09,359
you do whenever you have a chance

00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:11,599
either online these days or when

00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:15,440
speaking or in your network

00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:17,119
um again same thing with the retalk at

00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:18,960
the events in meetups tell everybody

00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:19,599
what you do what you're good at and all

00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:22,240
that

00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:23,520
and then end of the day everybody who is

00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:26,800
in your network

00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:28,880
especially linkedin or personal network

00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:30,400
right your friends or family

00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:32,000
just tell them what you're doing what

00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:34,079
you're starting and ask anything they

00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:36,720
need help but keep asking right

00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:37,359
sometimes you're just asking eventually

00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:39,040
you know

00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:41,119
something comes up this happens all the

00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:43,920
time um

00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:46,000
and strangely if i tell you some of

00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:48,160
these stories you'll be surprised that

00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:50,319
sometimes i talk to these people and i

00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:52,800
like this guy i'm wasting my time

00:52:50,319 --> 00:52:54,559
and that end up becoming the largest

00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:56,240
project i've seen one guy

00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:58,319
you know he called me for whatever i'm

00:52:56,240 --> 00:53:00,559
talking to him then i met him

00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:01,520
we had lunch and i was like wow what a

00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:03,440
time waste

00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:05,359
and that didn't end up becoming a three

00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:06,880
year project for long term with you know

00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:09,839
several people working on it

00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:10,319
so you never know you cannot just you

00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:12,480
know

00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:14,000
not take the call so you just you have

00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:17,599
to just keep asking keep meeting

00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:20,000
people um now you'll say you know what

00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:21,200
i'm the single guy am i supposed to work

00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,040
am i supposed to

00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:24,240
go to work and do the work how am i

00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:27,280
going to do all this

00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:28,079
well what best way is you set aside a

00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:30,720
little bit time

00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:31,680
i mean i'm not saying now in kobe times

00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:34,240
over time so

00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:35,440
you can still go to the calls or online

00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:37,520
meetings but

00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:38,960
you set up a day for example i know

00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:41,760
personally

00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:43,680
every thursday you know i live outside i

00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:46,960
live in glen mills which is

00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:48,480
about half an hour from philadelphia

00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:50,400
so you have to look at where most

00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:52,160
projects are where most jobs are where

00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:53,280
most companies are where your potential

00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:56,160
clients are

00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:58,480
okay it won't be at your home obviously

00:53:56,160 --> 00:54:00,800
you have to find that area

00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:02,960
and then you definitely start going and

00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:06,160
meeting people there

00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:07,599
so what i do is every thursday

00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:09,280
you know there's certain place in

00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:11,119
philadelphia where all business guys

00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:12,720
hanging out or there's event going on

00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:14,880
there's meetup going on

00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:15,839
every thursday i said you know what from

00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:18,160
4 p.m

00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:19,599
to 10 p.m 9 p.m that's where meetings

00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:20,079
are every thursday i'm going to give you

00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:21,839
that

00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:24,240
so in the beginning you may just want to

00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:26,480
go once in a month depending on how much

00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:28,400
time you can you know give to this but

00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:30,880
this is important for your business and

00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,880
yourself

00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:37,440
all right so far so good so

00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:38,640
let's just uh if we're running out of

00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:40,319
time here so if you want to

00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:41,760
uh wrap this up and then we could

00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:43,599
actually just so folks knowing there was

00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:45,680
one question in the chat

00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:47,440
please uh feel free there's plenty of

00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:49,520
opportunity to chat with folks via

00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:52,480
direct messages or anything like that

00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:53,119
uh via this platform so i'm sure mahesh

00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:56,400
would

00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:58,319
be happy to answer yes definitely one

00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:00,240
way i think this is my last slide

00:54:58,319 --> 00:55:01,839
so the key here is just be there

00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:02,880
available right build relationships

00:55:01,839 --> 00:55:05,200
recover that

00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:06,240
make sure you under promise or deliver

00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:08,400
right

00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:10,079
that's another thing is do not do not

00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:11,280
over promise that could be the worst

00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:13,359
thing you want to do

00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:15,680
as as a you if you are running your own

00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:17,839
business um

00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:19,680
build clients educate clients so we

00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:22,799
already covered a lot of these things

00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:25,520
and your first thing should be if

00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:26,799
you meet somebody first time just keep

00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:29,200
in mind that can

00:55:26,799 --> 00:55:31,599
what am i doing or saying and showing

00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:33,359
that this person can trust me

00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:35,119
uh so that's all people look for is

00:55:33,359 --> 00:55:36,960
first thing somebody meets you they

00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:38,880
first thing they ask a question nobody

00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:40,640
cares what you are saying nobody

00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:43,200
first thing they ask can i trust this

00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:45,119
person can i trust this person just keep

00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:48,640
that in mind

00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:50,559
and i believe with that we just you know

00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:52,000
there are few more points here is that

00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:53,839
if you are trying to build your own

00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,319
company you're gonna think

00:55:53,839 --> 00:55:58,160
how can i scale this thing because

00:55:56,319 --> 00:56:00,160
sometimes one person can't do it

00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:01,599
all what is the best is it there is

00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:04,480
anybody i can groom

00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:05,119
that person can replace me how can i

00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:08,640
find

00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:11,040
trusted friends and co-workers and again

00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:12,480
repeat customers are important so don't

00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:14,319
just sometimes you may lose your

00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:16,559
customer because there's no work but you

00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:18,400
always go back to them because that's

00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:21,520
where most work come from is recruit

00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:23,599
it's very hard to get new customers

00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:24,640
and we already covered that recruiters

00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:26,640
are your best friends

00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:28,079
build partnerships network network

00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:30,640
network first thing you

00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:31,839
always tell hey how can i help don't

00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:33,760
just think about

00:56:31,839 --> 00:56:35,760
am i getting work or not eventually work

00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:38,880
will come once you have this

00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:41,119
mindset i believe you will be successful

00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:42,319
and you'll build a successful consulting

00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:46,079
business

00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:48,079
so there you go and just my last quote

00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:48,720
is that half of the successes just be

00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:51,839
there

00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:55,040
and be available so guys that is

00:56:51,839 --> 00:56:57,839
all i hope um i help some of you
