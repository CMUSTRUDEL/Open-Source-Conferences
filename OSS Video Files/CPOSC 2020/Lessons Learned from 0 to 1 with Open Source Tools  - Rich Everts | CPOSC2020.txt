	00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,599
first let me introduce

00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:11,759
this session this session is titled

00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,080
lessons learned going from zero to one

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,000
with the help of open source

00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,359
presented by rich ebert's rich is a

00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,160
co-founder and ceo

00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:22,000
of bestibot and a home ai company

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,119
specializing in aging and place

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,119
solutions

00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:27,680
his previous award-winning work expands

00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:30,640
artificial intelligence film and video

00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,559
ux design and more he still believes

00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,640
sierra represented the pinnacle of the

00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:37,360
golden age of pc gaming

00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,200
though micro pros is a close second so

00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,000
with that i'm going to step aside and

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,480
let rich take

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,640
over thank you jag

00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,079
all right so excited to be with you here

00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,039
today we have a little bit more time

00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,600
than usual

00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,600
in a lot of the cpas talks so i'm hoping

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,879
that i can speak a little bit slower

00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,520
and still get through some really

00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:00,399
awesome content for everyone so

00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,120
let's just kick off real quick the day

00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,640
is about

00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,040
lessons learned going from zero to one

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,159
with the help of open source tools

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,680
and i want to

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,600
let's make sure that our clicker is

00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,640
working today

00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:18,240
i am discussing about 750

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:21,360
000 plus worth of my experience today

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,200
and that includes about four plus

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,799
years of research and development of

00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,880
in-kind uh

00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,119
work full-time work that i take on

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,240
outside of my normal gigs

00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:34,560
as well as over 125 000 worth of cash

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,159
and so there's a lot of experience here

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,000
that i want to go through now this is

00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,360
not necessarily what everybody's journey

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,280
is going to be like

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,720
if they want to build their own startup

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,159
that's an op that uses a lot of these

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,119
open source tools

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,799
i'm building a hardware system which is

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,720
notoriously expensive

00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,840
and also combining it with artificial

00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,000
intelligence

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,360
and so today i'm not going to talk too

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,560
much about that

00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,399
only and enough to contextualize some of

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,399
the information that you may get

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,560
so this is a lot about those lessons and

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,399
i also want to let you know that

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,319
this is just me speaking this is not

00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,080
bestivat this is not any of my

00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:12,239
clients or any of my customers this is

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,080
just my experience and my thoughts

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,599
and i really want to give it back to the

00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,040
community and i

00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,800
i love everything that people are doing

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,239
at cpask and

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,520
all the teams and everybody that's

00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,040
working the local community we have a

00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,280
great community here

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,560
so this is my opportunity for the year

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,280
to be able to give back

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,800
so let's take a look at the first issue

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,480
which is

00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,400
i really believe you have to live your

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,560
problem and so a lot

00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,640
a lot of people here know that in my

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,840
particular situation i have a son

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:44,000
who is an adult now and he has severe

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:48,160
autism and he cannot speak

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:52,400
he requires daily care and so

00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:55,840
for me my problem that i am facing

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:59,040
is the same as all of my customers

00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:02,400
which is we say to ourselves every day

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,879
i can never die i can never die

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,560
because what's going to happen to them

00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,159
and this particular problem

00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,680
that people face out there has a lot of

00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,239
solutions so

00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,680
there's financial uh packages to make

00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,159
sure that things are okay there or

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,159
there's

00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:19,440
you know social services but what are

00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,920
the technology solutions to this problem

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,040
of

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,519
how can i how can i die and still feel

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,000
like

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,760
you know things are going to be okay and

00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,720
so this is a problem that

00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,680
grew up out of my own challenges that

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,000
i'm having at

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,400
you know middle age and you know what am

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,319
i going to do for the next few years

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,920
and so a lot of people go out they look

00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,440
for problems to solve

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,879
but when i go through and tell you some

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,040
of the challenges you're going to have

00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,239
here in building startups and going from

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,280
zero to one

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,799
you're going to understand that if

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,159
you're not living your problem it's

00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:53,360
going to be difficult

00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:54,959
so that's really important so

00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,640
you know for instance this whole

00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,280
solution that we're building

00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,640
long term is being able to take care of

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,720
someone

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,920
in a home to converting their home to

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,159
being able to

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,840
act as a caretaker this is a big

00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,920
solution and your solution out there

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,239
might be big as well well

00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,519
cut it down break it down right and

00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,959
that's what you need to do so

00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,440
you start off with what's known as a

00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,759
minimum viable product an mvp

00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,160
which is uh this where the one is you'll

00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,360
see it's a bare minimum solution you can

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,440
sell

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,120
okay because you're building a business

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,160
remember and so you need to have

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,440
cash flow so with that cash flow you

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,759
will be able to

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,280
fund the next milestone so think of it

00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,280
as going from mountain peak

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,639
to mountain peak to mountain peak and

00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,160
between each one you got to go through

00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,120
these valleys and all these things to

00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,240
get to the peaks

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,680
peak to peak okay and you can have your

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,280
solution laid out over

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,040
in this particular one i just used five

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,360
years as an example you have you'll see

00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,360
that

00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,120
in five years you have a solid problem

00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,880
but when you're thinking about your

00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,720
business and your device and what you're

00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:00,000
building you had to think of it

00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:02,960
in these kind of milestones and so

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,160
for me and what i was doing and building

00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,800
this

00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,600
situ or this solution to be able to take

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,840
care of things

00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,680
in my home i had to start with something

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,520
that was a lot more simple and i'm

00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,680
i'm not going to sell this the whole

00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,600
point of this is just to show you

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,800
how i made that decisions on the

00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,800
milestone one

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,880
right so this is a minimum viable

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,520
product this just collects data around

00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,600
the home and

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,639
be able to do a number of things with it

00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,560
so number one

00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,400
it has an open source hardware solution

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,440
so i use the raspberry pi

00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,759
for the processor board now for software

00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,039
i use an open source solution as well

00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,240
which i use a django

00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:43,360
api for the database i o

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:47,199
now i did use proprietary ml and an ios

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,240
application to be able to add some value

00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,320
to the product

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,199
but in essence over two thirds of the

00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:55,360
product is using open source solutions

00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,600
and even the ml and the ios is using a

00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,479
lot of open source capabilities

00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,360
in order to get an initial product to

00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,199
market

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,199
so you don't have to necessarily come

00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,680
out with this super customized

00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,960
boards and all you know all these things

00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,199
right out of the gate

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,400
you know take some open store stuff and

00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,440
put it together and

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:18,400
that the

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,360
solution that you come up with that ties

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,280
everything together

00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,800
does have value okay so

00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,240
what did we use so let's take a look at

00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,360
some of the open source software that

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,639
you have that's

00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,840
when you're especially making ai enabled

00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,960
devices number one it's gonna be in

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,720
python mostly

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,039
right now okay if you know c plus plus

00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,120
great but python gives you speed

00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,720
and you're able to iterate very quickly

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,560
we can take customer feedback

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,160
and we can iterate on that and come out

00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,840
with a new thing and test it fairly

00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,360
quickly with python

00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,960
if you're doing data science stuff of

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,639
course you probably know this but you're

00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,520
going to be using a lot of scikit

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,080
a lot of numpy which are all open source

00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,160
tools

00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,759
you know pip install boom great we're

00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,919
done let's go

00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,680
now these here the next three i want to

00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:04,080
talk about are opencv

00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,960
tensorflow and pytorch now opencv is

00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,800
great uh

00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:10,560
built in c plus plus i believe in c um

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,880
so it's fast it does have python

00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,840
bindings you can compile it with cuda or

00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,080
not cuda

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,360
and it's a great tool because you know

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,800
part of the system we're doing a lot of

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,479
camera work as well which i'm not going

00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,520
to talk about today but we do a lot of

00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,759
computer vision

00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,560
and a lot of you know i run lancaster ai

00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,479
as well so

00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,319
i do a lot and i really focus on object

00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,440
detection vision neural networks and

00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,840
those kind of things so

00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,599
tensorflow and pytorch are awesome tools

00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,360
as well now tensorflow

00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,639
is really great because it has something

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,599
called tensorrt

00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,240
in it and that allows you to convert

00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,880
your

00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,360
types of your integers which are the

00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:48,560
basic building blocks of neural networks

00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,000
from uint like 32s and 64s to you went

00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,960
eights which means that

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,560
the memory that you use to figure out

00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,960
what's happening at a certain spot goes

00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,520
from

00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,120
being this big down to this big and so

00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,400
when you're multiplying things

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,919
when you're multiplying a lot of small

00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,720
things it goes faster faster faster

00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,720
faster

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,879
and so tensorflow has that which is

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,039
great for deployment on the edge

00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,400
and of course you have pi torch which is

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:13,840
a great way to

00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:16,160
quickly build neural networks and it is

00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,599
a fabulous tool and you can export your

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:21,280
things to tensor rt

00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:23,280
using the onyx framework but it does

00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,639
help you move things pretty quickly and

00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,840
of course cython

00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,720
which allows you to build things and

00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,240
then

00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:35,919
be able to convert it to like a c

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:39,599
compiled setup so it's a library.so

00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:41,680
library and what that means is you can

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,519
hide your proprietary python work and

00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,159
distribute it to the public if you need

00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,800
to

00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,680
okay so you can work on your open source

00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,279
you can get you know

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,519
give back to the open source community

00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:53,440
while protecting your

00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,959
proprietary work using something like

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,880
psython and you can also get some speed

00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,800
ups from there as well

00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,720
now in terms of licensing and things

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,120
that you want to work on

00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,560
mit is preferred and i'm sure there was

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,880
a great talk earlier today

00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,000
about a lot about licensing and i missed

00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,279
it but i'm looking forward to watching

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,200
the recording

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,720
uh and so mit is preferred because you

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:16,480
can just attach it to

00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:19,200
the uh repos really easily

00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,560
and if there is no license like you come

00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,080
across and this happens often when

00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,000
you're dealing with neural network stuff

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,440
like people are just doing cutting edge

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,720
stuff and they forget the license when

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,120
they just dump a repo on there that

00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:32,399
maybe has 10 stars or 15 stars

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,600
you can't use it because uh by default

00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,440
it is proprietary

00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,519
so they have to specifically have that

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,200
license you can open up a github request

00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,800
to see if they'll add that license for

00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,080
you but it's something to remember

00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:46,080
as you're going through these so let's

00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,920
talk a little bit about the hardware

00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,760
so you know for us it was too much to

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,000
build our own hardware for milestone one

00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,080
which

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,320
is why we went with the the raspberry

00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,839
pi's and we preferred not to have to

00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,680
deal with the fcc so

00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,959
the fcc you know if you're going to do

00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,839
anything that requires radio

00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,519
interference

00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,640
well guess what you're going to have to

00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,839
go through a bunch of hoops and

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,880
everything like that but from my

00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,720
understanding if it's already

00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,800
pre-approved by the fcc

00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,839
you can package and resell that and not

00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,200
have to deal with it so

00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,640
again speed to market

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,800
and of course raspberry pi's and

00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,560
arduinos are fantastic tools

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,560
everybody here i'm sure is very familiar

00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,519
with them and if you are not familiar

00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,320
with them

00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,920
they do allow you to build hardware

00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,440
prototypes very quickly

00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,200
and there's a lot of information out

00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,880
there so definitely look at those and

00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,680
i'm going to use the mycroft mark 1 as

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,680
an example

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,279
which is an open source software and

00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,200
hardware solution it's like a

00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,480
think of it as like an amazon echo in

00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,720
the

00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,680
mlp and it's built on these open

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,519
platforms

00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,279
and they came out a number of years ago

00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,079
and have built an entire business model

00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:49,279
around that

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:50,800
and it's an interesting way to to handle

00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,680
the hardware and software and if you're

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,600
interested i can

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,279
you should check out the minecraft teams

00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,519
they do have a mark ii which was just

00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:59,440
released

00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,800
now the interesting thing about theirs

00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,560
is the casing so

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,560
this is something where a lot of people

00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,880
don't understand what goes into casing

00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,279
so

00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,079
injection molding requires cast like you

00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:10,160
have to build a

00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,760
cast like a metal cast and then you know

00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,839
shoot the plastic into it

00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,800
but you're looking at twenty five 000

00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,880
plus per run

00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,480
in a lot of areas so you know if you

00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,600
don't have that kind of capital what are

00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,440
you going to build

00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,880
okay what are you going to use well 3d

00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,760
printing a lot of people say oh 3d

00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,399
printing can work

00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:28,240
and that's true generally though it's

00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,079
slow in quantity

00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,839
and it's high in cost so if you have a

00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:34,240
six inch by eight inch by

00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,600
you know seven inch uh thing that you're

00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,360
building you're gonna have to build a

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,560
structure for it on the inside and you

00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,200
know the system's gonna have to build

00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,959
that for you

00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,480
and then if you have a high resolution

00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:44,720
it's going to be very slow

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,240
and honestly in my experience i'm not

00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,399
dissing 3d printing the

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,440
the results are okay but they require a

00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,880
lot of post work

00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,880
like you got to do a lot of sanding a

00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,399
lot of cleanup filler polishing

00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,320
and stuff like that so you know that

00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,800
wasn't the solution necessarily that i i

00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,720
was

00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,079
going to look at but so i preferred

00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,800
going with uh

00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:04,720
wood that we we used for cost because

00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,920
it's low cost and it has a nice organic

00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,519
aesthetic

00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,959
now i am cognizant you should be

00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:12,000
cognizant of this as well

00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:14,480
that is difficult to scale

00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,440
if you're building things with wood so

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,360
um

00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,720
there's a lot that goes into you know

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,600
putting everything together if you're

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,680
going to

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,720
put on any kind of extras on it

00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,760
it's going to be it's going to be

00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:30,160
difficult i would recommend highly

00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,320
contacting and using the 717 makerspace

00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,000
here in central pa it's uh in lancaster

00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,120
it's run out of an old thaddeus stevens

00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,639
building

00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,160
and they have awesome things they have

00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,079
all the 3d printers they have all the

00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,720
laser etching they have a carvey down

00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:43,760
there

00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:46,079
which you can use to to create

00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,079
custom setups in your wood and

00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,440
everything it's an amazing place and if

00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,560
you're thinking about it you kind of

00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,560
have to have

00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,720
some kind of connection to the to the

00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,800
maker space i'm not sure where they are

00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,920
with all the covid stuff right now but

00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,440
uh they are a

00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,399
a wonderful solution you should check

00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:05,680
them out okay

00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:08,240
packaging so

00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,160
how is this going to work because the

00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,160
first part of your brand that a customer

00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:15,440
touches is going to be your packaging

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:17,040
it's steve jobs was notorious for

00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,399
getting into these details that people

00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,079
didn't understand at the time now

00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,440
everybody understands ux and everything

00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,680
but

00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,600
for me and my choice needs something you

00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,959
should think about for your devices as

00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,040
you're building them is you should look

00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,440
at custom boxes now i chose fantastic

00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,200
pack

00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,639
i don't make any money from them i have

00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,800
nothing to do with them it's just a

00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:37,440
solution i found but you got to remember

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,600
that they're expensive in low quantities

00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,040
they're 10 to 10 to 30 dollars per box

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,320
which is going to add to your cost of

00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:46,800
goods sold

00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:49,839
okay and you need to measure a lot

00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,360
measure a lot so

00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,120
not only you measure have somebody else

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,959
measure because it takes four to five

00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,959
weeks to get a delivery so if you order

00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,240
50 boxes and you're waiting five weeks

00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,880
to get them and then all of a sudden

00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,680
crap we

00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,000
use the wrong size guess what you gotta

00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,199
start

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,880
over so you measure not just twice not

00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:08,560
just three times measure a bunch have

00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,079
somebody else check your measurements

00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,480
and build these boxes there are tons of

00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:14,240
them 30 different boxes that you can get

00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,399
now packaging materials i would go

00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,560
through a company like uline

00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,839
you can get these massive things they're

00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,839
like 100 bucks

00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,120
but they'll last you years for your

00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,560
packaging i mean hopefully they won't

00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,920
hopefully only last a couple weeks

00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,320
hopefully you're shipping enough stuff

00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,920
but

00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,000
they are massive and it's a good

00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,160
wholesale way to get packaging

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,160
materials for your devices so this is a

00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,800
way that you can add some panache

00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,079
some style some aesthetics to your box

00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,560
for your customers when they

00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,600
first touch your thing like ah they can

00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:46,079
feel that

00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:48,079
that that brand really in their hands so

00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:50,240
you gotta understand your costs right

00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:52,560
that's why i recommend uline so

00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,160
you gotta offer probably in many cases

00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,240
free shipping

00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,320
so when you're offering free shipping

00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:02,000
what you're gonna end up doing is

00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,519
you're going to need to make it light

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,160
and you're going to need to still be

00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:09,360
able to protect your device the usps

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:11,839
is great for this because they it's

00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,360
free like the the boxes are free you can

00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:16,160
go to any post office

00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,760
and you have a specific stated flat rate

00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,760
of money so you know exactly how to

00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:23,600
calculate your cost of goods

00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:25,279
so if it's uh you know 595

00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,800
and you get 20 of them you know exactly

00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,600
how much it's going to cost to send all

00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,839
of your stuff

00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,199
so if you're at that initial level that

00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:35,680
first starting level

00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:38,880
i would definitely look at those okay

00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,160
some of the lessons learned

00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,839
i'm going to leave this up here so i'm

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,120
going to read it to you actually i added

00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,079
all the product features that each of

00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,360
you demanded

00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:48,000
now our product is the worthless

00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,600
hodgepodge of complexity

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,680
i appreciate your input i couldn't have

00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,880
failed without you and the guy's like

00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:56,800
teamwork

00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:58,720
all right so it's a little bit about

00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,720
about how it is sometimes the teams end

00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:03,279
up coming together

00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,639
so let's talk about this five lessons

00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:08,240
about teams real quick

00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:11,680
as we went from zero to one so deploy

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,959
where your time inefficient okay so what

00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,839
this means is

00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:16,240
you know everyone here is pretty smart i

00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,680
i

00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,120
if you're dealing with open source you

00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,639
kind of have to be and you have a way of

00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,440
thinking about the world

00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,680
and the way of processing things and so

00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,240
i

00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,519
my guess is that almost everybody here

00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,160
could probably

00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:31,519
figure anything out technically given

00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,759
enough time

00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,360
there's nothing that you couldn't do i

00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,720
really believe that

00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,720
the challenge is how long would it take

00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,800
you to learn it so if it's taking you

00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,320
six to nine months to learn something

00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,800
you probably need to bring on a team

00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,000
member to figure that out

00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,279
that doesn't necessarily mean you bring

00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,880
them on full time you can look at

00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:52,560
contracts you can do other things

00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,279
something to remember everyone has to

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,000
sign an nda an ip assignment before

00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,720
touching or

00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,560
saying anything now investors are going

00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,240
to require it when they do the

00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,480
diligence and handshakes are not enough

00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,400
so an nda is a non-disclosure agreement

00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,760
and an ip assignment basically says that

00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,839
anything they work on

00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,439
gets assigned to the company that you're

00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:13,600
working on in building

00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:15,199
and so i've had some serious

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,640
disagreements with software engineers

00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,559
who are like i'm not signing that well

00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,400
guess what you're not on the team

00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:22,640
because if you don't respect the company

00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,839
enough to sign that then you don't

00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,760
you don't understand what we're trying

00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:28,480
to do and what we're trying to build

00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,760
okay we ongoing funding if you're

00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,960
seriously going to consider it for your

00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,960
device and your product

00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,480
that you built with open source tools to

00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,280
start with and you're probably going to

00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,080
keep building with

00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,919
a lot of them you got to get that you

00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,679
got to get it

00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,200
here's a story invest your co-founders

00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:45,600
and employees period

00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,440
so vesting is this idea that when people

00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,120
get shares at the beginning

00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,640
uh you have to work for a certain number

00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,799
of years to get a certain percentage so

00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,320
usually it's four years and you get um

00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:57,600
you'll get you know 25

00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,640
25 25 25 that way you don't get them all

00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,600
at the beginning

00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,880
there is a company here in lancaster who

00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:06,000
i won't name

00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:08,000
who started as in college uh with three

00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,440
roommates and they split the equity

00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:14,799
three ways one two three well guess what

00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:17,360
one of those guys quit after two weeks

00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:19,120
and so six and seven years later they're

00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,799
still raising money and that guy

00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,120
he gave him some back but he's still

00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:25,039
holding on to a lot of those shares

00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,480
and so it really hampered the company

00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:28,960
from raising money because

00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,080
he just sits on that now is that fair is

00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,280
that right

00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:35,679
absolutely not and so that's what um

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:38,240
that's what it can cause problems so

00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:41,679
best your co-founders and your employees

00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,000
okay uh here's one people make mistakes

00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,400
all the

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,160
time when trying new things people are

00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:50,400
learning people are doing things

00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:52,400
look just correct let the best idea win

00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,840
and move forward and that's how you

00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,960
build trust and good

00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:58,960
products okay so if you have an outside

00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,559
standard of just building the good pro

00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,799
building a good product and there's not

00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:04,320
political things going on in your team

00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:05,600
and there's not these ideas

00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,480
your teams are going to be a lot

00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:10,799
stronger because they have this outside

00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,400
idea that they can move towards and it

00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:15,679
really protects your people and

00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:19,039
bri it builds in stability in the system

00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:20,880
okay and so that

00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:22,559
comes to you know someone who brings you

00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,320
a problem with the solution

00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,840
is worth 100 times the person only

00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,280
brings you problems to solve encourage

00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,880
your people to think and be outcome

00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,480
oregon and so

00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,240
i'll give you a great example what this

00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,640
means so when

00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,160
i'm dealing with team uh and many of you

00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,000
are probably dealing with your teams on

00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,400
different things all the time

00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,840
we get lost in a lot of complex ideas

00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,000
and things you know we're talking about

00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,440
bits or this abstract idea or that

00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,600
abstract idea and

00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,280
we get lost in terminology and all these

00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,120
things the way to

00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,760
move forward is always to bring it back

00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:55,280
to saying what is the outcome that we're

00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,919
trying to get to

00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,880
what is the the goal here what is the

00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:01,919
outcome

00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:04,400
go back to that and work backwards back

00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,240
into all the tech that you're working on

00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,480
focus on that work backwards and the

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,720
solution will present itself

00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,240
and the team members can all see that

00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,880
they can see it unfold

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,159
and they'll have faith in the solution

00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,320
as you're moving forward

00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:20,240
and there's no bias there's no stuff

00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,000
that's going on with the team is just

00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,600
being outcome oriented and when people

00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,520
think like that when people start

00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,840
thinking about being outcome oriented

00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,600
they can think of solutions on their own

00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:32,799
bring them to you

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:36,080
after the problems are and

00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:37,840
that there will give you much better

00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,400
team members

00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,520
your team would actually be taking care

00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,760
of things before

00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,760
they become problems for you so

00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:51,120
okay legal and accounting i'm not an

00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:53,440
attorney i'm not an accountant i'm not

00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,559
advising you here on anything specific

00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,320
that you should

00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:57,679
i want to put in your business go talk

00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,919
to a lawyer an accountant

00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:01,520
okay so with that proviso in place i'm

00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:02,880
just going to give you my experience so

00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,440
in my experience

00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,159
llcs are generally good to start for tax

00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,840
purposes

00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,280
they give you liability protection and

00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,520
they're easy for taxes

00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,880
they're passed through entities so what

00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,799
that means for you

00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,559
if you're building a business is it go

00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:19,440
straight through to your taxes

00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,760
um which is why when people talk about

00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,520
oh

00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,960
sh it's no big deal to tax people who

00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,320
make more than four hundred thousand

00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,480
dollars a year what they're not

00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:29,039
telling you is that because they're

00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:32,000
passed through entities many businesses

00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:33,840
that are small businesses um easily hit

00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,520
that 400 and 500 thousand dollar

00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,200
threshold because all their revenue

00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,280
from their business like a mom and pop

00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,200
stores you know on main street

00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,400
all those businesses all that income and

00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,600
revenue passes through to them

00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,039
personally

00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,480
right and then they have to pay taxes on

00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:47,440
and it's there's a lot that goes on

00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,720
there

00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:52,400
so it's just uh but llcs are great for

00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,480
keeping your taxes simple and getting

00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:57,360
some liability protection

00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,640
now then you convert to a delaware c

00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,400
corp when you're ready to begin

00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,000
fundraising seriously

00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,840
all the big dogs expect it you're gonna

00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,960
raise fundraising from any funding from

00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,600
anyone they're gonna be like are you a

00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,000
delaware c

00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,440
corp that's what they're gonna ask you

00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,960
and there's a lot of reasons for that

00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,400
but the costs are around

00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,760
five thousand dollars for that

00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:17,679
conversion okay

00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,440
now for accounting you should know about

00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,799
how much money is in your account

00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,240
every month at least now you know

00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,360
there's people like oh every day you

00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,840
should know exactly how much

00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,360
and maybe that's you and that's okay i

00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,799
know why commenting or others recommend

00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,159
going through at least once a month

00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:32,000
like going through all the numbers with

00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:33,120
your bookkeeper and everything and you

00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,039
run all of your

00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,960
you know metrics like month over month

00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:39,039
revenue compounded monthly

00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,400
growth revenue paid customer acquisition

00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:42,240
costs um

00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,400
and anything else go check out the y

00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,640
combinator videos on accounting

00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,880
they uh they will go through and give

00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,480
you a ton of information about how to do

00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,240
this and they're fantastic and you can

00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,000
understand what all these terms are

00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,080
and you can expect to spend about three

00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,080
to five k per year on taxes

00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,440
uh more if you're using accounting firm

00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,720
to do your books on a monthly basis

00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,640
maybe they give you

00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,400
you know some discounts and stuff but

00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,200
that's a little bit about the legal and

00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,559
accounting

00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:11,039
okay okay how do

00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:12,320
okay so you have a device you you've

00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:14,159
cobbled a couple of things together with

00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,720
your arduinos your raspberry pi's you

00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,440
know you

00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,640
assembled us um what are the financing

00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,760
you know how do you how do you manage

00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,360
that well

00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,799
there's generally five stages that you

00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,320
have you have your friends and family in

00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,960
pre-seed rounds often they'll go

00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,720
together

00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,400
then you have your seed round which is

00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,960
generally where your accelerators come

00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,400
in

00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,840
okay and we'll talk a little bit about

00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,320
that and then you have your series a b

00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:36,640
and c which are usually when your vcs

00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,000
start to come in and then private equity

00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,919
you know is when you're

00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,159
really scaling and just taking your idea

00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:44,080
and going forward for it

00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:45,440
okay so that's kind of how fundraising

00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,880
is broken down

00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,480
so let's talk a little bit about this

00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,520
number one accelerators really don't

00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,520
like hardware

00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,720
i'm going to tell you out of the gate

00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,880
they really don't because

00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,559
hardware has high capitalization and so

00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,440
if you're building a device

00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:00,720
it's going to be challenging to get some

00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,360
fundraising

00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,720
okay but if you're starting here in

00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,240
central pa

00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,320
the ben franklin tech accelerator

00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,480
program should probably be your number

00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:12,480
one option if you're just starting

00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,960
contact andy long he's over at the candy

00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:17,200
factory you don't get any money

00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,159
but you do get to compete for a 10

00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,640
dollar reward

00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:22,080
for your device and your solution okay

00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,080
which is pretty cool and they they've

00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:26,000
actually they help you hone your message

00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,360
do your customer discovery and all those

00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,600
things so it's a great

00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,799
great way to look at things and get

00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,039
started

00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:35,039
now if you're looking for very hardware

00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:36,720
specific kind of stuff

00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:38,080
uh you can look at alpha lab gear

00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,360
there's gentlemen cole who

00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:42,000
runs a lot of that out there they're out

00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:43,919
of pittsburgh you get 50 000

00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,279
out of the gate and they help you look

00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:46,640
at a number of manufacturing

00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:49,200
challenges and other things like that

00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:51,120
they're a great team next fab is down in

00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,360
philly that's totor and those guys

00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,480
they give you 25k now i do want to

00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,640
mention that each of these

00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,159
alpha lab gear and the next fab they are

00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,919
going to want you to have a solution

00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:01,039
that's probably already done now they'll

00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:02,240
tell you that you know they'll look at

00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:04,320
great ideas

00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,840
uh on the websites but when you get into

00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,640
the interviews and stuff you gotta have

00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,600
it done

00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,520
right you gotta have at least a

00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,400
prototype that's functional and working

00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,440
okay

00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:16,400
and a great website to look at is f6s

00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,600
i would check those out f6s i've been

00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,240
able to

00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,039
speak to people all around the world and

00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,520
europe

00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:24,960
london tokyo about the programs and what

00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,840
we're doing and what they're doing and

00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,000
it's a great way to to look at

00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:31,679
information

00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:34,559
about fundraising now once you

00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:36,480
get to the point where you're ready to

00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:38,320
you have a prototype you have an mvp and

00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,159
you're ready to move forward

00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:42,080
you can look at the big dogs in this in

00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:44,159
the seed round in series a of the

00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:46,559
accelerators these are top 15

00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:47,520
you can take a look at these go check

00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,640
them out

00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,240
i'll i'm sure the slides will be

00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,120
available or go back and check out this

00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,600
video

00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:55,120
and they most of these will give you

00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,320
upfront investments they'll usually give

00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,600
you something like twenty thousand

00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,039
dollars for a certain percentage and

00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,840
they'll give you something called a safe

00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:03,039
note

00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:04,000
which is uh not it's a it's a kind of uh

00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:06,880
investing

00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,080
uh framework to be able to use and so

00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,600
basically you get a hundred and twenty

00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,279
five thousand dollars you give up six to

00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,000
seven percent maybe ten percent of your

00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:14,480
company

00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,760
you go you go uh attend other programs

00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,520
for twelve weeks sometimes

00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,679
more and then at the end you'll have a

00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,919
demo day uh which you will

00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:23,440
present your your new product and people

00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:24,799
will invest at that point anywhere from

00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,200
one to ten million dollars in your

00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:27,200
product

00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:30,400
another option is crowdsourcing and i

00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,120
would seriously consider it for a lot of

00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:34,480
people but you

00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:36,320
should have a working prototype and

00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,679
don't be one of those jerks who goes and

00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,640
raises a bunch of money and never

00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:41,679
delivers

00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:43,279
okay have a working prototype

00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:45,120
and if you don't have a working

00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:47,120
prototype and you are fundraising

00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,799
here's a way you should use the scotty

00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,159
principle scotty from star trek

00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:52,240
principle

00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:54,080
which is if you're thinking about how

00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,520
much you would cost or how much time it

00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,760
would take you

00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:59,200
double it and that's what you tell

00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,200
everybody

00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,400
because chances are that's how long it's

00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:06,559
going to take

00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:07,919
okay go to kickstarter kickstarter is a

00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:09,360
great place you can go you can also go

00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:11,679
to start engine which is a new

00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:13,600
sec approved tool pretty cool you can

00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:15,360
raise up to 1.5 million without having

00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:18,000
to do fancy audits and things like that

00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,840
it's a great way to

00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,200
raise money from a community people have

00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,279
raised millions and millions of dollars

00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,720
so start engine is a place that you can

00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:27,279
you can take a look at i think mr

00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:29,360
wonderful from a lot of the

00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:30,399
um what was what were those things

00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:34,559
called shark tank

00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:36,240
uh is now working with start engine

00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:37,919
okay so i'm going to close here i'm

00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,360
going to bring up a couple of very hard

00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:41,039
lessons that i learned

00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:44,480
and these were very difficult to learn

00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:47,520
but i want to pass them on to you

00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:50,799
number one rarely listen

00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,919
to anything anyone ever says watch what

00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:55,039
they do

00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:57,360
okay so investors

00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:59,279
will say that they give money to the to

00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:01,039
ideas they don't they give money to

00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:02,399
people who are already winning with some

00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:02,720
kind of traction so you already have

00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,559
some

00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,000
something that you're selling okay or

00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:07,520
you have a huge list of people who want

00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,200
to use your product

00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,480
or they have a high profile team member

00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,159
so if you have somebody on your team

00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:15,679
who's already done an exit

00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:17,440
or is um you know works at google or you

00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:19,039
know worked at google or facebook right

00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,480
or anything like that

00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:23,360
they're more much more likely to give

00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:25,200
you money and the money advisors always

00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:28,000
win i've gone into meetings where

00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,120
uh a sequence of meetings and the

00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,919
product people say

00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,880
i love it i love it i love it and then

00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:35,360
the money people say

00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,120
yeah you know this might happen you know

00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,799
a year or two years later

00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:41,120
um so we're not gonna put them you know

00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:44,559
we're not gonna take a risk on that

00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:47,360
and guess what you're done so

00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:48,480
that happens so don't listen to anything

00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,840
anyone ever says

00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,799
always look for are they writing you a

00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:55,600
check are they putting you in a program

00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:56,640
are they actually returning the work

00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,320
things like that

00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,919
this is one of the lessons of startup

00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:02,080
life if you're going to start

00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:03,440
building this zero to one kind of

00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,840
situation

00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,640
let's look at another one building on

00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,960
that it is a

00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,000
pure numbers game you're going to get

00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,960
rejected

00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,679
constantly for the stupidest reasons

00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,120
okay

00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:19,039
uh i can tell you all kinds of stories

00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:21,360
so you can expect to get around one to

00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:23,840
two yeses for about every 75

00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:25,039
no's so get used to rejection right

00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:28,320
princess pride

00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:30,480
right get used to rejection okay take

00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:32,080
feedback and only if it's the same

00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:35,120
feedback from many investors

00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:37,200
and or users do you take it seriously so

00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,640
you right when we're doing lean ux many

00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,080
of you know that maybe you'll do a

00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,919
customer discovery you'll interview

00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:44,399
five to seven customers and you'll look

00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:46,480
at the feedback and you'll find that

00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:47,520
if all five or seven of them give you

00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,760
the same feedback

00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:52,000
it's a very good indicator that ah this

00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:53,200
is a feature we should probably look at

00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,039
okay it's the same thing with the

00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,600
investors investors are going to tell

00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:58,480
you

00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:00,320
all kinds of things right and um

00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:03,200
sometimes

00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:04,000
there it's just going to be silly stuff

00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:08,159
but

00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,679
um you know it doesn't mean that

00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:11,440
you do anything until you hear from

00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:15,039
multiple investors

00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:18,240
okay and i want to close with

00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:21,360
this which is most importantly

00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:24,320
it is going to cost way more than you

00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:27,039
possibly think to build any kind of game

00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,880
changing or ai enabled a hardware device

00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:32,320
or any kind of solution and it's not

00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:34,240
just in money okay so

00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:36,320
this is about startup life if you're

00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:39,039
looking to hop into that

00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,840
so you know the pressure the financial

00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:42,960
pressure

00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:45,039
and so you can expect to

00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,320
have to put a lot of what you are

00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:49,919
everything that you have

00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:51,360
in many ways into these kind of devices

00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:53,120
and products and things that you

00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,480
you want to build if you're if you're

00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,159
serious about that now

00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,760
i'm not saying you haphazardly just go

00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:59,840
in and just you know spend money spend

00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:03,760
money spend money

00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:05,200
and but you know you should

00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,320
be understand that you know there's a

00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,600
good chance you're going to be putting

00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,240
in your retirement you're going to be

00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,919
putting in

00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,200
you know 401ks you're going to be

00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:12,399
putting in you're going to be borrowing

00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,039
money you're going to be doing a lot of

00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:15,039
things and

00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:17,039
you have to be prepared for these high

00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:19,039
risk high reward situations if you

00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:21,440
cannot handle high risk

00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:22,799
and high reward situations you may want

00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,760
to reconsider

00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:28,399
okay another thing is time for me

00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:30,320
personally it's been about 637 days

00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:33,440
since i've had a day off

00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:34,240
now that includes a ton of 100 hour work

00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:38,080
weeks

00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:40,240
uh tons of 20 hour work days and

00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,440
you know it's a it's a lot to stay

00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,720
focused you have to stay

00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,840
focused for an extended period of time

00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,519
it's not one of those new year's

00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,159
resolutions that you do for three four

00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:50,720
weeks

00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:52,799
right you got to stay focused for months

00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,679
and months on end which turn into years

00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:55,600
on end

00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:56,799
right now you do have to take a break

00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,559
you do have to relax you have to

00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:00,240
understand what your limits are

00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:01,760
but you have to be prepared to stretch

00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:05,279
those limits

00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:08,399
you got to be prepared for rejections

00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:09,039
so you know what i mean by that is i've

00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:11,360
gone into

00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:12,559
a a meeting to have fundraising i

00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:15,519
literally had

00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:15,840
the investor sit me down and say you are

00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:19,519
too

00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:21,519
stupid to pull this off okay

00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:22,640
you i've gone into investor meetings

00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:24,320
where um

00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,760
you work on they tell you something

00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:28,159
they're like okay you do this

00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:29,279
and you're like okay i'll do this and

00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:30,640
you come back to them

00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:33,120
you know six months or nine months later

00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:35,120
and they say no maybe you should do this

00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,480
you know instead and they move the goal

00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:40,000
posts on you

00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:41,679
okay or you have things like

00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,519
team members you know and when you're a

00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:44,880
pre-revenue startup and many of you who

00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:46,159
are going from zero to one are gonna be

00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,080
pre-revenue

00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:49,679
and so you know your team members are

00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:52,080
working for very little or almost

00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:53,519
nothing and you put a lot of energy and

00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,799
effort in and if they leave for

00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:56,000
something else they're like ah you know

00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:57,200
i don't want to do this anymore

00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,640
you know you got to be able to handle

00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,240
that rejection on a business and

00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:03,919
personal level

00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:06,480
so but if you can endure

00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:07,600
all those things okay the financial

00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,760
pressure

00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,799
the time and stay focused for the time

00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:15,840
you can handle

00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:15,840
all those kind of rejections and you can

00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:23,679
pass through that crucible so to speak

00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:26,080
that'll take you to the starting line

00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:27,360
and that where something that you have

00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,960
is a one

00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,480
okay and you can look down that starting

00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,000
line and you can look down at all of

00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:35,039
your competitors

00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:38,559
who have one of something

00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:39,440
and from there well the future is

00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:42,880
unpredictable

00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:43,279
anything is possible and that's how i

00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,559
went

00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:49,039
from zero to one

00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:49,679
with the help of the open source tools

00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:51,440
so

00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:53,840
thank you and i'm gonna open up for

00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,840
questions

00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:06,240
okay i

00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:07,519
haven't seen any questions come up rich

00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,119
but if uh

00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:10,879
folks would like to make a comment or

00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:12,639
question he did there's a question from

00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:13,760
grant there i guess we could we could go

00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:16,079
for

00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,960
yeah okay uh i want to actually let me

00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:19,520
address

00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,079
is it i'm not sure if it's louie louie

00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,679
beware of

00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:25,119
really educating investors and they're

00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:28,159
perfect yes absolutely i've actually um

00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:30,000
i've run into that uh where

00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:31,520
i have actually i used to go down to

00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,440
philly like the last

00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,760
two years to work with some specific

00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,599
people to because

00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,839
it's just my personality want to want to

00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:41,200
give because

00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:42,639
you know and a lot of people here in

00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,919
open source are like that too we're

00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:45,440
creative people

00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:46,960
you know we're creative we're open

00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:50,960
people and we love

00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:52,800
to to do things and we get so excited

00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,079
right that's that's who we are as people

00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:57,200
in many ways

00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:57,200
um and

00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:01,280
i've had where i've i've educated these

00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,480
people and i've seen my ideas come out

00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:05,200
in some products

00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:07,359
and that actually concerned me and so

00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,720
i've gone into more of a stealth mode in

00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:10,160
a lot of ways like i haven't actually

00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,839
talked a lot about the tech today

00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,520
you understand that's because i'm not

00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:15,599
supposed to be selling stuff which i

00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:17,200
you know is important but at the same

00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:18,800
time i'm actually

00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,320
moving a lot of stuff into stealth that

00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:23,920
we're working on so thank you

00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:28,400
louise um that is a or louis that is an

00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:29,520
excellent point okay uh grant

00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,440
i know that you've been working on this

00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:33,040
for several years and it's had a name

00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,280
change the vision is the same but it

00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,800
sounds different six months ago how did

00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,520
your mission change and how do you keep

00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:41,680
that mission

00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:42,079
okay right excellent question grant so

00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,640
that

00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:46,240
um i'm gonna give you a thought about

00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:50,400
strategy and how that works

00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:51,839
when you're going from zero to one so

00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,480
you gotta get something out into the

00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:56,560
market so six months ago

00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,000
um i had to figure out where i was going

00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:00,079
to go with what we were doing

00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,760
we didn't have a product and the team

00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:03,680
was kind of you know

00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,920
we're working on this long-term solution

00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:08,400
but it's just taking too long so

00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:11,280
we decided to choose the path of the

00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:13,520
apple one versus the apple ii

00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,640
so many of you are familiar with the the

00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:17,440
story of apple

00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:19,280
uh and how they got started in 76 they

00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,400
are working at the homebrew computer

00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,920
club

00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,520
steve and steve were members at that

00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:26,800
homebrew computer club

00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:28,960
and they wanted to uh

00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,720
start building a home computer and they

00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,079
they started giving it away for free the

00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,040
designs and everything then they started

00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:34,960
helping people

00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:36,560
and then they're like oh okay well let's

00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,200
sell some so they sold some to a local

00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,920
computer

00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,480
company and then when they built the

00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:43,040
apple

00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:44,800
ii then the apple ii was a direct

00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:47,839
consumer product

00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:49,280
right and so that was for everybody and

00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:50,560
then you started having it floppy disk

00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,760
drives and all these other things that

00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,680
were integrated in it

00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,599
and the apple one was originally very

00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,800
specific kind of tapes and components

00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:59,520
and stuff

00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:01,839
and so the apple one was essentially

00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:05,359
made for developer it was a niche

00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:07,359
setup for computer geeks

00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:08,640
like us right i mean that's that's who

00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:11,040
it was for

00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:12,640
and so um there there is a track record

00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,599
and there's a number of products out

00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,200
there like that

00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:17,119
that start off like i talked to the

00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,240
owner of the pebble watch um who now

00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:20,480
works at yc

00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:22,160
during an interview a long time ago and

00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:24,000
um and that's one of the questions

00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,359
we talked about was you know starting

00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,839
off with something that

00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:29,520
maybe is not quite for the full consumer

00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:31,440
but something that is you know more for

00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:33,760
technically oriented people

00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:35,280
uh might be a good solution mycroft was

00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,240
you know very similar to that right

00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,599
that's what they base their whole

00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,520
business model on

00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:41,280
and so you know starting off with

00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,480
building something for other developers

00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:45,119
is not a bad idea

00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,760
as long as you continue moving towards

00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:48,560
that

00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,040
direct to consumer product it shows that

00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,200
you

00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:53,040
have an idea you can gain some traction

00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:55,920
with that initial idea

00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,480
right and then you can take that and go

00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,800
towards

00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:00,240
uh investors and say hey we have this

00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,760
vision that we're going to take in these

00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:04,079
separate milestones and

00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:05,040
we can go there and so that's what we we

00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:07,040
did at bestie bot

00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:09,040
and i think that if you're looking at

00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:11,839
what you want to do for your strategy

00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:12,480
i would seriously consider that as well

00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:14,400
um

00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,839
we're still keeping the same mission

00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:19,040
just a milestone-based approach to that

00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:23,839
mission

00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:27,200
awesome all right uh thank you nathan

00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:30,079
and i think that that is it i

00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:31,520
think that is thank you rich for sharing

00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:33,599
thanks for sharing your story that's

00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,880
this is uh good for anybody who's

00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:35,520
looking to get into this on their own

00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,400
that's a

00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:39,280
that's a good good set of steps and good

00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,040
advice
