	00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:08,559
i guess the first question is does

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,080
anybody have any topic that they would

00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:13,360
like to kick off it can be

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:16,240
a question it can be a rant

00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,279
um as long as it's a polite rant uh it

00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,359
can be

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,640
uh pretty much anything that you would

00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,320
like and

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,480
if it gets too out of bounds i will

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,400
certainly bring us back to center so

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,439
with that would anybody like to jump in

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,039
christian and stu you're on camera

00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,640
so maybe we'll start with you is there a

00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,600
topic that you would like to throw out

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:39,440
to the cpos community

00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:41,600
hmm i gotta give that one some trouble

00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,200
okay first off can you hear me hear me

00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,879
we heard yeah you sound great stu

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:49,360
okay uh let's see here

00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:51,199
and the the one that i keep coming back

00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,640
to and this is something that

00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:54,879
you know obviously you're going to be

00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:58,160
familiar with in your work charlie

00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:01,600
is the whole concept of

00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:04,720
of open source and education uh

00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,040
and and i'm always curious to see what

00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,479
are

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:12,159
other people doing uh

00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:13,040
in in the like in the education world to

00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,759
incorporate

00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,240
open source either into infrastructure

00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:20,400
or

00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:22,400
instruction sure okay absolutely i have

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,240
um i have a ton to say about that but

00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,520
i'd like to open that up

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,920
really to to anyone else who who is here

00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,600
to uh to maybe share i know dawn he

00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,040
jumped on if he would be willing maybe

00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,600
to talk a little bit about

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,600
uh his open hardware projects i think uh

00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:41,840
we'd really love to hear from him

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,840
um as far as answering his question

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,159
yeah um yeah so what are you doing with

00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,680
open source and education don

00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:53,439
uh i don't do a lot intentionally so

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:56,640
3d printing the marlin firmware

00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:59,680
that's an element of what i do um

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:03,280
i do try to steer my students to

00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,799
3d modeling in open source worlds just

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,479
because a lot of them

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,399
aren't going to pay for a professional

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:11,840
license that's

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:15,200
you know pretty high fees i don't

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,480
i don't do a lot intentionally on the

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:22,160
software side

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:23,840
nowhere close to what penn manor i don't

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,520
know what happened there i got another

00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:29,040
echo you know jeff yeah

00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,959
yep you could view there a second jeff

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,480
thank you so i uh

00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,080
i don't feel like i have a great answer

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,920
to that

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,080
okay i do have a question when we move

00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,000
into the next subject but

00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,239
okay great all right so don i'll cue you

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,239
up for the next question

00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,680
and uh jeff do you want to talk a little

00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,560
bit about your experience with

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,560
open source and education so i've been a

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:54,000
free software evangelist

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:57,200
and education since 1993

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,319
so and and it's been an exciting ride

00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,560
we're doing a lot

00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,599
now so i'm a work in arlington public

00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,519
schools

00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:07,440
and uh we have a full associate degree

00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,280
concurrent with high sc in computer

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:13,120
science concurrent with high school

00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:15,920
program that is finally in place cool

00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,280
it's a small program so i am the only

00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,040
instructor now but i

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,879
miss i'm expecting that that's going to

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,560
change so this year has been the

00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,120
craziest year ever i'm teaching

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,879
all four years like the the 9th graders

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,920
10th 11th and 12th

00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:32,959
we use all free software um

00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:35,440
from in the entire program um

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,040
so i'm a big huge fan of the raspberry

00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,599
pi os

00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,159
um and i've especially i found that it

00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,200
installs on just about any old hardware

00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,239
you can imagine

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,640
and especially now it will i have a

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,120
bunch of old laptops it installs on all

00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,799
of them

00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,640
so i've kind of settled in on that

00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,520
there's a lot of great curriculum around

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,649
that

00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,649
[Music]

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,480
um oh you mean the raspberry pi 400 no i

00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,239
have not

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,319
no i mean but i'm i'm actually talking

00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,959
about so there's a version of raspberry

00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,360
pi os

00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,159
that will install on intel laptops or

00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,280
you know it

00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:14,080
it basically it's debian

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,560
with uh with you know that with with um

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,560
this

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,120
you know desktop layered on top of it

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,280
and i guess because of system d now

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,360
it actually just does the regular debian

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,639
install and then auto detects all the

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,120
wi-fi drivers and

00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,880
everything works across the board it has

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,240
been the most delightful thing

00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:35,600
um i work with kevin cole

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:38,240
in a worker co-op nova web development

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,199
and i we have a lot of our students um

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,600
actually

00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,720
become interns we had one become a

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,240
member this year

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:48,800
and so that's been going on too and um

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,880
we we're partnering with some efforts in

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,520
liberia to start some schools and we're

00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,919
hoping to

00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:57,040
transplant our program over there so

00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:58,880
i'll stop uniform

00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,560
okay excellent jeff thank you so much

00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,080
dude you want to talk a little bit about

00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,759
uh maybe briefly about what you're doing

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:07,840
with open source and education oh sure

00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,720
sure uh i i'm a social studies teacher

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,000
at

00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,280
a school called aspen academy in savage

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
minnesota

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,199
and the the big push that i made for

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,360
using open source

00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,199
at school was through the clubs that

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,560
i've led both at this school and the

00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,919
previous one

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:28,000
um i work in the middle school and it

00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,120
to me always seemed like a natural fit

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,639
to try to get

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,639
you know middle school students

00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,080
interested in doing things with tech so

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,639
i started linux clubs

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,400
uh my previous school it was it was a

00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,240
hmong charter school and so that club

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,440
was called the asian penguins

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,199
uh in my my current school uh the club

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,240
is called the penguin corps

00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:51,600
and we started off in

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,600
uh in the fall of last year uh

00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,520
in the after-school program just getting

00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,440
a group of kids together to try things

00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,280
out to

00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,039
learn how to use some of the programs

00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,120
what are some of the philosophy behind

00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:05,120
open source at least at a basic you know

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,840
five through eighth grade level

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,919
uh you know and then get them into

00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,560
installing the operating system and the

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,880
apps

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,560
and troubleshooting hardware and poking

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,919
around inside computers

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:20,720
and then as a sideline for the program

00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,360
was recycling computers for students

00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,160
that

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,280
didn't have them at home and we really

00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,199
thought it was just going to be a

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,639
sideline and it's a school out

00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:32,319
in a rather well discovered so at first

00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,440
glance it didn't look like there were

00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,319
that many kids

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,880
that needed computers uh and then covet

00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,479
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,639
hit and we were shut down due to

00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:43,360
distance learning and

00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,240
uh the school turned to to me and the

00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,960
club

00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,600
uh for a solution because we needed to

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,919
get

00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,160
more computers out into kids homes and

00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,960
the school really didn't have a supply

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,479
of machines

00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,280
or the funds to get them so i started

00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:00,400
taping in

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,680
donations of whatever i could get mostly

00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,680
laptops

00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,440
the kids were helping me out initially

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,960
until the school was shut down and then

00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,800
i kind of had to take that on on my own

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:12,720
and we started pushing those out

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:14,960
to kids homes and the model we had for

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,080
education in the in the spring was

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,319
asynchronous so

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,160
teachers were recording lessons putting

00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,960
things in google classroom for kids to

00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,960
work on

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,039
but since it wasn't a lot of live

00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,319
classes kids could share devices in

00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,160
their homes so it's like

00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,840
we could we figured if we could at least

00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,720
get it down to like a two to one ratio

00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,440
in some of these

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,080
these homes we'd be doing pretty good

00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,000
from

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,000
october to march we gave away six

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,919
computers we're thinking okay i

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,599
guess we're doing all right and then

00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,280
from in april

00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,960
from like middle of march up through the

00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:48,479
first week of may we gave away

00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:50,319
60 computers uh so it you know demand

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,639
shot way up once all of a sudden

00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,840
parents realize oh wait every you know

00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,440
it's like we're

00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,520
teaching kids in our homes now so we

00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,160
need more computers

00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,039
then we come back in the fall and we're

00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,120
hybrid

00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:05,759
and synchronous which means all classes

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,919
are live and since it's hybrid

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,360
every kid is going to spend at least

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:12,000
part of their time

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,879
learning at home and every kid needs a

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,560
machine

00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:17,120
because they're all going to be on at

00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:20,560
the same time

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,879
and uh we gave at our open house we gave

00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,960
away like 132 computers

00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,000
in that one day and it still wasn't

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,240
enough

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,680
by the end by the first week of october

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,000
we got to a point where we

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,279
we had finally sort of caught up and

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,599
every kid who needed

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,479
or a machine or parents that expressed a

00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,680
need for a machine

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,640
had one and at that point we had handed

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,159
out

00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:46,640
somewhere in the range like 270 just in

00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,600
in two months almost all of the

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,839
computers were

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,959
were donated either from businesses or

00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,360
individuals

00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,800
we we did have to buy some but we bought

00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,399
those used from

00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:00,080
through the state surplus services uh so

00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,440
machines that were retired from

00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,800
government agencies

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,040
it's kind of like the state of

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,880
minnesota's garage sale so we could go

00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:10,080
in there and pick up computers cheap

00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,920
i think we bought about 50. um but all

00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,240
together during that that period of time

00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,839
we gave away like

00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:17,040
270. i went and tried to crunch the

00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,120
numbers to find out

00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,240
how much did we actually spend to try to

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,279
get all this stuff

00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,720
done um if we had had to buy new

00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,320
machines it would have cost us over

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,399
ninety thousand dollars but we did it

00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,959
for less than five

00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,080
yeah that's excellent work stu uh and

00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:35,040
steve's been doing

00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,800
just continuous excellent work with uh

00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,440
his students for for the past several

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,000
years

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,200
uh stu if you have a link to uh to what

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,640
you've been doing please if you could

00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,160
drop into the chat so

00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,680
so everyone can have access to that as

00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,200
well i certainly encourage you to check

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,720
it out

00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,040
does anybody else have any other

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,279
questions related to open education

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,720
again we're going to keep it moving so

00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,000
and then we'll jump to another topic in

00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,279
a few minutes

00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,760
with microsoft adopting a lot of open

00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,880
source

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:05,440
and really starting to

00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,640
get developers on board i was at the

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,600
first session with

00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,959
visual studio code i'm just curious as

00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,160
like a pulse survey

00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:17,440
how do people feel about that are they

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,600
sensing that microsoft is

00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,920
applying good in the community of open

00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:25,440
source or is there still a negative

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,440
stigma around microsoft

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,079
oh that's an interesting question so i'd

00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,640
be curious uh to hear what people

00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:33,760
think about that both in the chat uh

00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,680
jeff don or stu

00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,519
would you like to uh chime in on that

00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,040
briefly uh jeff had his hand up first so

00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,040
jeff go ahead if you haven't

00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,720
known the perception of microsoft i mean

00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,200
i'm just going to make a very narrow

00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,000
comment that i'm grateful now for the

00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,839
first time ever

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,560
this has become really easy because of

00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:53,279
the linux sub system for windows

00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,800
i now can it work with students in any

00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:57,120
platform whether they've got a

00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,079
mac or they've got windows or they've

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,079
got linux

00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,600
and we can use a vast shell and we can

00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,600
do good so that

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,279
i'm really glad that i've been i'm quite

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,760
grateful to microsoft for

00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:09,200
making that available in terms of

00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,079
reducing the barrier

00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,079
i'll just say that

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,600
uh joseph yeah i agree i've i i i tend

00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,839
to agree with that

00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,399
in terms of uh helping to improve

00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:27,040
microsoft's reputation in general

00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,959
um but i also josh i see your comment

00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,079
coming in you know it's it's it's hard

00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:32,480
to not forget

00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:34,560
uh the history of microsoft and open

00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,240
source uh for me personally i tend to be

00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,600
a forward-looking individual you know i

00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,320
think that actions speak

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,279
and uh you know if they continue to head

00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,720
in this direction i

00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:45,600
i think maybe it has been a bit of a

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,760
change apart anybody else on the panel

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,640
who is live with audio or video wanna

00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,279
weigh in on that

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,279
on that question

00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:56,959
i'm kind of encouraged by what microsoft

00:11:53,839 --> 00:12:00,240
is doing to be perfectly honest um

00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:02,480
you know i i guess i we we

00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,480
joke about this with with my students i

00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,160
put that quote from linus torvalds up in

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,560
my room where it said

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,560
if microsoft ever writes programs for

00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,959
linux i'll know i've won

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,680
and i show the kids my laptop and it's

00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,800
like okay

00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,399
right now this is a linux laptop it is

00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,959
running ubuntu

00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,639
i have three programs all published by

00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:26,160
microsoft on this machine

00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:29,360
right now so things have changed and i i

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:31,519
think that's that's not a bad thing

00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,120
yeah bob i hear what you're saying too

00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,880
you know trust is indeed uh

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,279
it's it's very hard to earn especially

00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,040
once it's been broken so i i totally

00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:41,760
totally get what you're saying there

00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,440
uh there was a comment to a related just

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,560
uh you know with education really quick

00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,320
before we kind of

00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:50,480
lose this this topic about uh student

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,079
about to help with students was there

00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,880
help with students to help you with open

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,360
source

00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,279
uh and i'm guessing if i grant if i'm

00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,839
reading into your question over the uh

00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,680
the whole

00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,160
the whole covent pandemic has that going

00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,800
down uh i can just briefly address that

00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,880
i feel

00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,480
that you know penn manor for all the

00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,079
work that we've been doing

00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,279
with open source and with our students

00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,480
the community is still incredibly

00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,959
supportive of us

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,560
uh so you know i i owe a lot to the open

00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,160
source community you know both locally

00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,800
here in lancaster but also

00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,000
you know uh nationally as well i'll give

00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,360
a quick shout out to red hat in

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,320
particular that has helped to feature

00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,079
our work

00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,839
uh i know they've engaged with stu

00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:27,519
before you know they they are

00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,040
they are just they are just tremendous

00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,079
they are tremendous advocates for

00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,160
for the work that we are all

00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:33,519
collectively doing uh with open source

00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,839
and education

00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,639
so okay moving on to the next topic don

00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,320
claimed it

00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,399
uh don there was a question for you

00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,120
before you ask your question a little

00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,120
bit back

00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,120
in the thread i think it was a question

00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,839
about software that you're using where

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,920
did that go

00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,959
i'm not sure i noticed that i did have

00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,079
time to think

00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,800
um we just had an instructor retire from

00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,079
my programs

00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,560
i teach at daddy stevens college in

00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:58,480
electromechanical

00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,560
technology so my students work on

00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,600
robotics and automation

00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,800
and the replacement hires names dan

00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,839
rogers

00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:11,120
and his background is military

00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:14,320
before that a machinist at lancaster ctc

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:16,320
he's a welder um but then he earned a

00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,360
bachelor's and a master's in computer

00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,360
science so

00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,560
and he worked at arconic or what used to

00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,639
be alcoa

00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,079
and jay and jay before he came to us as

00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:27,760
an educator but

00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:29,519
he's bringing a new uh emphasis on the

00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:33,040
coding side not just

00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:36,399
plcs or relay logic the hardware style

00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:39,440
plc's that most manufacturing uses so

00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:41,600
um i i put a video uh link

00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,360
a youtube link and it's about 30 minutes

00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,519
of projects he did with our

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,560
sophomores and a couple of them are

00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,360
raspberry pi

00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,760
or arduino based and more than a couple

00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,560
of them

00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,519
are using proprietary hardware but then

00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,920
they're

00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:58,079
using ros and i think we had one of our

00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:00,399
students doing some python

00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,440
maybe some javascript um because it's

00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,560
not my

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,320
hard you know specialty i

00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,600
you know i'm proud of what they did but

00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,440
i can't claim

00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,279
i even texted dan i was hoping to get

00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,040
him to come in here and he could talk to

00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:16,240
you guys all at your level

00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:19,519
um but ros is definitely uh

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:22,959
a theme that we're starting to see um

00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:24,959
and it's robotic operating systems so uh

00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:27,199
that's pretty exciting for the first

00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,880
time for our program at stevens we've

00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,680
been around for about five or six years

00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,600
so

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:34,560
we're at that point where we can start

00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:37,120
maturing and modifying our curriculum

00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,399
to track with relevant trends in

00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,360
industry

00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,399
and to see something like ros uh make

00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,720
inroads

00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,920
in automation and manufacturing is

00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,160
pretty exciting

00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,000
did you find the link or the question

00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,800
charlie

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,279
you did yeah it was uh which uh do you

00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,519
have an

00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:56,480
open source software 3d modeling

00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,680
suggestion

00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,920
uh it depends what you want to do um and

00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,839
if you want to go to 3d printing

00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,759
uh like blender is really powerful

00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:09,680
anybody that's doing any cgi

00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:12,959
or video game content creation

00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:14,320
all those things there's there's a lot

00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:17,040
blender i think is probably one of the

00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,920
most common but if you're going to 3d

00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,519
printing

00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,360
at the end if that's part of your end

00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:24,320
goal

00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,320
i don't know

00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:33,360
there's uh open cad open scad grab cad

00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:36,880
um i think open cat is probably the only

00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:40,000
uh heavily used in the community

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:41,279
i tend to use fusion 360 which is owned

00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,519
by autodesk

00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,639
and the 3d printing community is all up

00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,399
in arms because

00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,320
they just started moving towards

00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:51,120
monetization of that

00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,720
which i kind of knew the last three

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,079
years it was headed that way

00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,720
um oh freecad yeah and it's interesting

00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:00,079
people that

00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:04,240
are uh programmers

00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:08,319
love um the program-driven

00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:10,319
scad uh type programs and and

00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:12,880
i'm not so that's just again not

00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:16,240
something i use very often so

00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:18,000
um tinkercad you know technically i

00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:21,120
don't think is open source but it gets

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,640
used heavily in education and it's free

00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,160
um there are things that i like about it

00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,079
and then things i don't like about it

00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,000
but

00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:30,880
yeah tinkercad is one we've been using

00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:34,160
that extensively with students

00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:36,400
a there's a community of really cool

00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:39,039
projects that are based on tinkercad

00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,960
and they're open-ended they're to me

00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:42,160
they're relevant if people go in that

00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,840
career field

00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,679
you know and get into a stem career

00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,760
field so um

00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,679
yeah i i think tinkercad's a very

00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:52,080
powerful one

00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,760
i i'd be something to ask phil shapiro

00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,720
i'm guessing he'll talk about it this

00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,160
afternoon

00:17:54,720 --> 00:18:01,520
um and he's probably got more k-12

00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:04,960
awareness than i have yeah

00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:06,799
okay yeah it's um you know what we found

00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,720
you know to that question i can maybe

00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,480
expand upon that briefly

00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,640
uh i mentioned that we use tinkercad

00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,520
especially in in grades k

00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,600
through eight in particular you know the

00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,799
problem that we often face in k-12

00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,400
education is that

00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:22,080
we have you know constrained time

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,200
periods for classes

00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,960
so our teachers need tools that allow

00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,799
them to hit the ground running as

00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,039
quickly as possible

00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,640
you know many of these platforms they're

00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,080
they're absolutely phenomenal for high

00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,400
school and beyond

00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,919
but it's it's very very difficult to

00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,760
bring our students up

00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:42,160
you know up to speed quickly with

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,880
something you know beyond tinkercad

00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,480
right because

00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,679
our teachers just want to get them they

00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,200
don't have a lot of time they want to

00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,240
get the modeling they want to get them

00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,000
creating

00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,760
and they need to do they need to do that

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,840
as quickly as possible because of the

00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,520
the the crazy time constraints and time

00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,640
changes so one of the things you run

00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,960
into is what i call

00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,400
3d spatial awareness and that's part of

00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,280
why it's hard

00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,640
to bring in something to a student group

00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,960
that hasn't

00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,160
they may have played video games like 90

00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,320
percent of their life

00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,679
but if they've never done minecraft if

00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,679
they've never thought

00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:16,320
you know about what does this pen look

00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:18,880
like in three orientations and then

00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,000
how do i you know and and that's what's

00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,039
kind of important

00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:26,080
um whether you're doing cgi simulation

00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:28,320
ar vr um that 3d

00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,600
or spatial awareness is is a big deal

00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,679
and um

00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,880
i've done so many conferences especially

00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,679
over the summer and

00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,440
one of my favorites is construct 3d and

00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,799
to me that's one of the themes and

00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,280
elements and i keep

00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:43,600
gravitating to people that are doing

00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,320
that especially in a k-12 environment

00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,640
because

00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:48,640
their student body is going to have such

00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:51,360
a huge advantage

00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:54,160
and it doesn't really matter what

00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:57,039
software gets used or for what purpose

00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,000
if that student is thinking in three

00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,480
dimensions

00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,360
they're getting in my opinion lifelong

00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,000
skill

00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:06,640
uh we're just gonna become more and more

00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,840
spatial awareness driven in our career

00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,840
fields in my opinion

00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:13,600
yeah that's a that's a really terrific

00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:16,000
point something that you know is

00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,520
as as educators we wrestle with too

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,880
right it's not necessarily about the

00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,919
tool that we choose it's about the

00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,320
concepts right

00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,760
and the skills so again coming back to

00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,200
something simple like a tinkercad

00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,360
that gets kids thinking in three

00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,120
dimensions right it starts to build up a

00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,320
base knowledge and base awareness of how

00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,000
these tools work

00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,280
and then as they get older we can

00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,559
introduce them something to more

00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,880
sophisticated like a

00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:38,480
free cat and other tools but again it

00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,320
you know it's it's introducing those

00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:43,280
concepts early enough to try to you know

00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:45,520
kind of shape your thinking

00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,480
at the command prompt and you understand

00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,840
root

00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:51,600
directory structure super admin like

00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,039
there's a whole world you're aware of

00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:56,880
even if you're in

00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:59,200
an os like ios or microsoft or

00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,039
you know and and that's a huge problem i

00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:04,960
see a lot of 18 year olds

00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:08,640
and they're consumers of a lot of things

00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:10,559
and they for what we need them to do in

00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,559
automation need to be their own i.t

00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:13,679
person and they might have to open up

00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:16,320
some port

00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:17,760
um and get around a firewall or you know

00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,440
they just they have to have all these

00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,880
little pieces of knowledge

00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,120
and a lot of my students don't even

00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,919
understand understand directory tree

00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,760
structure

00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:27,760
because they never had to use dos and

00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:30,880
they didn't go through windows 3-1

00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:33,280
and um so the further we

00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,400
rest yeah yeah and i and an ipad

00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,960
certainly isn't really going to be

00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:40,720
exposing file structure right you know

00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:43,520
yeah so that's good don so okay

00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:45,280
i definitely i i could go on a while

00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,559
about education open source in this

00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,480
discussion but we don't want to just

00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:49,760
let that dominate the discussion so

00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,000
certainly if other folks have

00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,880
questions for the group um again you

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,960
know we

00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,919
you know we want to hear them you can uh

00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,440
request uh sharing for audio or video i

00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:00,000
mean i'll open that up for you we have

00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,640
multiple

00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,640
spots right now

00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:07,120
that's all right oh yeah i'm sorry

00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:10,159
there's some comments in there i'll

00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,480
maybe try and address some of the cad

00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,240
but

00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,240
please i'm wondering if anybody in here

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,880
is familiar with helium

00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,400
um and it's just helium.com and it's

00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,360
blockchain

00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,640
uh interacting with a network it says

00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:26,080
people-powered networks

00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:27,919
start a wireless revolution um i'm just

00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:30,960
curious if anybody out there has any

00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,960
experience with it

00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:35,280
this is the first i've heard about while

00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,200
we're seeing if anybody that

00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,440
recognizes that the reason i'm

00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,520
interested in it i've been

00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:44,000
a casual observer of beekeeping for

00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:46,720
about five to ten years so that's

00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,640
something i plan to do this winter um

00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,080
and get ready in the spring to keep bees

00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,640
and one of the things that's freaked me

00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:56,640
out is caring for the hive

00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:59,600
and so uh hacker

00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,400
i get all the hacker sites well mixed up

00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,280
there's a

00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,240
long hive project and it's three college

00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,400
students

00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,400
in philadelphia i think like one upend

00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:11,919
and two directs or something like that

00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:15,760
but they published this um hack for

00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:18,320
good uh they won financing

00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,919
and it's so it's long hive and it has

00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,760
it's monitoring the weight of the hive

00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:24,400
it's using acoustics

00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,280
and then this open wi-fi it's really

00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,720
inexpensive

00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:30,799
data pipe up to the cloud

00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,559
and then they're doing a lot of stuff i

00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:35,440
don't understand machine learning

00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:36,000
and um but you know i vaguely understand

00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,600
so i'm really

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,080
excited about it so they're acoustically

00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,919
monitoring the sound the bees are making

00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,360
in the cloud and then pushing back to

00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,360
you a dashboard

00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,799
of whether your hives are in good shape

00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:50,320
or not um

00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:53,360
and so as a newbie that

00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:54,000
one or two it gets me into beekeeping

00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,080
and

00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,720
it gets me into some really cool big

00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:02,159
data uh machine learning

00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:05,200
um just really cool stuff and it's using

00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:07,520
sensors so you have the whole um you

00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:10,159
know physical computing element to it

00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,720
um but it's based on the helium network

00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:13,200
and

00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,480
that's the first time i heard of it so i

00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,559
this is the community i

00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,400
thought if anybody locally is doing

00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:20,080
anything with helium this is where

00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,880
you're going to be

00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,919
but nobody's chatting yet okay yeah this

00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,640
is

00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,640
this is pretty cool

00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:34,159
okay and tom and tom just jumped in as

00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:36,640
well so i don't know if he had a comment

00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:37,039
about helium so i came across this um

00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,240
i'm

00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:40,080
actually going to be giving a talk a

00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:43,679
little bit later about radio

00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:46,080
stuff i saw that um so um

00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:48,080
helium specifically is kind of a touchy

00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:51,120
subject in the radio community

00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:54,000
because they are specifically using

00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:55,039
um public radio waves for private

00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,120
monetization

00:24:55,039 --> 00:25:02,240
bitcoin training um

00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:04,640
the underlying infrastructure however uh

00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,960
for all of that communication is based

00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,320
off of what's called low raw when

00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,480
and i'm actually going to spell that out

00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:12,720
here although i've seen that in your

00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:15,840
documentation

00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:18,320
yeah um so that is a low power

00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,279
uh wide area network communications

00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,840
protocol

00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:22,640
and um you know it's free for anybody to

00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:25,919
use

00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:28,559
so that actually is um

00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,960
kind of the underlying infrastructure

00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,360
that

00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,320
helium is using for their kind of

00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,919
monetization

00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,400
but um any anybody who is interested can

00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:39,919
get a

00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:41,600
lower land device and send whatever kind

00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:44,799
of data they want over it

00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:47,200
okay so so do you think it will be

00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:48,320
stunted in its growth because of that

00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:52,080
resistance

00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:55,120
uh as part of its use

00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:56,159
uh potentially but i don't i don't know

00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:59,279
if it would

00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:00,480
um really kind of make any sort of

00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:03,520
difference since the

00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:05,200
actual underlying infrastructure is free

00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,440
for anybody to use

00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,320
oh so i think the problem with a lot of

00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,320
the laura wan

00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,919
stuff isn't about whether it's free or

00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:14,080
how available it is it's getting the

00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:15,240
actual end users to adopt it and the

00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,640
idea of having some sort of

00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:19,360
cryptocurrency

00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,840
on this ver on this lorawan network

00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,559
there

00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:24,080
the helium one uh is theoretically an

00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:25,520
incentive to get more people

00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,520
on it because in order for any sort of

00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:29,039
mesh network to actually be functional

00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,200
you need a lot of nodes if there aren't

00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:32,559
a lot of nodes it's not very fast it's

00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,720
not very reliable

00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:35,919
it doesn't matter i've contemplated uh

00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,000
some of my buddies like

00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:39,039
building little laurel when uh

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,120
communicators

00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:44,000
to just to try it out but if you don't

00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:46,000
have multiple nodes in between

00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,520
you're then stuck trying to convince oh

00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,279
hey mr neighbor i've

00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,799
talked to you maybe a couple times would

00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:51,520
you be willing to keep this thing

00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:54,000
plugged in

00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:56,320
like in your basement like or something

00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,200
so that i can use your home now as a

00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,440
relay to

00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,120
communicate with my buddy and trying to

00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,279
sell that to

00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,720
the masses is what you have to do it

00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:07,679
looks like helium is sort of

00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,200
trying to do that but i'm not exactly

00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:12,080
sure what their goal with

00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,480
the blockchain stuff is in my opinion it

00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,159
just

00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,520
looks like they're throwing blockchain

00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:18,240
in there to try and

00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,880
lure in investors as a buzzword like hey

00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,720
guys

00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,480
bitcoin blockchain you know that thing

00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,679
that hitting almost twenty thousand

00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,240
dollars in value

00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:26,799
we have something like that come now

00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,960
even though

00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:30,799
it might not meet any needs or actually

00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,080
do anything for them but i like the idea

00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:34,640
of the laura stuff

00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:36,320
there just needs to be a good project

00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:39,200
that gives

00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,520
more normal average users an incentive

00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,840
to

00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,880
actually start using it because it is a

00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:46,320
very

00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,320
cool platform and idea

00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,840
okay thanks uh

00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:53,279
joseph did you want to jump in

00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:57,679
the hot spots that they have where if

00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,240
you have a comcast account you can use

00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:01,360
any

00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,000
x-fi um uh hot i guess that's more hot

00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,080
spots than

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,760
uh relays a little bit different i guess

00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,520
but uh that's the first thing i thought

00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,120
i typically turn that off because i

00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,720
i personally don't like the idea of

00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:13,600
someone using my

00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,960
access point if i'm paying for it um but

00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:18,160
but if it was an open source thing i

00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:21,269
think i would be more open

00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:21,269
[Music]

00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:26,559
but it is a critical mass adoption

00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:30,080
otherwise you have a mesh that's

00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:32,880
not even it's either not reliable

00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,480
not or the big thing is if not enough

00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,840
people start adopting it there's nothing

00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,279
developed for it if there's nothing

00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,640
developed for it's like

00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:40,720
it's great that you might be able to

00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,480
keep track of your beehive

00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,080
but the mesh then obviously suffers

00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:47,440
because no one's using it

00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:50,159
it's a chicken in the eggs problem

00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,159
all right thank you

00:28:52,720 --> 00:29:00,000
all right great thanks don

00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:01,279
okay uh looks like we've run out of

00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,679
steam on that topic

00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:04,799
so i am taking suggestions for the next

00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:06,799
topic

00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:09,120
so if anyone and uh if you'd like you

00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:10,559
can also kick it off by typing in the

00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:13,919
chat window

00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:15,200
and uh oh there we go joseph is back so

00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,640
we'll let him in again

00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,640
in the chat window or if you'd like to

00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,480
turn on your uh your av

00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,720
tolls we can do that as well so take it

00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,159
away inaturalist.org

00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,679
i did a lightning talk about this

00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:26,080
previously i just think it's really cool

00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:28,159
because

00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:30,399
people can upload observations of any

00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:33,200
wildlife uh plants fungus

00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:34,080
animals birds etc um so it's kind of

00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,880
open data but

00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,600
the website is also open source um i use

00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,520
i upload

00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,880
observations to a lot i haven't written

00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:44,159
any code for it obviously

00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:47,279
the api is available um

00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:51,120
i i think it there's potential for

00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:53,679
uh some games or tools to make

00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,480
using the api where like you make a quiz

00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:56,240
like

00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,440
you look at all the birds that are in pa

00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,640
you show a picture of the bird and then

00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,960
you say what kind of bird is this and

00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,799
then

00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,880
it because the financials knows what it

00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:05,520
is and then you can kind of have a large

00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:07,120
data set to kind of just make stuff that

00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:09,279
might be kind of interesting and

00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,159
obviously for science for biologists and

00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:12,399
stuff it's

00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:14,559
a lot of data to use and for things like

00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:15,600
the spotted lanternfly that data is very

00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:17,679
useful

00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,799
just something that is interesting to me

00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:22,159
and it's open source

00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:24,159
related so

00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:25,360
so i i've seen thank you bring that up

00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:28,080
um so i

00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,880
naturalist is the tool i've i've seen

00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,240
this before

00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,919
i think i may have played with it in the

00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,520
past but if just

00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:35,200
just to kind of take a step back for a

00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:38,000
second so in essence it's a

00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,240
it's a citizen science data collection

00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,120
and

00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,640
um i know you're from you're you know dr

00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,320
hardy both dr hardy's

00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,080
um and i know they have their wiki plan

00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:50,480
atlas website which

00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:52,880
is it's very similar to that um

00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,640
yeah yeah and for the group so uh there

00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,320
are two dr hardy's uh

00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,000
one that teaches in the biology

00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:00,000
department at moser university and the

00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,159
other the computer science department

00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,679
uh who've certainly done some work with

00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:04,640
citizen science and citizen data

00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:08,960
collection

00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:11,600
um before i knew about i naturalist i

00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,240
i i had known about uh dr christopher

00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:16,840
hardy's

00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:20,799
uh wiki plan atlas and it's very similar

00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:24,080
yeah yeah okay excellent so i don't know

00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:26,159
it's a i think it's a web app it's just

00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,440
i'm into the bird watching and stuff so

00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,039
like just

00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,600
wildlife in general but it's it's a lot

00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:32,640
of fun to one look and see oh well in

00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,080
this county what

00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,240
what are the most commonly reported

00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:38,159
animals um and then upload your own

00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,919
observations and stuff and then the api

00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:41,200
and the open source aspect open up a lot

00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:43,760
of possibilities if you want to kind of

00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,760
tinker with it

00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:49,120
so i so i maybe this is open source

00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:50,720
adjacent but i've recently discovered

00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,559
i'm not very familiar with that

00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:56,000
necessarily

00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:57,519
are you so it's kind of crazy actually

00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,679
so what it's doing i'm sure it's using

00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:01,760
machine learning in the background but

00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:03,440
if you can see that so it's listening

00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,159
right now basically you just take your

00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,320
smartphone

00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:09,039
and listen to the background birds you

00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,039
take a sample

00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,559
specifically but i naturalist actually

00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:14,799
doesn't have machine learning stuff

00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:16,080
when you upload your photo it will have

00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:19,360
suggestions for you

00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:20,960
so if it's a clear uh close uh proximity

00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,480
photo it will tell you very

00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,240
with pretty good confidence what it

00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:26,320
thinks the animal is which is very

00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,799
useful

00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,919
usually when someone uh yeah because i'm

00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:31,279
a bird watcher i

00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:32,720
people send me pictures of birds like

00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:33,279
what is this bird and if i don't know

00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,320
i'll just

00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:35,760
take the picture upload it to

00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,960
inaturalist and see what suggestions

00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,840
they give me and then do a little bit of

00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,840
research and i can tell them

00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:45,679
yeah so uh a couple questions around uh

00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:47,279
i naturalist and i also don't know about

00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:50,799
the birdnet app i don't know

00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:52,559
that's open source on the main webpage

00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:53,679
on the sidebar there are actually bugs

00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:55,200
there like you can

00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:57,120
if you wanted to and you are familiar

00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,279
with the language it's written you could

00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,720
like open a pull request or something

00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:04,960
and probably

00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,960
help them improve their application

00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:11,120
that's super cool thanks for the shout

00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:11,120
out kevin and grant did you have

00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:25,840
i'm still relatively new to her without

00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:27,840
a net

00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:31,760
no i didn't have anything useful to

00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,760
contribute other than burn calls

00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:37,039
okay very good we have room for bird

00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:39,840
calls grant did you have something to

00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:39,840
include

00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:43,679
i think you're muted yes you're muted

00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:49,120
you're still muted uh hey grant i

00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:50,960
believe

00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:54,080
hey grant we can't we can't hear you i

00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:56,480
think you might be muted there we go

00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,480
all right

00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,640
uh still let me see uh it says i cannot

00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:04,840
unmute you

00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:06,159
so you may be muted locally on your

00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,679
system

00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:11,440
and it's cool we're still figuring out

00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:11,440
which buttons to push on this platform

00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:16,159
i still can't hear you grant

00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:22,560
uh maybe try to uh

00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:26,639
to leave for a second then come back in

00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,639
i can readmit you as a moderator for ev

00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,240
joel walker asked the question um how

00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:34,399
the hand

00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:35,359
is set uh i i know that you just submit

00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:37,679
data like uh

00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:38,560
so basically data is research grade if

00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,159
it has so

00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,599
one one thing you can do is you can add

00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:42,480
identifications to other people's

00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:44,000
observations

00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,760
so some people they just sit there and

00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,200
they find uh

00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,639
observations and they say i know this is

00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,200
a cardinal so i'm going to say this is a

00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:52,879
cardinal

00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:56,560
and if you get more than two-thirds of a

00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:57,599
um of a observation identified then it's

00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:00,320
research grade

00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:03,040
so i think that's how they they

00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:06,640
determine the quality of the data

00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:08,190
okay joel echo echo echo welcome joel

00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:11,260
did you have a follow-up today

00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:11,260
[Music]

00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:19,040
hang on

00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:22,000
we can hear you joel if you had a if you

00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:22,000
had a follow-up to that

00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:30,000
you got it yeah um i well

00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:33,599
i think yeah i think i am echoing sorry

00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,599
all right is everyone getting feedback

00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,400
okay no it sounds loud no yeah i was

00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:40,000
actually just curious like

00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,480
there's so many different projects that

00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,800
we work on um

00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:46,800
that could make like good use out of

00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,760
like that data as well i just didn't

00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,760
know if um

00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:52,400
there was what the access to that data

00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,400
was uh

00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,839
the access is anyone can do whatever

00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:58,079
they want the data um

00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:58,880
there are people who will uh i think

00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:01,200
there's like

00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:03,359
amphibians of pa like they they've added

00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,200
my observations to their data set

00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:06,320
and they use that for whatever i don't i

00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,000
don't know what they're using data for

00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:10,079
but you can you can

00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,520
create collections of data sets and use

00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:13,520
it for whatever purpose you want

00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,560
i'm not a biologist so i don't know what

00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:17,359
purpose it serves

00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:18,560
i just upload any animal i see that i

00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:20,079
take a picture of and

00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:22,160
and share it so i don't know what people

00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:22,880
do with the data but the data is there

00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:26,960
and i know

00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:29,760
researchers use it um pretty extensively

00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,079
there's um invasive species groups like

00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,359
people

00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:32,800
that's one thing that they'll do to

00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:34,480
track invasive species and stuff like

00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:37,119
that

00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,560
yeah i can actually um share my screen

00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:40,320
if you're interested to see

00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:42,640
a quick view of it i think i should

00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,640
share it

00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:50,480
yeah fire away so these are just some

00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:52,240
recent observations i've made

00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,599
so this this is research grade now this

00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,480
one doesn't have it because only one

00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:55,839
person

00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:58,240
identified it obviously it's a poor

00:36:55,839 --> 00:37:00,160
image so i think it's a buffle head but

00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:02,320
it may not be because it's very zoomed

00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:03,359
out you can upload evidence of creatures

00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,040
so i was in

00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:09,280
uh up near scranton a couple weekends

00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:12,480
ago and i saw this which was

00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:13,280
there's a beaver dam here and a beaver

00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,960
dam here

00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:17,440
so it was evidence of a beaver so you

00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:20,079
don't have to see the the creature but

00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,440
evidence alone is enough to get uh an

00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:23,839
identification for it so you have two

00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,839
thirds

00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,760
what does it look like on that map like

00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,240
i have no

00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:32,000
i'm not sure yeah that's like so that'll

00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,520
just show where my specific observation

00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,560
is but if you go to

00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:38,720
american beaver and then

00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:40,000
you can look at its natives united

00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:42,240
states there's some

00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,599
statistics there seasonality you can

00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,880
upload data points with your

00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:47,680
observations

00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,240
so here's the map here you can see where

00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,400
they're

00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,920
located and this is what's really fun i

00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,200
will just look at this stuff for a long

00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,320
time just because i think it's really

00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:58,880
interesting

00:37:54,320 --> 00:38:00,800
um so yeah yeah it's a lot of fun though

00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:02,720
and if you go here you can see all my

00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:05,680
observations to see all the stuff that i

00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:08,480
uploaded i have a 1717 observations and

00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:08,480
i go in that view

00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:15,359
so here's my map view most of it is in

00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:18,640
pa but

00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:20,720
would be just cool me an idea

00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:22,800
charlie or whatever for like local area

00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:25,119
networks like some sort of like um

00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,079
like mix like you know tech people doing

00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:28,160
like you know

00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:29,200
nature things with like the county

00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:32,000
conservancy

00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:33,599
like oh yeah definitely uh i i wouldn't

00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,400
be surprised if they used this to some

00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:37,599
extent

00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,960
um yeah ebird is another open source

00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:41,200
i don't know the words open source but

00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:42,480
ebird is something that birders use more

00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:46,640
exclusively

00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:48,720
um that also has a plethora of data

00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:51,680
if you look here you can see before

00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:53,280
covid i would often go for walks at work

00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,880
and these are all the observations i

00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:57,680
made on my walks

00:38:54,880 --> 00:39:01,839
so redo search and map and you can see

00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:01,839
the frequency of the species that i see

00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:09,599
yeah you know project i i love projects

00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:12,880
like this as an educator obviously

00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:14,320
right because it is a real world way to

00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,560
get kids excited

00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:18,320
about the natural world right and also

00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,119
make an immediate impact on that right

00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,720
you know where they're taking

00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:22,800
observations they're collecting data

00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:24,400
they're contributing in a meaningful way

00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,760
you know but i think too as adults i

00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,000
think it's really valuable right because

00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,680
it gives adults a chance to reconnect

00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,119
you know with nature and that's probably

00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,320
a talk for you know a different

00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:34,560
conference right

00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:36,560
um but i would say if somehow if our

00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,839
open source community is encouraging

00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,040
the adults of the world to have a

00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:40,800
greater understanding of the natural

00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,760
world i think that's that's a level of

00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,599
success right

00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,880
it's not just all about creating code

00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:47,280
for uh for the next

00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:48,240
uh service product or next generation

00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,520
facebook it's something

00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,440
that's very we appreciate you sharing

00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:53,920

music um i mean i'm

00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:33,040
now helping a student a little bit

00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:35,680
with uh music blocks which is

00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:37,920
you know scratch for the for the

00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:41,040
musically inclined

00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:44,480
but not really but i'm also

00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:46,079
very interested in i mean i've got

00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:49,440
ubuntu studio

00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:52,560
and kx studio installed and i keep

00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:55,839
promising myself to do more with

00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:59,280
music and audio and open source

00:40:55,839 --> 00:41:01,839
and i'm i don't know oh yeah i've seen

00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:04,079
that uh sonic pie

00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:05,040
yeah that's that's a i haven't played

00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:07,839
with it but i have

00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,839
seen it

00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:12,079
yeah yeah we that's actually a really

00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:15,359
good question kevin

00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:17,119
um we have at penn manor school district

00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:19,440
here in lancaster we've really struggled

00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:22,079
with finding

00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:23,119
tools for for music composition for

00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:26,319
creation

00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:27,599
that work well in a classroom i think i

00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:30,880
saw joseph you mentioned

00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:32,319
um audacity audacity is is terrific for

00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,640
audio recording

00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:36,319
but for straight up composition it is it

00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:39,920
is really really tough this is

00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:40,640
this is one sore spot where i'm just not

00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:43,359
finding

00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:44,880
that work well with with younger kids in

00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:46,400
particular

00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:49,359
where again the needs are not

00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:50,880
necessarily for all of the tools that

00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:53,119
that you would find in a uh

00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,400
in a doll right you know or you know an

00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:56,560
adult based

00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,440
uh music composition kit so yeah i'd be

00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,960
curious if

00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:03,839
i think there's some looking at some

00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:03,839
chat here uh

00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:18,079
with a music you know it's

00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:19,440
it's you know walter bender's doing it

00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:22,480
um

00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:23,200
uh one of jeff's students is working on

00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:30,079
it

00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:32,480
uh yeah just um yeah uh let me

00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:34,880

labs

00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:41,119
yeah so that you know for young

to go to there uh

00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:48,560
okay well that's a good tip i was not

00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,079
familiar with this

00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:52,640
i'm just doing some googling here as

00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:55,839
you're describing it

00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:55,839
looks like that's it

00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,480
okay great that's uh that's something i

00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,720
can certainly check out

00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:05,200
at musicblocks.net okay it looks like i

00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:08,480
saw the sugarlaps project as well

00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:11,680
uh jeff's gonna jump in as well

00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,000
oh for older for older have have you

yes i we are very happy with really well

00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:27,040
it works really well for the kids

00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:36,560
for younger students yeah if you could

00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:39,599
view please jeff

00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:41,119
you know my my first need is

00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:42,800
or my biggest need really is to find

00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:44,560
something for elementary even you know

00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,400
seventh grade use score tends to get a

00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,359
little too complicated for elementary

00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,960
kids

00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:50,800
um so yeah i'm really interested in

00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,079
checking out this uh this music blocks

00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,880
recommendation

00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:56,319
uh jeff or jeffrey jeff did either of

00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:59,119
you have uh

00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:59,520
uh something to uh you know say about

00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:02,240
you

00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:02,240
know tonight

00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:09,839
all right i'll jump off what you said

00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:17,520
so i have a student we have this

00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:20,000
capstone program where seniors

00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:22,000
um work on a project for a year walter

00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,920
bender is mentoring him

00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,920
that's the one kevin was referring to

00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,400
and he's working on music blocks this

00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,400
year

00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:30,400
so kevin and i haven't been following it

00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,440
real closely but we met with him once

00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,640
and we plan on

00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,480
you know just finding out what he's

00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:35,200
doing but he meets with walter all the

00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,880
time and he's

00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,720
actually going to contribute to music

00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:43,760
blocks so uh it's

00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:43,760
it's pretty cool so i'll leave now

00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:51,680
okay great thank you and yeah tom i saw

00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:53,520
uh reaper uh that's uh kind of like the

00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:56,400
pro tools ask

00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:57,119
uh digital tool ed uh i am familiar with

00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,760
that

00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:01,520
um again not something as you know uh

00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,480
tom schwartz who used to to work at penn

00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:04,000
our school district

00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,839
uh that's that would be great for high

00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,680
school probably not so much for our

00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:11,200
elementary kids but that's definitely

00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:14,000
i did a short really short demo

00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:16,160
uh for you know talking one of the

00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,280
things when i'm talking about music with

00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:20,480
people

00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:23,520
uh i like to i'm working with

00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:24,800
old slightly older students but i like

00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,920
to talk to them with

00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,319
you know when talking about the

00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:29,760
raspberry pi and one of the things i

00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:33,440
like to start out with

00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:37,440
is the pie and just an alarm clock

00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:38,240
buzzer and and then i ask a question

00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,760
like you know

00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:41,920
hey who can tell me what's important

00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:44,079
about the 12th root of two

00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:46,800
and it's like i don't even know what

00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:49,920
that is well i'm glad you asked

00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:53,040
and uh so this the

00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:54,400
music blocks thing that i pasted in is

00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:58,240
just a real quick

00:45:54,400 --> 00:46:01,599
demo of you know going up

00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:03,040
a chromatic scale just by multiplying by

00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:06,160
the 12th root of two and

00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:11,040
and uh so it's it's real short but

00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:11,040
anyway i will leave that at that

00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:20,720
all right excellent we have we do need

00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:20,720
