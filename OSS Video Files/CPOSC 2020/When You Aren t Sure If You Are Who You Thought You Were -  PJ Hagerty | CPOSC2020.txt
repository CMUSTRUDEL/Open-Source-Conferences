anything so this this talk is called uh

00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,359
when you aren't sure if you are who you

00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,960
thought you were a look at imposter

00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,719
syndrome it could also be called

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,040
pj trying to find the longest title he

00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,000
could and i'm pretty sure i won on that

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,799
that front

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,320
uh so as court said i work in a i find

00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,360
in a place called develop.io

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,960
we work with a lot of different

00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,040
companies i also work full-time as a

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,560
senior dev advocate at mattermost

00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,840
but what devrelite does is we work with

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,680
companies to get them in touch with the

00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,320
communities they work in we do podcasts

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,840
and

00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,880
speaking at conferences and wearing

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,320
t-shirts and figuring out what

00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,200
conferences you should sponsor and

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,479
things like that

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,000
these are some of the great people that

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,799
we work with and feel free to reach out

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,479
and ask me

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,520
about any of them after the talk though

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,400
because that's not what this talk is

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,560
about

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,439
um a little bit about me i am a

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,600
developer

00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:39,119
relations specialist that is a

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,000
completely made-up title i'm not going

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,040
to lie

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,280
if you don't know what developer

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,880
relations is we are people who go out

00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,119
there and work in community on behalf of

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,200
our clients or our companies

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,399
to be a member of a community we're not

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,040
just there to

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,320
sell or chill or whatever our job is to

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,520
get out there and talk about what the

00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,040
community wants to talk about whether

00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,719
that be new technology

00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,560
or what's going on in the community or

00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,240
things that have happened um

00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,079
as court mentioned and as you saw on the

00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,920
slide and on my t-shirt

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,520
i am a board member at osmi which is

00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,360
open sourcing mental illness it's a

00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,720
company that specializes

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,239
in uh mental health in the tech forum

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,640
so if you want to learn more about that

00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,760
osmo help org that'll be on some slides

00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,599
at the end

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,200
but before i really get started there's

00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,160
a very keen important thing that i have

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,239
to say

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,239
i am not a licensed professional mental

00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,599
health expert i am many things

00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,800
i know it sounds weird that i'm going to

00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,000
start with a negative when i'm talking

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,200
about imposter syndrome but i'm

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,319
literally not

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,000
a licensed mental health professional so

00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,519
bear that in mind this is from my

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,280
experience and my research

00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:42,560
if you are having an issue please seek

00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,959
out appropriate medical attention

00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,400
that said a word of caution we're going

00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,440
to be talking about topics of mental

00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,040
health

00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,640
some of things here may trigger

00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,560
something inside of you maybe

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,640
maybe have you have some feelings you

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,920
might not even be aware of the fact this

00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,519
is going to happen

00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,680
i'm letting you know now there's a bit

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,040
of a bit of a woe factor with a lot of

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,239
these talks

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,599
please know your limitations and

00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,360
understand that i'm not offended by

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,879
questions or challenges here

00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,720
but i ask that we'd be respectful of the

00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:11,120
mental states of everybody here

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,239
and i will do my best to do the same

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,920
that said

00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,959
if you feel uncomfortable or you feel

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,360
like you can't handle what we're talking

00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,640
about

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,120
please feel free to go you're not going

00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,920
to hurt my feelings i totally understand

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,680
so let's get started that was all

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,519
preamble i hope you enjoyed the preamble

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,680
it was two and a half minutes long

00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,920
um so my look into imposter syndrome

00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,560
began in a cafe in a totally different

00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,400
country

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,000
the setting isn't super important but

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,680
these words began a conversation with a

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,480
friend of mine a fellow developer

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,080
and a speaker and they said i think i've

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,599
lost my identity

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,760
so we're sitting there in this brightly

00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,280
lit cafe day after a conference where i

00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,120
felt like things really went well we

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,640
both gave presentations

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,640
um the interesting thing is mine was

00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,200
like the soft talk i was talking about

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,959
meetups and using open source projects

00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,159
as a metaphor for meetups and how

00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,519
you have to kind of have you know

00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,720
different things going on so like that's

00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,959
the soft talk i don't really like the

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,720
term soft talk but that's what it was

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,319
they spoke about internal garbage

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,640
collection of an open source language so

00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,200
some

00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,959
super deep dive technical stuff so i was

00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,720
really confused

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,159
on what this was about i was concerned

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,360
that there was something here beyond my

00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,959
understanding they said i think i've

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,560
lost my identity

00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,239
and they followed up luckily with not

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,160
like it's been stolen or something

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:21,519
or someone's impersonating me which was

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,759
good because i can't handle that either

00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,000
i'm not a professional sex ops person

00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,400
just i don't know who i am as a

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,120
developer anymore

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,639
okay so i was still kind of blindsided

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,320
but at least this was a mental health

00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,000
issue i was familiar with

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,400
and maybe even i've experienced this

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,680
firsthand to a degree

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,680
with this statement comes a mixture of

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,440
relief and concern relief because at

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,960
least it's not literal identity theft

00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,960
though in comparison that's a mere

00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,440
inconvenience

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,400
no it was it wasn't about memory loss or

00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,400
amnesia or even

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,320
schizophrenia none of which i'm equipped

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,040
to handle no what we're talking about

00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,880
here is

00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,040
imposter syndrome so let's discuss what

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,039
that means um if anyone's ever seen me

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,600
give a talk before i've been to cposc

00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,560
before

00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,320
i've been to a bunch of different

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,000
conferences i always like to start with

00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,280
definition so we're all working on the

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,039
same language

00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,400
so i'm going to read you a little

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:13,199
definition

00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,880
imposter syndrome is a psychological

00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,680
pattern which an individual doubts their

00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,600
skills

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,360
talents or accomplishments and has a

00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,199
persistent internalized fear of being

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,720
exposed as a fraud

00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,720
so it's also known as imposter

00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,479
phenomenon in posterism

00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,240
fraud syndrome or the imposter

00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,840
experience

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,440
despite external evidence of their

00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,199
competence no matter how much you tell

00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,720
these people that they're wrong

00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,400
those experiences in this phenomenon

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,320
remain convinced their frauds

00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,560
and that they do not deserve anything

00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,639
much less all that they've achieved

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,560
individuals with imposterism incorrectly

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,320
attribute their success to luck

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,600
are interpreted as a result of deceiving

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,320
others into thinking they are more

00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,000
intelligent

00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:53,919
than they perceive themselves to be

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,759
for those unfamiliar with this concept

00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,639
imposterism is defined as having fields

00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,319
of inadequacy

00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,919
that persist in the face of information

00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,520
indicating the opposite is true

00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,280
so that's my definition i think that

00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,280
works a little bit better

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,280
this feeling permeates regardless of

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,039
having a successful career

00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,120
being recognized by your peers winning

00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,960
awards uh having the

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,479
ears of crowds at conferences hanging on

00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,240
your every word like i know you're doing

00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,840
right now

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,600
it doesn't really matter what you do

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,720
when you have apostasy or how much you

00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,400
achieve

00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,560
nothing makes you believe that you've

00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,000
done it nothing makes you believe that

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,400
it was anything but luck

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,680
or weird stuff or fate or some

00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,639
happenstance

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,360
something came in between you and your

00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,880
success

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,960
that made it happen and it definitely

00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,000
wasn't you it was nothing you've ever

00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,160
achieved

00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,080
so to clarify let's talk about start

00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,080
with the types of imposter syndrome

00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:50,479
so researchers have discovered five

00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,520
types and a lot of them sound like they

00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,120
overlap so

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,800
they're not necessarily strict silos

00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,039
they're more like a venn diagram

00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,800
so there's the perfectionist the super

00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,319
woman man person

00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,880
the super person we'll go with super

00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:05,759
person the natural genius

00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,880
the soloist and the expert we're going

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,639
to look at each one

00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,240
and see if we can find examples of this

00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,039
in people you know or maybe even in your

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,639
own behavior

00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:15,360
but we'll describe exactly how it works

00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:17,199
we'll start with the perfectionist

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,039
perfectionism and imposter syndrome go

00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,880
hand in hand think about it

00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,160
perfectionists set excessively high

00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,280
goals for themselves and when they fail

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,199
to reach that goal

00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,400
they experience major self-doubt and

00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,599
worry about measuring up

00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,360
they're not good enough because it

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,160
wasn't perfect how many times have you

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,919
heard the phrase

00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,680
perfect is the enemy of good

00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:36,000
perfectionists don't believe that

00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,120
only perfection is good whether they

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,360
realize it or not

00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:42,000
this group could also be called control

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,680
freaks which is kind of demeaning

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,599
they feel like they want something done

00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,560
right and they have to do it themselves

00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,199
there is no choice some behaviors here

00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,120
include

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,639
being a micromanager how many of us have

00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,919
been micromanaged

00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,199
just raise your hand by yourself we'll

00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,319
make it just feel like we all can see

00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,599
each other

00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,280
i've been micromanaged i know i've been

00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,160
micromanaged a lot of times

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,400
perfectionists have

00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,759
a lot of difficulty delegating tasks or

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,840
jobs

00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,960
they also tend to accuse themselves of

00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,720
not being

00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,280
cut out for the job simply because they

00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,520
missed one self-made benchmark

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,960
so a benchmark they set for themselves

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,639
and they didn't meet that and therefore

00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,560
this probably isn't the job for them

00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,400
for this type of imposter syndrome

00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,440
success is rarely satisfying

00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,280
because they believe they could have

00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,840
done even better no matter what i

00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,360
climbed mine

00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,879
everest so i probably could have jumped

00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,280
off of it and touched the moon

00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,879
not good enough um but that's neither

00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,479
productive nor healthy

00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,479
owning and celebrating achievements is

00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,640
essential if you want to avoid burnout

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,479
find contentment and cultivate some sort

00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:41,360
of self-confidence that works externally

00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:43,039
as well as internally

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,839
so since people experience this

00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:47,920
phenomenon the superman superwoman

00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,920
super person they're convinced they're

00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,360
phonies among real deal colleagues

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,360
they often push themselves to work

00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,120
harder and harder to measure up

00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,800
so you have to prove yourself to be a

00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,839
hero i mean a lot of

00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,600
a lot of times they feel that they're

00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,360
covering up their insecurities with a

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,959
false identity of being this amazing

00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,560
thing

00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:07,200
but this is just a cover-up for their

00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,040
insecurities and the work

00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,720
overload kind of tends to harm their own

00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,320
mental health but also their

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,240
relationship with others

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,240
so people who kind of qualify as super

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,560
people often stay later at the office

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,080
than the rest of the team even past the

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,560
point of completing that day's necessary

00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,160
work

00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,000
they'll still stay at the office so they

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,519
can pull more hours do more things maybe

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,200
even prep for tomorrow

00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,200
they get stressed when not working and

00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,640
they found they find diet down time

00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,480
completely wasteful

00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,640
complete waste of time no hobbies no

00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,480
nothing that gets in the way

00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,240
they let hobbies and passions they may

00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,200
have had in the past completely followed

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,760
by the wayside

00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,880
they sacrificed it all to work um

00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,200
impostors

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,080
uh are preposterous who are super women

00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,800
supermen

00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,480
super people are workaholics and they're

00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,080
actually addicted to the validation that

00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,640
comes from working not to the work

00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,040
itself

00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,880
the work is the work that doesn't matter

00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,760
but they love the validation that comes

00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,360
from working

00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,440
completing a task even if it's a small

00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,200
test really yeah i got that done

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,720
sometimes they even reason that they're

00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,040
alpha personalities

00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,079
or maybe this is more relatable 10x

00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,680
developers

00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,440
so they can excuse this excessive

00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,720
behavior and say it's not part of a

00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:18,800
mental health issue

00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:21,200
it's just me being 10x all the time

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,040
so natural genius these types of

00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,320
imposters set their internal bar

00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,480
impossibly high just like professionals

00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,760
perfectionists

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,120
excuse me but natural genius types don't

00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,560
just judge themselves based on

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,000
ridiculous expectations

00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,160
they also judge themselves based on

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,360
getting things right on the first try

00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,279
when they're not able to do something

00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,200
quickly or fluently their alarm goes off

00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,640
red flags big bells

00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,720
and some of those red flags include

00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,480
having a track record of getting tons of

00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,720
praise or rewards for doing what comes

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,600
naturally

00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,600
disliking the idea of having a mentor

00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,120
not being able to handle feedback even

00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,200
when it's positive

00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,399
and avoiding challenges outside one's

00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,240
own comfort zone

00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,440
so think about this this is this is kind

00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,600
of the idea of

00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,279
that kid in high school who never had to

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,000
study but got

00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:09,360
got straight a's and it wasn't so much

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,480
they were a natural genius it's actually

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,600
because they weren't really being

00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,839
challenged

00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,200
or they took well enough notes well

00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,760
enough to not really have to worry about

00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,519
studying

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,040
there's nothing special about the person

00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,880
but as soon as they had a challenge

00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,959
oftentimes with the with the high school

00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,079
genius it was immediately as they went

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,680
to college

00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:27,200
and they were challenged excuse me with

00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,399
new ideas and new ways of doing things

00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,440
for the first time

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,440
that they found out they weren't a

00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:35,279
natural genius they were just

00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,279
someone who got easy work pretty well

00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,200
sound like anybody you know probably it

00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:42,720
does

00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,279
the soloist so sufferers who who are so

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,880
lewis

00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:46,880
they feel as though asking for help

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,800
reveals their phoniness

00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,399
like it shows everyone else that they

00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,000
don't know what they're doing

00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,920
um there's nothing wrong with being

00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,079
independent don't get me wrong

00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,320
but not to the extent that you refuse a

00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:00,560
system if you refuse assistance

00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,480
so that you can prove you're worthy so

00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,160
you can prove that you know you prove

00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,440
you have the knowledge

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,600
here are some of the behaviors

00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,240
associated are demanding to accomplish

00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,760
everything on your own uh framing

00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,200
requests in terms of the requirements of

00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,079
a project rather than the needs of a

00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,079
person

00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:17,360
in other words you know i need i need

00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,040
this done by such and such a time

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,160
because blah blah blah

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,760
and what you're actually saying is i

00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,240
need this done because i need it so that

00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,920
i can

00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,000
feel better but i'm framing it as the

00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,680
needs of the project um letting a

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
project fail in silence instead of

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,000
asking for assistance or guidance uh

00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,839
actually ironically

00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,760
or not ironically i never use that word

00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,839
correctly um

00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,519
had a conversation about this today with

00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:41,760
my friend brian lyles on twitter

00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,040
brian was talking about uh how how many

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,079
github repositories you have that are

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,360
just abandoned

00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:47,200
projects that you've never really gotten

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,399
back to and he was like well you know

00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,440
it's interesting because i feel like a

00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,880
lot of that shows

00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,480
that you had a good idea but maybe you

00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,680
didn't have the time to execute it and

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,800
it's interesting because i was just

00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,079
researching this

00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,440
and it turns out a lot of it is because

00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,399
you're afraid to share it with somebody

00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,600
because you're afraid they might think

00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,240
you're a phony

00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,120
um and and a lot of times you know

00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,720
you'll just leave it

00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,880
leave it go or you'll leave it private

00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,480
no one will ever see it or you delete it

00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,760
um so we're actually having a big batch

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,839
channel discussion about that that i

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,600
will continue after this talk

00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:16,399
um but that's kind of how the soloist

00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,720
works then of course there is the expert

00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,800
the expert measures their competence

00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,600
based on what and how much they know or

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,760
can do

00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,600
believing they will never know enough

00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,720
they fear that they will be exposed

00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,560
as inexperienced or unknowledgeable

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,320
experts tend to shy away from applying

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:36,160
to job postings unless they meet

00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:37,839
every single educational requirement

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,360
they are constantly seeking out

00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,880
trainings or certifications because they

00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,320
think they need to master their skills

00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,399
in order to succeed

00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,240
and just a quick side note on that

00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,959
certifications i'm a big

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,320
non-fan of certifications i'm very

00:13:47,959 --> 00:13:52,079
anti-certification and i'll tell you why

00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,839
it seems to be that this is an industry

00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,920
thing that happens every few years

00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,120
and it kind of preys on the validation

00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,040
idea like oh

00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,519
i this is going to show my age a little

00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,079
bit i'm an mcsc i'm a microsoft

00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,560
certified

00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,279
engineer um that means that i can do all

00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,720
of this stuff

00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,320
and what it really means is i paid for a

00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,199
course and studied it it doesn't mean

00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,560
that i'm better at some

00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:12,000
someone that has a lot of experience

00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,800
just means that i have a certification

00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,040
for it

00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,240
um but that kind of prays on this whole

00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,760
imposter syndrome thing like oh more

00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,040
certifications mean more things

00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,000
now you're seeing it more and more where

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,440
people are giving out devops

00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,920
certifications and i'm even seeing in

00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,279
the

00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,639
developer relations field where people

00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,519
are saying we can certify you to be

00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,000
devrel

00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,800
what does that even mean but back to

00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,440
experts

00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,560
um experts tend to feel like they never

00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,480
know enough

00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,839
and they shudder when being called an

00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,000
expert

00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,120
they'll call themselves hobbyists or oh

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,560
i just kind of know that because i read

00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,240
up on it they'll never say that they're

00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,680
an expert

00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,279
this does clash a little bit with what i

00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,680
said but i'm literally not a licensed

00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:48,959
medical physician so

00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,800
i should probably change the wording on

00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:52,639
that um you may see some of these

00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,320
behaviors in yourself and others

00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,680
now that we know the types let's touch a

00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,240
little bit more on imposter syndrome in

00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,920
general

00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,360
and a bit on how it relates to the tech

00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:02,079
field

00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,079
so one of the things that we focus on is

00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:05,279
coders developers database engineers

00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,360
designers

00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:09,279
especially in the team focus stage that

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,839
we're in now is being on a team of

00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,160
people

00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,760
so much smarter than we are this is

00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,199
something we celebrate we boast about

00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,639
when we talk about our jobs

00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,320
people are always happy to tell you that

00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,240
they're linking a chain with the best

00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,639
minds in the business

00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,000
every time we say this though it can be

00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,320
causing like a small

00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,360
seed in our minds to start to bloom that

00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,759
seed is saying

00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,320
if everyone on the team is so awesome am

00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:34,399
i the one who is less awesome in fact

00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,240
is my contribution somewhat less than

00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:40,160
the next person

00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:41,680
this seed once planted is insidious some

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,959
people overcome it

00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,120
uh perhaps through individual

00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,720
perseverance or maybe they just work in

00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:50,160
a less toxic workplace

00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:52,720
but others let this seed consume them

00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,240
there's a balance to the juxtaposed

00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,839
internal and external situation

00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,519
here it's difficult to keep things

00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,800
moving forward and avoid feelings of

00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,560
imposter syndrome

00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,279
when both internally and externally

00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:05,440
you're being made to think this is true

00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:07,199
this is true non-toxic teams can even be

00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,000
true on positive teams depending on how

00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,920
the reinforcement

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,480
comes in keep that in mind when you talk

00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,079
to your employees your teammates

00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,519
this issue is compounded by the fact

00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,040
that most people suffering

00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,800
from issues of imposter syndrome are

00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,360
likely to engage in behaviors that cause

00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,560
others to feel out of place or put on

00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,600
the wrong foot

00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,079
i mean we can look at some of those

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,279
examples from our five types a soloist

00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,240
might make someone feel like they aren't

00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,759
good enough because

00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,279
the soloist keeps all the work on a

00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,040
project to themselves so they're not

00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,839
willing to share it with me

00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,519
so i must not be good enough to work on

00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:38,959
it a natural genius right might refuse

00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,839
to take in new perspectives for someone

00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,279
who's offering

00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,600
making them feel their opinion isn't

00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,000
valid you know the natural genius well

00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,279
you know

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,519
they always know so much they're always

00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:49,279
so so talented

00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:51,360
when i said you know let's use let's use

00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,880
uh let's use react instead of you

00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,160
they just shut me down and it's really

00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,040
because the natural genius is afraid

00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,079
they don't know

00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:00,320
view they don't want it um

00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:02,000
a super person might go through that

00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,279
whole hero behavior that makes other

00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,039
people feel inferior

00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,400
and is often rewarded in the workplace

00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:08,480
even though hero behavior shows that we

00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,240
haven't built our abs correctly

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,240
it's a vicious cycle it's all a vicious

00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,280
cycle and it makes it that much more

00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,319
difficult

00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:18,400
to to suss out and work toward resolving

00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:20,160
issues of imposter syndrome

00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,919
then we also have some modern

00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,039
accelerants uh

00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,799
one of the general things that we've

00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,079
i've said this word a few times one of

00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:26,799
the general symptoms of imposter

00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,400
syndrome is

00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:30,320
suffering the sufferer feels like a

00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,400
fraud you feel like you're not doing for

00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,480
anything for real you're fraudulent

00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,320
this comes into glaring focus in today's

00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,760
everything is public coding world

00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,440
at any point in time you can see the

00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:42,000
level of check-ins on any

00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,360
person's github or git lab account some

00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,360
people especially those that

00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,640
feel like they're impossible postures

00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,480
they feel graded and that their

00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,679
contribution isn't enough

00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,520
as if there is a standard of

00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,960
participation we all need to achieve

00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,039
all those tweets that you see people are

00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,120
like looking at my 365 days of green

00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:58,400
you're not helping all you're saying is

00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,679
you work too hard maybe you're the

00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,400
imposter because you're working so hard

00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:03,520
to prove

00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:05,520
you can code 365 days in a row

00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,039
doesn't help anyone in that situation

00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,400
the idea that everyone needs to meet an

00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,360
imaginary level of acceptable

00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,720
contribution

00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,559
brings many to the conclusion that they

00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,720
will never reach that level so maybe

00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:16,240
don't bother it's a perception that

00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,880
feeds paranoia which turns

00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,919
into and feeds imposter syndrome it's

00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,919
difficult to avoid

00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,760
feeling a public judgment when what

00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:26,000
developers do especially the open source

00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,840
world is so publicly visible

00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,440
this is also something we can't do much

00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,799
about in our current environment

00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,559
um it's possible to make our work

00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,880
private but hiding contributions and

00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,559
stuff

00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,320
is just avoiding the problem and it's

00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,840
not just very that's not very good open

00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,760
source behavior

00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,200
we need to enable the developers to take

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,039
heart in the fact that any amount of

00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,120
contribution is available and every

00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,320
excuse me every little bit helps one

00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,679
thing that i do especially with new

00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,320
people who are looking to get into open

00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,679
source

00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,080
is i teach them to work with

00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,880
documentation first they worry that it's

00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,559
not enough

00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,679
but at the same time documentation a i

00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,600
think we can all agree documentation

00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,360
needs to be fixed none of it's any good

00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,799
um there are great examples but

00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,600
nothing's perfect

00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:04,880
uh at the same time like everything has

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,840
everything iterates everything needs to

00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,760
be new and

00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,600
functional so it's a great place to get

00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,799
in it helps you learn the place

00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,559
it helps you feel a little bit less like

00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:15,440
an imposter a little bit more like you

00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,440
belong on that team

00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,160
so recognizing posture system

00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,760
the first step to recognizing issues

00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,440
with yourself or

00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,960
others when it comes to imposter

00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,160
syndrome is

00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,640
to zero in on new on a few facts first

00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,000
off

00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,559
we're speaking about a mental health

00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,440
issue and like me i imagine very few

00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:37,120
people who are

00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,039
at the central pennsylvania open source

00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,240
conference are qualified mental health

00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,600
practitioners therapists or

00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,200
professionals

00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,039
just to guess i don't think it's the

00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,440
audience

00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:49,039
we're not qualified to diagnose anyone

00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,480
but if we see some things we can

00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:52,880
certainly help out

00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,160
some things we need to be careful of

00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,679
even when looking at ourselves is

00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,160
labeling things incorrect

00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,280
incorrectly or applying names to mental

00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,880
health issues

00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,320
and giving them a temporary status that

00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:06,320
someone might have

00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:08,000
we all have pairings we all have periods

00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,600
of feeling inadequate or that we're not

00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,120
up to snuff and that's okay

00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,520
there are plenty of factors that go into

00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:16,080
this imposter syndrome is really

00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,960
much more sustained it can happen for

00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,559
years

00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:22,320
and clean can lead to other mental

00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,320
issues and behaviors if left unchecked

00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:26,480
so why do people experience imposter

00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,919
syndrome

00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,280
here's the bad news i always have a bad

00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:31,360
news slide in every presentation i've

00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:34,000
ever given and this is the one

00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,880
there's no single answer some experts

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,480
think it has something to do with

00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,840
personality traits like anxiety or

00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,679
neuroticism

00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,520
others focus on family or behavioral

00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,799
causes for for example being always told

00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,919
you're the golden child and

00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,760
you'll never get anything wrong you're

00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,960
so great you're a genius how could that

00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,720
possibly go wrong

00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,000
sometimes childhood memories such as

00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,039
feeling that your grades were never good

00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,480
enough for your parents

00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,080
or that your still your siblings

00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,280
outshone you in certain areas can leave

00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,679
a lasting impact

00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,320
i get that i'm a middle child um

00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,679
sometimes

00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,440
it's the need to achieve in a

00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,000
competitive job i don't know like being

00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,799
a developer

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,480
in tech that bases what we do on our

00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:08,240
mental abilities

00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,000
that's i just pretty much just described

00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,760
what we did it's competitive

00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,600
everything that we do is not based yeah

00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,200
we write code with our hands but we use

00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,799
our brains

00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,400
this is also the major reason why

00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,240
there's so much stigma about mental

00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,400
health issues in tech

00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,000
an imposter system is no different if

00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,080
there's even an inkling of the

00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,919
possibility that someone is suffering

00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,679
from impostor syndrome any mental health

00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,600
issue there's no reason to believe that

00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:33,760
the very nature of jobs and technology

00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:36,080
won't consistently trigger issues

00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,600
beyond that if you think about it you

00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,760
know we think about our tools as our you

00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,919
know our computers our keyboards our

00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,039
you know our many monitors and various

00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:44,240
rigs that we all have set up now that we

00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:46,080
all work from home

00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,320
but the tool that you use most is your

00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,919
brain most people are embarrassed to say

00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,200
hey my brain doesn't work right i need

00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,960
to get it fixed

00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,320
but that's the wrong attitude to take

00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,039
and we really need to focus on keeping

00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,120
that

00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:59,280
working better than anything else you

00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,880
can always get a new laptop

00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:03,120
can't get a new brain you can only fix

00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,039
the one you have

00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,559
first thing we look for in recognizing

00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:08,080
someone with imposter syndrome is their

00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,840
outward behavior

00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,440
it's a common misconception that a

00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,720
person is going to be like super shy or

00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,000
quiet or more introverted because they

00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,720
have imposter syndrome that's just not

00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,600
true

00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,799
like it's 100 the opposite most people

00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,120
with imposter syndrome

00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:23,120
are very self-confident in the eyes of

00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,720
others they don't see it themselves

00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,559
but they sometimes come off as having so

00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,039
much bravura and so much

00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:30,400
like confidence that just exudes in some

00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:32,400
cases so much so

00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,400
their co-workers and their teammates say

00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,440
like oh it's so admirable that so-and-so

00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,679
is so confident

00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,760
i wish i had that so this is what's

00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:41,520
known as a contra indication

00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,360
in other words it's the opposite of the

00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,520
expected behavior

00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,640
but that's the true behavior you're so

00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,000
confident that you're pushing out

00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,799
confidence so no one finds out that

00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,799
you're an imposter

00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,640
the imposter cycle is defined by dr

00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,960
pauline r clance

00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,799
begins with an achievement related task

00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,480
so we're getting kind of science here

00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,679
an example of an achievement related

00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,200
task would be like building a new

00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,400
feature for the front end

00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,640
we're building each feature from the

00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,799
background building new feature

00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,679
once someone's been assigned a task the

00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:11,440
assignment

00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,600
the feelings of anxiety and self-doubt

00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,679
and worry immediately follow

00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,840
the cycle accounts for about two

00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:19,120
possible reactions that stem from these

00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,280
feelings

00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,799
one will respond either by over

00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,679
preparation or by crash

00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:27,360
procrastination if the person responds

00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,280
with procrastination

00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:31,679
this initial response will turn into a

00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,120
frantic effort to complete the job

00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:34,559
once the task has been completed there

00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,400
will be a brief period of accomplishment

00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,120
and a feeling of relief and if someone

00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,880
gives positive

00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,159
feedback like hey great job on that new

00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,600
feature the front end the new front end

00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:43,120
looks great

00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,880
once the work's been done they get that

00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:47,760
comment and they'll immediately

00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,960
discount that positive feedback they'll

00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,120
say it was luck

00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,559
they'll say they pulled off an 11th hour

00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,760
miracle they'll say whatever to make

00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,880
sure that it isn't because of the work

00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,159
that they did

00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,320
on the other side if the person over

00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,600
prepares even if it goes successfully

00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,360
they'll view the entire thing as a

00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,720
failure because it wasn't perfect

00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:05,840
it didn't meet the same vision that it

00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,840
met in their heads

00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,840
so usually the response to over

00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,520
preparation is a successful outcome

00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,120
was a result of hard work that's usually

00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,039
the feedback you get if it's

00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,559
procrastination you view the outcome as

00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:18,400
a matter of luck

00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:19,840
in the imposter cycle gaining success

00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,600
through hard work or luck is not

00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,240
interpreted as a matter of true personal

00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,640
ability

00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,240
not by the individual this means it

00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,440
doesn't matter which mechanism

00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,640
somebody used to complete the task

00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,159
whether they procrastinate or over

00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,480
prepare doesn't matter

00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:34,480
the outcome falls flat even with a

00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,360
positive response even with the feedback

00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,279
again

00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,279
it has no effect whatsoever on the

00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:42,080
person the individual's perception

00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:42,799
of their own personal success this leads

00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,960
to

00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:46,799
discount of positive feedback so this

00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,640
sequence of events serves like there's a

00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:49,679
reinforcement causing the cycle to keep

00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,520
going in motion

00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:53,440
with every cycle feelings of being

00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:55,520
fraudulent self-doubt

00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:58,000
depression and anxiety just add up and

00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:59,520
add up and add up and add up

00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,840
as the cycle keeps going forward

00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,400
increased success leads to the

00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:04,640
intensification

00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,760
of feeling like a fraud that seems

00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,600
completely crazy like

00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,799
you're you're trying to say you're

00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,320
better you're better you're better

00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,360
you're doing a great job and this person

00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,400
is actually feeling more and more

00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,159
fraudulent

00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,440
this experiences causes the person to

00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:17,039
remain haunted

00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,279
by the lack of perceived personal

00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:21,360
ability believing that at any point

00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:24,159
they're going to be exposed for someone

00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:26,320
who by by someone who thinks they really

00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:29,760
keep the cycle in motion

00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:31,279
so what can we do once we know and we

00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,000
can identify the feelings in ourselves

00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:34,799
and others

00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,799
how do we mitigate things in a team

00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:38,720
setting a quick way to stop this out

00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:39,840
is to continually validate all members

00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:43,200
of the team

00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:46,159
even when not doing jobs specifically

00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,960
so this might this is this might seem a

00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,520
little bit odd

00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,000
but this has to be sincere validation

00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,200
not

00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,120
pat on the back because you're part of

00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,120
the team we're so glad you're here

00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,960
um but like an actual time in a meeting

00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,720
or stand up to cite something

00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,240
each person has done and appreciate

00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,840
their contribution whether that

00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,200
contributed to the final part of a

00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,640
project or not

00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,400
this gives each person a concrete

00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,279
accomplishment they can recognize and

00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,880
take pride in

00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:11,279
at this point especially with covenant

00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,960
stuff going on it might just be like hey

00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:14,320
i'm really glad you got up today i don't

00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,120
even give a that you didn't get

00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,640
dressed

00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,880
i'm glad you got your coffee and you're

00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,159
here i'm just glad you're here

00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,080
it's really an important message

00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:23,600
especially right now don't expect

00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,080
someone with imposter syndrome though to

00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,080
immediately

00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,760
improve from this type of reinsurance it

00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,120
takes a lot of work

00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,960
to bring someone from the internal

00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,240
dialogue of imposter syndrome but it

00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,880
needs to start somewhere and it can

00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:37,039
start with you

00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,559
at the very least you can take a step

00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:40,320
back and do something outside the normal

00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:41,760
coding routine that often helps

00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,279
it seems like in our industry there's

00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,640
even a stigma around taking time for

00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:46,799
yourself because we have the whole 10x

00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:49,039
developer concept and all that jazz

00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:50,640
often though this time is like needed to

00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:51,360
reevaluate your goals establish a

00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,880
connection

00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,000
back to what made the person passionate

00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,799
about what they were doing in the first

00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,640
place

00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:57,840
taking a step back to find things that

00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,360
take the pressure off

00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,880
like this is super hard right now

00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:03,200
especially when you can barely walk away

00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,640
from where you work

00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,640
but there's ways to build up team

00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,000
rapport and things that people do

00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,919
build up friendships instead of just

00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,520
co-worker relationships

00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:13,279
to help people trust each other and to

00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,960
trust themselves this will create

00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:17,840
what they call a psychologically safe

00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:19,600
environment it'll foster communication

00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,200
also there's the most obvious thing if

00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,080
you think you have issues with imposter

00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,600
syndrome

00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,120
and you don't want to deal with it on a

00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:28,320
work level seek

00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:29,520
out therapy there is no shame whatsoever

00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,320
in speaking with a mental health

00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,919
professional

00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,919
who can direct your energy toward

00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,200
improvements i know that's difficult

00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:36,000
right now because you can't actually go

00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,399
in and see someone

00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,919
but there are lots of online services

00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:41,120
that will help you do this

00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:42,799
even if you don't think you have an

00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,240
issue with imposter syndrome or any

00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:46,720
other mental health issue

00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,600
get a therapist it's likely there's

00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,600
something lingering

00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,039
somewhere just under the surface that a

00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,880
conversation with someone outside of

00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:54,640
your social circle outside your family

00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,159
side of your friends who you can just

00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,520
kind of unload to

00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:59,360
it might help to uncover and help you

00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:02,559
like improve your day-to-day life

00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:04,480
what's the harm

00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:05,600
so the other key thing with imposter

00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,760
syndrome is to know that you're not

00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:10,240
alone

00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,520
it's not uncommon it actually affects a

00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,360
lot of people

00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:16,159
um it doesn't mean you'll never find

00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:17,520
success each person on this side every

00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:18,960
single one of them

00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,399
has stated that they suffer from

00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,880
imposter syndrome and they've been dying

00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:22,559
some of them

00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,159
diagnosed by doctors they have embossed

00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:25,919
syndrome they overcame it

00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:28,000
to a point where they could be a paragon

00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:29,760
in their field so in case you don't know

00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,080
we'll start in the upper left that is

00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:33,679
that is uh tom from radiohead one of the

00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,480
most famous you know alternative rock

00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:35,600
bands in the world

00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,880
if you don't know who the person in the

00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,320
middle is i'm not sure where you've been

00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:41,200
the last few years

00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,840
um on the right top row that's neil

00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,279
gaiman

00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,279
or neil gaiman i never know how to

00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:48,480
pronounce his name we've never met

00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:48,960
uh bottom left is david tennant bottom

00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,000
center

00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,279
is uh supreme court justice sonia

00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,799
sotomayor

00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:58,240
and on the bottom right is maya angelou

00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:59,840
and she gave one of the best examples of

00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,720
what it's like to suffer from imposter

00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,840
syndrome

00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:05,600
she once said i've written 11 books but

00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,760
each time i think uh-oh

00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,039
they're going to find out now i've run

00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,799
the game on everybody but they're going

00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:12,480
to find me out now

00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:13,760
it's not a matter of being found out

00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,360
it's a matter of learning to work within

00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,720
the parameters of accepting who you are

00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:19,120
and what you can do

00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,880
remember studies show as many as 70

00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,240
percent of people suffer from imposter

00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,840
syndrome at some point

00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,240
it's about half that number having

00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,919
repeated or long-term issues with it

00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:30,080
there's no shame in admitting you might

00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:31,200
have a problem there's no shame in going

00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,480
to get help for it

00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,520
there's no shame in reaching out to

00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,120
someone who you think might have a

00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,640
problem it's probably the best thing

00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:39,520
that you can do

00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,600
so i have some additional resources here

00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,720
check out what we've done at

00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:44,960
osmihelp.org we have a lot of guides and

00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,960
stuff

00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:48,240
the the second one is really great it's

00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,200
a thing called mentalhealthfirstaid.org

00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,240
it will not

00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,799
teach you to be a mentor health

00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,240
professional do not expect that it will

00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:55,679
what it will help you do is kind of

00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,880
recognize behaviors and others that

00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:00,080
might make you want to step

00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:03,760
in say something and see what's going on

00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:04,880
um and i i think it's relatively cheap

00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,799
but i think they are doing online

00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:09,120
training right now during cobit

00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:10,240
speak to a therapist can't emphasize

00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,960
that enough everyone should be doing

00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,600
this

00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,159
um also check out the work of dr maureen

00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,480

uh who's linked right there and time

00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,919
magazine also

00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:22,480
has uh an awesome article did recently

00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:23,600
on imposter syndrome itself uh for those

00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,520
of you who are saying well

00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:27,600

00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,240
want to watch

00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,440
a lot of apps where you can talk to a

00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,240
therapist uh

00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:35,279
talkspace is is one of the best overall

00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,520
apps

00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:38,960
for live chat you can use better help

00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,000
better help actually it's like a 30

00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,399
minute session that you sit down and

00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,799
have

00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:43,679
talk space sometimes is asynchronous the

00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:46,799
best for

couples is an app called regain where

00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,200
which are also a couple

00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,799
quick ways to get consultation and maybe

00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,559
get access to a psychiatrist if you feel

00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:16,399
it needs to go that far

00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:18,159
so i'll be happy to publish all of that

00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:21,120
stuff after the talk

00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:22,720
um in case you get a chance to get it so

00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,640
the conversation kicking off this whole

00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,240
talk touched on all of the aspects and

00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,919
ended with

00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,760
so what do i do to get my mojo back this

00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:31,679
is what my friend asked me

00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,679
and again not being a professional i

00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:35,200
suggested seeking out help

00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:37,840
there's resources for people feeling

00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:40,080
less inadequate imposter syndrome begins

00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,360
can begin with internal low self-esteem

00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,399
remember we talked about it might not

00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,760
show outwardly

00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:45,440
but it can quickly spiral into

00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:48,159
depression and anxiety

00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,960
and even neuroticism a talk with a

00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:50,399
psychologist

00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,960
or a group where you can share

00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:54,960
experiences is often beneficial

00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,399
never underestimate your own value or

00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,519
the value that you bring to the people

00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:59,360
around you

00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:00,880
be kind to each other keep an eye out

00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,480
for those of us in trouble

00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,480
and let's take off the imposter mask

00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:07,279
leave all the other masks on

00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,880
covet but take off the imposter mat and

00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:12,840
with that thank you very much and i'm

00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:14,960
happy to take any questions if you have

00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:16,880
them

00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:19,039
uh as you know in case questions come in

00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,720
uh or while questions come in i just

00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:22,559
wanted to say pj thank you

00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:25,519
uh it's a great talk there's actually a

00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:28,559
lot of discussion happening um

00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:29,840
uh during the talk uh that

00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:31,600
i don't know it was actually really

00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:34,640
great uh with the virtual format

00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:36,480
um you know people expressing

00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:38,000
their own experiences and things like

00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,760
that that of course they wouldn't do in

00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,640
the middle of a live talk

00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,600
um so i was i that was awesome um

00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:46,559
exactly

00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:48,799
um but yeah i know yeah i thought i

00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:50,000
thought the most

00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:51,760
i thought the most interesting part of

00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,799
the talk when i was researching it was

00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,080
you know i'm thinking because i've had

00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:54,799
issues with imposter center before

00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:57,600
actually

00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:58,960
fun fact when we first met court uh way

00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,320
back in 2011

00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,720
you were there with that team from

00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:04,240
orchestra and i came in being like one

00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,519
dude who had worked on a few apps and i

00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,200
was like ruby and you guys were like

00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:08,559
hard-coding everything i was like

00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,320
i do not belong talking to those people

00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:12,240
those people are way too cool i'm going

00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:14,000
to stay over here and work and support

00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,760
and so it's not like like it's something

00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,360
that i received so when i saw that list

00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:19,039
of people

00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,640
and and it's like you david tennant

00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:22,159
really i mean like the guy's

00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,000
top of his game he has the hottest

00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:25,919
podcast on spotify

00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,679
he you know he he was doctor who for

00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:29,120
christ's sake and he thought he wasn't

00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:30,880
good enough

00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,399
it's it's it's crazy it's madness but

00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,600
that's that's that's like a lifetime

00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:35,760
achievement award and

00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:38,480
it's like yeah everyone out there is

00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:39,760
chasing it's insane

00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,000
right it's not the right way to look at

00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:43,600
yeah well i saw your comment about she's

00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,960
she's a supreme court justice why would

00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,559
she think she's not good enough it

00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,480
doesn't get any better than that that's

00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:53,840
crazy

00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:53,840
um anyone have questions

00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,679
if you i know this is a tough subject

00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:00,080
and you're more than welcome to dm me

00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:00,880
or uh you know whether here in the

00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,760
conference

00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,480
what joel that's a great question and a

00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:07,039
lot of that

00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:09,200
is is the stem of the problem so joel is

00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:11,200
asking what is good enough who defines

00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,639
good enough and i think that that's

00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,839
that's part of the problem

00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:15,919
especially you know when it comes to

00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:18,399
imposter syndrome at work

00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:19,919
often that's determined by someone who

00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:21,599
may be a paragon in our industry but

00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:22,960
also may have no idea what they're doing

00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:24,879
let's be let's let's just put all the

00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:26,240
card to table sometimes good enough is

00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:27,440
determined by a project manager who

00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:29,119
doesn't know how to code doesn't know

00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,040
how to write a front end or a back-end

00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:32,240
or a database query or anything and

00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,040
they're telling you how it's supposed to

00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:35,760
go

00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,879
so your issue with you know reacting to

00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,399
that is probably gonna be like well what

00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:39,919
is good enough what am i what am i doing

00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:42,480
why are you defining this

00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:44,079
um i think for what your work is is you

00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,200
have to determine that and also continue

00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:46,639
to ask questions like

00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,480
i feel this is good enough but you're

00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:50,399
saying it's not can we discuss why

00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,720
and be open to receiving feedback on

00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:53,599
that i think good enough is a constantly

00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:56,159
moving

00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:57,680
needle um that you have to kind of zero

00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:59,599
in on and eventually hit

00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:01,599
but like what is good enough is going to

00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:04,400
be different for every person every team

00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:04,400
every organization

00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,720
any other questions i want to remind so

00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,000
you can uh if you want to ask a question

00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:14,400
directly you can just click the

00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,079
request to share audio video link in the

00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,560
upper right and i'll get you to

00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:18,560
load it up

00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,839
um i'm gonna i'd just like to respond to

00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:28,960
grant your

00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:30,800
grant sally you're absolutely 100 right

00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,480
um this is an issue that we've talked

00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,680
about a lot at osmi especially with a

00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,079
lot of people saying like

00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:37,200
oh i'm so ocd i have to put my shoes on

00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:38,079
before i step out the door it's like

00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,640
that's not

00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:42,079
it's not ocd that's not how that works

00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,839
um it seems

00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:45,599
you can feel sad and not suffer from

00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:46,960
depression you can feel anxious and not

00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:50,400
have anxiety

00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:51,040
um if it you know it's kind of i also

00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,480
argue

00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,000
if you're an extrovert you probably

00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,599
don't have a twitter account like if

00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,680
you're saying i'm a pure extrovert

00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:59,040
on twitter and also saying hashtag fb so

00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,160
it goes to your facebook and maybe

00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,760
there's a picture that still gets picked

00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:04,400
up on instagram

00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:06,240
you're not really an introvert that's i

00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:08,320
mean i think i switched those too but

00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:10,000
but i think you get my point a lot a lot

00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,560
of times we use these labels and they're

00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,160
not

00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:15,839
appropriate so yeah ocd is like you know

00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,599
having to turn a light on 19 times

00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:18,640
exactly 19 times every time before you

00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:20,079
leave a room

00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,680
you cannot leave the room if you don't

00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:23,280
do it um so

00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:25,839
yeah it's not just being a neat freak or

00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:27,920
making sure your room is picked up

00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:29,680
even if you think that's enough if you

00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,119
feel your ocd because you have to be

00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,320
clean constantly

00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:35,200
see a therapist because there's probably

00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,200
something you need to look into

00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:39,280
um christopher i also agree with you

00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,320
acknowledging each other is super

00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,640
important

00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,240
um we talk a lot about things like

00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,440
diversity and tech but we talk

00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,440
you we're generally talking about you

00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,440
know skin color and culture

00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,640
but neurodiversity is also super

00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,920
important

00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,760
there's lots of people you know who fall

00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,079
in the autism spectrum or have mental

00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,400
health

00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:57,920
issues and they're not you know they're

00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,119
not treated the same way that other

00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,480
people are

00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:01,599
we have to acknowledge these people

00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,280
exist we have to acknowledge these

00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:04,240
people are part of our group part of the

00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,000
community

00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:09,839
and learn more about them and figure out

00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,839
how to help

00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,599
uh i had a question about the links i

00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,359
will definitely be tweeting out the

00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:19,760
links but i will also

00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:21,200
um and of course is there a way to like

00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,119
post like a bulletin board or something

00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:26,240
like that

00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:29,599
i honestly don't know uh

00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:32,079
i'll get back so i know

00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:33,520
all the chat we do identify all the chat

00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:34,240
that exists for all the sessions and

00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:37,040
everything

00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:38,240
gets recorded as well so um it's it's

00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,079
not

00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:41,920
okay yeah it's super nice and that like

00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:43,839
it's not like you could watch the chat

00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,960
side by side with the video or anything

00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:47,440
like that but

00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:49,040
um we're gonna make the recordings uh

00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,160
available so i don't see any reason why

00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,680
we wouldn't make

00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,280
that the chat available so if you just

00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,240
want to post in chat that's where these

00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,720
people will be able to track it down

00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,720
there as well

00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:01,359
yeah and i'd like to thank elise for

00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:04,000
answering kevin before i did yeah my

00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:05,520
my twitter handle is esplenic because uh

00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,520
as for those of you who are at lunch we

00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,560
were discussing bicycles when i was 19 i

00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,920
lost my spleen

00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,920
and it just happens to be that no one

00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,680
ever takes a medical condition as a

00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,200
username so that's my twitter handle

00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:17,680
if you'd like to connect with me on xbox

00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:19,920
that's my xbox steam

00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:22,160
irc pretty much anywhere in the world

00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:24,800
look up at splenic there's a 99 chance

00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,800
it's going to be me

00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:28,480
but that's a whole other talk

00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,520
do you feel imposter syndrome is

00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,000
something more commonly reported or

00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:36,000
talked about

00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,680
in tech uh i do feel like

00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,520
and this could be my personal bias

00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,800
because you know i work with the folks

00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,880
at osmi

00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,880
i do feel like we tend to notice it more

00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:47,920
in tech or that we're at least more

00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:49,839
overt about it but i

00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,599
also think we're catching people who are

00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:54,720
falling through the cracks

00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:57,119
um i i've always felt that

00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,800
mental health issues in general we tend

00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:01,839
to be pretty strong in

00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:03,520
there's a reason why we came to tech and

00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:05,200
most of it is because we have some sort

00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,640
of neurodiversity we don't quite match

00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,480
up with the average

00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,839
you know the average thinker the average

00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:13,040
mind or whatever

00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:15,040
for good or for bad but i think that

00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,920
yeah posture syndrome attack is a huge

00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,440
thing

00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,839
uh also because we've gone through the

00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:21,920
past 15 years or so beating our chest

00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:23,599
and talking about how awesome tech is

00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,960
and you know to the point of like you

00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:28,000
know

00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:30,480
framework wars and vim versus emacs

00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,720
and you know oh you're coding on a mac

00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,440
disgusting oh i'd never buy a windows

00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:36,800
machine

00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:38,960
and all of this flag waving

00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,160
just contributes to imposter syndrome

00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:43,760
and others

00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:45,200
um you know to the it i i remember

00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,880
i remember the first conference i ever

00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,400
went to the first open source conference

00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:51,280
kevin you're not helping

00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:52,640
um i remember the first open source

00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,440
conference i ever went to and i went and

00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,280
i had a dell

00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:57,440
laptop because i had just finished i was

00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:00,640
a visual fox pro programmer sorry

00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:02,320
it's true it happens um don't do it and

00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:04,160
i was moving to ruby so i went to

00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,760
a ruby conference and i'm like looking

00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,480
around and i'm opening up my laptop with

00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,800
the big

00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,000
very cringy yeah because that's what the

00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,359
dell sound like back those

00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,800
then when you open them and everyone

00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:13,440
else has opened up their sweet macbooks

00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,960
with a

00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:17,920
brushed chrome and i'm like wait a

00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:20,400
minute do i belong here

00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:22,000
and i actually had someone tell me like

00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,520
can you even run ruby on that and i was

00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,200
like okay i'm just gonna leave

00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,720
i'm just gonna leave i feel like it's

00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:30,000
probably the best thing for me to do

00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:33,119
but all that's crap it's all

00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,800
bravado it's all garbage um but i do

00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:36,560
think that does contribute to answers

00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,160
i do think it contributes to causing

00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:40,640
more imposter syndrome intact

00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:42,000
which could be why we see it so often um

00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,760
but i also feel like

00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,359
part of the reason we think it's more

00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,960
intense because we also

00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:48,720
are a little bit more open about that i

00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:50,000
think people are willing to say i have

00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,280
imposter syndrome

00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,000
more often than people are willing to

00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:55,839
say i have bipolar disorder

00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,920
um but it's still a mental health issue

00:40:55,839 --> 00:41:00,640
it's just like you can take the

00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:02,400
the easy one the lower one and be like

00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,760
okay so i won't deal with the real issue

00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,040
that's going on i won't admit to that

00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:08,400
but i'll say i have imposter syndrome

00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:08,400
and that might cover for a few things

00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:15,040
absolutely court absolutely i think

00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,119
anywhere where

00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,319
you know your brain powers what you're

00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:21,440
meant to succeed with

00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:23,440
is this is going to be an issue um

00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:25,280
i've actually i mean i think i'm glad

00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,480
that we talk about it at least i've seen

00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,920
other industries like you know i have

00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:30,240
lots of friends who work elsewhere

00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:31,280
where it's not like sales is actually a

00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,960
huge deal

00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,720
because everything they do is modern

00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,079
everything has very specific and very

00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:37,680
minut metrics

00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:39,440
so a lot of times they do not feel like

00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:42,319
they're achieving anything

00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:44,000
um so imposter syndrome is huge there uh

00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:45,760
also with first responders

00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,880
like i i couldn't imagine meeting a

00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,200
doctor that thought they weren't good

00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,720
enough

00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:51,040
i'm glad they generally don't share that

00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:53,920
with me because that would be terrifying

00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:55,280
um but in general yeah like i mean i

00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:58,000
think imposter syndrome

00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:59,359
it affects experts say about seventy

00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,839
percent of people

00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:03,839
so at one point in time or another

00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:09,680
grant exactly and then they asked you to

00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:11,359
fix their vcr

00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,880
oh wait that's an old person thing then

00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:14,480
they asked you to fix their

00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,920
the biggest thing i had when courtney

00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,640
used to work together at a cloud

00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,319
platform

00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,440
company and people would say two things

00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:20,319
first they if they saw me wearing the

00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,680
sweatshirt they'd say

00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:23,760
you work with trains and i would say no

00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,960
it's just called engineer um

00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,000
and then they'd say so what do you do

00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,680
and say oh i work in the cloud they'll

00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,720
be like oh my god can you fix my icloud

00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:31,200
for me

00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:32,800
i'd be like no i don't work at apple

00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,960
they're like but i cloud i'm like

00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,880
yeah what your pictures are i can't get

00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,079
my pictures okay yeah i i can't help you

00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:41,040
i don't work there

00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:42,240
um but yeah it's interesting like i

00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,040
think sometimes that feeds in the

00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,640
impossible

00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:47,040
but i should know all of the clouds

00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:48,880
shouldn't i if i'm a cloud expert i

00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:51,680
should know every cloud

00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:52,160
um but yeah there are you know what

00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,599
kevin

00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:55,359
you're right there are also physical

00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:56,800
side effects of imposter syndrome

00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:58,960
sometimes it can lead to things like

00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:00,400
weight gain or you know other other kind

00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,720
of issues and

00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:04,240
and uh i mean just like any mental

00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:05,520
health issue it can contribute to a lot

00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:07,200
of health factors

00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:08,480
physical health factors that are really

00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:13,839
really negative and really really

00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:13,839
dangerous sometimes

00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:22,640
aaron aldridge ladies and gentlemen

00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,640
knowing more about clouds than anyone

00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:30,480
else

00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:31,520
i i hope it does you know it's it's

00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,960
interesting

00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:34,720
christopher that you bring up or return

00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,319
the office you know employees

00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:38,240
hired during quarantine it's gonna bring

00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:40,480
new folks yeah i can't imagine

00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:41,280
how people are to react having been

00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:44,079
hired mid

00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:45,520
mid pandemic and then possibly having to

00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:47,520
go back into an office with people who

00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:50,319
are essentially strangers

00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:51,760
um but you've also worked together for

00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:54,720
the last six months

00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:55,440
like that's going to be kind of crazy

00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,720
can people

00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:59,040
can i still work around people the same

00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,920
way i that it's a question we're all

00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,280
going to have to answer

00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:03,040
actually i'm not going to answer it i'm

00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:04,800
going to stay home i've been working

00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:06,560
remote for like 13 years now i don't

00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:09,040
think i can go back into an office

00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:11,359
i'm not capable no one wants to be there

00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:11,359
anyway

00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:17,520
all right uh i think we're about good on

00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:19,760
time here so

00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:21,680

00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,640
to reach out to him via dm or something

00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:25,839
