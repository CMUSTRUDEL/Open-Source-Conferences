okay thank you everybody for coming max

00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:12,830
from IBM and today I have the great

00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:15,389
privilege really to present with Maria

00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:17,190
and let me start by saying first thing

00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:19,350
is that everybody here if you're coming

00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:22,650
to hopefully learn something about Bosch

00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:24,869
you know a little bit about Bosch I'm

00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:27,660
looking for Dmitri I can't see him but

00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:30,269
anyway that's okay he is the brain of

00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,679
Bosch we all know that but the heart and

00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:35,700
soul is Maria

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:37,649
believe me so I'm here in good hands and

00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:40,649
hopefully you'll learn a lot from what

00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:42,899
we have to talk about so we're going to

00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:44,550
talk about washing it so it's gonna be

00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:47,510
kind of a back and forth a pair

00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:50,239
presentation with my colleague Maria and

00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:52,500
we'll get started there is a live demo

00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,219
hopefully everything works we pray to

00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,710
the gods

00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:58,530
so should be okay but we'll see where it

00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:01,800
goes so first is what is Bosch I mean

00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:03,449
it's it's a it's a easy question in some

00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,869
ways to answer but also very difficult

00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:09,450
but the important thing I think is it

00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:11,850
you know especially Bosch in it is

00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:14,270
listed here so you think of Bosch as a

00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:16,590
agnostic tool for deploying

00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:19,500
infrastructure and in deploying large

00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:22,140
systems Bosch unit is the bootstrapping

00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,990
of that so Bosch in it is that first vm

00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:27,829
how do you get that first vm started so

00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:30,119
that you can do the subsequent

00:01:27,829 --> 00:01:31,380
deployments that you need the other

00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:34,259
important thing is that as you know

00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:36,630
Bosch is agnostic so you could do you

00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:38,759
could use Bosch to deploy not only CF

00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:40,979
but also Concord CI which a lot of

00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:46,439
people have discussed and any other kind

00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:48,659
of large scale cloud you know projects

00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,810
or systems so this is the important

00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:52,350
thing

00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:54,990
so Bosch in it is new and this is gonna

00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:59,009
be pretty much the purpose in the the

00:01:54,990 --> 00:02:01,049
topic of this talk today so as we

00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:03,420
mentioned there is a demo and Maria is

00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:06,149
gonna start it because it takes about

00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:06,869
five to ten minutes so hopefully get

00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:09,550
started

00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:12,670
all right so let's get down to business

00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:15,879
and start out down one so we're gonna

00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:19,390
use what you need to deploy our initial

00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:23,319
director VM to AWS infrastructure so

00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:26,230
we're gonna run push in it deploy

00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:29,650
command and we're gonna pass in the

00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:32,620
manifest file so notice that the only

00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:36,459
input that it takes is a manifest file

00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:39,730
so what you need is a CLI tool it's

00:02:36,459 --> 00:02:43,420
using cloud provider interface so cloud

00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:46,319
provider interface which is CPI is the

00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:49,810
software that implements Pacific API

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:53,980
that can manage resources in certain

00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:57,579
infrastructure so CPI is packaged as a

00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:59,799
release and first thing that Washington

00:02:57,579 --> 00:03:04,000
is doing is installing the CPI locally

00:02:59,799 --> 00:03:07,569
and then it's using the CPI to create

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,810
resources in infrastructure after VM and

00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:13,930
disks are created it configures those

00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:16,389
VMs as specified in deployment manifest

00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:18,400
so we're gonna take a look at the point

00:03:16,389 --> 00:03:24,910
manifest a little bit later in more

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:27,459
detail but let's take a look what are

00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:29,350
the main components of washing it so

00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:33,150
stem cell release and deployment

00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:36,450
manifest are three main components of

00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:40,540
boss that is used to uniquely identify

00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:45,760
any deployment stem cell is an operating

00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:48,940
system image it's used by Bosch to

00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:53,319
create LeAnn's from and release is a

00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:55,630
software that defines what services are

00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:59,950
gonna run on that VM and what

00:03:55,630 --> 00:04:03,880
dependencies they need deploy manifest

00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:08,560
is a configuration file so let's take a

00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:13,690
look at the point manifest so if it's a

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:17,040
ya know file and we've questioned it we

00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:21,830
try to be consistent with

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:25,830
for month let's watch director is using

00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:28,230
to manage any other deployments so it's

00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:32,580
using the same manifest format as both

00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:36,660
director and it has similar VM in this

00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:41,460
life cycle and also it specifies stem

00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:43,440
cells in easier way so let's take a look

00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:55,260
at our deployment manifest that we use

00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:58,560
to run our demo so there are several

00:04:55,260 --> 00:05:01,200
paths in deploy manifest and first you

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,820
can see there are releases which is

00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:07,410
software that we're gonna install on a

00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:10,140
VM and you can see that we're gonna

00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:15,440
install Bosch director and we're gonna

00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:19,410
install UA UA is user identification

00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:22,380
service and we're gonna use it to manage

00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:25,440
our authentication to watch and since we

00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:28,830
to point to AWS we're gonna also use a

00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:32,130
double CPI realism next we have resource

00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:35,940
post section that defines what type of

00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:40,290
VM we can deploy and the stem cell that

00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:43,620
we're gonna use to create our VM from so

00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:46,950
next sections networks dispose and jobs

00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:53,160
are all stay consistent with both

00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:57,810
director the last bit is cloud provider

00:05:53,160 --> 00:06:02,130
section so this one is unique to Bosch

00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:04,230
in it and it basically defines some

00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:11,520
properties that are going to be used to

00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:14,430
bootstrap our VM so yeah let's talk more

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:19,410
about the history and why we decided to

00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:22,410
rewrite existing tool so we used to have

00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:25,530
Bosch microsil I plugin which was a gem

00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:29,370
that was installed along with the boss

00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:30,350
real life and it was used to create that

00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:34,760
initial

00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:36,860
director VM and we call it micro boss so

00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:40,730
that tool worked well but it came with

00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:43,790
certain limitations and Max here

00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:47,660
experienced those limitations so he can

00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:50,960
tell us more about them Thank You Maria

00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:54,200
so let me be clear I work for IBM and

00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:56,210
large company and when I say when Maria

00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:58,160
said I experienced the limitation really

00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:00,470
by proxy so there are people here

00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,240
actually Ben and Jimmy was sitting in

00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:03,680
the room that actually experienced this

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,750
every day because these guys are running

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,400
bluemix and of course maybe maybe many

00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:10,010
of you have experienced similar metal

00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:12,770
imitations so I think part of the

00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:14,840
biggest problem that we had and this

00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:16,790
came about like last year discussing

00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:20,270
with Demetri and Maria and worse people

00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:22,820
is that bluemix for instance had to fork

00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:25,340
bah-bah SH because we have our own cloud

00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:27,830
call software and of course we use other

00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:30,380
clouds like open sac but we needed to

00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:32,030
include a CPI for that and of course you

00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:34,700
know that cloud maybe other people don't

00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:36,770
care so we had to fork it well once you

00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:38,930
fork that means that you now have to

00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:41,360
manage an external piece of code that

00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:43,310
you know is evolving and of course Bosch

00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,890
is evolving so how do you keep it merged

00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:48,560
so it's a real pain and you know we're

00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:51,260
so how do you kind of deals with deal

00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,210
with that embossing it one of the big

00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:56,330
thing that we did is we externalize the

00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:57,920
CPRS so now you no longer as we if you

00:07:56,330 --> 00:08:00,380
remember when Maria was showing you the

00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:03,440
manifest there is a section where you

00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:05,570
can specify the CPI that CPI exists as a

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,220
binary it's a completely different piece

00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:09,020
of code it can be and it can be written

00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:10,310
in whatever language you want as well so

00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:12,050
you're gonna see a little bit more of

00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:14,020
that so it makes it a little bit better

00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:16,940
for development testing and so on

00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:19,100
another part was that before you

00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:21,680
couldn't really combine different

00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,360
releases and as you saw if you remember

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,000
from the demo

00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:28,190
Maria is demoed the manifest included

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,320
not only the boss director but also UA

00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:32,660
which is a component of cloud foundry

00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:34,180
and you a can be useful for things

00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:37,789
because this is where you'll have

00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:40,280
essentially the users for your boss

00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:41,360
director so by combining those two

00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:43,310
releases and of course you could have

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,190
auto releases so if you wanted to add

00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:45,960
Concord

00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:49,830
to the back to the mix you could also do

00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:52,530
that another important one was that the

00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:55,410
installation was difficult because the

00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:57,840
boss director is written in ruby and of

00:08:55,410 --> 00:09:02,100
course the CPI code was embedded as part

00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:05,490
of it you now had essentially have to

00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:07,650
install Ruby into your you know wherever

00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:10,650
you wanted to use Bosch and the CLI as

00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:12,630
well so it made it made things very

00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:15,510
difficult everything it was written in

00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:17,700
Ruby which is great to some extent but

00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:20,250
also difficult because of the fact of

00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:22,140
the pollution of the gems for instance

00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:25,590
and certainly startup time is not as

00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:28,500
good as what we have now we think it's

00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:32,640
all fixed because in some ways washing

00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:33,780
it is a rewrite but is it not fully but

00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:37,170
almost there

00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:40,590
right so one thing we want to talk about

00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:43,970
specifically is that the CP is for

00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:49,500
instance at IBM we are rewriting our CPI

00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:51,690
in n go for the software now there are

00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:54,390
other CPI so we've externalized the

00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:57,780
different CP is that makes it basically

00:09:54,390 --> 00:10:00,840
a better separation of concerns so the

00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:04,310
the CPI is versus the director now even

00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:06,630
if you write your CPI in Ruby your ruby

00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:09,180
environment for your CPI can be very

00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:09,960
different than your director environment

00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,760
for your CPI

00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,290
those are very specific things that

00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,630
we've experienced pain that we've

00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:21,510
experienced that we've now essentially

00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:25,710
solved another part of this is the

00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:27,450
leaner stem cells yeah you're gonna have

00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:29,930
to keep your head down because yeah

00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:29,930
thank you

00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:37,990
yes so because we watching you can take

00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:42,010
arbitrary number of releases and install

00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:45,790
them on initial VM that means that we no

00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:47,710
longer need to include CPI release and

00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:52,030
water ease into the stem cell

00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:55,540
so before we included those releases

00:10:52,030 --> 00:11:00,040
solely for the purpose of deploying that

00:10:55,540 --> 00:11:01,960
initial boss director VM so now this can

00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:06,160
be removed that makes our stem cells

00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:08,950
lighter and we can independently update

00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:13,380
those stem cells whenever there is

00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:16,180
operating system update required and

00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:22,600
update what should isn't apparently when

00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:25,150
there is new like director changes so we

00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:27,400
have now releases that we can style

00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:30,880
several releases so you could see in a

00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:33,760
download that we specified wash and

00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:36,490
reinstall it alongside with you a so

00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,560
because we can install several several

00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:41,770
releases we can like exchange the

00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:44,620
features of existing releases by

00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:48,730
integrating them with some other

00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:51,040
releases on on that initial vm so that

00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:56,670
wasn't possible before for that initial

00:11:51,040 --> 00:12:01,120
iam also it opens your for installing

00:11:56,670 --> 00:12:06,100
multiple CV eyes or not vm and we no

00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:12,010
longer tied to CPI that our first vm is

00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:15,520
created on so we can use any CPI and we

00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:22,090
can now create VMs with specific purpose

00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:25,060
like for example John box if if you want

00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:28,090
to deploy a vm that doesn't need bush

00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:31,000
director maintains but at the same time

00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:33,840
you want to utilize bush features like

00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:37,420
deploy manifest in dependency management

00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:39,940
then you can use bush in it tool to

00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:44,950
deploy a TM

00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:47,380
so we are you wrote our washing it CLI

00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:50,230
and go and that gives us several

00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:52,540
adventures so now is distributed a

00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:56,650
standalone binary it's very easy to

00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:59,290
install it compared to like previous to

00:12:56,650 --> 00:13:01,750
watch microsil I plugin which was a gem

00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:05,110
you had to like resolve all these gem

00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:08,560
conflicts so now you just download it

00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:10,420
put it in your path and run it and it's

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:14,440
faster to startup it feels more

00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:16,810
responsive and as always with free

00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:21,460
writing it allows to address some

00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:24,130
technical debt there also were made some

00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:27,730
more improvements it's more item point

00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:30,070
it has more consistent UI and there is a

00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:34,290
cleaner separation of deployment

00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:38,440
workflow and infrastructure management

00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:41,050
so yeah my max has had experience

00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:42,460
developing CPI for software so he can

00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:47,340
talk more about it sure thank you Mary

00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:49,930
so of course you know rewriting the CPI

00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:54,730
was also happening at the same time as

00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:57,240
some of those Bosch in it you know one

00:13:54,730 --> 00:14:00,400
of the best programmer I know Dmitri

00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:02,290
actually would like a warden CPI which

00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:06,730
you can also use or you look at that and

00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:08,710
essentially pattern a new CPI after this

00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:10,870
which you could it's all open source so

00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:13,360
you can also look at that and I think

00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:18,220
the important thing to remember is this

00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:21,340
polling picture you can think of this as

00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:24,040
a washing director shelling out and

00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:26,710
talking to the CPI and what what's

00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:29,530
happening it's actually calling to this

00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:32,530
binary so this entire part of the CPI

00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:34,420
address I'll explain it later is the CPI

00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:36,910
so it's a binary and the director just

00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:38,800
talked to it and back and forth shelling

00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:40,810
out so that's pretty much what you now

00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:44,380
have and it can you know it has to be on

00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:46,480
the same you know vm but that's kind of

00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:48,340
what happens now to implement your CPI

00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,730
you really just have to implement the

00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:50,470
method

00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:53,079
of course it's it's more complicated

00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:55,089
than that naturally each one of those

00:14:53,079 --> 00:14:56,980
methods have parameters and they return

00:14:55,089 --> 00:14:58,630
some values but pretty much that's all

00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:00,130
you have two internet and actually you

00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:03,100
don't have to implement all of them

00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:04,209
you really have to implement a subset of

00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,850
these essential ones

00:15:04,209 --> 00:15:09,459
so pretty much creates themselves delete

00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:11,440
stem cells create vm d DB m has vm and

00:15:09,459 --> 00:15:13,810
so on so once you implement those you

00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,370
can actually start using your CPI and of

00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:17,500
course as you need more features you'll

00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:20,170
have to implement more of it that's

00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:22,269
pretty much what the new idea so I think

00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:24,040
you know we're encouraging people to to

00:15:22,269 --> 00:15:25,750
get to this so oh yeah it's going to

00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:29,260
talk about some of the CIO did that we

00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:31,779
did also right so because we separated

00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:35,980
our CP is we can now independently

00:15:31,779 --> 00:15:38,199
manage and maintain and produce CPI

00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:41,050
release version was released version and

00:15:38,199 --> 00:15:44,139
stem cells so that allows us to speed

00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:48,760
our one PGI pipeline into several

00:15:44,139 --> 00:15:51,130
pipelines and we use Concours so we

00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:53,709
start switching to that and Concours

00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:57,279
actually can be deployed with pushing it

00:15:53,709 --> 00:16:00,519
and we are planning to generalize that

00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:05,110
CI pipeline that we used to test our CPI

00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:12,010
s-- and CPI developers can use it to to

00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:14,649
run tests against area CPI so of course

00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:17,199
I think part of what we're trying to do

00:16:14,649 --> 00:16:19,980
here is to encourage more write more

00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:22,750
collaboration more companies joining and

00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:24,399
we can't really speak for Microsoft and

00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:26,350
Google but we know that they've been

00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,420
experimenting with it certainly at IBM

00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:31,600
we have multiple CPI's and you're gonna

00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:33,579
see those coming I've got a team from

00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,980
China here that we're gonna be working

00:16:33,579 --> 00:16:37,510
on planning for releasing some of this

00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:40,600
so we're gonna be adopting this whole

00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:43,680
Bosch in it very soon hopefully a

00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:47,930
thousand more will bloom too so

00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:53,279
we have to go back to the demo oh yeah

00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:56,459
people love us so here we deployed in

00:16:53,279 --> 00:17:00,149
youtubers react OPM so you can see that

00:16:56,459 --> 00:17:03,509
first we install CPI locally then we use

00:17:00,149 --> 00:17:06,209
that CPI to create our resources in the

00:17:03,509 --> 00:17:08,760
infrastructure so we created VM we

00:17:06,209 --> 00:17:12,689
created disks and we installed all

00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:16,289
required dependencies and we started our

00:17:12,689 --> 00:17:19,679
service which is both director and we

00:17:16,289 --> 00:17:23,039
put it alongside with you eh so now we

00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:26,390
can use ua to login into directors so

00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:31,049
let's do that so we have you a

00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:34,580
configuration that we can use so here's

00:17:31,049 --> 00:17:34,580
the user let's use it

00:17:42,289 --> 00:17:50,250
so our URI is configured with custom

00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:59,399
certificates so I need to pass in my SSL

00:17:50,250 --> 00:18:01,789
cert alright so these are the problems

00:17:59,399 --> 00:18:01,789
from UA

00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:13,990
and here yeah cool yeah so what you're

00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:15,790
seeing here is not only the new VM being

00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:18,460
deployed the different releases

00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:20,170
including u18 deployed using the UA now

00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:22,720
to login so if you know anything about

00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:24,400
Bosch this should be kind of I don't say

00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,110
mind-blowing but should be interesting

00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,790
to you

00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:35,370
alright I have one person thing is mind

00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:38,910
blowing thank you okay so to finish up

00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:43,000
what's next right I mean in many ways

00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:44,230
Dimitri has set up Bosch IO if you don't

00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,910
know anything about a Bosch I know

00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:48,670
you're interested in Bosch you or

00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:51,610
yourself just go to it just check it out

00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:53,200
it's Bosch that I all right certainly

00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:56,530
send us feedback if you're trying

00:18:53,200 --> 00:19:00,610
washing it we want to hear from you

00:18:56,530 --> 00:19:03,300
email Dmitri so right there don't spam

00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:06,220
him but feel free to spam it and then

00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:08,020
he'll respond and then I think the other

00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:10,420
thing is the the boot started the whole

00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:12,900
team started Bosch notes which is where

00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:16,540
a lot of the ideas of what's coming up

00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:20,020
you know is being discussed so feel free

00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:21,940
to go there the one thing we mentioned

00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:24,790
besides thanking you is this important

00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:26,520
one so again I'm I be M I'm working with

00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:29,470
pivotal I spend a lot of time with them

00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:32,740
and what you should know is a lot of

00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:34,870
this doesn't start without a team so a

00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:36,310
lot of them are in the back of course I

00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:38,440
mentioned Dmitri multiple time but

00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:41,740
there's Chris also who did a lot of the

00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:44,770
work on this you know fun unfortunately

00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:48,460
left pivotal but he's been instrumental

00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:51,220
to this and then we have my fabulous

00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:53,350
mate impersonator call who also did

00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:54,880
quite a bit of the work on this so in

00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:57,340
many ways I'm sitting in front of you

00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,580
but we owe it to them so thank you for

00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:59,580
your time

00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:17,480
and I think we have some time for

00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:20,660
questions so okay yes so the question is

00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:22,580
are there plans to rewrite yeah this is

00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:29,260
this yeah like what I guess the question

00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:29,260
- I'll watch manager yeah after this

00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:45,860
other questions we have a little bit of

00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:49,190
time yes so we completely delegating to

00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:52,760
ouray our authentication mechanism so

00:20:49,190 --> 00:21:01,060
whatever you a gives you you can you use

00:20:52,760 --> 00:21:01,060
it you answer your question

00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:15,700
[Music]

00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:26,780
okay any other questions

00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:56,840
well actually a cloud funny CF releases

00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:59,210
using you a so we had to extract you a

00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:02,809
in two separate series to go to

00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:04,879
integrated with Bosch remember it can be

00:22:02,809 --> 00:22:07,249
any reduce right so like for instance

00:22:04,879 --> 00:22:09,200
concours or any other project like Greg

00:22:07,249 --> 00:22:11,809
Boris you know other guys there's a

00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:14,049
release for that product you can you can

00:22:11,809 --> 00:22:14,049
add it

00:22:35,289 --> 00:22:40,460
okay so repeating the question is can

00:22:38,509 --> 00:22:43,250
you use washing it to kind of increase

00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:44,720
the h AO of the director i think we've

00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:46,880
discussed a lot of things i don't think

00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,950
that's the design at this point but

00:22:46,880 --> 00:23:11,690
certainly we'd love to hear you know if

00:22:48,950 --> 00:23:15,440
you try it you know so yeah we we

00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:18,200
support all manifest for months so if

00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:20,899
you deployed your initial director of a

00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:25,700
of micro brush tool we're going to

00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:29,139
convert that state deployment state into

00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:31,940
new format for you if you use this tool

00:23:29,139 --> 00:23:33,649
there is a path yes to migration

00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:36,889
basically which is what you're asking

00:23:33,649 --> 00:23:38,389
yes no it's true I mean I'm gonna spend

00:23:36,889 --> 00:23:40,549
all Wednesday with Ben and Jimmy

00:23:38,389 --> 00:23:44,240
discussing what is the path for bluemix

00:23:40,549 --> 00:23:46,659
to migrate to this yes we're trying no

00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:50,779
it's there it's actually implemented so

00:23:46,659 --> 00:23:54,590
we we save the state of your micro brush

00:23:50,779 --> 00:23:59,330
VM in in a specific file it's like

00:23:54,590 --> 00:24:02,629
deployment llamo and if you put your

00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:04,879
manifest in the same folder for Bush for

00:24:02,629 --> 00:24:08,210
botching it where this file is we're

00:24:04,879 --> 00:24:13,429
gonna find it and convert it into new

00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:15,909
format that watching it understands you

00:24:13,429 --> 00:24:15,909
one last question

00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:33,890
yeahthere's environment variable you can

00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:37,100
use to turn onto bagging logs and see

00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:39,000
more information

00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:41,760
