good morning my name is antonio melo I'm

00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:06,359
with Humana I lead the digital

00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:09,660
experience center there and we'll learn

00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:12,000
more about that in moments to come I'm

00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,950
Jason McKee I'm a senior software

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,590
engineer at the digital experience

00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:19,410
center and so today we kind of want to

00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:22,880
speak broadly about the consumerization

00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:27,330
of health care and Humana's role in

00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:29,640
leading in that space I will also tell

00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,289
the story of how the agile

00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,860
transformation that the company is

00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:38,399
undergoing is really empowering that and

00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:45,030
some mission-critical objectives before

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:46,950
the company today so to really begin

00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:50,100
this story let's consider the past

00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:53,610
rooted in delivering customer

00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:55,410
experiences like you've heard in some of

00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:58,739
the talks related to agile

00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:04,939
transformation yesterday we come from a

00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:07,950
Big Bang culture and this Waterfall

00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:13,590
culture that's really rooted in decades

00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:15,930
of success was great for us up until

00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:19,380
recently and what we've discovered is

00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:22,229
that a financial cycle that happens once

00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:25,560
a year where our leadership tries to

00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:28,860
predict the future in many regards that

00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,600
is the onset of delivering not really

00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:32,820
products we've thought of them

00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:36,540
traditionally as projects or technical

00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:39,810
capabilities in isolation without really

00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:42,030
a notion of user validation or this idea

00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:46,500
of what value are delivering to the user

00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:48,720
so in the absence of this we've realized

00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:52,290
that they're really leading the 21st

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:56,579
century we have to change and so what

00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:59,119
we've noticed health care is on fire if

00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:01,590
you played NBA Jam you get it anyway

00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,240
what we're seeing is that in what you're

00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:06,540
probably noticing is there's interest

00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:08,610
from many different segments in health

00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,899
care specifically the Affordable Care

00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:11,560
Act the government is getting

00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:13,690
increasingly involved in health care

00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,849
Healthcare gov and the kind of rocky

00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:17,400
launch and then the subsequent agile

00:02:15,849 --> 00:02:19,989
transformation that they went through

00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,920
and then you see obviously in the new

00:02:19,989 --> 00:02:24,130
startup space

00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:26,349
there's tons of investment being made by

00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:29,110
existing venture capital firms as well

00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:32,860
as brand new healthcare startup

00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:37,150
accelerators and then you still have the

00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:40,780
existing longtime players like Humana so

00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:44,739
given that domain Humana is in the midst

00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:46,840
of another transformation and and

00:02:44,739 --> 00:02:48,489
reinvention or transformation has been

00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,650
part of the DNA the company in its

00:02:48,489 --> 00:02:53,799
50-plus year history we started in

00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:57,640
nursing homes evolved to hospitals

00:02:53,799 --> 00:03:00,310
evolved to b2b commercial health

00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:03,489
insurance and now we're in the midst of

00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:05,620
a transition to being a health care

00:03:03,489 --> 00:03:07,599
company focused on health focused on

00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:10,180
well-being and we'd like to quickly

00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:14,080
share a video that we think encapsulate

00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:16,390
the spirit of that there's a gap out

00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,480
there that's keeping you from the health

00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:20,940
care you deserve at Humana we believe

00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:23,670
the gap will close

00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:26,280
if health care changes if it becomes

00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:29,310
simpler if frustration and paperwork

00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:32,730
decrease if grandparents get to live at

00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:35,490
home instead of in a home so let's do it

00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:38,310
let's simplify health care let's close

00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:43,920
the gap between people and

00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:45,660
join us at close the gap c'mon accom so

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,000
when you think about putting people at

00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:49,860
the core of your business and you think

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:55,950
about the simplification of health care

00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:57,870
the reduction of reliance on paper we've

00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:00,680
had to dramatically change and the

00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:04,200
digital experience Center which is a

00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:06,480
lean agile product development practice

00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:11,010
that we've stood up in partnership with

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:15,500
pivotal labs really is a vehicle for

00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:19,790
cultural transformation we've realized

00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:23,580
accelerated delivery and agile tool set

00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:26,700
collaboration and an organization that

00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:29,850
that albeit small and local really flies

00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:32,640
in the face of our matrix org and

00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:37,020
traditional Big Bang approach to product

00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:40,139
otherwise so the first product that we

00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:43,050
ever developed in this new lean agile

00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:44,850
way for us was in partnership with

00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:49,020
pivotal labs and it's called Humana

00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:50,640
vitality so Humana vitality is a what we

00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:53,130
refer to as a comprehensive health and

00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:55,320
wellness rewards program basically you

00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:56,789
do healthy things you get points you can

00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:00,390
redeem those points for things you like

00:04:56,789 --> 00:05:02,700
so when we launched this you know it was

00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:05,520
really focused on the consumer but when

00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:08,789
we did it it was launched in July 1st of

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:11,130
2011 with a website only and it was

00:05:08,789 --> 00:05:13,200
non-responsive so we're telling people

00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:15,570
to get out and be healthy but they have

00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,130
to get down and sit down in front of

00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:19,350
what we lovingly refer to as Grandma's

00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:20,940
web where you're sitting down in front

00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:23,550
of your desktop computer or your laptop

00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:27,300
computer and you're you're being healthy

00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:29,669
somehow in front of your computer so one

00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:32,039
of the goals that we had for this was to

00:05:29,669 --> 00:05:33,990
increase engagement because of using

00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:36,870
that existing web experience our

00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:40,050
engagement rate was at 3% of eligible

00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:41,669
members and so the goal was to really

00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:43,380
prove the success of the way we're going

00:05:41,669 --> 00:05:45,810
to work and this product

00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:47,340
let's get that over 10 percent so keep

00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:48,110
in mind we're asking to more than triple

00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:51,319
it

00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:53,599
so we developed the product we develop

00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:56,060
an MVP in two months we develop and

00:05:53,599 --> 00:05:57,379
continue developing after that we demoed

00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:01,520
to senior leadership in the middle of

00:05:57,379 --> 00:06:04,969
that and now our engagement rate is over

00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:06,680
30% so we kind of smash the goal that we

00:06:04,969 --> 00:06:07,430
had for ourself which seemed you know

00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,759
pretty high

00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:11,810
you know 300% but we've been really

00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:15,830
proud of what we've been able to achieve

00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:18,439
there it is the most popular mobile

00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:22,039
product we've delivered and it was the

00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:24,020
beginning of building some momentum of

00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:25,969
meeting people where they are and

00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:28,219
encouraging health this next product

00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:29,659
which was also also delivered by the

00:06:28,219 --> 00:06:31,699
digital experience center and I'm gonna

00:06:29,659 --> 00:06:33,469
try and go a little quicker with what

00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:37,370
little time we have this is a condition

00:06:33,469 --> 00:06:39,800
management condition management product

00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:42,440
for our members focused on hypertension

00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:46,610
diabetes and congestive heart failure

00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:48,590
the member inputs blood pressure or

00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:50,509
weight or some other data elements and

00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:52,610
then in return we give them some

00:06:50,509 --> 00:06:55,879
personalized contents and trending over

00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:58,520
time the notion is we're seeking to

00:06:55,879 --> 00:07:01,879
allow them to manage their conditions on

00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:04,310
the fly so why this one is specifically

00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:06,020
relevant to this conference is it was

00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:09,469
our first product to every utilize Cloud

00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:12,169
Foundry the core application API is a

00:07:09,469 --> 00:07:14,750
rails app deployed on an internal or

00:07:12,169 --> 00:07:17,839
on-prem Cloud Foundry instance that

00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:20,419
we've stood up we could only deal with

00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:25,580
so much change at one time so we didn't

00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:28,610
do it on the on vitality so moving on

00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:30,349
the the product that we'd most recently

00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:33,259
released that really kind of embodies

00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:35,930
the spirit of this video and what we

00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:39,620
would just call Humana's future is Q by

00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:41,150
Humana what's unique about Q is that you

00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:45,289
do not need an existing relationship

00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:48,319
with Humana to use this out it is a app

00:07:45,289 --> 00:07:50,750
for the Apple watch and for the iPhone

00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,430
all it does is remind you to do simple

00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:54,349
things that we all need to do throughout

00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:56,719
the day that we forget to do like stay

00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:58,730
hydrated go outside get up away from

00:07:56,719 --> 00:08:01,250
your desk things like that

00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:03,200
so it's really significant that we've

00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:05,090
opened this up and just said you know

00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:07,520
everyone's our customer even if you

00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:11,500
don't pay us we're on that journey to

00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:14,750
getting our our communities healthier so

00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:17,330
this product was developed by a team of

00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:20,810
four and took five weeks to get to the

00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:24,740
first app store approval which for us as

00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:27,770
an organization is huge that is unheard

00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:29,870
of and it's we've received a lot of

00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:31,550
internal praise because it's like you

00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:33,770
guys move like like a real software

00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:36,590
company and it and it's starting to feel

00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:38,540
that way quite frankly so one of the

00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:39,800
goals that we had was that we would

00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:43,010
launch this on the day the watch

00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:44,540
launched so we achieved that in addition

00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:46,280
to that we were able to be featured in

00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:49,910
the Apple watch app store alongside

00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:52,160
uber Evernote New York Times subsequent

00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:54,320
to that Mac life comm and their listing

00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:57,530
of 20 best Apple watch apps picked queue

00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:00,110
to be in that list and it was the only

00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:04,580
health and fitness app to kind of make

00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:06,740
that cut yeah I mean deca what Andy of

00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:08,720
Allstate said yesterday I mean it takes

00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:11,810
us in Humana sometimes two months for

00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:15,050
the two provision servers so for a

00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:18,020
Louisville Kentucky insurer to actually

00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:21,280
deliver a product to everyone not just

00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:25,610
its members but to anyone in five weeks

00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:31,670
really is for us revolutionary and it

00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:36,320
symbolizes where we we aim to go now

00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:41,030
when we consider that for for what for

00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:43,220
us what is disruption certainly we

00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:45,830
cannot do it without a set of tools and

00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:48,140
and pivotal Cloud Foundry really is the

00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:51,590
heart of what's enabled these kinds of

00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:53,420
fast deliveries yeah so with cloud

00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:57,170
foundry as I'm sure most of you are

00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:59,690
aware we're able to do what would take

00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:01,520
filling out a webform getting a litany

00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:03,620
of approvals and then someone actually

00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:05,420
like a network ops person going to the

00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:08,870
server and go okay they said copy the

00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:10,400
files from there to there and then if it

00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:12,320
didn't work then they've got to fill out

00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:15,560
another webform because well it's not in

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,210
the first webform so quad foundry

00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,680
pivotal Cloud Foundry specifically has

00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:20,990
really enabled us to do that

00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:23,210
you know CF push and we're done and

00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:25,100
there's no nonsense and we're able to

00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:27,080
deliver that value to our users be it in

00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:29,120
testing or in production in a much more

00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:32,589
rapid fashion than we were prior and it

00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:35,300
also really allows an empowerment of our

00:10:32,589 --> 00:10:38,720
interdisciplinary product teams that has

00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:40,339
not been realized otherwise exactly it's

00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,980
becoming that first-class user of the

00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:45,710
data center as it was stated previously

00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:47,750
so when we look at how do we you know

00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:49,460
manage these products how do we manage

00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:52,279
the development lifecycle of them one

00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:53,630
tool we use is pivotal tracker and that

00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:55,370
comes from obviously being in bed with

00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:56,410
pivotal and it's their product and it is

00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:59,000
a great product

00:10:56,410 --> 00:11:01,130
lets us simply see you know what's

00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,650
coming up next it forces us to focus on

00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:06,200
one thing at a time in contrast to the

00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:08,270
tools that we use internally already

00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,650
which there may be a tool for the

00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:11,210
development team there may be a tool for

00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:13,490
the testing team and there may be a

00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:14,930
different tool for audit and so this

00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:16,400
just kind of says all right let's get

00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:18,290
down to one tool that's really just

00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:23,300
focused on the product and not on the

00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:24,530
project so another set of simpler tools

00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:26,870
that we use they're just kind of

00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:28,430
information radiator tools we use

00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:31,010
project monitor it's an open source

00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:34,220
pivotal product these are just tiles

00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:35,660
that set up on TVs at the top of the

00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:37,330
kind of work space to give quick

00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:40,040
visibility into the health of builds

00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:42,890
green means good red means we had a

00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:44,330
failing test and then those old bars and

00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:48,380
numbers at the bottom our integration

00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:49,760
from the related tracker project so that

00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:51,230
works well you know for day-to-day

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,300
development but when it comes to

00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:55,120
production monitoring right now we're

00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:58,880
using a product called dashing i/o and

00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:01,130
this is the dashboard that's currently

00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:03,230
alive in our in the digital experience

00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:05,209
Center for Humanity eyetality each one

00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:07,220
of those little green tiles is kind of a

00:12:05,209 --> 00:12:09,650
step that goes on in the login process

00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:11,000
we had problems because there's so many

00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:12,589
dependencies as you can see from the

00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,020
eight tiles on login that we needed to

00:12:12,589 --> 00:12:16,520
know specifically okay who do we go talk

00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:18,500
to so we set up eight different tiles

00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:19,910
for that and the top right we're kind of

00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,030
keeping that consumer voice in the

00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:23,190
forefront you know what if you

00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:24,270
saying about us in the AppStore how can

00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:26,100
we you know keep that at the forefront

00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:27,420
of them of our mind because that's as

00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:29,430
important as the health of our builds

00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:31,110
and then in the purple tiles what you'll

00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:33,270
notice is this is an integration with

00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:35,280
flurry to say how many people are

00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:36,810
actually using our app is the content

00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:39,300
we're producing this month is that

00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:44,820
relevant to people's lives is it making

00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:46,590
them engage with the app so I think

00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:50,310
health is really something that can

00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:56,100
resonate with all of us and you know

00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:58,830
Humana is really set on orienting the

00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:00,960
entire company around bolstering health

00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:03,870
for its customers and for the

00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:06,090
communities it serves what when we think

00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:08,640
about the digital experience Center and

00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:10,830
its role in doing that you know we

00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:12,600
realize we have to help simplify

00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:15,240
healthcare and meet people where they

00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:19,230
are and deliver them value and

00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:22,260
experiences that resonate with them and

00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:25,170
the goal absolutely is to drive a

00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:27,750
healthier culture and for obvious

00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:31,890
reasons that's you know of utmost

00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:33,450
importance but it's also a financial win

00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:35,700
for everyone you know certainly it

00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:37,470
reduces costs for companies like Humana

00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:40,680
but it also reduces the cost of health

00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:42,780
care for all of us and the role that the

00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:45,600
deck the digital experience Center has

00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:48,900
within the company to help orient the

00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:51,600
company around health is the way that we

00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:55,350
work the tools that we use the culture

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:58,200
that we have been able to create that

00:13:55,350 --> 00:14:01,260
really flies in the face of this Big

00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:04,830
Bang approach to development otherwise

00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:07,770
it just must become common and we cannot

00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:09,930
emphasize the importance of the lean

00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:11,930
agile product development practice the

00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:15,960
set of tools that we have to really

00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:18,750
disrupt this culture that doesn't really

00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:21,450
otherwise beg the question of change why

00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:26,580
change the human is extremely profitable

00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:28,980
as it stands today but the point is we

00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:31,070
are looking to transform to be prepared

00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:33,690
to be healthier in every respect

00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:36,690
tomorrow and Jason and I are trying

00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:38,550
do our part to ensure that this agile

00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:41,820
and cultural transformation occurs for

00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:46,249
that very reason thank you thank you

00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:46,249
