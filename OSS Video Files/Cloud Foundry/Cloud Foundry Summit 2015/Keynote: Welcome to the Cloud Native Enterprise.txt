	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,150
great to be here so a little experiment

00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:08,400
I today I thought instead of doing an

00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:11,460
extensive series of slides and theses

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,780
and observations I might just do what

00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,730
Josh and I normally do when we sit

00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,859
around my office on Friday night and

00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,869
just talk about the patterns that we're

00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:21,570
seeing out there how it's informing our

00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:23,160
strategy and what we're seeing in the

00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,900
market the trends and you know what this

00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,250
is really all about so hopefully don't

00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,619
mind coming along with us on that

00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:30,900
journey while I grab the clicker oh yeah

00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:34,680
don't forget the clicker so Josh you

00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:36,989
came to us last fall was it now the

00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:39,390
October I think and you've been on the

00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:40,920
road pretty extensively and you came in

00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:41,790
with a pretty unique perspective as

00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,530
someone who'd been focused on

00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:45,750
infrastructure had always wanted to

00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,700
build a platform what's it been like

00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,260
living on a plane speaking with all the

00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:52,949
largest organizations in the world

00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:54,420
so I I stopped counting cities six weeks

00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:55,969
into the year because they're starting

00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:59,489
to freak me out

00:00:55,969 --> 00:01:01,260
but what's really amazing about this

00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:04,049
transformation is it's not a single

00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:07,490
industry you know I I'm working now with

00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:13,760
financial services federal government's

00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:16,530
industrial retail automotive insurance

00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,270
medical like it's it's every industry

00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:19,890
every vertical in every region and what

00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:22,170
do you what do you think's common across

00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,460
all those diverse sets of economic

00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:25,229
organization that you're seeing today

00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:27,119
what are the uniting themes

00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:29,670
technologically organizationally that

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,020
you see as you walk into random meeting

00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:32,850
rooms and in every state in the country

00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,890
and every region around the world

00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:37,560
I mean I've decided to call cloud native

00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:40,829
them the meme that binds yeah right

00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,780
because different organizations will

00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:44,790
have other things they talk about maybe

00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:47,490
they have a CD initiative or maybe

00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:50,280
they're there they're trying to get more

00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:53,430
agile across the business but this idea

00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:56,759
of a fundamental architectural shift

00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:58,469
yeah is totally ubiquitous actually I

00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:59,579
was gonna tell a tiny story James wants

00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:00,930
me to keep on the clock so I'm gonna

00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:03,990
immediately ignore the clock and tell a

00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:06,119
story you know I started programming

00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:07,920
when I was six never went to college and

00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:09,479
so my first really professional

00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,890
programming job I had no idea what I was

00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,319
doing yeah I was like I know how to

00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:13,390
write

00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:14,980
of code and that will be good enough so

00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:16,659
about a month into that my good friend

00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:18,969
Chris Campbell handed me the Gang of

00:02:16,659 --> 00:02:20,409
Four book and at the time this was a

00:02:18,969 --> 00:02:22,299
total revelation for me I was like

00:02:20,409 --> 00:02:23,650
there's actually a right way to do this

00:02:22,299 --> 00:02:25,450
there's this thing called architecture

00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:27,730
and you can think about it and it

00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:29,139
totally changes the game and I feel like

00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:31,900
now the equivalent of going to college

00:02:29,139 --> 00:02:33,549
is working at Google yeah and everyone

00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,079
who works at Google comes out at Google

00:02:33,549 --> 00:02:37,359
with this notion of like there are these

00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:40,269
patterns that you should use that change

00:02:37,359 --> 00:02:41,919
the game and so you know Cloud Foundry

00:02:40,269 --> 00:02:43,239
and going out there with cloud native

00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:44,980
architecture is sort of like handing

00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:47,799
people the Gang of Four yeah and all of

00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:50,079
a sudden they're like whoa we get it I

00:02:47,799 --> 00:02:51,549
think I think that's the point that most

00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:53,949
resonates with me like over the last

00:02:51,549 --> 00:02:55,480
year that's changed the most is that it

00:02:53,949 --> 00:02:57,430
went from you know the first time I got

00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:59,680
on a plane did 40 cities myself last

00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:01,329
year not as many as you to start

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,540
explaining this to people two years ago

00:03:01,329 --> 00:03:06,189
it was pretty abstract and what's really

00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:08,620
happened is that everybody has started

00:03:06,189 --> 00:03:11,260
to realize that Google isn't different

00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:12,579
from them they're the future Netflix

00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,799
isn't different from them they're the

00:03:12,579 --> 00:03:19,060
future and that they have to close that

00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:20,560
gap somehow and fast to compete yeah you

00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:22,239
know people talk about cloud native as

00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,949
if it's only about scale right and they

00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,150
say these giant scale businesses when

00:03:23,949 --> 00:03:27,129
cloud native because they had to for

00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:29,799
scale scale is not just about the number

00:03:27,129 --> 00:03:32,680
of users it's about the number of

00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:35,169
transactions the amount of value and the

00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,759
amount of value is combinatorial about

00:03:35,169 --> 00:03:38,199
of the number of just different pieces

00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:40,090
you're pulling together so in a large

00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:41,889
organization connecting two or three

00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:43,599
systems you suddenly have a scale

00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:44,970
problem but it blew my mind when you

00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:48,009
said you came back from Washington DC

00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:50,590
just let's get very very specific about

00:03:48,009 --> 00:03:52,479
this you weren't Washington DC and an

00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:54,969
organizational leader said to you we

00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:56,379
know that we're two monolithic we know

00:03:54,969 --> 00:03:58,780
that we have to refactor to cloud native

00:03:56,379 --> 00:04:00,549
maybe micro services and we know that we

00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:03,120
need a platform so it's not just one I

00:04:00,549 --> 00:04:06,239
did nine agencies in 48 hours

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:09,159
most of them three-letter yeah and

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,789
they're all in exactly the same position

00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:12,009
right now

00:04:09,789 --> 00:04:14,650
yeah like our systems cannot be adapted

00:04:12,009 --> 00:04:16,299
to the changing worlds we know this you

00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:17,859
know we went to agile we figured out how

00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:19,329
to build a new release in two weeks it

00:04:17,859 --> 00:04:21,099
still took us nine months to push it

00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:24,070
into production that doesn't work yeah

00:04:21,099 --> 00:04:25,320
and we know we can't fix the operational

00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:27,120
model without

00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:29,400
changing the application development

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,810
model and that's where they saw a CNA do

00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,660
a cloud native application just playing

00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:35,670
right in so it was every single agency I

00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:38,820
talked to yeah had exactly the same

00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:40,770
agenda yeah and it was amazing a Diego

00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,660
from the 18f organization the government

00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:44,160
Astra had an awesome quote and he said

00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:46,980
let's just transition on this one

00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,540
he said it's obvious to me that Cloud

00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:50,970
Foundry is the future of enterprise

00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:53,190
DevOps yeah now what do you think he

00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:54,330
meant by that well he also he quoted a

00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:55,980
slightly different he said one of our

00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:58,080
developers when I asked him how they

00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:58,950
felt about the pilot and and and pilot

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,290
is a loose term because they went

00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:03,000
straight into production yeah he said

00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:06,480
you know if you take cloud foundry away

00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,740
from us we will hurt you these are the

00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,300
small moments when you've been on this

00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,950
journey for four years working on this

00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:14,340
that you're like maybe maybe this is a

00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:16,440
workout no yeah the you know that the

00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:18,090
the difference is so rat and government

00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:20,400
look I worked at NASA right it took us

00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:21,740
six months to get a VM it took 18 months

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,420
to get the first system into production

00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:32,550
Diego's team can get an authorization to

00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:35,070
operate in three days yeah that was the

00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:36,810
same theme we heard from Andy yesterday

00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:38,910
of all state he said used to take a

00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:39,570
hundred days to do this now it takes 15

00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:42,090
minutes or less

00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:44,400
yeah that's unfair question and this is

00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:46,230
what this quick notes about here is that

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,540
there's a really revolutionary thing

00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:49,950
about cloud foundry in that it works and

00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:51,810
that was one of the themes that I heard

00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:53,700
yesterday and all the customer talks as

00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:55,890
they said hey actually this technology

00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:58,140
we installed it we used it it worked as

00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:59,940
advertised as opposed to I think where

00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:03,300
they've been coming from which was these

00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:05,100
two or three-year organizational changes

00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,870
around let's go build a platform and

00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,760
unite around that they're not realizing

00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:11,160
that they can arbitrage between Google's

00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:14,130
capability and their own by using Cloud

00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,630
Foundry yeah a lot of the other the

00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:17,640
previous approaches to this problem

00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:19,740
space you know how do we how do we make

00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:21,960
it easy to deal with distributed systems

00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:24,470
have been either language specific

00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:27,690
framework specific or have required

00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:29,190
superheroes yeah and there was a lot of

00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:30,330
discussion yesterday about superheroes

00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:31,890
and how we're all kind of we're

00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:33,240
superheroes or we think we are and

00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:34,530
that's super cool and I believe it I

00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,290
think we're cool we weren't hoodies

00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:39,250
I don't but ordinary people do not fly

00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:40,780
using a cape they get on the plane

00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:43,180
that's right right and so Cloud Foundry

00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:45,220
is essentially a plane it lets everybody

00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:47,410
fly that's right and that I think is

00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:49,000
really really powerful I think that's

00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:51,400
what's so revolutionary about it for me

00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,950
is that the idea that it's you know I

00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:56,110
talked to a leader at a major banking

00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:57,670
company who said hey we use some you

00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:59,440
know configuration management on top of

00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:01,120
OpenStack previously he said what I

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,820
really end up building was a snowflake

00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,560
generator and what it's really connected

00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:07,360
with me and CIO is the simple questions

00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,770
like why is still managing operating

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,420
systems this is a simple question I

00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:12,340
asked them Cloud Foundry and beds and

00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:13,720
operating system in it so that you're

00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:15,940
just managing at the application level

00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,980
much like consuming an Amazon service

00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:19,210
like a relational database service you

00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:21,550
don't even know what the OS is you don't

00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:23,980
need to yeah you really yeah I'm another

00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:25,480
segue right James was building Cloud

00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:27,820
Foundry when when I was building

00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:29,860
OpenStack yeah and my goal was to be

00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:31,780
building Cloud Foundry that is what

00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:33,700
opens tech was built for it was to get

00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:35,890
to the structured platform part cuz I

00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:39,310
don't I don't really think like hand

00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:41,350
tooling to a Niyaz API yeah it is is a

00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:42,790
long-term strategy for application

00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:44,050
development yeah and I think I think

00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:45,640
that's what's so amazing is that we've

00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:48,040
started to deliver really on the promise

00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:50,080
that this works you can plug it in today

00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:52,690
there's ten pivotal CF customers

00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,400
speaking here I mean this is not like in

00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:55,240
some of the other open source worlds

00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,680
where they're like hey when is

00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,780
Enterprise gonna show up to the party

00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,820
like Enterprise helped us start this

00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:04,600
party because the capability is already

00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:06,220
mature you know james part of our job or

00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,660
your job in particular my job is to go

00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:10,150
talk to people about what works today

00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:12,960
yeah your job is to be ready for what

00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:15,310
they need in six months right right so

00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,800
most folks when they say claude native

00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:19,390
they translate that into twelve factor

00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,550
you know and twelve factor has become

00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:23,169
this amazingly powerful way of

00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:25,660
describing what a cloud native

00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:27,640
architecture looks like but as soon as

00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:29,350
you actually do cloud factor there's a

00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,940
new set of challenges that come out of

00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:33,039
that you want to talk about going beyond

00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:35,729
well factor I mean the awesome thing

00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:38,110
about pivotal is that we are also

00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:40,390
responsible for the entire Spring

00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:41,770
Framework community and once that I

00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:43,510
wanted to share with the audience today

00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:45,220
because I think a lot of people are

00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:47,589
really stuck on legacy technologies like

00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:49,270
web sphere and web logic and it really

00:08:47,589 --> 00:08:50,950
clogs their entire organizational

00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:52,290
structure because they're like hey we

00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:54,180
got to get the WebSphere admin

00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:56,190
to do a deploy and it's incredibly

00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:57,959
complex and they're scarce and that

00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:59,910
whole continuous delivery cloud native

00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:02,040
architectural organizational change just

00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:04,230
grinds to a halt and I showed one of

00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,940
these websphere guys one day how cloud

00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:07,829
foundry worked and he said I'm so mad I

00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:11,339
want to flip the table over this is a

00:09:07,829 --> 00:09:13,560
quote and you can see that anger coming

00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:15,089
out in this download chart of spring

00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:17,490
boot now spring boot is what Netflix

00:09:15,089 --> 00:09:20,579
uses for their micro services Java it

00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:22,920
embeds a very lightweight runtime inside

00:09:20,579 --> 00:09:24,690
of it and you can see it went nearly

00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:26,100
vertical at the beginning of this year

00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:28,319
which is another indication of cloud

00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:30,630
native adoption so we had over a million

00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:33,180
downloads by developers of spring boot

00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:35,160
in April alone yeah that's a that's a

00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:37,290
really powerful stat and you said

00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:40,470
Netflix like like four times right and

00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:42,089
and they are the poster child in cloud

00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:43,980
native architecture probably mostly

00:09:42,089 --> 00:09:46,620
because Adrian has spent so much time

00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:48,240
explaining it to people what what I

00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:51,000
admire about Netflix is they're built

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,829
for speed and resiliency like everyone I

00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,449
talk to you know a major retailer was in

00:09:52,829 --> 00:09:57,449
talking with us and me and Rob me last

00:09:54,449 --> 00:10:00,449
week and he said we how do we transform

00:09:57,449 --> 00:10:02,010
for speed and how do we get resiliency

00:10:00,449 --> 00:10:03,480
and everything that we build and one

00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:06,149
thing I admire about Netflix is they

00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,410
culturally turned that 211 they said how

00:10:06,149 --> 00:10:10,199
do we structure everything about our

00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:12,690
applications to get to 11 on speed and

00:10:10,199 --> 00:10:14,339
resiliency and it's a great privilege

00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:16,230
that the spring team works directly with

00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:17,699
Netflix they use spring boot we also

00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:19,290
have this thing called spring cloud now

00:10:17,699 --> 00:10:21,360
which includes all the Netflix micro

00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:23,850
services right in the spring programming

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:27,350
framework so I actually want you to stop

00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:30,089
and say that over again because I went

00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:31,079
the the rumor of this got out right and

00:10:30,089 --> 00:10:33,089
I was in Whitley County

00:10:31,079 --> 00:10:34,709
right now I was in wall street I was

00:10:33,089 --> 00:10:37,500
meeting with another one of these very

00:10:34,709 --> 00:10:38,459
large banks and they stopped me in the

00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,689
middle of the presentation where this

00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:41,100
was like a footnote I look like I'm

00:10:39,689 --> 00:10:42,660
talking I'm talking about cloud founder

00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:45,420
in there wait wait wait you just said

00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:46,889
that we get all of Netflix OSS for free

00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,209
yeah this happened again

00:10:46,889 --> 00:10:50,459
yesterday it was out for some lunch

00:10:48,209 --> 00:10:53,310
somebody was like wait we get Netflix

00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:55,230
for free conversations over let's just

00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:56,910
go let's go do that I think it's so

00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:59,970
important because you start to bring the

00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:01,380
cloud native architecture not just into

00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:03,810
the platform and infrastructure

00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:04,800
resiliency and team management etc like

00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:06,600
cloud foundry has with

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,580
to cloud we also start to bring it right

00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,260
up into the framework I mean I get giddy

00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:11,850
when I see people writing you know

00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:14,100
spring coat and it says at historic

00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:16,230
switch is a circuit breaker from Netflix

00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:18,029
right in there which provides resiliency

00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:19,560
and failover right in the application

00:11:18,029 --> 00:11:21,510
what's it going to happen is those are

00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,640
all going to be pivotal CF services as

00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:25,050
part of Cloud Foundry so the platform

00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:27,180
and the programming are going to become

00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:29,279
one big blurred line for this cloud

00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:37,589
native architecture yeah really powerful

00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:39,959
yeah so I mean one of the big promises

00:11:37,589 --> 00:11:42,180
of cloud native is that it's not about

00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:43,470
where you run your app it's about how

00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:45,990
you build your app do you want to talk a

00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:47,519
little bit more about how from a from a

00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:49,649
product strategy we've been addressing

00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:52,200
this yes I know it's a huge concern

00:11:49,649 --> 00:11:54,060
across all of these verticals is we

00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:56,730
don't want lock-in right and certainly

00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:59,700
the embrace around open source has been

00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:02,570
how do we stay away from getting married

00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:05,579
to a single vendor how do we not turn

00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:07,589
Bezos into Larry Ellison I I think in

00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:09,149
addition to that the two big trends that

00:12:07,589 --> 00:12:11,490
I see out in the market right now are

00:12:09,149 --> 00:12:14,220
cloud native for organizational design

00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:16,920
agile art app architecture and then

00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:18,420
multi cloud in terms of I T because the

00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,459
CIOs don't want to get locked into

00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:21,510
Amazon and they don't only also don't

00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:22,980
want to get locked into private data

00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:24,420
center because they know in two years

00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:26,010
that they might have to have an Amazon

00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:27,510
initiative and they don't want to really

00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:29,670
build two different teams with two

00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:30,990
different sets of tools and I think one

00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:33,390
of the reasons pivotal Cloud Foundry has

00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:34,860
been you know the most popular weight of

00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:37,320
using Cloud Foundry the enterprise is

00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:39,630
that we are so dedicated to multi cloud

00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:41,610
and I know you helped us recently with

00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:42,870
CenturyLink in terms of you know maybe

00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:44,670
tell folks how we're doing that

00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:47,370
integration and very dedicated to

00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:49,260
running on any API on any cloud yeah so

00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:52,550
the the CPI the cloud provider

00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:54,300
abstraction yeah inside Cloud Foundry is

00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:55,920
probably one of my favorite features

00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:57,839
it's certainly the first part I actually

00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,550
worked with hands on right a couple of

00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,620
years ago you were still at VMware I was

00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:03,000
still at piston and we pulled those two

00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:07,079
teams together to build the original

00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,550
OpenStack CPI yeah and the the work that

00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:10,140
the whole community has done in

00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:12,620
maintaining and expanding that I know

00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:15,540
IBM's leaned in on that a lot yeah

00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:17,370
CenturyLink actually looked at that and

00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:18,030
said hey why don't we just implement a

00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:20,160
compatibility

00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:21,540
lair of open sack API is even though

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,030
we're not even running OpenStack yeah

00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:26,220
because that is the much simpler way to

00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:28,830
achieve Interop and it's worked really

00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:30,120
well so I think those are the those are

00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:31,590
that's the other big trend is a multi

00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,510
cloud if people really want multi-cloud

00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:34,890
choice and we've delivered that the

00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:37,050
final proof point that we tried to put

00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:39,060
into the product itself is that we've

00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:42,750
said our hosted services include in our

00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:44,460
software and I think that's really a big

00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:46,020
proof point for us with enterprise CIOs

00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:48,000
because I said how can I afford to give

00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:49,830
you access to our hosted service for no

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,260
more than the software costs yeah you

00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:53,970
are actually paying people's amazon bill

00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:55,650
for them that's right like that is the

00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:57,870
the effect of that is saying we believe

00:13:55,650 --> 00:14:00,660
so much that cloud native architecture

00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:02,100
is efficient we're gonna take all of the

00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:05,190
efficiency gains out of our own bottom

00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:09,690
line like it's I mean I think you're a

00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:11,580
little crazy it's really working like

00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:12,240
putting it on the line I explained to

00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,830
them I was like well it's

00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,240
containerization and efficiency of a

00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:17,130
cloud native platform is what allows us

00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,720
to give you just capacity on demand on

00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:20,730
our hosted edition it's really powerful

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,590
so it's pretty cool I think you know all

00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:24,000
of us have been dreaming about this I've

00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:25,880
been dreaming about this for five years

00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,160
you were dreaming about it at NASA and

00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:29,970
it's great to see the variety of

00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,190
customers really that have come to this

00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:34,710
event and that we've assembled and the

00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:37,080
people that we're helping you know as a

00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:39,480
closing thought I got into an argument

00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:41,790
on Twitter a couple days again again

00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,470
it's usually about the definition of

00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:44,940
prod what does it mean to be in prod

00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:47,040
right and this was this has always been

00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:49,170
this magical benchmark of how do you

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,990
know an open-source project is mature is

00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:55,110
when it's used in prod I was like well

00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:57,780
most of the PCF customers I talked to

00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:59,910
yeah went straight to production like

00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:01,920
this was not a concept of oh well we've

00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:03,870
got to do because that's what cloud

00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:06,000
native is it says there is a single

00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:10,110
approach that allows you to go from dev

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,880
to prod in one motion which it just it

00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:13,800
changes the game you can't you can't

00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,930
have an idea on Monday and ship an idea

00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,850
on Friday if you have like nine months

00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:19,680
of workflow yeah I think that gets back

00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:21,810
to the urgency that some people feel to

00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:24,630
implement and use the platform and get

00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:25,740
moving with it quickly and you know just

00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:27,090
in summary and feel free to come up to

00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:28,860
Josh and I on the hallways and continue

00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:30,900
this casual chat

00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:33,210
but you know to me cloud natives really

00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:35,520
about a change in the way organizations

00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:37,860
and applications are structured it's the

00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:40,230
ability to run that application on the

00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:42,210
cloud of your choice without encumbrance

00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:45,090
to any local dependencies on that cloud

00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:47,040
and finally I think it's the ability to

00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:48,570
use a structured platform in the way

00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,520
that Google and Netflix of all built is

00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:52,230
very structured very rigorous platforms

00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,790
to get incredible efficiencies and

00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:55,890
agility no one has ever done

00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:57,450
collaborative without a platform either

00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:59,700
they've built their own or they've used

00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:02,670
CF I think that's that's a really great

00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:07,320
thing to end on all right thanks thanks

00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:07,320
