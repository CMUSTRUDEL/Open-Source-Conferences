	00:00:00,319 --> 00:00:06,919
so how's the Cloud Foundry summit

00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:09,900
treating everyone yeah so far so good

00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:14,250
people are trickling in so I'll I'll go

00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:17,400
slow so this is a talk about a lot of

00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:20,119
things and I usually give a disclaimer

00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:22,470
that we're gonna go really fast I have

00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:24,150
30 minutes supposedly but I'll probably

00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:28,070
go long and I'm gonna go through about

00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:29,970
90 saman slides and some of them are

00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:32,759
some of them have more bullet points

00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:34,410
than others but the main thing I want to

00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,090
do is take you on a little journey tell

00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,350
a little narrative and for some of you

00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:40,579
will relate to things that you've

00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:43,410
experienced in your career maybe on a

00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:46,559
similar arc or observed from different

00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:49,260
personas my career so far I've kind of

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:53,160
spanned many different roles inside of

00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:56,640
IT as a developer a sysadmin a founder

00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:58,340
of a company and just thinking really

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,520
about how all these things fit together

00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:05,129
so the alternative title if I can get

00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,560
this thing to change there we go is a

00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:10,650
systems thinking is the new black

00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:13,979
just by any show of hands did anyone

00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:18,619
come to last year's summit the at the

00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:23,490
Hilton okay how many people saw my talk

00:01:18,619 --> 00:01:26,880
how many people saw on video so this is

00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:29,700
all this all online but the ideas in

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,710
that talk I think are our key to actual

00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,329
izing some of the things that you're

00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:34,170
going to see in this talk and also some

00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:35,939
of the things you're probably trying to

00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,439
do inside of your organization's it

00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:38,729
definitely has so it has a bunch of

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,759
information about organizational

00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:43,770
learning and I used the stonecutter

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:47,250
metaphor so this is another alternative

00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:50,520
title and this is a Stonecutters quest

00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:53,070
for nice things do you guys recall the

00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,500
the morning session with Sam we're

00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:57,329
talking about the I have a slightly

00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,729
different version but it's basically

00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:03,899
this idea of connecting to a higher

00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:05,430
purpose or not right like there's

00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:08,039
different levels of understanding of

00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:10,050
your craft and the lowest level is the

00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:13,670
stonecutter that he gets paid to cut

00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:17,190
stones right he knows that he can make

00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:19,319
you know food for his family because he

00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:22,340
cut stones he has a skill and then the

00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:25,849
second level is the stone cutter that is

00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:28,140
he's just fascinated with the actual

00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:29,819
craft right like if you ask him

00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:32,129
questions he'll get excited about how

00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:34,230
how the stones are laid and the tools

00:02:32,129 --> 00:02:35,790
and you know how the servers are

00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:38,370
configured with this one configuration

00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:39,720
management tool and then the last one is

00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:43,560
the one who's connected to this higher

00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:47,069
purpose of the Cathedral so this is our

00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,120
lowly stone cutter and you know my

00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:49,829
career and I'll just go through this

00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,640
really fast but I've been involved in a

00:02:49,829 --> 00:02:53,430
lot of startup so we're going to

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,110
actually talk through some of that most

00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:56,819
people know me from puppet I did a lot

00:02:55,110 --> 00:03:00,329
of work early days especially on

00:02:56,819 --> 00:03:02,760
OpenStack and then my my background

00:03:00,329 --> 00:03:04,170
we're gonna go through a lot but I did

00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,299
some writing for O'Reilly this is a

00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:08,069
little book I helped write on web

00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:10,290
operations and there's a lot of great

00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:13,440
stuff and I'm packing my house to move

00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:17,549
to Los Angeles from Pittsburgh and I

00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:20,040
came across this book just yes this

00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:22,799
weekend and I read I read this book and

00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:25,200
it's from 2010 but it's really stood up

00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:27,420
you know and we're five years out from

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,220
that and anyone who's interested in

00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:31,349
really building like a new future and

00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:33,030
we're gonna really see a lot of the

00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:34,200
ideas that are embodying that book but

00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:36,599
it's a great reference if you're

00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,040
interested in DevOps and operations and

00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:40,319
really managing this stuff at scale and

00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,730
then I've been involved in in the DevOps

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,319
movement and we'll talk about that a

00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:45,650
little bit I've been on the core

00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:47,790
organizing team for DevOps since the

00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:49,950
beginning of DevOps days and we

00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:52,620
organized you know dozens of those

00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:53,970
around the world now and if you've not

00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,650
had the opportunity to participate in a

00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:57,750
DevOps days then I think it will really

00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:59,430
be eye-opening to see the communities of

00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:01,680
practice that come together and openly

00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:03,660
share the information and this this

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,400
whole thing is very similar like we're

00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:09,720
trying to build a community of practice

00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:11,970
around cloud foundry but traditionally a

00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:14,370
lot of the a lot of the organizations

00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:17,030
that are quote-unquote Enterprise they

00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:18,989
tend to they tend to hide information

00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:21,719
they often hide information from

00:04:18,989 --> 00:04:23,760
themselves internally but they try to

00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:25,260
hide information from each other where

00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:27,540
one of the things that you saw in the

00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:29,880
DevOps communities is even though people

00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:33,120
working on you know on face on some

00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:35,430
somewhat competitive services that they

00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,690
would often share the the way that they

00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:38,190
were solving these common on

00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:42,030
differentiating problems with their

00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:45,960
infrastructure and then done I work for

00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:51,810
pivotal I don't know if anyone needs a

00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:54,000
job we're hiring yeah and then I try to

00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:55,920
amuse myself on Twitter and it might

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,210
amuse you too but I'm little idea and

00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,910
that's probably the fastest way to get

00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:03,150
my attention even if you work with me

00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:05,120
and have my email which I'm usually

00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:07,560
about a thousand emails behind on

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:11,880
alright so if you saw my talk last year

00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:13,260
this is funny three stone cutters walk

00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,420
into a Pareto inefficient Nash

00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:17,790
equilibrium go watch that talk and you

00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:19,770
can laugh later I'm now going to talk

00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:22,080
about Cloud Foundry what I'm actually

00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:24,680
going to talk about is all the stuff

00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:28,560
that kind of is around Cloud Foundry and

00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:31,020
bye-bye relief by the way that that

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:34,920
silhouette then will kind of have clouds

00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:36,090
boundary left over that makes sense so I

00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:41,070
like to do this

00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:42,690
still let's start with the conclusion so

00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:45,180
there's a bunch of buzzword bingo crap

00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:47,490
they're like Gartner publishes and

00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:49,170
everyone does and some of the words meet

00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:50,220
something and some of the times they

00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:52,350
mean different things of different

00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:54,510
people and you get into all sorts of

00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:56,400
strange conversations if you don't start

00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:58,590
each conversation with the definitions

00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,760
like for this conversation this is what

00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:01,320
we're going mean this way and that's

00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:03,150
that's fair that's fine

00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:06,870
vanya argue this is really just one

00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:09,450
thing that DevOps continuous delivery

00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:10,860
micro services like these are all really

00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:14,550
part of the same phenomena that's

00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:17,010
happened and these things are enabling

00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:19,950
these things are dynamic these things

00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:22,530
are not really finished and what we're

00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:24,750
able to do today will really evolve

00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:27,480
rapidly especially as as these

00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:29,880
communities cooperate and drive that

00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:31,770
innovation forward we can come back and

00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:33,270
will will have a little bit more

00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:35,100
definition around each of these words by

00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:37,380
the end but first I'm gonna tell you

00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:39,220
story about me alright so in the

00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:43,750
beginning

00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:48,400
but not the real beginning but I got a

00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:50,950
job as a developer I had a job I was I

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:54,070
had a degree in math and I had admire in

00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:55,630
CS and I had a professor he is a

00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:58,330
theoretical chemist and he wanted to

00:06:55,630 --> 00:07:01,150
have this project he's like we can you

00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:01,840
do this and I was like I have no idea

00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:07,120
how to do that

00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:09,820
yes so he gave me like tiny bits of

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,800
money and and I was really smart and I

00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:15,970
had Google but I really had no idea was

00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:16,600
doing right so I was sort of left to my

00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:19,150
own devices

00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:23,590
there was this half cobble together idea

00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:25,990
that this grad student had sort of

00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:29,410
implemented for this guy his his vision

00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:32,020
was he wanted to build a way for these

00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:33,580
theoretical chemists who were redoing a

00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:36,760
lot of the same calculations over and

00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:39,760
over to share the these pre calculated

00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:41,950
chemical kinetic and thermodynamic from

00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:44,050
first principles and so he this idea was

00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:46,660
his original idea was he wanted to have

00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:47,980
this database so you'd have this

00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:50,320
database but you're gonna ship these

00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:53,140
like kind of synchronized databases

00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,890
across the community but that's a

00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:56,110
terrible idea

00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:58,750
when you could build online system and

00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:59,919
this is right around its like 2001 so

00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:02,590
you're starting to see like internet

00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:05,050
stuff come online and I was like well

00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:07,570
how about we build it as a web service

00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:09,340
and I convinced something we should do

00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:13,120
that and I learned how to do a bunch of

00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:15,190
stuff with my my little red JSP book and

00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:18,100
my Google like I was able to build a

00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:20,650
bunch of stuff so I did this with no

00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:22,630
experience and really no one teaching me

00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:25,960
how to do it I didn't know anything

00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:27,100
about testing I didn't know anything

00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,360
about back it so I didn't really know

00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:30,160
anything about service so I was like

00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:33,159
learning how to configure you know

00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:36,190
Apache to do the the whatever things to

00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:37,330
set up the the tomcat thing to set up

00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:38,680
this other thing and then I would go

00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:40,750
write a little bit of code and I'll just

00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:43,690
kind of make this thing work and it was

00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:45,810
just me and my server that like served

00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:49,420
the website off of my desk

00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:51,640
literally and and it was just like I

00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:55,810
made it work it mostly worked

00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:57,670
and it worked enough that the guy got a

00:08:55,810 --> 00:09:02,170
five million dollar grant to like make

00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:05,079
it like more real and at the time he is

00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:06,700
paying me like nothing right so and and

00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:08,920
everyone's making a ridiculous amount of

00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:11,230
money doing like the same exact kind of

00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:12,399
technology so I had a conversation where

00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:17,459
I was like I think you should pay me

00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:21,820
more than nothing and he's like well you

00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:22,930
know and and i think in in academics

00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:26,380
like people are really used to slave

00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:28,540
labor for some reason so so he's like

00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:29,649
well you know maybe and then there's all

00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,850
this stuff going on and there's all

00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:32,769
these jobs and i was like well i think

00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:34,899
how i should go do is go work for

00:09:32,769 --> 00:09:36,550
someone else because they'll pay me more

00:09:34,899 --> 00:09:38,440
money and I'm looking at the the job

00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:41,140
postings and in between that

00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:44,339
conversation and the date that I set to

00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:46,660
leave then you have September 11th and

00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:49,240
then and then no one would talk to you

00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:51,910
after that like it just basically like

00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,560
evaporated so there's no there's no work

00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:56,649
and every job that was posted had

00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:58,300
hundreds of resumes and you just you

00:09:56,649 --> 00:09:59,410
know it was it was ridiculous though

00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,790
because you you get in these

00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:03,579
conversations with the hiring manager

00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:05,529
and I was trying to I was I always try

00:10:03,579 --> 00:10:07,360
to be proactive or you know I'm getting

00:10:05,529 --> 00:10:08,680
better or worse said that depending on

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,660
how you look at it as my career goes

00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:12,130
along but I really ought to this guy's

00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:13,660
like hey you know I'm trying to try to

00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:15,519
make my way like can you give me some

00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:17,620
advice on how to do this better what

00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,180
about my resume he's like well we had

00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:20,649
all these things you know hundreds of

00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:22,930
them and we're only going to interview a

00:10:20,649 --> 00:10:25,000
dozen people and and so we decided to

00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:27,220
interview people that only had you know

00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,019
people anyone who didn't have ten years

00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:31,089
experience in Java we didn't we didn't

00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:37,560
interview them it's like hmm

00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:37,560
it's 2001 Java came out in 1995

00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:44,700
good luck so then I went to hide I went

00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:47,820
to hide from the economy so this is

00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:50,339
around 2002 and I went to grad school

00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:53,459
and I did a program diversity talk

00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:54,930
called computational science so it's

00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:57,120
basically envisioned as this bridge

00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:58,949
between the computer scientists who

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,050
didn't know how to do math in the math

00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:03,480
people who didn't know how to do

00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:05,250
computers and what I specialized or what

00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,260
I focus a lot on is building these by

00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:09,600
electric fields models and by electric

00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:11,970
fields and so we build these torso

00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:15,000
models with like the tissue and the

00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:16,380
anisotropic you know resistance and

00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,300
conductance across the tissue and then

00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:20,430
we would do these visualizations so ITA

00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:23,040
this class to do visualization of the

00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:25,980
bioelectric fields in in lots of stuff

00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:29,850
anyways it's pretty fun anyone go to

00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:33,240
grad school then he did they wish you

00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:35,190
were perpetually in grad school if you

00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:37,889
could make money doing that back to that

00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:40,980
slave labor thing but what I learned

00:11:37,889 --> 00:11:43,320
there which was formative is this idea

00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:45,720
of technical debt because this thing

00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:48,240
called ski run which is you could see

00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:50,880
it's how you would you'd be able to make

00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,430
these types of visualizations it was a

00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:56,100
project that had a five-year grant for

00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:58,800
like millions of dollars but the way

00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:00,630
that it was architected was this where

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,640
Conway's law comes in which is does

00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:03,899
anyone know Conway's law I use in like

00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:06,680
every talk so I start to assume people

00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:10,260
notice so Conway's law is this idea that

00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:12,540
organizations will build systems that

00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:14,910
mirror the communication structures of

00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:17,310
the organization right so if you

00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:19,410
communicate a certain like often this is

00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:22,260
this is true you know maseri product I

00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:24,360
see if you see API level problems then

00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:26,160
if this group doesn't talk to this group

00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:29,490
very well then you're gonna have that

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:31,949
problem like all the time so in in this

00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:34,620
project although I did learn to use

00:12:31,949 --> 00:12:38,040
source control you had a project that

00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:40,560
was this long-standing grant where the

00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:43,829
majority of the code was written by a

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:47,910
grad student who was only there maybe

00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:50,100
working on it for a year right and so

00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:50,850
like over a five year period you can

00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,920
imagine

00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:55,079
that all their incentives and all that

00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:59,430
communication was perfectly aligned with

00:12:55,079 --> 00:13:01,050
building great software it's what I like

00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:04,350
to use the mystically refer to as

00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:05,930
academic see and maybe some of you have

00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:08,819
seen or written some of this code before

00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:13,290
but there is really no what I would

00:13:08,819 --> 00:13:16,410
consider very mature process and in in

00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:18,600
most cases there's very little regard

00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:20,759
for the future it's like you have some

00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:24,000
little bit and the parts that I worked

00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:26,430
on were mostly about doing algebra so

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,190
the people had implemented a bunch of

00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:32,029
naive ways to do matrix multiplication

00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:35,100
and so I basically replace it all with

00:13:32,029 --> 00:13:36,480
the Fortran lepak libraries and did a

00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,399
bunch of stuff with that so I was mostly

00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:42,360
focused on the math part but super fun

00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:44,220
and then I graduated my wife start

00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,529
medical school and we had our first son

00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:49,009
in about two months span so that was the

00:13:46,529 --> 00:13:52,620
end of the rock-and-roll lifestyle

00:13:49,009 --> 00:13:55,130
clearly and and she decided that I

00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:55,130
should get a job

00:13:55,210 --> 00:14:02,410
and and try to feed us and I sent I sent

00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:04,030
out some resumes and put one on diced

00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:06,250
comment and then a recruiter called me

00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:08,170
and he's like will you go to this

00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:10,810
interview and I was like sure he's like

00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:13,420
on your resume it says vtk which stands

00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:15,130
for visualization toolkit and they need

00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:19,360
someone or they're looking for someone

00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:25,210
who knows gtk so that's that's pretty

00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:30,550
close so so go talk to him this is a

00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:33,730
true story so so I go to this this group

00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:36,100
and I spent I was there probably 40

00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:38,050
minutes and I talked to two people and

00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:39,340
one guy was in charge of marketing and

00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:41,350
what they were hiding for were they're

00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:42,880
looking for the time was someone to come

00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:44,370
and work on user interfaces for this

00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:47,410
device I'm gonna show you a second and

00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:49,300
they had a bunch of ideas about how that

00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:50,410
should work and they they had someone

00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:53,320
who didn't know how to code that was

00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:54,940
trying to work on them and they're just

00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:57,190
kind of desperate at that point and then

00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:59,830
I've been working on user interfaces and

00:14:57,190 --> 00:15:03,220
usability with respect to visualization

00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:05,800
and I started I have a I don't know

00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:07,540
character flaw but I get really fixated

00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,860
on little things and I want to go like

00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:11,680
find out all this stuff and so I got

00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:13,090
onto this stuff about usability and

00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,460
Jakob Nielsen and all these people are

00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:18,190
like write about usability and UX you

00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:19,690
know going back decade and so I was you

00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:21,310
know way into like all these ideas about

00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:22,780
how to do this and so they got excited

00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:23,980
about that and then I went across the

00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:26,230
hall and I talked to the VP of

00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:29,320
engineering and the VP of engineering is

00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:31,780
like looking at my stuff and then he's

00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:34,900
like so you've been doing math models

00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:37,240
and by electric fields in the torso of a

00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:38,800
human and then are you going to be bored

00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:42,190
working on user interfaces for like our

00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:45,070
crappy little device and I said I am

00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:48,820
pretty good at entertaining myself you

00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:52,670
say come back on Monday so

00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:55,250
so I joined this adventure where we we

00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:58,850
spent 26 million dollars and had really

00:15:55,250 --> 00:16:01,310
nothing to show for it then except for

00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:03,560
this Wikipedia article which you can go

00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:05,600
read if you look up black dog and Rome

00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:08,360
systems so we have this little thing

00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,710
we've made the boards we made the we had

00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,450
like a custom kernel that ran on this

00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:13,340
thing all the way up through this

00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:15,410
operating system this is some of the

00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:18,800
specs for the device and we had this big

00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:20,630
vision about solving identity and we

00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,660
were actually doing some things that are

00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:24,830
very much the same problems that

00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:26,810
everyone's trying to solve with the kind

00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:28,580
of IOT was like you had to provision

00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:31,460
this thing and what we did was build on

00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:33,470
the fly Debian packaging of the of the

00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:34,790
policy so your administrator could

00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,960
configure all these things that you're

00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:37,550
supposed to have access to in the

00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:39,650
backend and then it would make an

00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:41,330
on-demand Debian package of that and

00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:42,860
then when your key got online it would

00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:45,110
download just the things for you and it

00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:47,990
was like it was fun and it was one of

00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:49,880
the best is one of the best engineering

00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:52,100
teams I ever worked on and it was really

00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:54,350
formative for me so I worked with this

00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:57,110
guy who wrote the book on make like he

00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:59,060
literally wrote this book on on can you

00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:00,770
make and he taught me a bunch of things

00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:02,960
about how to think about problems and it

00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:04,819
wasn't so much like do this do this do

00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:06,560
this it's like you should not implement

00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:08,720
something until you thought about three

00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:10,370
ways to do it right you should you know

00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:15,890
like you should test these things and he

00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:17,630
had I I had a one time I was because we

00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:19,610
were cross compiling these things for

00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:21,890
this little chip on our Linux machine so

00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:23,630
he and it's funny now cuz everyone's all

00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:25,730
excited about containers but we were

00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:27,140
have these like chroot environments to

00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:29,360
go build this stuff and like put it onto

00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:30,950
these devices and he and he's like

00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,480
you're not testing it you're code for

00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:35,210
this interface for this other thing and

00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:37,610
I was like it's impossible he's like no

00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:40,490
it's not and I was like it's impossible

00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:41,660
I tried it's like okay okay I'm gonna

00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:45,020
come and we're gonna pair and we're

00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:48,050
gonna make it work I was like okay so so

00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:50,270
he came over to my desk and after like

00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:52,370
literally two hours one day of like

00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:54,530
trying to get all this testing like and

00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:56,360
where is boost and C++ to like do this

00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:58,250
thing and test and he had like these

00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:00,440
high aspirations and finally he's like

00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:01,460
he just tapped out he's like fine you

00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:05,860
don't have to test that

00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:05,860
I wanted to I really wanted to gonna do

00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:11,450
but the thing that was interesting here

00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:13,640
is it was a like perfect display of

00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:15,230
colonies log in and there are all these

00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,610
little kind of Game of Thrones ideas

00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:18,190
about the different teams and everyone

00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:21,230
on this thing and I kind of broke it

00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:22,940
accidentally because I was working on

00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:25,220
this like C code and like platformer

00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:27,169
code on this one side and then there's

00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:30,220
this Java side where they did the actual

00:18:27,169 --> 00:18:32,840
server stuff to do the configuration and

00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:35,000
I'd implemented a bunch of stuff that

00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:36,559
needed to have the server put together

00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,630
those configs and then push them to the

00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:40,190
devices and I wouldn't talk to this guy

00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:42,590
you look for weeks or whatever and he's

00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:43,549
like you know oh that's awesome that's

00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:44,779
awesome I was like well when do you

00:18:43,549 --> 00:18:47,510
think we're gonna see this system work

00:18:44,779 --> 00:18:51,020
in 10 and he's like well it's not in my

00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:54,200
sprint it's not in my stories like what

00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:56,330
the okay talking about why do you think

00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:59,419
I spent all this time explain how this

00:18:56,330 --> 00:19:01,159
work like don't you get this like we sit

00:18:59,419 --> 00:19:02,659
and we hear the vision for what this

00:19:01,159 --> 00:19:04,250
proc supposed to do like aren't why are

00:19:02,659 --> 00:19:07,610
you connected to this cathedral or

00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:08,840
trying to build and then so my solution

00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:11,419
was basically didn't just go implement

00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:13,610
it on the on the Java server which made

00:19:11,419 --> 00:19:15,169
everyone mad well not everyone it made

00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:17,120
some people very happy because now this

00:19:15,169 --> 00:19:18,470
thing worked but it made the people who

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,580
thought that that was their code very

00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:23,720
unhappy and then as a result the

00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:25,340
vice-president engineering decided it

00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:27,679
was better for everyone to get work done

00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:29,059
and I have this ownership so he

00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,799
dissolved all the teams and everyone

00:19:29,059 --> 00:19:32,210
just became one pool and then then it

00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:33,710
was like a free-for-all for me I was

00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:35,149
like I'm gonna learn how the kernel

00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:37,250
works and like I could go do that stuff

00:19:35,149 --> 00:19:39,020
and then the next week I just grabbed a

00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:41,990
story from you know whatever part of the

00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:44,390
system I want to so that was a really

00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:46,370
rapid iteration of my levelling up on

00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:48,260
how computers work and and there's

00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:50,919
enough stuff that I wouldn't have been

00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:53,270
able to do inside of another

00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:55,220
organization but one of the things this

00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:58,159
did for me is like I disassociated my

00:19:55,220 --> 00:20:00,049
identity from any aspect of anything

00:19:58,159 --> 00:20:02,240
right like I don't care if you're a

00:20:00,049 --> 00:20:04,700
sysadmin or your developer or your Java

00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:07,460
guy or a C++ look guy like it's just

00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:08,690
it's just something you just do like you

00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:10,970
want to make it work you make it work

00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:13,960
right like if you attach your identity

00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:15,220
to things I think that's limiting and as

00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:19,029
and that kind of comes back to play in

00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:20,710
the in a dev off story so then the next

00:20:19,029 --> 00:20:22,870
thing that happens is that company runs

00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:25,090
out of money and they go from basically

00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:27,520
a hundred people down to fifteen people

00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:30,730
in six months and I was in the layoffs

00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:32,590
between my friends who were getting two

00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:34,510
weeks severance and my friends who

00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:37,720
missed paychecks so like my group was

00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:39,330
just hey don't come back and then but I

00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:41,610
didn't ever missed eight paychecks and

00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:43,899
well here's another aside because we

00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:46,840
developed all this expertise on flash

00:20:43,899 --> 00:20:48,880
and the team that we worked on there is

00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,980
they eventually built fusion-io

00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,470
I don't know does anyone know confusion

00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:54,669
I always so that it's already been

00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:56,049
depend on when I signed I would have

00:20:54,669 --> 00:21:01,000
been like the fifth to the ninth

00:20:56,049 --> 00:21:02,740
employee at fusion-io and but the deal

00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,029
was they're like hey we know we just

00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:05,980
unraveled and like you didn't get

00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:08,620
paychecks and like your friends didn't

00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:09,970
get paychecks and then we might be able

00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:12,700
to pay you in nine months when we raise

00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:13,870
money or these guys across town had just

00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,399
raised their five million dollar 80

00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:18,190
around and they're like we'll pay you a

00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:20,470
six-figure salary so that was a really

00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:25,149
easy decision for my wife too for my

00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:27,460
wife to make I'm losing my mic I think

00:21:25,149 --> 00:21:30,250
oh no that's just the card fair we can

00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:32,620
still hear me okay so then this was kind

00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:34,690
of the opposite so the the first team I

00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:36,039
worked on was a drain team from an

00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:38,529
engineering perspective and we have this

00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:40,529
deep expertise across the wide a bunch

00:21:38,529 --> 00:21:43,539
of things but we had this pathological

00:21:40,529 --> 00:21:46,330
understanding of our business and in

00:21:43,539 --> 00:21:49,779
this other startup we had actually a

00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:53,440
very clear business mission and we had

00:21:49,779 --> 00:21:57,760
pathological technology so we had a CTO

00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:59,320
who had a CS degree and had never worked

00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,419
for anyone had never had any mentoring

00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:03,669
who could type a higher in 20 words a

00:22:01,419 --> 00:22:07,110
minute and he could fix any problem in

00:22:03,669 --> 00:22:10,929
the universe with another if or six and

00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:13,600
so that was that was the codebase was

00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:17,770
like this his specialty was the if/else

00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:20,770
Plinko is that it was it was in three

00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:23,980
places across JSP Zen code the AFL's

00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:27,039
Plinko had to magically construct the

00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:27,610
the string that got put straight into

00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:29,440
the JTP

00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:30,910
see to call the database and come back

00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:34,540
out and then you had to have the same

00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:35,770
if-else Plinko to recover the result and

00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:39,010
then yeah it was terrible

00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:41,020
I had a contest once at a conference

00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:44,950
about who who saw the worst code ever

00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:46,990
and you know after about an hour into

00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:49,810
this this meal everyone was just tapping

00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:52,870
out they're like no we win and I was

00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:54,460
even to the good parts yet like it was

00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:57,700
it was amazing so that what I learned

00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:59,500
there is kind of opposite lessons but I

00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:01,360
was I was really empowered there's like

00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,680
one of the first places where I wasn't

00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:05,080
used to developer like Austin and I

00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:07,870
could do do things that other people

00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:09,400
couldn't do I was able to I was put in

00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:11,050
charge of a bunch of stuff because I

00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:15,640
proved I could solve these problems

00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:20,110
really rapidly and then the the CEO kind

00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:22,360
of he couldn't he couldn't undermine his

00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:24,040
CTO but he kind of knew they're in

00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:26,230
trouble and so he put me in this

00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:28,750
position to to act as like a check-in

00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:31,510
balance and and then I learned a bunch

00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:33,490
of stuff about Team Dynamics and and

00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:35,890
more Conway's law but what we'd built

00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:39,130
looked suspiciously like like this

00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:39,760
rubric Goldberg machine and we had a lot

00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:41,860
of automation

00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:46,060
I mean we're deploying at that time this

00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:49,030
is like 2006 ish our our infrastructure

00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:50,860
was roughly like 50 servers each of

00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:52,300
those were like 8 cores like they're

00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:55,870
they're pretty beefy servers for the day

00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:56,530
and we're doing about 30 million dollars

00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:58,510
in revenue

00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:59,590
I'm not revenue but transactions through

00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:02,380
and we were taking like a small piece of

00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:04,840
that so this was sky high we did stuff

00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:06,970
like we had I didn't know anything other

00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:08,590
than what I'd learned and most of what I

00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:11,080
learned wasn't really about doing these

00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:12,580
large-scale deployments on servers up to

00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:16,060
that and those aren't really large scale

00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:19,540
in retrospect but we we shared a bunch

00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:24,670
of stuff you know there's the the do it

00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:26,350
now Sh do it now dot si or do it now

00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:28,210
five you know like you just keep like

00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:31,440
changing these things and share them and

00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:31,440
this is kind of what things look like

00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:37,230
and so that that story that narrative is

00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:38,760
really you know everyday you'd go to

00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:41,640
work and if you did a deployment the

00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:43,530
night before then you're often greeted

00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:45,630
by a bunch of emails from your East

00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:47,640
Coast clients who hadn't been able to do

00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:50,370
transactions on their ecommerce store

00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:51,780
because you broke the way checkout works

00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:52,680
or something and this was a pretty

00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:55,110
common

00:24:52,680 --> 00:25:01,080
has anyone ever lived this movie and

00:24:55,110 --> 00:25:04,230
never seen this so as it turns out my

00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:06,840
roommate from Reed College was Luke and

00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:09,360
Luke had already sort of thought a

00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:12,390
little bit about this and I had been

00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:14,640
part of the puppet community and I've

00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:17,100
made some commits to it but it wasn't

00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,360
really a business yet and it was you

00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:20,100
know as I told you a bit more of my

00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:22,260
story it was kind of hard to convince my

00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:24,330
wife that the way this should work is

00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:26,700
I'm gonna go with my roommate from

00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:28,430
college and we're gonna make software

00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:30,690
we're gonna give it away for free and

00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:34,440
it's gonna be awesome it's gonna work

00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:37,260
out well while she's doing her 80 hours

00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:39,930
a week medical school stuff but the

00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:42,780
thing that that really happened you

00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:44,610
mentally for me is and a lot of this

00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:45,780
I'll give you no credit to Luke's

00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:47,340
perspective and there's a ton of people

00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:49,950
influenced how I think about this stuff

00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:52,230
some of them are here and I'll get to

00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:53,190
velocity in a minute but we really

00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:55,080
wanted to change the relationship

00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:56,220
between people and computers we want to

00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:58,440
change the way that people thought about

00:25:56,220 --> 00:26:01,860
their computers we didn't want to have

00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:03,210
the do at five as the way that people

00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:05,910
thought about it like we wanted to get

00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:08,610
it so you could consistently manage

00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:11,280
these complex systems at scale in a way

00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:13,010
that you know basically very few people

00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:14,550
outside of some of these other

00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:16,890
organization I'm going to talk about a

00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:18,360
second we're able to do but what turns

00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:20,070
out and this is part of the Cloud

00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:21,990
Foundry story is you actually need to

00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:24,990
change the relationship between people

00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:26,460
and other people as much or more than

00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:28,170
you need to change the relationship

00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:30,180
between people and the computers because

00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:32,370
going back to Conway's law if you have a

00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:35,460
bunch of different ideas about how the

00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:37,800
world works then you're probably or god

00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:38,940
forbid different incentives then you're

00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:41,610
probably not going to do the greatest

00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:44,260
job with your computers and so this is

00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:46,400
the this DevOps story

00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:48,500
everyone's read the Gartner report on

00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:51,620
DevOps and how you need to change your

00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:53,059
culture but I don't think you can really

00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:56,240
talk about DevOps if you don't talk

00:26:53,059 --> 00:26:57,860
about velocity and I'm gonna I think I'm

00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,779
going to bring up some ideas that people

00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:02,840
haven't thought of before or at least

00:26:59,779 --> 00:27:04,220
not articulated and this is a conference

00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:08,090
that I could say the first devops

00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:12,740
conference this is certainly a slide

00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:15,860
that was was this is from velocity 2009

00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:18,320
John all spa and Paul Hammond giving the

00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:21,110
talk about ten deploys to Tim deploys

00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:23,690
per day at Flickr and they had they had

00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:25,399
these slides and for some of us who'd

00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:27,710
kind of been around them and been around

00:27:25,399 --> 00:27:30,169
this conversation it was just like oh

00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:31,610
yeah you know Paul and John they like do

00:27:30,169 --> 00:27:33,500
this thing and there had been a bunch of

00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:35,120
these threads but for people who'd not

00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:38,890
been in that world it hadn't thought

00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:43,159
this way hadn't seen this stuff is like

00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:45,679
and will come to more that this is

00:27:43,159 --> 00:27:46,429
actually the first recorded use of the

00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:48,860
word DevOps

00:27:46,429 --> 00:27:53,899
and these are from that session have

00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:57,409
velocity and this is my Twitter so this

00:27:53,899 --> 00:28:00,440
is a July 3rd 2009 I just cut and pasted

00:27:57,409 --> 00:28:02,419
that image from Twitter this morning and

00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:04,399
the you know we're having the same

00:28:02,419 --> 00:28:07,429
conversation but this basically hasn't

00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:09,409
really changed since then it's just it's

00:28:07,429 --> 00:28:11,899
propagating through the rest of the

00:28:09,409 --> 00:28:13,870
industry but the thing I want to draw

00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:17,950
attention to with respect to M or

00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:21,250
velocity is velocity was started as a

00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:24,220
guy from Amazon and a guy from Google as

00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:27,100
the chairs putting together this program

00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:30,320
around web operations and performance

00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:32,480
and what what that represented was as I

00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,330
mentioned earlier these communities of

00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:37,610
practice coming together and sharing

00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:40,490
their ideas sharing their successes

00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:42,799
sharing their failures you know that

00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:44,899
some of the most interesting things and

00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:48,320
this is interesting especially in a

00:28:44,899 --> 00:28:51,020
culture where it's very blame 'full that

00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:52,760
that you share your your failures right

00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:54,350
you let people understand how you failed

00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:57,020
so they don't fail again so they don't

00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:57,890
feel like you but everyone everyone

00:28:57,020 --> 00:29:00,679
hears about

00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:01,850
and this this bookstore you got has

00:29:00,679 --> 00:29:05,899
anyone ever ordered anything from this

00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:09,710
bookstore my wife gets like three boxes

00:29:05,899 --> 00:29:11,299
a day from Amazon but this is this is

00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:12,620
the last public thing I heard them

00:29:11,299 --> 00:29:16,730
saying and this a couple of years old

00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:18,350
now but according to my sources this is

00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:20,600
actually an order of magnitude off now

00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:25,580
so they're they're closer to a

00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:27,200
deployment every second you know they

00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:29,390
might not say that out loud but that's

00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,590
that's roughly what I would imagine but

00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:32,630
then you have to understand and we'll

00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:35,299
get to this in a minute is that's not

00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:38,389
like monolithic deployment right that's

00:29:35,299 --> 00:29:42,200
like thousands and thousands of services

00:29:38,389 --> 00:29:44,059
each being updated independently this is

00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:46,399
this is a quote from Verna Vogel she

00:29:44,059 --> 00:29:48,250
knows who Verner is and tells you on the

00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:50,600
slide so hopefully you can figure it out

00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:54,139
and I won't read I won't read all of it

00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:56,510
but if you haven't this is from 2006 so

00:29:54,139 --> 00:29:59,870
this is three years before anyone said

00:29:56,510 --> 00:30:02,870
that word DevOps he said Amazon if you

00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:04,399
build it you run it right if he this

00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:05,840
brings developers into contact with the

00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:07,760
day-to-day operation of their software

00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:12,470
it also brings them into day-to-day

00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:14,450
contact with the customer and it will

00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:17,210
change the dynamic of your organization

00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:19,250
very very quickly if the person who is

00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:21,289
going to feel the pain for a bad

00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:24,710
decision on their code actually gets

00:30:21,289 --> 00:30:26,149
paged for that bad decision like changes

00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:29,000
state and I don't think anything changes

00:30:26,149 --> 00:30:30,409
things faster right and it's one thing

00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,539
to connect incentives and a bunch of

00:30:30,409 --> 00:30:36,700
stuff but if you if you move pain to the

00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:38,779
right places like it goes away all right

00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:40,100
just a quick aside does anyone know the

00:30:38,779 --> 00:30:40,730
experiment where they like give the guys

00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:42,139
the shocker

00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:45,799
this like a classic California

00:30:42,139 --> 00:30:48,139
experiment humans are weird man what are

00:30:45,799 --> 00:30:51,620
we doing it's like you're just gonna

00:30:48,139 --> 00:30:53,600
shock the guy all right so everyone

00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:56,269
looks at Amazon and they rush to copy

00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:58,880
this there's like oh there's the cloud

00:30:56,269 --> 00:31:02,000
Amazon's advantage is not the fact that

00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:03,440
they put API in front hypervisors right

00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,940
like I think that if you look at some of

00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,320
the stuff that's happened with other

00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:08,389
attempts to make open-source solutions

00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,649
to that problem you realize it's not

00:31:08,389 --> 00:31:11,990
that's not the hard part

00:31:09,649 --> 00:31:14,539
these are superficial feature

00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:16,700
and really the big advantage Amazon has

00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:18,320
is the is the process of the culture

00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:20,119
that produced I'm the artist

00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:23,080
those are artifacts of this other thing

00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:25,009
and there they have a huge advantage

00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:27,169
against most other people in this space

00:31:25,009 --> 00:31:28,700
although you know there's a short list

00:31:27,169 --> 00:31:31,190
of people that could compete with them

00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:33,350
with respect to operating a massive web

00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:34,840
infrastructure at scale I don't know

00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:39,799
what just happened

00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:41,720
with the the cost of operating that is

00:31:39,799 --> 00:31:44,210
something that they are able to press

00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:45,889
down and down and down which is why they

00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:47,480
can provide that level of service they

00:31:45,889 --> 00:31:49,429
can at the price of that they can and

00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:51,710
that's why you're seeing roughly 30

00:31:49,429 --> 00:31:54,019
percent decrease in the cost of their of

00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:56,509
their services year to year over the

00:31:54,019 --> 00:31:58,580
last four or five years this is from

00:31:56,509 --> 00:32:01,039
O'Reilly radar which is also kind of

00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:03,710
related to to velocity and they're

00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:05,149
arguing here that operations is the

00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:06,470
secret sauce and they're talking about

00:32:05,149 --> 00:32:08,360
startups so what you're seeing on the

00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:12,590
left is what we'll call you know the

00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:14,659
do-it 5sh solution to operations and on

00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:16,820
the right it's more of you know the

00:32:14,659 --> 00:32:19,549
configuration management style like very

00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:22,070
policy driven collapsing the complexity

00:32:19,549 --> 00:32:24,230
with systems that can enforce across

00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:26,059
your your full infrastructure so in the

00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:28,249
bottom what they're trying to show is

00:32:26,059 --> 00:32:30,049
the server so you have you did a bunch

00:32:28,249 --> 00:32:31,940
of work you start your deployment that

00:32:30,049 --> 00:32:35,389
that peak there is the first deployment

00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:36,860
to to production and then as you grow

00:32:35,389 --> 00:32:39,259
servers if you're using kind of

00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:41,119
traditional IT then the cost of doing

00:32:39,259 --> 00:32:43,249
that is going to continue to go up

00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:46,730
linearly where if you've if you've done

00:32:43,249 --> 00:32:49,309
this work to make the kind of the

00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:51,830
configuration a non-issue then it's

00:32:49,309 --> 00:32:53,749
still going to go up but your your your

00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:55,460
linear factor is much much lower and so

00:32:53,749 --> 00:32:57,740
your your overall total cost of

00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:59,480
ownership is much lower and the thing

00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:01,490
that you have to understand if you're

00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:03,289
building services which it seems like it

00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:04,999
takes a lot of people a while to get is

00:33:03,289 --> 00:33:07,429
that day two matters right like

00:33:04,999 --> 00:33:10,340
deployment is the price you pay to get

00:33:07,429 --> 00:33:12,499
to your real problems and if you think

00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:13,970
about you know everyone kind of over

00:33:12,499 --> 00:33:16,730
rotates on developers developers

00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:18,769
developers if you are going to do the

00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:21,919
math about what it costs to own

00:33:18,769 --> 00:33:23,840
something then the on some timeline the

00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:25,309
cost of ownership if it's high to

00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:29,720
operate it then now

00:33:25,309 --> 00:33:31,759
dwarf dwarf the development costs right

00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:34,639
if it's high that the time that it takes

00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:37,039
to equal that is is very very short but

00:33:34,639 --> 00:33:38,539
but many whatever for whatever reason

00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:41,960
many organizations don't internalize

00:33:38,539 --> 00:33:44,659
that so what I want people understand

00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:47,809
here is that these are really things

00:33:44,659 --> 00:33:50,269
that emerge from from principles right

00:33:47,809 --> 00:33:53,090
when you see someone using puppet that's

00:33:50,269 --> 00:33:55,249
not DevOps right if you see someone

00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:58,490
using any tool Cloud Foundry it doesn't

00:33:55,249 --> 00:34:01,100
matter that's not that's not DevOps so

00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:02,389
the principles are the greatest thing if

00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:05,059
you understand that then you can

00:34:02,389 --> 00:34:07,100
flexibly change to whatever you have to

00:34:05,059 --> 00:34:08,899
deal with the practices that will

00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:10,579
naturally emerge as you understand these

00:34:08,899 --> 00:34:12,470
things are one thing and then the tools

00:34:10,579 --> 00:34:14,300
are the last artifact that's the lowest

00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:16,520
level thing about what we're talking

00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:18,079
about so let's rewind I'm going to keep

00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:19,490
going and we're gonna go really fast so

00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:21,319
let's rewind that so software in the

00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:23,510
beginning we had a bunch of stuff we

00:34:21,319 --> 00:34:25,099
shipped it on CDs it was hard to change

00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:26,810
after release it runs other people's

00:34:25,099 --> 00:34:28,220
computers you don't have to really worry

00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:30,290
about bugs because it's out there on

00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:32,899
someone else's computer the processes

00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:34,310
don't run really long right like you you

00:34:32,899 --> 00:34:36,290
turn off your computer and you come back

00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:39,710
so it doesn't matter if has memory leaks

00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:41,480
so much and there's no real uptime new

00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:45,889
memory leaks who made some memory links

00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:48,649
before that's right so you don't and

00:34:45,889 --> 00:34:50,329
this is all really to me like there's

00:34:48,649 --> 00:34:51,889
this story about and this is what's

00:34:50,329 --> 00:34:53,629
powerful about software development is

00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:56,089
you could take ideas that you can just

00:34:53,629 --> 00:35:00,140
make stuff right like you manifest ideas

00:34:56,089 --> 00:35:01,579
that's code that's powerful so this is

00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:03,170
the process in traditional thing you

00:35:01,579 --> 00:35:05,030
have a good idea you request a server

00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:06,650
you get his purchase order you wait you

00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:08,240
wait the server arrives the server gets

00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:10,040
power network server gets operating

00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:12,680
system start to configure for the

00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:14,060
deployment and yeah this this admin and

00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:15,770
he keeps all this stuff running he

00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:18,589
doesn't care about your application he's

00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:20,839
not paid to care he's waiting other

00:35:18,589 --> 00:35:22,490
people need their service too and he's a

00:35:20,839 --> 00:35:24,980
cost center anyway so he doesn't carry

00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:26,450
and he has to worry about not just all

00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:30,050
these servers but also probably email

00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:32,510
and maybe God forbid printers so then

00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:34,250
you shift to servers your services right

00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:35,240
so like now we're not going to ship CDs

00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:37,069
we're gonna have services so the

00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:38,630
internet changes all this we run things

00:35:37,069 --> 00:35:39,530
on other computers there are computers

00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:41,750
we can change those can

00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:43,970
anytime we want you stop to worry about

00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:45,560
bugs and processes now we're in a really

00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:47,630
long time and on time becomes everything

00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:49,640
right like that's this transition that

00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:52,810
not everyone in the industry is made but

00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:56,690
that the the big web lives and dies by

00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:58,250
and and we'll get to this platform store

00:35:56,690 --> 00:36:00,710
in a minute so then this is bigger

00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:02,240
faster there's a Google Data Center and

00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:05,450
you always hear people say where we

00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:08,830
can't do this we're the enterprise our

00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:12,950
ways are different we have this thing

00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:14,210
right and it's like what our strategy is

00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:19,850
is we're going to just slow everything

00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:23,570
down and and this is this moving slow is

00:36:19,850 --> 00:36:26,180
an advantage how I don't know so this is

00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:28,010
a this is a classic slide from velocity

00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:29,480
conference talks I gave and use it all

00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:30,470
over so you have developers and

00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:32,020
operations what you're going to do is

00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:34,940
you're gonna put a wall between them

00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:37,190
probably a ticket system and then

00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:40,180
everyone's unhappy and then this is

00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:40,180
pretty much what happens

00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:47,020
so our misaligned missing light

00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:50,110
incentives an advantage that's really

00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:52,960
not how the web was built I'd like no

00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:54,130
one at Google or Amazon I mean there's

00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,240
an info sack and there's a bunch of

00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:57,100
other stuff and so there's definitely

00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:59,110
still gating it's not a free-for-all

00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:01,420
I'll get to that in a minute but it's

00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:03,370
not a competitive advantage if you have

00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:05,830
to go through this this kind of process

00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:07,450
and what's what's evolved or what we're

00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:11,140
talking about now is these narratives

00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:12,760
around platform DevOps

00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:15,760
contagious delivery micro-services who's

00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:17,380
read any of these books so contagious

00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:20,800
delivery is a great book chess humble is

00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:23,350
a great writer the Phoenix project is

00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:25,570
really a rewrite of the goal which is

00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:27,730
the theory constraints framed with IT

00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:30,430
and release it is a bunch of patterns

00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:32,230
for this kind of stuff you see in the

00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:35,200
blue or Netflix open source with respect

00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:36,820
to some of these patterns so then we

00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,770
have this new narrative that's emerging

00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:40,750
and we have a bunch of new tools and and

00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:42,430
this is definitely part of my story so

00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:44,590
now we have a new process and the

00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:48,280
process is I have a good idea and I get

00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:50,140
a server and I can make cloudy API calls

00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:52,360
right and so I get a server in minutes

00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:54,280
now and I run my configuration tools and

00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:55,410
then in minutes everything's up and

00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:58,270
that's pretty cool

00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:59,170
principles practice tools but then

00:37:58,270 --> 00:38:02,260
there's this guy

00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:03,880
you know so this is now he's a venture

00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:06,760
capitalist so he turned to the dark side

00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:09,610
but he said he used to lead a lot of the

00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:11,230
cloud stuff in Netflix and hit these are

00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:12,460
these are like straight stolen from some

00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:15,250
his presentations so he's like this is

00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:17,920
what I learned speed wins remove

00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:19,630
friction from the product height height

00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,310
rest low process no handoff between

00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:24,010
teams I think this is the hardest thing

00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:26,290
for a lot of the people who have really

00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:29,950
ingrained you know their identity in

00:38:26,290 --> 00:38:31,330
these processes to overcome freedom and

00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:33,370
responsibility culture we're not going

00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:35,620
to cover everything with all these rules

00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:37,570
what we're going to create is a bunch of

00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:39,010
highly empowered people that can take

00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:42,310
responsibility for our success or

00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:45,040
failure and then don't redo things that

00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:47,020
you not to do right and use simple

00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:48,670
patterns automated by tooling this is

00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:51,310
like work forward off of his

00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:53,350
presentation self-service cloud this is

00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:54,309
the key self-service cloud makes

00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:57,459
impossible things

00:38:54,309 --> 00:38:59,319
instant and this is something that every

00:38:57,459 --> 00:39:01,119
kind of DevOps project always aspired to

00:38:59,319 --> 00:39:04,930
you is like be able to give you

00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:07,509
self-service right but rarely you get to

00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:08,769
there because there's all these other

00:39:07,509 --> 00:39:09,880
things you have to solve it's one thing

00:39:08,769 --> 00:39:11,650
to configure servers how you're gonna

00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:13,719
solve the role Baysox it's how are you

00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:15,309
gonna do the API to do the orchestration

00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:16,479
and then get the server and then you run

00:39:15,309 --> 00:39:18,039
your puppet right like there's a bunch

00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:19,689
of other stuff and everyone aspires to

00:39:18,039 --> 00:39:21,549
do that but very few people actually get

00:39:19,689 --> 00:39:23,650
there I've got there before with those

00:39:21,549 --> 00:39:26,109
tools I think your integrated solution

00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:27,489
is a better way to go so here's another

00:39:26,109 --> 00:39:28,779
thing I want everyone in this room to

00:39:27,489 --> 00:39:30,880
internalize especially if you work for

00:39:28,779 --> 00:39:32,079
enterprise but we're in enterprise we do

00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,539
not have the talent to do this this is a

00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:36,400
quote from from Adrian as well but

00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:40,619
Netflix has a superstar development team

00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:44,439
and we don't this is what he told them

00:39:40,619 --> 00:39:47,109
we hired them from you we hired all

00:39:44,439 --> 00:39:51,759
those people from you and we got other

00:39:47,109 --> 00:39:53,739
way so this is this is this impact of

00:39:51,759 --> 00:39:55,809
back size so I want people understand

00:39:53,739 --> 00:39:57,640
when we start talking about rapid

00:39:55,809 --> 00:40:00,609
changes to these infrastructures it's

00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:02,979
actually safer so if you imagine risk

00:40:00,609 --> 00:40:04,299
accumulating as you write code and then

00:40:02,979 --> 00:40:07,779
every time you do a deployment it comes

00:40:04,299 --> 00:40:09,789
back down then if you do big batches the

00:40:07,779 --> 00:40:13,359
amount of risk you're exposing yourself

00:40:09,789 --> 00:40:15,489
to is higher your exposure to the risk

00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:17,499
is less frequent but the actual total

00:40:15,489 --> 00:40:19,689
risk is higher and just think about it

00:40:17,499 --> 00:40:22,029
mentally if I do a deployment of

00:40:19,689 --> 00:40:24,939
something I wrote an hour ago and

00:40:22,029 --> 00:40:27,699
there's an actual problem then it's not

00:40:24,939 --> 00:40:29,529
a big mystery where that code is I can

00:40:27,699 --> 00:40:31,539
go fix it immediately and so you're

00:40:29,529 --> 00:40:33,789
minimizing your time to recover and

00:40:31,539 --> 00:40:35,559
you're not not worried about about the

00:40:33,789 --> 00:40:37,420
impact because you know you can minimize

00:40:35,559 --> 00:40:39,009
it very fast and so what's happening in

00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:41,859
these web companies is their time to

00:40:39,009 --> 00:40:43,630
recover goes to almost zero and so

00:40:41,859 --> 00:40:45,729
they're they're very plus they have

00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:47,410
continuous delivery is predicated on

00:40:45,729 --> 00:40:48,789
continuous integration if you don't have

00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:50,829
culture of testing if you'll have a

00:40:48,789 --> 00:40:52,799
culture of monitoring then don't do this

00:40:50,829 --> 00:40:54,910
stuff but as you get those capabilities

00:40:52,799 --> 00:40:57,519
then then you should aspire to do this

00:40:54,910 --> 00:41:00,900
because it's both faster and safer and

00:40:57,519 --> 00:41:03,459
you want to go faster because john-boy

00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:05,109
well I don't have time to get to Lou the

00:41:03,459 --> 00:41:07,599
loop and I'm way over time and I still

00:41:05,109 --> 00:41:08,320
have more slide so it's not necessary to

00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:11,580
change

00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:14,109
survival is not mandatory Edward Deming

00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:16,600
so Netflix build a platform to enable

00:41:14,109 --> 00:41:18,190
self-service deployment they build a

00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:20,410
platform to deploy and operate micro

00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:22,810
services they build a platform to

00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:24,490
continuously deliver software they build

00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:27,670
a platform that could protect itself

00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:30,490
from failure what Netflix did not do is

00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:33,190
build a platform for general ad hoc

00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:35,980
automation that's another thing people

00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:39,310
you understand because the platform

00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:42,220
makes promises and the constraints are

00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:44,770
the contract that allows the platform to

00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:46,840
keep those promises so we start thinking

00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:49,510
about 12 factor apps and that's that's

00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:52,359
the contract that Heroku decided to make

00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:54,250
with their platform and there's a bunch

00:41:52,359 --> 00:41:56,410
of other platform contracts you could

00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:58,780
imagine but if you if you just allow

00:41:56,410 --> 00:42:01,210
anything then you didn't really solve

00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:02,320
anything either right and then you're

00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:04,090
right back to trying to figure out

00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:05,890
what's wrong when you have a problem if

00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:07,390
you collapse what you're what you're

00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:13,090
able to do those constraints are

00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:16,150
actually enabling because 8020 rule that

00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:19,440
you can get 80% of the benefit from 20%

00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:19,440
of the features most of time

00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:26,230
so DevOps refers to the practices and

00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:29,110
tools that emerge from high-performing

00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:31,300
organizations and continuous delivery as

00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:36,610
a result as a consequence of that

00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:40,510
practice and this is not possible with

00:42:36,610 --> 00:42:41,950
gating and handoffs now we could debate

00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:44,890
continuous because there's like a

00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:47,110
quantum of delivery but in reality like

00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:48,810
you want to shrink your batch size and

00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:52,300
you want to shrink the cost of delivery

00:42:48,810 --> 00:42:55,170
because it's not possible it's untenable

00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:57,310
if the fixed cost of deployment is hot

00:42:55,170 --> 00:42:59,470
if you have a high fixed cost of

00:42:57,310 --> 00:43:03,700
deployment then you do it all the time

00:42:59,470 --> 00:43:06,580
that's expensive right and microservices

00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:08,530
is just a description of the post cloud

00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:11,670
post DevOps post continuously deliver

00:43:08,530 --> 00:43:14,260
post continuous delivery architecture

00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:17,860
it's not it's a natural evolution so

00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:19,750
this baseline operational capability

00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:22,750
that you get when you can do a

00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:24,610
deployment on demand and then the other

00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:27,040
thing that this is giving you as the

00:43:24,610 --> 00:43:29,620
Team Dynamics to leverage Conway's law

00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:31,240
because you're decoupling the amount of

00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:34,330
people that need to be involved by

00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:37,060
enforcing the contract and the API as

00:43:34,330 --> 00:43:38,650
your as your communication then you can

00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:42,010
decouple so each of those can be

00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:43,330
deployed them independently like that's

00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:47,200
the whole point of micro services is

00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:48,730
that you have loose coupling right there

00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:50,740
if you have to deploy them all together

00:43:48,730 --> 00:43:52,840
then you don't really have micro

00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:55,720
services what you have is a monolith

00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:56,980
that you broke apart right you didn't

00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:59,230
you didn't actually get to micro service

00:43:56,980 --> 00:44:00,580
because you're not decoupled and I'm

00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:02,290
gonna argue that continuously delivered

00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:04,390
micro services are the natural evolution

00:44:02,290 --> 00:44:08,650
for services that need to run at scale

00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:10,810
and be changed frequently and that a

00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:14,580
bunch of people built platforms to do

00:44:10,810 --> 00:44:14,580
this but those are one-off platforms

00:44:15,490 --> 00:44:20,570
and that continuous delivery is a wide

00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:22,970
DevOps as a how and microservices or

00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:23,750
what but all of them you basically need

00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:26,420
a platform

00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:28,010
you can't until you can take arbitrary

00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:31,460
code and put on a server and have it run

00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:33,050
you can't do confuse delivery right

00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:36,050
until you can have something that is

00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:38,000
relatively monitored and and safe and

00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:40,670
maybe even self-healing you can't really

00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,050
do micro services and and to be able to

00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:43,430
do that to build all the scaffolding

00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:46,640
around doing that that looks

00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:49,940
suspiciously like a platform do you want

00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:53,720
to build one by yourself there's this

00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:55,070
thing maybe you've heard of it and maybe

00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:57,760
maybe you don't to build one by yourself

00:44:55,070 --> 00:45:00,650
but me we can build one together and

00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:03,200
this is the new process you have a good

00:45:00,650 --> 00:45:04,940
idea push code to the platform it's

00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:06,830
running in seconds self-service

00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:10,730
self-healing and we all live happily

00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:12,650
ever after but here's why why this is

00:45:10,730 --> 00:45:15,410
like the takeaway no one set out to do

00:45:12,650 --> 00:45:15,890
micro services continuous delivery any

00:45:15,410 --> 00:45:18,680
of this stuff

00:45:15,890 --> 00:45:21,200
these were natural consequences so don't

00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:22,910
fixate on the words like I it's annoying

00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:24,770
to me when people are like you know

00:45:22,910 --> 00:45:27,440
we're so agile it's like well you guys

00:45:24,770 --> 00:45:30,770
suck at software like what are you

00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:32,960
talking about like don't tell me how

00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:35,860
DevOps you are tell me like how much

00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:38,860
you're like kicking ass for your company

00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:41,690
and this is actually not the end because

00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:43,550
what's happening now with the Internet

00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:45,680
of Things and big data and everything

00:45:43,550 --> 00:45:49,190
getting bigger and faster that means

00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:51,080
that in the next five years that I say

00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:52,670
the average if you just start to do math

00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:53,000
on time series and sensors and all this

00:45:52,670 --> 00:45:55,040
stuff

00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,620
the average the Internet of Things

00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:59,360
deployment is going to put enterprises

00:45:57,620 --> 00:46:02,480
on the scale that Google had to be at

00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:05,960
maybe five ten years ago it's just it's

00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:07,880
just math right and and if you are still

00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:09,800
stuck in the past with your processes

00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:11,960
and your thoughts about how to do this

00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:13,910
stuff you're gonna be at a huge

00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:17,090
disadvantage and someone else is going

00:46:13,910 --> 00:46:19,640
to build that future for you so I work

00:46:17,090 --> 00:46:21,470
for pivotal I work on Cloud Foundry I

00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:23,030
get a little excited about stuff and I'm

00:46:21,470 --> 00:46:24,890
way over time but thanks for sharing

00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:27,790
this time with me I'm happy to answer

00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:27,790
any questions you might have

00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:32,750
thank you

00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:32,750
