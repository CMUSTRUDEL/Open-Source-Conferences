okay so hello everyone my name is Dave

00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:09,179
Nielsen as I mentioned earlier I am the

00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:12,210
founder of the Silicon Valley Cloud

00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:14,429
Foundry meetup group and we've been

00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:21,539
running meetups now for about three

00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:26,970
years and for my day job I do consulting

00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:29,099
and my primary focus is on platform

00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:31,560
consulting so how do i how do companies

00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:34,530
figure out how to get their platform up

00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,960
and running and that can mean one that

00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:39,480
they buy or download and run themselves

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,250
or can be a company who has a platform

00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:44,100
that they want to market to others so

00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,989
basically all things platforms and I'm

00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,700
doing some consulting right now with Al

00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:49,200
tauros which is a consulting company as

00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:52,469
well but they specialize in deploying

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,579
Cloud Foundry and and then some of you I

00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:55,739
don't know if any of you are familiar

00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:58,020
with some of the events that I've run in

00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:01,670
the past but I started something called

00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:04,229
cloud camp back in 2008 and we ran about

00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:06,510
350 cloud camps around the world in

00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:10,080
about a hundred cities with about 50,000

00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:12,060
people I was all grass roots and if you

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,610
happen to be gotten here early yesterday

00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:17,460
and you attended the CF camp that was

00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:19,080
something that I organized and I really

00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,549
enjoy those kind of events because it

00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,759
helps me learn a lot about what's going

00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:24,960
on in the street so if you want to

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,700
follow me you can follow me at Dave

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,900
Nielsen on Twitter if you want to

00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,850
contact me I'll just play this

00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,100
information later so you can write it

00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:34,500
down I just want to give a special

00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,720
thanks to Al Toros there are really the

00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,009
ones who've been sponsoring me to do a

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,600
lot of the work that I'm doing I'm

00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:45,509
consulting with them and a lot of the

00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:47,579
experience I've had has been in running

00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:52,140
events and workshops that they have

00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:54,780
sponsored so shout out to them so the

00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:56,310
main goal here of this talk is to talk

00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,630
about deploying your first app to Cloud

00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,610
Foundry but of course first we got to

00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:01,969
talk about well why are you gonna deploy

00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:06,090
your first app to Cloud Foundry and

00:02:01,969 --> 00:02:08,970
there's a couple basic examples you can

00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:11,170
deploy run and scale your application as

00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:13,510
needed you

00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:15,970
can choose from a variety of runtimes

00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:20,140
and framework so you're not limited to

00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:22,180
any particular set of code as long as

00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:24,490
there's somebody who's open sourced a

00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:26,440
build pack or the framework that you

00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:29,260
need to run on Cloud Foundry you should

00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:32,530
be able to do so and there's a very

00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:37,030
quickly growing third-party service

00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:38,470
broker ecosystem so that just like when

00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:40,110
you deploy your application if your

00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:42,430
application needs to use services

00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:44,170
there's a lot of services out there that

00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:47,890
are already running for you or that you

00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:50,290
can deploy next to Cloud Foundry and use

00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:52,090
as a service as well so it's making it's

00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:53,769
becoming easier and easier to get all

00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:58,300
the things that your application needs

00:02:53,769 --> 00:03:00,250
as a service and as I said earlier you

00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:01,870
know there's a growing ecosystem not

00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:06,400
just a third-party service brokers but

00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:08,519
also different platforms out there so

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,350
folks who are taking Cloud Foundry and

00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:13,600
hosting it for you or providing

00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:16,720
downloaded version that you can use that

00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:19,780
distribution is you if you will so Cloud

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,700
Foundry as a product itself can be

00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:23,410
hosted for you or you can download it

00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:26,380
and it's open source so we're seeing a

00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:28,390
lot of innovation around Cloud Foundry

00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:29,829
folks are doing things that you might

00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:31,360
not have thought you would do with Cloud

00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:34,000
Foundry because it's open source and

00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:37,480
they can and you have a choice between

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,860
both public and private clouds so but

00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,340
you know really the reason why we like

00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:44,500
Cloud Foundry is as a developer you can

00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:47,290
deploy your application and it goes up

00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:49,750
on to a compute cluster essentially and

00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:51,489
now your code your application code can

00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:53,709
scale out horizontally and you as a

00:03:51,489 --> 00:03:56,230
developer don't have to do much to make

00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:59,260
that happen so once it's set up for you

00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:00,910
as a developer you don't have to worry

00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:03,310
about the nuts and bolts of how your

00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:05,650
virtual machines or your containers etc

00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:09,340
are set up that's that's done for you as

00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:11,680
a service but let me clarify a little

00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:14,530
bit more on this concept of Cloud

00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:17,890
Foundry the software vs. Cloud Foundry

00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:19,390
this service a lot of folks gets

00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:21,160
confused about this and I just want to

00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:23,830
make sure that we're on the same page

00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:26,810
all right because

00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:29,360
Cloud Foundry is actually just software

00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:31,910
okay it's it's not a service it's

00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:35,360
software however you can choose to

00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:36,920
download that and/or purchase it you

00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,480
know license to it from one of the

00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:45,050
distribution vendors and run it yourself

00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:47,600
now once you run it yourself when I say

00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:49,520
you I mean you're the IT department

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,690
you're not the developer so cloud

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,390
foundries are not really not meant for

00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:56,810
developers to download and run it's

00:04:53,390 --> 00:05:00,230
meant for IT departments to set up and

00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:02,630
run inside of your company all right you

00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:04,280
know system architects you know your

00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:05,540
data center folks you know they're gonna

00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:09,020
be interested in setting up a cloud

00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:10,060
foundry not the developers if you're

00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:12,200
going to deploy just one application

00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,850
cloud foundry is probably not the right

00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,410
thing for you unless this is a massive

00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:17,720
application and Cloud Foundry can help

00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:19,580
you scale out cloud foundry as a

00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,810
software solution it's something that

00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:22,760
you would download and set up and then

00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:24,050
give all of your developers access to

00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,700
that so they can quickly deploy their

00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:28,490
applications and then you're providing a

00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:29,780
cloud for them all right and that's what

00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:31,460
most people are you doing with cloud

00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:33,770
boundaries are they're getting a

00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:36,500
distribution and setting it up and then

00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:39,680
offering it to their developers you can

00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:41,060
also use it as service but before I get

00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,760
to that let me just point out some of

00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:45,550
the options you have if you want to

00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:48,170
download and run the software yourself

00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:49,610
you've got it's open source so there's a

00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:50,750
lot of vendors out there it's not just

00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:53,630
these but these are the main ones

00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:57,200
there's pivotal of course there's active

00:05:53,630 --> 00:06:00,410
active States staccato there's IBM has

00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:03,260
something called bluemix local HP the

00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:04,700
only on dev platform and you can also if

00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:06,170
you if you really want to you can

00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:12,230
download the open source version and run

00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:13,820
just that alright so if you download it

00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:15,980
yourself then yeah you can create your

00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:19,190
own Cloud Foundry as a service for your

00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:24,200
company or for your employees or offer

00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:26,360
it as a public cloud so this is what

00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:28,460
Cloud Foundry the software looks like

00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,590
okay it's got all this all these

00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:33,200
components to basically run your cloud

00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:35,940
for you it's a little bit of an outdated

00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:38,460
diagram but this is the general idea

00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:39,570
and this is not something that you as a

00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:42,540
developer should have to worry about

00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:43,830
this is what your IT folks your your

00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:45,540
sister bands your architects they're

00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:49,190
gonna look at this and figure out how it

00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:52,490
works and set it up for your company

00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:55,740
now what about Cloud Foundry the service

00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:56,610
so like it said you could set it up for

00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:58,080
others to use

00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:00,300
they could be your employees they could

00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,070
be on the public cloud new customers who

00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:05,550
are paying you to provide that service

00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:07,350
there are two predominant ones right now

00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:09,480
which is pivotal Web Services which is

00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:11,790
different than pivotal CF pivotal CF is

00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:13,890
a software pivotal Web Services is the

00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:16,080
service running okay you can use that

00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:17,490
and that way you just you developers go

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:21,900
straight to that and you don't have to

00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:24,750
have IT staff setting it up same goes

00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:27,660
with IBM bluemix cloud platform that's a

00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:29,100
service and you can use that as well and

00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,630
there's others out there I just don't

00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:32,700
have as much familiarity with them I

00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:33,990
think I need to go find out more about

00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,520
those but I wanted to mention some of

00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:37,170
them that I knew about like app fog and

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,650
ne9 and canopy there's some others out

00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:45,000
there okay so you can deploy your

00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:47,780
application to onto these clouds and the

00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,040
idea here is that the vendors are

00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:52,470
collaborating on the Cloud Foundry

00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:57,080
codebase but then they're competing on

00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:58,980
the the software ease-of-use or

00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:01,650
extending the software to offer

00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:04,110
additional services but the core of

00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:06,990
Cloud Foundry is is open source and it

00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:11,160
remains consistent across most of the

00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:12,630
vendors so in this particular session

00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,640
what I wanted to do is focus more on the

00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:16,310
services because if you're gonna deploy

00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:18,630
your first app I recommend not

00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:20,070
downloading Cloud Foundry and installing

00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:22,110
it and then deploying your first out

00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:24,510
simply go to one of the public clouds

00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:26,100
first and try it there you'll get a

00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:28,380
sense for what Cloud Foundry can do you

00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:30,320
can poke around and see what these these

00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:34,740
are the two primary ones that recommend

00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:41,430
pivotal and bluemix and you know you can

00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:43,590
poke around see what's like ok so once

00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:45,780
you've set it up it's supposed to be

00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:47,460
easy and you know you may have seen this

00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:49,710
haikyuu earlier I'm not sure I saw

00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:51,390
somebody tweet it that you know here

00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:55,440
my source code run it on the cloud for

00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:57,480
me I do not care how as a developer you

00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,700
just want to be creative you want to get

00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,200
functionality into your application you

00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,850
want to push it out there and get

00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,970
feedback you didn't really don't want to

00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:07,800
have to worry about oh shoot this one VM

00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:09,690
didn't start the way I expected or I

00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,910
have some patches to deal with you know

00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:15,870
you just don't want to deal with that

00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:17,610
all right so what a developer should be

00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:20,760
doing is really something called CF push

00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:22,410
and this is something you need to do to

00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:25,110
basically move your application code

00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:26,730
from your laptop up into the cloud

00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:28,680
foundry service that you've chosen and

00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:31,170
then that service is going to

00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:35,580
automatically take that code and create

00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:38,550
a container image that's going to be

00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:40,320
stored as a binary and then as you need

00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:42,540
to scale out your application it will

00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,180
take that binary image and deploy it as

00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:46,640
many times as you need and each one of

00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:49,050
those deployments is a container

00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,120
instance running in the cloud and gives

00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:53,940
you more compute power to serve your

00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,410
customers so you may need one if you're

00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:57,780
just starting out you don't have very

00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:59,520
many customers or you may need hundreds

00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:06,150
if you have a very large application

00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:07,530
with lots of customers so yeah and then

00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:09,900
like you can like I said before you can

00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:11,340
tell it to scale up or scale down as you

00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,050
need and that's that's really nice it's

00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:17,970
not a lot of complexity for the

00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:19,710
developer so I know I don't have a lot

00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:22,350
of time here but what I wanted to do is

00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:26,040
just kind of quickly show you what the

00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:27,090
seven steps to CF push would be so if

00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,280
you're going to try this for your first

00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:32,400
time then you're gonna go to one of

00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:33,780
those cloud service providers cloud

00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,640
foundry service providers I mentioned

00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:36,150
and you'll basically go through this

00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:39,120
process

00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:39,660
okay so let's shoot over here see if

00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,150
that works

00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:44,220
okay oh by the way I have a workshop

00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:46,500
that I've been giving and if you want to

00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:48,060
download this document it's a QuickStart

00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:50,160
guide it's basically the same thing that

00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:51,600
I'm showing you here and you can I'll

00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,970
show you the URL again at the end of the

00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,640
slide so you can download it there or

00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:59,370
copy the URL but it's basically cloud

00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:02,519
workshop org slash cloud foundry it's

00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:05,800
just my own little landing page

00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:09,220
okay so let's take a look at pivotal

00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:13,060
first alright now I've already logged in

00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:14,620
here and it's kind of showing me a

00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:17,010
slightly different view than you might

00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:20,110
see on a on your laptop because it's

00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:22,149
formatted for the projector here but

00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:25,269
it's it's a little different but

00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:26,680
basically the same and what you're gonna

00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:29,399
do is you're gonna go grant account

00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:33,399
accounts free you go to run pivotal IO

00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:35,950
create your account by the way they do

00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:37,810
require pivotal does require a text

00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:40,060
message confirmation code so you'll have

00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:44,019
to give them a cell phone to receive a

00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:46,329
text message just to eliminate the you

00:11:44,019 --> 00:11:50,200
know I don't know the folks who are just

00:11:46,329 --> 00:11:51,579
creating spam and stuff like that so you

00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,410
go create that account and then you log

00:11:51,579 --> 00:11:55,269
in and this is what you'll see remember

00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:57,160
your email address and password because

00:11:55,269 --> 00:12:00,990
later on you're gonna use that to log in

00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:03,430
from the command prompt or from terminal

00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:07,600
and once you log in you'll see that you

00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:09,699
have this org and you have spaces so an

00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,500
org is basically your team or your group

00:12:09,699 --> 00:12:14,970
of people working together on a project

00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:16,839
and spaces is the different stages

00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:17,920
actually you can organize it however you

00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:19,360
want but it's the different stages of

00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,370
your application so you can create a

00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,079
development space you can create a

00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:25,089
testing space and you can have a

00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:27,040
production space and then what you do is

00:12:25,089 --> 00:12:30,490
you would deploy your app into it each

00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:33,540
one of those spaces as as as you

00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:38,290
progress through the application

00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:39,910
lifecycle you can also download a CLI

00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:42,640
right from this page it'll just click

00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:48,940
over and show you where to link or you

00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:51,940
can go to github directly and go to this

00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:56,800
Cloud Foundry slash CLI page let me show

00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:58,480
you where that is and you down don't go

00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,279
to the download the code page you don't

00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,140
need the source code for the CLI what

00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:03,610
you need is a binary or the installer

00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:05,800
because that's unless you want to

00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:08,320
contribute to the CLI as the open source

00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:10,209
developer sure go ahead but you don't

00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:14,520
need that you can just scroll down below

00:13:10,209 --> 00:13:16,620
and find the right download for you

00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:18,899
and I recommend if it's the first time

00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:20,459
just grab one of the installers and just

00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:21,630
run that it's very simple but it sets up

00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:24,930
all the paths and all the things you

00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:26,490
need to run okay

00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:29,630
so those are the two things you're going

00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:33,240
to want to do create an account and

00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:35,700
download the CLI by the way the same

00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:38,850
thing it works just as well on bluemix

00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:41,370
so basically all of the steps that I'm

00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:45,470
going to show you will work on ibm's

00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:50,089
bluemix or pivotal web services and

00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:50,089
let's see if i go to the dashboard here

00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:54,390
you can see it's it it's similar but

00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:57,720
different I'm going to click on the

00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:59,550
Cloud Foundry link here and you can see

00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,410
that there's no applications currently

00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:02,670
here but we'll come back to that and

00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:05,279
we'll see some output and application

00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:09,029
running okay I'm gonna get rid of this

00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:10,670
screen here okay and then let's see I

00:14:09,029 --> 00:14:13,050
guess I have a lot of time left alright

00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:16,740
alright so now let's go back to my

00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:19,230
instructions alright so at this point I

00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:22,350
would have created an account again on

00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:25,260
either pivotal or IBM and I would have

00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:26,970
downloaded the CLI and just you know CLI

00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:28,920
stands for command-line interface is a

00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:31,380
very generic term there's lots of CLI is

00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:35,850
out there for lots of different software

00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:37,740
so CLI is not the name that we all use

00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:41,600
for just this see allies a very generic

00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:43,560
term this is the Cloud Foundry CLI okay

00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,420
you're gonna download it and then you're

00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:47,070
gonna run the commands now what I've

00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:49,170
done is shown you a very simple example

00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:51,089
of how you can try this yourself I've

00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:53,399
already got an application a super

00:14:51,089 --> 00:14:55,740
simple application up and stored up on

00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:58,740
github that you can download and it

00:14:55,740 --> 00:15:01,040
really goes as simple as this let's see

00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,040
here

00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:07,990
well let's say

00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,990
[Music]

00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:11,529
I'm going to create just to make it

00:15:10,449 --> 00:15:15,880
easier I'm going to create a folder

00:15:11,529 --> 00:15:19,060
called workshop and then inside this

00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:20,440
workshop folder as you can see the code

00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:24,670
here

00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:27,820
it's github.com and it's my github

00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:32,790
account and then hello cloud get so I

00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:32,790
didn't really copy that but get clone

00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:42,459
hello cloud git

00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:46,209
ok now for those of you who have not

00:15:42,459 --> 00:15:47,800
used git before or github it's just a

00:15:46,209 --> 00:15:49,949
source code repository and this command

00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:53,620
is gonna download the code right into my

00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:55,949
laptop here oh hold on a second I know

00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,949
what I did

00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:06,120
okay now let's try that again okay all

00:16:04,709 --> 00:16:10,019
right so it's very quick it's very small

00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:13,050
application so downloaded it quickly and

00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:16,260
from this point again going back to the

00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:17,579
steps I need to move into the folder

00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:19,290
that it just created so I just

00:16:17,579 --> 00:16:21,449
downloaded a basically a folder called

00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:24,959
hello cloud and inside that is some code

00:16:21,449 --> 00:16:26,970
so let's move into hello cloud and now

00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:28,410
you can see it just has a few files so

00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:29,880
it's a very simple application this is

00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:32,399
super simple as it's kind of the hello

00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:38,579
world example that you see demonstrated

00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:40,260
quite often now from here I'm gonna go

00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:43,470
ahead and log in so I've moved into that

00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:46,440
folder table foundry the with the CLI

00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:48,510
basically it knows what folder you in

00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:52,170
you're in and when it's talking to the

00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:54,360
cloud service itself it uses that as

00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:56,579
that folder as a as a reference so it

00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,680
knows that you've got code application

00:16:56,579 --> 00:17:01,110
code in that folder and it's basically

00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:04,199
going to try to take that code and push

00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:05,850
it up into Cloud Foundry now I haven't

00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:08,669
chosen a cloud yet but let's go ahead

00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:10,799
and use James water just gave me a free

00:17:08,669 --> 00:17:15,569
account at pivotal so we'll use that

00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:18,630
thank you James and what I'm gonna do is

00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:22,439
log in first so to make sure that you

00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:24,959
have the CLI running just type CF and

00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:26,280
you'll get a bunch of commands so you

00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,980
can see a whole bunch of commands here

00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:31,260
and there's lots and lots and lots of

00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:33,660
them all right

00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:36,179
tons of them basically everything you

00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:38,190
can do from the web interface you can do

00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:42,330
from the command line so it's very

00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:44,429
robust command line also while not all

00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:47,130
of these are implemented on every cloud

00:17:44,429 --> 00:17:51,090
most of them are so if you use a command

00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:52,740
on one cloud like pivotal versus IBM the

00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:55,250
commands gonna work the same on both of

00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:58,830
them you can kind of think of it like

00:17:55,250 --> 00:18:01,410
Linux in many ways where the Linux

00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:03,660
kernel is basically the same from Linux

00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:06,780
distribution to Linux distribution but

00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:08,669
then whether you're a boon to more

00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:11,429
canonical with a boon to or RedHat they

00:18:08,669 --> 00:18:12,500
compete by adding additional features on

00:18:11,429 --> 00:18:15,850
top of

00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:18,280
that Linux kernel and so they listed

00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:21,650
they listen to their customers and

00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:24,830
determine what their set of features

00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:27,710
they should add and they create Kubuntu

00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:29,540
or they create Red Hat Linux so but the

00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:31,880
core remains the same so Cloud Foundry

00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:33,350
open-source is basically the same no

00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:37,970
matter what you do and the CLI will

00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:40,960
basically do the same thing on either on

00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:43,370
any cloud cloud foundry cloud okay so

00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:46,160
let's go back down here at this point

00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:49,730
I'm gonna go ahead login so everything

00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:53,150
starts with CF and we're gonna log in

00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:57,040
and this time I'll use the - a just

00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:59,480
simply means what API am i pointing to

00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:03,610
and if I don't fat-finger this I can

00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:06,320
probably get through it quickly yeah I

00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:17,500
can't see as well alright here we go

00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:20,600
and it's API dot run dot pivotal ok

00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:23,630
alright so it found the endpoint and it

00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:25,520
actually connected to the server and now

00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:27,920
it's pinging me back saying hey yeah

00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:30,560
great you know you found me that I don't

00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:37,190
know who you are yet so tell me who you

00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:38,450
are now I can use my email address this

00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:43,580
is the email address of the account that

00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:44,750
I have and then my password ok I

00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:47,690
remember my password

00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:48,590
alright so at this point it says great

00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:51,890
now I know who you are

00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:55,910
but I need you to tell me which org and

00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:57,410
which space you want to use see James

00:19:55,910 --> 00:20:01,400
gave me this one but actually use this

00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:05,410
the one I've been using so I just logged

00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:09,320
into my own org called D Nielsen org and

00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:11,840
at this point I'm logged in he knows who

00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:15,560
I am and there's really nothing left to

00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:16,940
do except for CF push now this may or

00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,830
may not work the first time and I'll

00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:20,360
explain why it might not work in just a

00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:22,040
moment yeah ok if you read the

00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:25,460
instructions here it says the host is

00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:26,179
taken now think about it I'm sharing

00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:30,080
this cloud

00:20:26,179 --> 00:20:32,570
with lots of other users when they say

00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:34,909
the host is taken what they mean is the

00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:37,309
sub domain of the application that we

00:20:34,909 --> 00:20:39,799
thought you wanted to deploy is already

00:20:37,309 --> 00:20:41,330
being used by another application now I

00:20:39,799 --> 00:20:43,249
happen to know because I have a fairly

00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:46,369
unique sub domain that I've specified in

00:20:43,249 --> 00:20:47,720
my manifest that that's me okay so I

00:20:46,369 --> 00:20:51,590
know I know that I knew that was gonna

00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:53,480
happen how do I fix that well let's go

00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:55,639
ahead and take a look at the files of

00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:59,570
the application so you can see how Cloud

00:20:55,639 --> 00:21:01,549
Foundry handles this so again let's take

00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:04,460
a look at the files okay you can see

00:21:01,549 --> 00:21:06,559
that there's five files here of these

00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:08,389
five files four of them are the

00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:11,179
application and one of them is the COG

00:21:08,389 --> 00:21:13,159
foundry manifest now I'm just gonna use

00:21:11,179 --> 00:21:15,200
Nano here to make it kinda nice and easy

00:21:13,159 --> 00:21:17,749
if you're new to Linux you can use Nano

00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:23,929
it's a nice easy text editor and let's

00:21:17,749 --> 00:21:26,600
take a look at the file now you don't

00:21:23,929 --> 00:21:28,580
have to have a manifest when you deploy

00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:31,070
your application to a Cloud Foundry

00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:33,049
provider it's Cloud Foundry we'll take a

00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:35,389
look at the files that you are pushing

00:21:33,049 --> 00:21:36,529
through the CF push all those files that

00:21:35,389 --> 00:21:38,690
get pushed up the Cloud Foundry you'll

00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:40,070
they'll take those files store them and

00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:41,600
then go look through them and try to

00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:45,200
figure out what programming language

00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:47,990
your application is using and based on

00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:50,600
that it will go grab a build pack to

00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:52,490
then run you know build the image and

00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:55,039
then run your application but it's

00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:57,350
guessing and most of the time it guesses

00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:58,789
right however you might not want it to

00:21:57,350 --> 00:22:01,340
guess you might want it to be very

00:21:58,789 --> 00:22:02,539
specific about not only a programming

00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:04,580
language build pack but a specific

00:22:02,539 --> 00:22:07,669
version of a build tack or create your

00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:10,249
own custom build pack and so you can see

00:22:07,669 --> 00:22:11,659
here that with the build parameter here

00:22:10,249 --> 00:22:13,820
this is just the Yambol file by the way

00:22:11,659 --> 00:22:16,190
it's pretty simple to edit with this

00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:19,009
build parameter here that's the build

00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:20,779
pack and I've simply specified a node.js

00:22:19,009 --> 00:22:22,159
one I didn't have to specify that it's

00:22:20,779 --> 00:22:25,789
gonna use the same one I've also

00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:28,129
specified how much memory I've specified

00:22:25,789 --> 00:22:29,600
a host this is the sub domain and I'm

00:22:28,129 --> 00:22:30,710
gonna just increment this let's just put

00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,710
it up to eight so I think I ought to use

00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:36,190
seven as well and then this is the

00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:37,899
application name CF node

00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:42,100
hello cloud all right now I'm gonna save

00:22:37,899 --> 00:22:46,899
this and I'll go ahead and do my CF push

00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:48,549
again now it's gonna go through this

00:22:46,899 --> 00:22:50,980
process the process that's going through

00:22:48,549 --> 00:22:52,690
is actually quite sophisticated there's

00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:54,669
a lot going on here and this is

00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:57,519
basically the value of Cloud Foundry is

00:22:54,669 --> 00:22:59,559
it automates all the deployment process

00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:01,929
so your developers don't have to deal

00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:04,600
with that and it does it the same way

00:23:01,929 --> 00:23:07,240
for everybody so operations folks can

00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,500
take a look at what's going on with the

00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:10,870
open-source version if they want to

00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:12,850
change something they can and then they

00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:15,340
run it for their entire company or

00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:16,840
division or department whatever and then

00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:19,269
everybody's basically using the same

00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:22,450
process this is great for any big

00:23:19,269 --> 00:23:24,100
company that has a lot of you know rules

00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:25,509
and regulations and all these things

00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:27,610
that they have to go by because they can

00:23:25,509 --> 00:23:29,169
certify that process once and then all

00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:30,970
the applications that are deployed from

00:23:29,169 --> 00:23:33,940
that on are running that same certified

00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:37,990
process okay so what happened here oh

00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:39,159
good it went through now I could go

00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:40,570
through and explain all this but I don't

00:23:39,159 --> 00:23:42,879
have a lot of time here I think I've got

00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:45,250
like five minutes left so what I'm just

00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:47,769
gonna quickly do is show you that it's

00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:50,590
telling us that I've got one instance

00:23:47,769 --> 00:23:53,200
running okay it's showing that I've got

00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:57,700
my 128 megabytes of memory which is what

00:23:53,200 --> 00:24:00,639
I'd asked for and it took the domain

00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:03,399
that this pivotal cloud

00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:05,529
I'm sorry pivotal Web Services uses and

00:24:03,399 --> 00:24:11,379
added my subdomain to it so now I have

00:24:05,529 --> 00:24:15,399
an application running right here and if

00:24:11,379 --> 00:24:17,679
I go take a look at it I can see my

00:24:15,399 --> 00:24:19,809
application running all right it's a

00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:21,669
really simple app like I said before the

00:24:19,809 --> 00:24:24,519
only thing dynamic is that in that is

00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:26,230
the 0 ok and what that's doing is it's

00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:29,529
it's using a custom Cloud Foundry

00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:31,779
routine to simply look at then the node

00:24:29,529 --> 00:24:34,809
and determine how many nodes are running

00:24:31,779 --> 00:24:37,870
and it's it's outputting the ID the

00:24:34,809 --> 00:24:42,250
instance ID of that node ok so there's 0

00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:45,220
means 1 in math go figure

00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:47,440
yeah so in computer science 0 means 1 so

00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:49,170
we actually have one running if we had 0

00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:52,260
running we wouldn't even see this page

00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:54,000
all right now what I can do

00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:56,580
like I said before everything you can do

00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,130
through the UI you can actually do

00:24:56,580 --> 00:25:02,910
through the command line so now what I

00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:04,770
can do is I can type CF scale and I have

00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:08,880
to remember the name of my app which i

00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:14,460
think is CF node hello cloud and then I

00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:22,530
can say instance and let's say 3 ok Oh

00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:24,620
what happened here oh thank you fat

00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:28,320
fingers that's it they should call me

00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:32,310
get all fat fingers alright so it looks

00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:34,350
like it works it if I want to see some

00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:44,900
details about my app I can type in CF

00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:47,160
app and a fat finger this again ok and

00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:48,630
it's gonna tell me some information and

00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:51,390
you can see that now I've got three

00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:54,840
instances running and when I go back

00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:56,760
over to my UI and if i refresh you'll

00:25:54,840 --> 00:26:00,710
see that number changing so that's

00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:03,870
instance 1 and since 3 instance 1

00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:06,300
instance - ok love them out there

00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:08,700
alright it's always confusing anyway

00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:10,710
so that's basically a demo of how you

00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:12,840
deploy an app and you can scale it now

00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:17,550
it's running on 3 physical container

00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:20,880
nodes alright and just to kind of round

00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:23,430
this out I can go back to my UI take a

00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:25,980
look at the app that was deployed here

00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:29,460
it is right here I'm gonna go and take a

00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:31,830
look at the UI version of this app and

00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:33,210
you can see I can do all the same things

00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:35,610
or at least most the same things I can

00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:38,550
do you can see that I now have three

00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:43,820
instances running and I can shrink that

00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:48,000
back down to let's say one instance and

00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:49,350
when I do so you'll see that it's

00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,670
already killed off those other two

00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:53,010
instances so that's fast

00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:54,180
I'm gonna round this out because I don't

00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:56,130
have a lot of time to show you how to

00:26:54,180 --> 00:27:00,649
like connect to a database and all the

00:26:56,130 --> 00:27:02,730
other things but basically the way

00:27:00,649 --> 00:27:06,869
and just let me just show you some

00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:08,759
slides here okay so we deployed the one

00:27:06,869 --> 00:27:10,470
instance let me just fast-forward this

00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:11,909
through this so the process is you're

00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:14,730
gonna prepare to deploy which is we

00:27:11,909 --> 00:27:17,480
create our counts you can identify the

00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:19,980
end point get your user ID and password

00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:21,509
you're going to if you want you can

00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:23,220
actually specify your own full sub

00:27:21,509 --> 00:27:24,389
domain name you don't have to use the

00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:27,629
one provided but here are the ones that

00:27:24,389 --> 00:27:30,929
pivotal on bluemix provide then you go

00:27:27,629 --> 00:27:33,330
in and edit the the manifest okay like

00:27:30,929 --> 00:27:34,590
we saw you can these are the variables

00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:35,820
that you can put in the manifest there's

00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:39,179
a lot more information but these are the

00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:40,559
main ones then you push we just did a CF

00:27:39,179 --> 00:27:43,470
push but you can also specify the app

00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:46,409
name if you want you can add additional

00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:48,990
services to your app the way you do that

00:27:46,409 --> 00:27:51,509
is you go find your application you

00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:54,389
click on this services tab and then you

00:27:51,509 --> 00:27:55,980
click from ad from marketplace now I

00:27:54,389 --> 00:27:57,899
only have a minute left here but as you

00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:59,970
can see pivotal has a bunch of services

00:27:57,899 --> 00:28:02,070
that are listed up in their marketplace

00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:03,330
I'm not sure I'd call it a marketplace I

00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:05,220
think of it more as just like a catalog

00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:10,369
but it's a list of all these third-party

00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:12,240
services and you can add them let's say

00:28:10,369 --> 00:28:15,950
for example I think I'm running out of

00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,950
time here so let me just wrap this up

00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:22,919
I'm not gonna get too clever here let's

00:28:20,249 --> 00:28:26,549
take the Redis instance you can view the

00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:28,789
plans you can then select the plan the

00:28:26,549 --> 00:28:33,210
default plan it's free

00:28:28,789 --> 00:28:36,119
okay and now at this point you can

00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:38,759
configure it and add it and what's being

00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:40,980
done here is Cloud Foundry is going out

00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:43,289
using a service broker it's talking to

00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:45,570
that third-party service it's sending it

00:28:43,289 --> 00:28:46,710
a command saying please add an account

00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:50,730
to your service

00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:52,649
for this Cloud Foundry application that

00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:54,869
service replies back with the

00:28:52,649 --> 00:28:57,059
credentials so that application can now

00:28:54,869 --> 00:28:59,940
contact and talk to that service and

00:28:57,059 --> 00:29:02,639
those credentials are pushed into memory

00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:05,820
of the instance of the application so

00:29:02,639 --> 00:29:08,100
now in your code you just refer to the

00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:09,809
configuration details in your instance

00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:12,090
just like you would a configuration file

00:29:09,809 --> 00:29:13,380
that you push to your application and

00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:14,610
now you can get the user ID

00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:16,440
the password and all the other details

00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:18,300
that you need to talk to that service

00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:19,620
it's a beautiful way of separating out

00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,550
so that you're not putting user ID and

00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:22,440
passwords and all that kind of stuff

00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:24,270
into your source code alright and it's

00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:27,360
all managed beautifully through this

00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:28,710
service broker concept and like I said

00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,850
before these service brokers are

00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:31,530
extending there's more and more

00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:31,950
companies adding service brokers all the

00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:33,450
time

00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:35,520
so you should be able to find most of

00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:37,770
what you need and if you don't somebody

00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:41,160
will probably add it soon so at this

00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:45,570
point I'm out of time what I can do is I

00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:47,400
can quickly oh yeah one last thing I

00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:49,430
left out to troubleshoot there's a log a

00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:51,900
really nice log system you can choose

00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:53,640
you can type in like well I won't get

00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:55,620
into it I just on time but you can type

00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:57,690
in CF logs and then the application name

00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:59,760
- - recent and you'll see all the logs

00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:02,430
of your application so if something went

00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:04,230
wrong you can troubleshoot if you want I

00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:06,000
said here's that URL you can go download

00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:07,200
this guide that I've created I'll put

00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,550
the slides up there - they're not up

00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,620
there yet but I'll put them up there -

00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:12,210
and you can just follow along the guide

00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:13,500
if you have any suggestions or if you

00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:15,690
catch anything that's not quite clear

00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:18,420
please email and let me know I'd like to

00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:20,160
make this easy for folks and my goal by

00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:21,750
the way is to take this and turn it into

00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:24,210
something that can be offered in schools

00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:27,900
and you know sort of like get started

00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:31,320
with Cloud Foundry workshop alright with

00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:33,150
that here's my contact information and I

00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:36,480
don't have any time here I don't think

00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:38,410
but it says stop so I better step up

00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:44,349
thank you very much all right

00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:44,349
