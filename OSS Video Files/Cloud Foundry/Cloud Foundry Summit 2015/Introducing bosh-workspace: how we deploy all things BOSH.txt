ladies and gentlemen dr. Nick Williams

00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:14,660
[Music]

00:00:10,269 --> 00:00:16,820
next one with the automatic fade-out a

00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:18,619
little bit better there that's let's

00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:23,210
walk on music called walking on sunshine

00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:25,189
I liked it so this the topic that you've

00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:27,890
all come to see is vaguely similar one

00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:29,480
don't talk about the title said Bosch

00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:33,500
workspace is how we to play everything

00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:37,040
with Bosch that is the topic but as you

00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:38,870
sell tell a story we have new ideas on

00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,909
this topic and we'll be remiss if it's

00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:43,220
not to share them with great enthusiasm

00:00:40,909 --> 00:00:43,610
just because the title said something

00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:46,549
else

00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:48,409
so I'm Morris didn't you having what's

00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:50,720
interesting then you know what we've

00:00:48,409 --> 00:00:53,360
done the past so let's quickly go

00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:55,820
through for those if you don't know me

00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:59,030
us Stark and Wayne that is a very large

00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:01,010
logo ridiculous /bo frankly we're a

00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:03,199
consulting company so we only get to do

00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:05,659
things if we can convince customers that

00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:10,100
it's worth solving for the most part and

00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:12,560
that's a lot of fun you know you look

00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:14,060
around this this conference grew we grew

00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,120
I think this time last year there were

00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:21,740
six of us it's now 15 and that's pretty

00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:23,360
awesome and many of them very very new

00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:25,460
and so it's been interesting watching

00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,560
our people learn this stuff as quickly

00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:29,900
as possible and I'd like to think that

00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,780
that onboarding process is not just for

00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:37,130
us but for everyone getting a lot easier

00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:38,300
if you've got help what else we got this

00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:41,510
and many other things we have Twitter

00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:44,030
account please follow us because we have

00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:46,040
no idea how to find you all we make all

00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:47,870
these blog posts and we'd really don't

00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:50,930
know how to get them to you so this is

00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:53,570
you know since you none of you use RSS

00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:56,930
anymore I don't know I was supposed to a

00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:58,909
mailing list which we are a fax I hope

00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:00,590
that we could do that that'd be pretty

00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:04,490
hood to send it out to the engineering

00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:06,490
groups fax systems github how does that

00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:08,780
fix anything

00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:11,690
whoo-hoo honestly looks at the github

00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:16,090
homepage to for the the Activity Feed

00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:22,080
and gets useful information out of that

00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:23,820
any problems so we did grow and as such

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,210
have to bring them all in so we board

00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:30,020
the jet and that's pretty cool that

00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:33,180
comes five bucks to get that done

00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:38,820
substantially cheaper than buying an

00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:40,680
actual jet but one day I will get the

00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:43,980
jet and then haha the laughs will be

00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:48,120
well temporarily on you and then every

00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:49,530
month on me if you want to find out

00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,970
starting yeah we got a stock and went

00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:53,190
github account but we really put

00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:55,440
anything in it we find this a lot of fun

00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:57,270
putting everything we do in the class

00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,940
boundary community organization and

00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:03,240
helping people put their things in there

00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:04,380
this orc is kind of a discovery solution

00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:08,280
how do you find other interesting

00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:10,470
problems projects and it's now like 167

00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:14,070
repositories and 91 different people who

00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:16,830
have ownership of this and so if you're

00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:19,350
new to cloud foundry lots of interesting

00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:22,920
little side projects and core ideas that

00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:26,160
might help you along some of the ones

00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:27,270
that that I guess I and other people

00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,160
from soccer would have worked on is

00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:30,810
these ones Bosch gen I looked up the

00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,280
other day this is like the first thing I

00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:36,570
ever did when I discovered Bosch three

00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:38,910
years ago was I love making generators

00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:40,590
so I wrote one and I've been looking

00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:42,030
after three years and I think many

00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:44,070
people look at other people's blush

00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:46,280
releases and I consider see the telltale

00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:48,420
signatures they may have used this tool

00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:50,780
mostly from all the crops that it

00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:53,040
generates that you didn't delete but

00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:55,380
Bosch bootstrap we have a bunch of

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,320
interesting terraform plans to bootstrap

00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:59,730
on Amazon and OpenStack and hopefully

00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,120
soon we can do an is your one that'll be

00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:02,280
cool

00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,170
because Microsoft is all cool now right

00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:09,120
because because they wrote like a new

00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:10,800
text editor that runs on your Mac since

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,670
you haven't owned a Windows machine in

00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:17,400
ten years and emboss workspace which is

00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:19,130
somewhat the top of today and lots of

00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:23,100
other interesting things but these are

00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:25,140
and a gazillion blog posts it's got to

00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,760
the point there's a there's a lot

00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:28,740
fifteen of us writing blog posts and

00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:31,380
there's a lot of blog post I'm almost

00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:34,169
going to apologize that we write too

00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:35,880
many but there's a lot of interesting

00:04:34,169 --> 00:04:37,380
stuff not just advanced things

00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:40,260
perhaps the topic of today but a lot of

00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:43,620
as our new people learn things we both

00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:45,210
ears if you have an idea share at least

00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,970
there's one person in the world that

00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:49,470
reads it that's future you you've

00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:51,680
variably ended up reading a road blog

00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:54,060
post because you can't remember anything

00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,680
but is it is pretty awesome so if you

00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:58,380
read these blog posts we do not know you

00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:01,110
do that you get Google Analytics but who

00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:02,640
trusts that for your robots there would

00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:04,020
appreciate feedback because it feels a

00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,810
little bit like riding into a void

00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:09,020
sometimes it is a lot of love and

00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:11,790
affection in sharing these ideas and

00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:15,180
happy to hear about if you use any of

00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:19,530
them um and you know they'd be euro cuz

00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:21,570
it's the internet and of any topic so if

00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:23,370
we had this problem like you get to do

00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:26,520
one talk theoretically

00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:28,620
well I have 60 something interesting

00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:31,760
topics to talk about

00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:35,610
so let's go through them all

00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:37,530
sequentially chronologically tomorrow I

00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:40,070
what do we could use this time slot for

00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:42,420
whatever she'd be a lot of fun and and

00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:43,650
so if you have any questions at this or

00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:46,680
anything else we'll do that

00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:48,840
okey dokey so the problem and this is

00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,670
the problem that I I've talked about

00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:52,920
this idea for three years since I

00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:54,450
discovered Bosch because everyone else

00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:56,280
when they talk about deploying something

00:05:54,450 --> 00:06:02,700
they get very excited about deploying it

00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:05,190
at all like docker people look it comes

00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:08,900
up in 30 milliseconds and you've never

00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:15,000
created a production problem so quickly

00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:17,280
all new world of production disasters it

00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,140
worked on my machine he's a one gig Java

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:23,100
docker image have fun with that

00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:25,530
production people so you know if a

00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:28,260
production system lasts five years there

00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:30,180
are 60 months I I find the next fifty

00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:32,640
nine months as fascinating after a lot

00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:33,810
more fascinating in part because Bosh

00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,820
can do it and no one else's

00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:39,030
infrastructure or the core castration

00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:41,510
tool can and it doesn't justify it all

00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:44,280
have goddamn hard years to learn Bosh

00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:48,030
but once you do the next fifty nine

00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:51,280
months not a lot better

00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:52,030
so the challenge then becomes awesome so

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,580
we have Bosch

00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:56,680
hooray let's say we tried to blow Cloud

00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:58,600
Foundry well in the last four months

00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:03,760
alone they've been 12 separate releases

00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:06,060
of the entire thing some of them are

00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:08,860
small releases some of them substantial

00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:10,680
500 commits just to the CF release

00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:15,700
though some of them are bumping

00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:19,540
sub-modules templates the the the job

00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:22,240
specs etc but in the jobs templates

00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:27,790
alone know the definitions of the jobs

00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:29,200
99 different changes this year so and

00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:31,060
it's not like they don't try to help to

00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:33,640
be one of the reason I became fascinated

00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:37,150
by Cloud Foundry so I was previously an

00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:38,710
engine yard and so somewhat a traitor's

00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:41,860
action to leave one pass to go to

00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:43,450
another one but this was open and not

00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:45,340
just open but even from when I first

00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:48,220
described it three years ago they gave

00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:49,990
us Bosch with somewhat of a Rubik's Cube

00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:54,340
type challenge although I bet you can't

00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:56,590
make it work but there was this vague

00:07:54,340 --> 00:08:00,070
idea that they did care that you should

00:07:56,590 --> 00:08:02,110
be able to run it yourself and so you

00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:04,180
know year-and-a-half ago I think I spoke

00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:05,560
at this conference and I joked being the

00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:07,120
only person in the audience that got

00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:09,370
cloud foundry running and I know now

00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,260
everyone can do it and if you can't come

00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:12,850
and ask and we'll get you will get do

00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:14,200
not go home this conference with that

00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:17,010
knowing how to run cloud factory and

00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:19,210
Bosch we can solve that problem together

00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:22,600
in a sort of Lourdes see Darth Sidious

00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:23,710
type way you join the dark side we'll

00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:27,940
see if we can't get Cloud Foundry

00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:28,990
running ma'am so but each version that

00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:31,960
comes out they do a great job of

00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:34,510
documenting the release links to every

00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:36,250
pivotal tracker thing you cannot be

00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:41,860
removing from I obviously the source is

00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:43,000
open you can learn all of it I mean you

00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:46,270
know that would be a full-time job

00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,460
keeping track of it but a couple of

00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:50,770
ideas on just in case you looking for

00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:52,840
some get food get log is one of the

00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:55,270
things I do to get a feel for what

00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:57,370
changed between versions so you can

00:08:55,270 --> 00:09:00,190
reference a couple of showers or tags

00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:01,340
and then Double Dash and then some sort

00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:02,960
of glob of the

00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:07,370
Falls that you care about or subfolders

00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:08,870
that's kind of fun dude get a gif of the

00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:11,110
same sort of thing so let's look at

00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:13,070
specifically what changed in a in a spec

00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:15,230
now this is interesting

00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:16,940
so here we've we've sort of

00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:19,640
fundamentally changed some aspects of

00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:21,380
the UA a worth looking into should you

00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:24,110
be looking at doing this upgrade and I

00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:27,290
bring this particular one from 195 to

00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:29,750
207 it's relatively one knife I was the

00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:31,160
last one from last year 2 to 200 7th the

00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,240
current one well we were looking a

00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:36,430
customer where they've been running

00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:39,590
version 194 for about five months and

00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:45,490
then they decided to just upgrade to 205

00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:47,510
and it didn't work I can't believe it

00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:49,010
who would have thought you just can't

00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:50,810
randomly jump from one version to

00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:52,070
another without doing any investigation

00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:54,380
whatsoever to what might have changed

00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:56,180
and these are some of the things that

00:09:54,380 --> 00:10:00,830
changed all the sudden is a whole new

00:09:56,180 --> 00:10:02,330
way of the CF tool looking up they're

00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:05,780
doing the translation between user ID

00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:09,470
and username or email I need to set that

00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:14,050
up not a major one but watching out for

00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:16,400
changes of default that's a good one I

00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:20,000
bet you didn't specify it in the first

00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:21,740
place so it went from a value didn't

00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,180
know what it was to another value didn't

00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:28,730
know what it was so who knows what that

00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:30,950
might be and whilst you're struggling to

00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:32,960
figure this all out which mean none of

00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:36,320
your users care about what you're going

00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:37,670
through they just want it to work it's a

00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:41,210
platform it's supposed to just run

00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:42,830
forever and you hear we are struggling

00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:46,310
with premise that a new version comes

00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:48,290
out every week or two I guess at this

00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:49,820
point if I was a vendor I'd say and now

00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:51,080
you can use our product that just does

00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:52,190
all this for you but in this

00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:54,410
conversation we're going to look at

00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:57,290
Boston and deploying things where it is

00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:59,090
our problem um so this is what the users

00:10:57,290 --> 00:11:00,950
care about developers I guess are a user

00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:03,110
they care about they've got a test app

00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:05,660
they're happy about that this is as

00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:08,180
complex as their life gets deploying the

00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:11,000
app twice and all all of them of that

00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:13,880
complex for one we don't have the

00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,200
ability to copy a droplet we have copy

00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,850
source I don't know if you know that

00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,800
you can copy source from one app to

00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:20,030
another and then the bill pack will run

00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,700
again and hopefully you get the same

00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:25,430
droplet but this is about as complex as

00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:27,830
many customers will get an app test it

00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:30,070
and then migrate promoting a production

00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:32,570
but we know it's more complex than that

00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:34,460
very soon you're going to think I could

00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:38,180
gotta stop just upgrading production

00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:39,890
Cloud Foundry and hoping it works you

00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:42,530
have the bright idea of deploying a

00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:43,970
second cloud foundry which we'll call

00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:45,590
the test Cloud Foundry and you might

00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:46,940
want to put some test workload on it a

00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:48,650
couple of test apps to check that's all

00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:50,000
working around the cats and things like

00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:51,350
that that's pretty awesome now if you're

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
running OpenStack you probably learnt

00:11:51,350 --> 00:12:00,950
the most valuable lesson about OpenStack

00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:08,390
which is it doesn't work and so you

00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:10,310
might want a second one of those it's a

00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:11,600
I mean I'm sure they fix this now but

00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:14,660
when we started at new years ago with

00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:17,930
OpenStack literally there was no upgrade

00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:20,150
model to OpenStack the upgrade path

00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:24,020
literally was we're starting another

00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:25,520
datacenter in another part of the

00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:30,670
country cuz you might as well make it

00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:30,670
exciting and hope your customers find it

00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,910
it still would be you know the old

00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:37,550
versions of OpenStack running because

00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:39,200
there's no upgrade path so anyway as

00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:40,580
funny as it is to laugh at OpenStack I

00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,580
mean it's their fault but nonetheless we

00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:45,020
will make the jokes not them are very

00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:47,780
serious people not capable laughing

00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:54,320
themselves that would require agreement

00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:55,760
on something I don't think that so you

00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,470
can see now we have three Cloud Foundry

00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,300
running a different class different

00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:01,430
bosses different targets you know let

00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:04,550
alone multi-cloud let alone multi a Z

00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:06,470
etc multi region until we need a

00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:07,730
solution to this and many other problems

00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:10,760
hopefully that least gives you an

00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:14,330
example of the problem so fortunately

00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:18,830
Alex from people wrote a tool called

00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:21,320
spiff which is I guess how could you put

00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:23,500
it is the best-in-class solution to this

00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,500
problem

00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:30,080
[Applause]

00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:31,940
that's politely put as an Alex that's

00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:34,010
pretty good you know at this point I

00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:36,500
wish I had I almost like it I'm

00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:39,710
gonna find it because he is in the

00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:41,000
audience and this is hilarious I just

00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:44,870
think this is this was the funniest

00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:47,440
thing I've ever seen go straight to the

00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:51,940
issues I assume it's still an open issue

00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,940
Alex do you know which one no internet

00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,470
okay I'll fix that in a second

00:13:54,850 --> 00:14:04,190
this let's fix my internet problem first

00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:06,740
this better be worth it there's a guy

00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:08,450
with with slides that things how much

00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:11,830
time we've got left and what he doesn't

00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:11,830
have one is saying you're wasting time

00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:25,640
issues how I get how do I get is that

00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:28,870
all right this is so worth it Alex do

00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,870
you remember which one it is it's like

00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:38,020
here we go that's the one this is gold

00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:40,700
this is classic open source

00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:43,410
I've personally stopped using spiff on

00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:50,110
my own projects

00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:51,640
sorry to be fair a little bit of buyer

00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:53,940
beware as we proceed through the rest of

00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,940
the talk

00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:05,530
well let's not you know that get

00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:07,300
distracted by that um it still works and

00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:08,770
it still gets bumped along and as I said

00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:10,930
they're still missing you tell me what

00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:13,990
else exists and we go with it

00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:15,040
and and the the Bosch project is here

00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:16,870
it's going to be some fascinating stuff

00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,940
with the cloud configuration and links

00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:20,770
and manifests themselves make it really

00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:22,990
simple and we may not need this tool and

00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:24,850
awesome and nothing I talked about at

00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:26,380
the end of this talk will be affected

00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:28,360
the next thing I'm going to talk about

00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:30,930
will be substantially affected but in

00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:35,620
the long term you know everyone knows

00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:37,390
this is a problem but this is where at

00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:38,920
okay so we want a spife merger we want

00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:42,670
templates and we want to be able to have

00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:44,830
something that we think will work you

00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:48,340
know for the three and feel confident

00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:52,150
that as we move through we we go get

00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:53,830
reproducible behavior alright so spiff

00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:57,880
we saw it it's got a it's got ASCII art

00:15:53,830 --> 00:16:01,210
so you know it's good now I quickly

00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:03,640
define you know watches blah blah blah

00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:07,240
did you bother making s ki earth care

00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:08,560
about your project God's sake and so

00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:12,700
here's the idea and you've probably

00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:14,140
hopefully seen these this allowed this

00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:16,900
such came about and fine thank God

00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:18,340
finally pivotal who were deploying I had

00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:20,530
templates that were deploying off to

00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:22,090
Amazon and until blush light came out

00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:23,680
they didn't really have a motivation to

00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:26,470
start making templates for anything else

00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,940
and much much later they start doing

00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:30,370
vSphere and then much much later

00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:32,020
OpenStack and so Bosch workspace was

00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:35,980
this tool that came about because there

00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:38,350
were some of these a year ago that's not

00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:39,850
the ones we needed and our deployments

00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:41,950
were different from pivotal and we

00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:43,050
wanted different clusters and and so we

00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:45,640
needed a solution to this but

00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:47,800
nonetheless very awesome that Cloud

00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:51,130
Foundry comes with a bunch of example

00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:53,800
templates on how to deploy and all you

00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:55,779
do is you take the ones you care about

00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:59,170
and you merge them and you get a

00:16:55,779 --> 00:17:02,860
manifest that will just work for some

00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:05,319
value of work now couple here to keep in

00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:06,939
mind is I do not just go to the head of

00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:09,329
the project and assume those templates

00:17:06,939 --> 00:17:11,980
work that will be unhappy day for you

00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:15,189
you want templates that go with the

00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:16,750
version of the software and I'm of the

00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:21,339
belief that yes it's kind of good that

00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:23,199
the templates are in the repo I for

00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:25,569
everyone happy that deploying anything

00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:28,419
with Bosch ultimately means get cloning

00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:29,559
something so if Swift templates are

00:17:28,419 --> 00:17:32,260
where we are personally I would like

00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:34,510
them to be shipped off and packaged

00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:35,799
somewhere else as part of of that and I

00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:38,429
guess that's kind of where we're at with

00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:40,779
the Concours stuff to some degree but

00:17:38,429 --> 00:17:42,880
anyway at the moment you pretty much

00:17:40,779 --> 00:17:46,240
have to get clone build these sort of

00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:49,929
things and be ready to keep in mind

00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:52,419
which of those do you care about what

00:17:49,929 --> 00:17:53,980
order they get merged in and I guess

00:17:52,419 --> 00:17:56,950
more importantly you're going to very

00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:58,990
quickly want them to be different and so

00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:01,559
now you've diverged and then do you

00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:06,690
remember how and you remember what

00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:09,789
and so Bosch workspace was an attempt to

00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:11,200
continue to live with the continuing 15

00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:14,260
plates that came out because they're

00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:16,899
tested to some you know pivotal would

00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:18,760
the core team were testing them for some

00:18:16,899 --> 00:18:19,899
subset of testing obviously not for

00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,549
everything we were doing but they're

00:18:19,899 --> 00:18:23,620
pretty good starting point but we wanted

00:18:21,549 --> 00:18:25,600
our own changes we want different

00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:27,100
cluster sizes and so much worth choice

00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,909
was this idea if I've how can we make

00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:33,010
this happen and so what we had is

00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:36,010
another gamal file cuz we're all good

00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:38,950
with that nothing bad ever happened with

00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:40,840
the amal it's just when it gets to three

00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:45,460
thousand lines long you start asking

00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:47,230
there what the question alright

00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:49,289
you're on your fourth coffee before you

00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:52,090
get to the end there's has got to stop

00:18:49,289 --> 00:18:53,649
there's no there's no storylines no arc

00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:58,240
there's no character development this is

00:18:53,649 --> 00:19:01,600
you know yet it's longer than a novel so

00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:03,520
this is a smaller manifest and to some

00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,200
degree and more readable like you can

00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,549
get the gist from the list of templates

00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,619
now that what this is going to be doing

00:19:07,549 --> 00:19:12,499
it's going to be using Postgres instead

00:19:09,619 --> 00:19:14,299
of not Postgres I mean IDs I guess or

00:19:12,499 --> 00:19:16,489
however else you want to do Postgres you

00:19:14,299 --> 00:19:17,929
can bring your own Postgres which is

00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:19,419
probably a good idea because your

00:19:17,929 --> 00:19:23,389
Postgres might be highly available

00:19:19,419 --> 00:19:26,350
whereas ours isn't you might use H a

00:19:23,389 --> 00:19:28,850
proxy instead of your B's or in a

00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:34,850
external load balancer except for except

00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:36,440
to NFS because you hate yourself you

00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:38,659
know apparently you're using Google

00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:42,109
where it only gives you results from the

00:19:38,659 --> 00:19:43,570
90s and and you've learned about NFS for

00:19:42,109 --> 00:19:47,840
the first time that's an awesome idea

00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:49,879
and other ideas that are pure gold let's

00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,489
turn off SSL curse you know we don't

00:19:49,879 --> 00:19:56,269
have security problems around this place

00:19:51,489 --> 00:19:59,389
and it allows you and your your team to

00:19:56,269 --> 00:20:02,299
understand it's at a glance what you've

00:19:59,389 --> 00:20:04,759
got now in order to do that you do need

00:20:02,299 --> 00:20:06,950
to I you know one thing I we've sort of

00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:09,820
evolved in having lots of templates in

00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:12,980
order to get this sort of readable comp

00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:15,609
cognitively I've lost the word but

00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:18,139
readable that's a good word

00:20:15,609 --> 00:20:20,320
understanding of what's coming in the

00:20:18,139 --> 00:20:23,149
ones here are the ones from upstream and

00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:25,429
brush workspace just makes all this

00:20:23,149 --> 00:20:27,889
happen it it has to get your elf where

00:20:25,429 --> 00:20:29,929
the Biff templates come from and you can

00:20:27,889 --> 00:20:33,499
add releases it makes a lot easier to

00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:35,600
mesh these things together and and the

00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:39,499
thing is if I really wanted to use it I

00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:41,809
talked more about it and I'm talking

00:20:39,499 --> 00:20:46,639
about it because it's mentioned in the

00:20:41,809 --> 00:20:48,789
title now be rude not to at least give a

00:20:46,639 --> 00:20:51,980
glancing blow

00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:53,539
but it's served us it's certain to solve

00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:56,029
these problems so you know specify the

00:20:53,539 --> 00:20:57,379
stem cells the top level information the

00:20:56,029 --> 00:21:00,139
inputs what do you care about now

00:20:57,379 --> 00:21:01,999
there's another set of inputs which Alex

00:21:00,139 --> 00:21:04,159
did you come up with mara as the idea of

00:21:01,999 --> 00:21:09,190
the top level why met or not instead of

00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:12,679
like inputs golf golf go there so we're

00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:16,070
and so let's go and so you know you know

00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:17,149
some definition of cool and so this is

00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:19,399
the things that are going to go into

00:21:17,149 --> 00:21:20,899
your templates and hopefully you can get

00:21:19,399 --> 00:21:21,560
it down to be small and readable as

00:21:20,899 --> 00:21:25,160
opposed to

00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:26,690
and excessive but it may change from

00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:28,610
company to company as to what goes into

00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:30,650
that because of your deployment and it

00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:32,630
doesn't have to be you know part of what

00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:35,480
Bosch workspace gave us was a liberation

00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:37,070
from what the upstream templates were we

00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:39,560
could start to curate our own templates

00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:42,530
and what else we got

00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:44,780
so there's your inputs and and so if

00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:46,760
your instant point Cloud Foundry there

00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:48,500
is a workspace so the idea of Bosch

00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:51,020
workspace is an extension to the Bosch

00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:52,700
CLI you don't really set it up yourself

00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:54,770
pretend to find these things lying

00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:56,960
around so Cloud Foundry community see if

00:21:54,770 --> 00:22:00,500
Bosch workspace is a Bosch workspace

00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:03,080
extra templates to do extra things like

00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:08,600
the example as I gave and this is what

00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:10,040
we used for the terraform work you start

00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:12,260
the terraform thing it brings up a

00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:14,960
bastion or a jump box it brings up a NAT

00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:17,840
brings up all the subnets and the VPC in

00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:21,860
the other order and then on the bastion

00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:23,240
it does this stuff which is pretty cool

00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:27,050
now one of the things that's super cool

00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:31,010
is we started running job templates for

00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:32,870
a much smaller cluster and it uses me to

00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:34,460
no end every time we find someone which

00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:36,170
is many people who think that Cloud

00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:37,460
Foundry can not be deployed there

00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:40,400
there's this idea that Cloud Foundry

00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:43,130
needs 20 VMs so if I could take a moment

00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:46,610
to dispel that you know it's just

00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:48,590
software there's nothing about those

00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:50,330
bits that preclude them from being on

00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:53,230
the same machine they don't there wasn't

00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:53,230
like a blood feud

00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:57,620
whatever imaginary reason you can say

00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:59,390
well that needs to be on it so that's

00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:05,240
Ruby and that's Java and they hate each

00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:06,890
other most things it really it should

00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:09,740
all be and I think that the Bosch nice

00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:11,210
project you know I spent a bunch of time

00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:13,040
trying to make sure Cloud Foundry can

00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:15,140
all work on one VM but six is a good

00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:19,010
number as you're especially compared to

00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:21,070
20 and I get to use this bit that's

00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:23,300
awesome this is new so watch me use it

00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:26,630
and you can't double it you can scale it

00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:28,340
it's a che so you can double it and get

00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:30,380
a high bail ability could scale it out

00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:33,740
the DA's etc it's

00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:36,650
nice if only as a source of examples of

00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:38,780
template's but I sort of fell out of

00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:41,690
love with Bosch workspace if you didn't

00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:44,150
figure out where this was going I didn't

00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:48,500
have a solution to the problem but it

00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:50,300
got complex it's a little icky and and

00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,380
as I started asking other people what

00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:54,110
they were doing about this problem

00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:55,220
everyone was just using shell scripts so

00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:56,360
at some point you gotta realize you've

00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:58,790
probably gone down the dark path of

00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:01,610
complexity to solve what what time were

00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:04,490
we solving we wrapped this command or

00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:07,580
running spiffed merged in a truckload of

00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:09,500
Ruby that was a plugin that did meta

00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:11,660
programming on Bosch which is already

00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:15,110
complex and constantly under threat of

00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:18,440
actually being changed at some point and

00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:20,870
so this this became an idea let's just

00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:22,850
go back to this continue with the idea

00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:24,860
of writing our own manifests our

00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:28,850
templates that describe how we want to

00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:31,760
describe it and about this time I was I

00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:36,670
got to see Alex who let us down so

00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:36,670
severely with spiff redeeming himself

00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:49,700
and with a thing called concourse and so

00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:52,430
this led me to to get to re-explore this

00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:54,710
problem of the last month and we'll come

00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:56,870
back to this in a minute so this is

00:24:54,710 --> 00:25:00,490
somewhat complex looking thing but it's

00:24:56,870 --> 00:25:04,640
pretty awesome I think in that what this

00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:05,750
this is a concourse pipeline and I think

00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,580
there's now the fourth time I brought

00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:10,670
this up in various meetups in the last

00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:13,310
24 hours so I'm pretty excited what this

00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:15,890
one does as we'll go through it is it

00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:17,240
deploys something in this case would be

00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:19,820
Cloud Foundry Redis whatever it is

00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:24,610
you're deploying three times the goal is

00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:26,300
to protect production partly from Bosh

00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:29,150
because I don't know if you've ever used

00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:30,800
Bosh if it doesn't go well sometimes

00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:33,280
delete deployment is the only solution

00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:36,890
out of your particular predicament and

00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:39,380
if we can keep that to a minimum over in

00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:42,140
this department we might get to keep

00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:43,610
their jobs sorry this pipeline is

00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:45,530
designed to protect

00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:47,390
from Boston us from screwing up

00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:49,460
production and so the idea here is is

00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:51,080
there various different inputs come in

00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:52,910
we're going to give them a crack we're

00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:55,309
going to try them out and then we are

00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:58,040
going to have a candidate that we will

00:25:55,309 --> 00:25:59,750
pass through this pipeline ultimately by

00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:02,090
automatically or manually at a point and

00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:06,110
this became very exciting as I started

00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:08,390
to learn how concours worked and and and

00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:10,309
ultimately as of yesterday got the

00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:11,950
variation of this or this and and some

00:26:10,309 --> 00:26:14,330
other sort of interesting variations

00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:19,400
working so I did really want to share

00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:20,840
them so back to our our shell script so

00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,250
one thing that's different as I

00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:24,770
rethought what I was trying to do with

00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:28,250
spiff templates was I no longer wanted a

00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:30,350
big stub of lots of things like the name

00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:33,559
of the deployment to me is not a stub

00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:35,240
thing it doesn't change it's just a

00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:37,490
piece of configuration and nearly

00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:39,049
everything in Innes what we've done with

00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:40,730
smoke stubs if you've ever looked at the

00:26:39,049 --> 00:26:43,250
cloud foundry things you just ran the

00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:45,650
generate manifest or make manifest spiff

00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:47,720
and looked at what it did is this big

00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:53,150
stub and it can't go through to me most

00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:57,169
of that is that's a terrible signer I'm

00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:58,790
gonna look and all that and to me the

00:26:57,169 --> 00:27:00,950
only thing is going to stub or what

00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:02,570
you're testing and the pipeline so the

00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:03,770
release candidate versions and and that

00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:05,059
sort of thing and this is where I've

00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:06,650
come to and I'm happy to share it

00:27:05,059 --> 00:27:08,510
because if any feedback would be the

00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:11,240
first feedback because this is all

00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:12,650
relatively new to many people so we have

00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:16,640
all the today and tomorrow to discuss

00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:19,940
this and so here's a simple look at at

00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:22,370
what we've got we've got oops that's the

00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:24,830
wrong magic button yeah whatever sorry

00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:26,240
those three there are the inputs I know

00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:28,100
this looks like as many inputs better

00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,290
once we're testing a new version of

00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:32,090
Redis a new versions of stem cell sorry

00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:33,770
a docker a new version of logstash

00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:35,260
a new version of the stem cell they're

00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:38,690
the things I care about checking and

00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:41,030
ultimately if it succeeds I'm going to

00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:42,530
take those templates and I'm gonna say

00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:44,870
this is the candidate that I want to

00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:47,419
test ultimately in production and

00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:49,130
there's my pipeline it gets gets passed

00:27:47,419 --> 00:27:51,740
through this pipeline as I test it now

00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:54,080
concours - tang mostly being used by

00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:56,090
people moving artifacts through your

00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:58,700
shipping software

00:27:56,090 --> 00:28:01,010
and well as a concourse does have a

00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:04,700
Bosch deployment resource it also has a

00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:07,070
cloud for SC f1 Chris can say to me

00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:07,640
whether he thinks it's good or not this

00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:10,670
is it good

00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:12,560
would you use it you would use it tends

00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:15,650
to fix the bug where it deploys apps for

00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:18,140
the first time No No maybe all right so

00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:19,870
that you're all right but deploy Cloud

00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:21,800
Foundry you can use this for both I

00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:23,420
don't know if that was the intended

00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:25,670
purpose but this is very exciting to me

00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:29,420
as using it to production systems more

00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:31,880
so than artifacts and I want to give a

00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:34,280
little and my one remaining method he

00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:36,410
tells me yeah I got 10 other minutes

00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:38,000
they're fine you're doing a great job

00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:42,970
and I do not want to take away from the

00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:49,450
magic of the service to providing

00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:51,860
service context insensitive timekeeping

00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:55,630
how about you showed me the five minutes

00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:55,630
bang when there's five minutes to go

00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:05,090
this is an example of watching

00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:08,210
conquerors this is it takes a minute to

00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:10,430
watch again it's doing a bunch deployed

00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:11,720
because that's what I want to do I mean

00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:13,190
it could it's concours a good to blow

00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:15,340
anything but we care about Bosch so

00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:17,930
let's look at doing a Bosch deployment

00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:20,330
it had to do the package compilation for

00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:22,640
the first time because this boss had

00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:25,880
never done it before but what we show is

00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:27,320
is that I actually export them and ship

00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:29,750
them into all the other bosses so no

00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:31,700
other boss ever does them why because

00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:33,920
there's one thing that less that could

00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:35,660
possibly go wrong in production and I'm

00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:37,670
trying to protect production with every

00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:39,440
possible you know talent and skill and

00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:41,150
and tool that I can so here we are

00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,780
exporting those compiled packages and

00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:45,770
then because we have two other

00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:48,320
environments there's going to ship them

00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:51,260
off and install them and it takes longer

00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:52,580
than that but he's rushing me so I'm

00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:55,130
gonna get through the animated gift

00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:57,980
really quickly we then deploy pre prod

00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:59,720
and that would do our deployment from

00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:01,550
production whatever those templates were

00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:03,710
rebuild it then upgrade it to whatever

00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:05,630
came from the candidate if that works

00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:07,040
now we've got something we can ship to

00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:09,880
production and if you're interested to

00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:13,399
know how that ends up mysteriously

00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:14,809
come to that booth yeah we can talk

00:30:13,399 --> 00:30:15,919
about this it's really interesting and

00:30:14,809 --> 00:30:18,200
we can go through it because you know

00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:20,360
he's not giving me enough time to share

00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,919
so this is the subset of templates

00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,690
they're going through the pipeline this

00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:27,980
is that candidate if you want to know

00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:29,120
how to make templates I wrote all four

00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:32,630
make me spiffy

00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:34,580
and it takes values from attempt from a

00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:37,940
manifest and puts in a spife template

00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:40,250
and just makes it more spiffy like it's

00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:41,840
kind of fun I'm not very good at naming

00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:42,679
Alex makes awesome names I'm very

00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,500
envious

00:30:42,679 --> 00:30:47,990
protip because of concourse uses docker

00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:49,610
so that now you know it's cool you are

00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:51,440
unsure a minute ago but I've said it

00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:53,620
uses docker in Europe right we've

00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:56,029
answered some big important questions

00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:58,190
super important player using docker I

00:30:56,029 --> 00:30:59,360
think is to put the darker files in with

00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:01,789
a project that uses them

00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:03,320
I have other points but this is you know

00:31:01,789 --> 00:31:13,190
at least I get to say docker so now a

00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:15,320
Felidae it's on every line this sum of

00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:18,260
those two of the things I mentioned on

00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:20,390
the roll one get up somewhere and and I

00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:23,990
decided that the tutorial I'd be written

00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:25,549
is I gotta make a book for it because I

00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:27,440
really excited about what we're going to

00:31:25,549 --> 00:31:29,360
be able to do with Concours and

00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,340
certainly how it's going to roll out for

00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:36,380
for our customers and and for everyone

00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:38,510
else logo and a Twitter thing again and

00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:40,309
if you want to come tomorrow 10:40 we

00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:43,370
could talk about this and any other sort

00:31:40,309 --> 00:31:44,600
of associated topic yeah the same is

00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:47,809
fewer really how many people aren't

00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:49,970
terrible us three me and three cardboard

00:31:47,809 --> 00:31:53,360
colleagues of me so they'll be spiced

00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:55,730
view we have a couple of things going on

00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:57,860
our booth figure out cool t-shirts made

00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:59,899
cool or if you wear them and if you come

00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:04,059
