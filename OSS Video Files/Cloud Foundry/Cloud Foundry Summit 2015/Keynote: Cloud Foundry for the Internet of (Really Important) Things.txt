good evening good morning let's see if I

00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:09,030
can get this thing to work that will be

00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:11,280
my first test okay so some of you

00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:12,750
wondering what gee executive is doing in

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,089
a conference like this it's almost like

00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:18,840
a crop duster coming to an organic

00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:20,609
grower conference but let me give you

00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,320
take the next 15 minutes and try to

00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:24,600
explain what we're building maybe by the

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,670
end of the talk I'll be able to convince

00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,130
you that we are working on the same

00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:31,470
thing that you're working on Internet of

00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:33,660
Things IOT very important thing you can

00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:35,850
see it everywhere everybody is talking

00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,890
about the numbers of devices that are

00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:40,920
showing up the storage that is going on

00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:42,980
you have four or five very important

00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,620
companies working on that Google Amazon

00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:48,719
Apple maybe Microsoft sometimes when if

00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,399
you like it overall these are very

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,829
important companies and they have about

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,410
19 percent not only they they have about

00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:57,629
8 percent but overall the software

00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:01,590
industry is all about 19 percent of the

00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:04,470
the S&P 500 total market value very

00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:06,540
important egg cookers that connect to

00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:09,119
each other communicating toothbrushes

00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,070
belt buckles that light up all kinds of

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:14,520
interesting things this is not what

00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:17,820
we're talking about we're talking about

00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:19,290
something much more important and you

00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,000
may not feel it but at the end of the

00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:23,100
day when you open the faucet you're

00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,799
using G equipment at the end the other

00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:28,049
end of the of the line when you turn on

00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:30,439
the lights there is a turbine at the

00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:33,689
other end that actually produces this

00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:36,329
power this wattage that you're using if

00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:37,829
you have if you're taking on a flight

00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:39,450
which some of you are going to do after

00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:42,420
I'm done and the next speaker is going

00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:46,229
to be done you will be flying 70% chance

00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:49,950
a GE aviation product so overall we're

00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:51,720
talking about big dirty noisy machines

00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,790
that are very important for a lot our

00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,130
life in general our well being

00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:58,290
specifically now the interesting thing

00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:01,500
about that is all those things have

00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:03,570
sensors and they talk day and night 24/7

00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,250
and somebody needs to analyze them and

00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:07,829
make sure that we understand exactly

00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:10,140
what's going on with them if you look at

00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:12,569
the numbers of the sensors and those

00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:13,440
machines we are approaching to the point

00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:15,870
where there are 20

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,690
billions of them and they create about

00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:21,120
80 exabytes of data now this is a lot of

00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:23,580
information and the reason we want to

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,410
collect it is not to break any privacy

00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:27,080
rules or do anything of that sort but

00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:30,630
really to understand how we can optimize

00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:33,210
those assets potential to generate more

00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:35,640
revenues how to make sure the production

00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:36,930
and the livelihood of those companies

00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,840
that actually are working with those

00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:42,120
assets much smoother and how do we make

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,510
sure that we can extend those assets and

00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:47,880
allow them to generate revenues in the

00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:52,260
years to come those things are actually

00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:54,450
going on for a very long time some of

00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,990
those assets were put in place 30 35

00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,550
years ago

00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:58,830
naturally they didn't have all the

00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:01,260
controllers and the compute environment

00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:03,810
that we're looking at today but the

00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:06,030
goals of GE and the companies that are

00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:07,740
working within the same ecosystem is to

00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:10,800
make sure that we really build this

00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:12,960
thing we called industrial Internet you

00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,330
have the consumer internet you have the

00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:17,550
enterprise internet sales force plunk

00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:19,290
and so on and you have the industrial

00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:21,000
internet and industrial Internet it

00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:23,489
actually is going after that part of the

00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,560
GDP that is a little bit the underserved

00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:28,380
community right it's not something that

00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:31,020
every day you wake up and with the

00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:33,420
thinking about how a turbine talks to

00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:36,510
another piece of equipment on that

00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:40,459
Internet but we would assert that this

00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:40,459
is really tomorrow's growth opportunity

00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:44,610
there is a big difference between the

00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:46,110
two at one level it don't look that

00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:47,790
different but actually if you think

00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:50,160
about that there is a huge difference in

00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:52,320
several key dimensions and that's why

00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:54,900
we're here today first the average

00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:56,970
longevity of those devices and no

00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:59,790
offense to the toothbrushes and the rice

00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:01,980
cookers is that usually people use them

00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:04,980
for about six months it can be a nice

00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:07,769
warbles that you bought it can be a nice

00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:09,900
gadget these things actually are working

00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:12,890
for about six months on the average our

00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:16,890
assets need to work day in day out for

00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:18,840
3035 years and when you think about that

00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:20,489
they actually a lot of people have to

00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:22,560
make a lot of the operators have to make

00:04:20,489 --> 00:04:25,380
those decisions about whether they take

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,610
the drill into maintenance or forget

00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:28,889
about maintenance and

00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:31,199
drilling oil because the price of oil is

00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:33,330
jumped by five dollars those decisions

00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,669
are really deep economical decisions

00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:40,050
that people have to make as they go and

00:04:35,669 --> 00:04:42,960
work those assets if you think about the

00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:44,580
other part connectivity the biggest

00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,719
problem that we can have is the call

00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,099
will be dropped you know they're

00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:48,900
definitely a certain loss of

00:04:47,099 --> 00:04:52,650
productivity when people can talk to

00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:54,659
each other but when you have a blowout

00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:56,879
preventor that you have to overhaul or

00:04:54,659 --> 00:04:59,159
upgrade in the middle of a subsea

00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:00,990
drilling operations and you know that if

00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:03,270
that blowout preventor is not going to

00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:05,909
work the way it should then God forbid

00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:07,860
another oil spill is going to be upon us

00:05:05,909 --> 00:05:10,379
this is where connectivity is becoming

00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:12,900
very important and so not only we have

00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:14,520
to make sure that we will be able to get

00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:17,400
this connectivity all the time but we

00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:19,560
also have to make provisions for when

00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,599
the connectivity is intermittent or

00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,759
really to some extent unavailable if

00:05:21,599 --> 00:05:25,050
you're in the middle of the sea usually

00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,659
unlikely that you're going to have a

00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:29,969
cell operating in the vicinity you have

00:05:27,659 --> 00:05:32,069
to rely on satellite communication you

00:05:29,969 --> 00:05:33,409
have to optimize the cost of that you

00:05:32,069 --> 00:05:36,060
have to make sure that under any

00:05:33,409 --> 00:05:39,529
circumstances the industrial assets will

00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:43,289
be able to keep working big difference

00:05:39,529 --> 00:05:45,960
data management let's talk about how

00:05:43,289 --> 00:05:49,469
many exabytes we need if you think about

00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:52,740
that there are about I think 10 million

00:05:49,469 --> 00:05:54,300
or ten yeah something along the lines of

00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:57,089
every second of tweets that are

00:05:54,300 --> 00:06:02,129
happening in there in the on the network

00:05:57,089 --> 00:06:04,139
there's about 80 gigabyte a day and this

00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:05,580
is a basically a very respectable number

00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:08,009
if you look at Facebook you're talking

00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:10,650
about you know hundreds of petabytes a

00:06:08,009 --> 00:06:14,339
year now let's look at what happens when

00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:17,550
you deal with with GE aviation and this

00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:20,039
is only G aviation 500 gigabyte for

00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:22,080
every flight it's all the data about the

00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:24,319
engine the airframe the vibration the

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,159
cabin temperature it's important for

00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,259
mechanical engineers that build the

00:06:26,159 --> 00:06:29,939
airframe it's important for GE aviation

00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:32,009
folks with building engines and it's

00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:34,439
important for the marketing and the

00:06:32,009 --> 00:06:35,849
performance scientists in the airline's

00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:38,969
that would like to understand whether

00:06:35,849 --> 00:06:40,080
the cabin was too warm or too cold there

00:06:38,969 --> 00:06:42,030
are about a hundred thousand

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,639
flights every day they're happening in

00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:46,319
the United States if we only took if you

00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,330
only took the part that we're dealing

00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,580
with which is G is dealing with which is

00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:52,169
about 70 percent market share we're

00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:54,990
talking about 70 percent of a hundred

00:06:52,169 --> 00:06:57,180
thousand flight times half a terabyte I

00:06:54,990 --> 00:07:00,479
think in my math it's about 50 terabyte

00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:02,039
sorry 50 petabytes a day so we're

00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,780
talking about unprecedent amount of

00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:05,759
information and for the first time in

00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:08,129
history people actually know what to do

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,960
with all this data because if you go and

00:07:08,129 --> 00:07:12,599
analyze that you're gonna figure out how

00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:15,569
to build better engine faster engine how

00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:18,060
to make sure that the blades the turbine

00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:20,219
blades actually can last much longer so

00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:25,639
you have an end-to-end picture of

00:07:20,219 --> 00:07:27,780
everything that we're building security

00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:30,060
everybody wants the devices will be

00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:32,370
secure but would you pay $100 more for

00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:35,490
secure phones maybe in your in the

00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:37,770
intelligence community or very a

00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:39,719
business that is exposed to industrial

00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:41,819
espionage that may be the case normal

00:07:39,719 --> 00:07:44,520
consumers don't pay for that our

00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:46,440
industry will pay a lot to make sure

00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,389
that their devices don't get hacked I

00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:50,699
mean I'm not sure I know I don't think

00:07:48,389 --> 00:07:52,770
I'm telling you any secret but you can

00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:54,240
actually hack into pretty much

00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:56,699
everything unless there is enough

00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,490
security in that and if you if somebody

00:07:56,699 --> 00:08:02,370
goes and futz around with a turbine or

00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:05,310
an MRI machine or a CT scanner this is

00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:08,250
actually have some very important and

00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:10,319
very unfortunate consequences most of

00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:12,690
the things we're building are considered

00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,580
national critical infrastructure they

00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:16,199
have to work all the time we want to

00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:18,120
make sure that the end of the day the

00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:20,639
industrial Internet is not only high

00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:23,879
performance but also high security and

00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:27,779
we cannot tolerate breaches either by

00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:29,460
nation states or just by bad people that

00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:31,229
would like to play around with some of

00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:36,029
those assets that we have at our

00:08:31,229 --> 00:08:40,050
disposal Zuckerberg said several years

00:08:36,029 --> 00:08:41,760
ago that privacy is no longer the social

00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:43,740
norm and it to some extent while

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,620
everybody was upset about that it is

00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:48,750
true we are much less private today than

00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:51,060
we're 20 years ago it's okay to put

00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:53,400
things on facebook it's okay to twit

00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:56,910
whatever the heck you think about but it

00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:59,100
the end of the day when it comes down to

00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:01,140
a different set of devices again the

00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:03,930
industrial devices the medical equipment

00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:06,420
this is where the privacy is not just a

00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:09,690
matter of sentiment of somebody or a

00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:12,570
doctor or patient it's a regulated and

00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:14,670
required property of their overall

00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:16,620
system you have to be epic compliant you

00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:19,050
have to be either compliant you have to

00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:21,120
have ISO 27000 you have all these

00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:23,490
standards some of us may or may not

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,140
agree with the fact that there are

00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:27,780
actually have some sort of a burden on

00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:31,440
our system but it is what it is the

00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:33,900
politicians the people the governments

00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,910
have all decided that this is how the

00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:37,440
set of equipment that we're building has

00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:39,900
to behave and we have to make sure the

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,670
industrial internet while at the risk of

00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:44,520
being a little bit more bureaucratic is

00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:49,620
something that enables us to really

00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:52,200
serve and comply with those standards so

00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:55,590
with that in mind we had to build

00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:58,260
something that will allow us to really

00:09:55,590 --> 00:10:00,480
take all this data make sure it's secure

00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:05,100
enough it's compliant with the right

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:07,350
standards ingest it store it clean it

00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:09,390
and make sure that at certain point we

00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:11,730
can take all of that analyze that and

00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:13,920
come back to the operator of those

00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:15,840
assets within sites what what is that

00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,180
they need to do that will make the

00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:21,180
operation of those things better more

00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:22,830
profitable and prevent the bane of the

00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:25,950
industry that we're dealing with which

00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:27,390
is called unplanned downtime unplanned

00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:28,890
downtime is when you sit on an airplane

00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:30,180
and the captain comes in and said well

00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:32,580
this plane is not gonna fly today

00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:34,590
everybody gets out everybody goes find a

00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:36,720
different plane this is something that

00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:38,610
was not maintained it was not planned if

00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,930
it were planned then you wouldn't be

00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:41,700
sitting in this plane where it should

00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:44,340
sit in a hangar and get worked upon

00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:45,780
right so at the end of the day this is

00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:47,250
what we're trying to optimize we're

00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:49,170
trying to optimize the operation of

00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:51,120
assets we're trying to give our operator

00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:55,080
some insights about what is they need to

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:56,700
do so we have to focus on higher level

00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:59,580
of the stack and for that we need to

00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:01,440
find the right level the right lower

00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:06,060
levels to make sure that we can do it at

00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:07,980
scale GE is working in 170 countries or

00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:10,350
around the world we have to make sure

00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:12,060
it's reliable because we don't our

00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:13,710
customers don't expect anything less

00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:16,260
than twenty four seven four nine

00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:18,300
sometimes five nines and we want to make

00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:20,490
sure that we can get things that will

00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:22,020
allow us to push the envelope as we

00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:24,390
build the industrial internet for years

00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:26,610
to come and this is what we're we

00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:29,640
started working with cloud foundry it

00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:31,590
was not actually a natural journey

00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:34,380
because for GE a company that has been

00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:35,580
doing what it's doing for 130 years to

00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:37,860
go and change everything we know about

00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:40,290
software getting the Cloud Foundry

00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:42,720
culture working with people and other

00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:45,420
players in the company in the ecosystem

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:48,630
was not very simple but what it did it

00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:50,280
allowed us to actually get move a lot of

00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:53,250
the people that were working on that

00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:54,840
level in the past and deploying them on

00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:57,690
a higher level of the stack so we can

00:11:54,840 --> 00:12:00,060
work on the analytics and we can work on

00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:02,010
the way to ingest and keep the data and

00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:04,400
make sure we can get into the right data

00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:06,570
I draw at record time without

00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:08,220
sacrificing the reliability or the

00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:11,220
completeness of that some of the data

00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:12,810
that we have to keep we keep because we

00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:14,580
like it and because we think it's going

00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:16,380
to be good for us to understand what the

00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:18,990
assets are doing some of the data we

00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:20,610
have to keep is because we were told to

00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:22,530
keep it right the government told us to

00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:24,930
keep it these are regulated data that we

00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:27,660
cannot get rid of so platform three was

00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:29,760
paramount in our ability to lift the

00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:31,680
discussion and lift the focus of what

00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,320
we're doing two completely different

00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:36,060
level that will get us closer to the

00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,770
industrial internet abstraction

00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:39,450
what is an asset you know what is a

00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:42,270
locomotive really when you think about

00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:45,600
it a locomotive is a big thing running

00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:47,220
on railways but at the same time it's a

00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,560
hundred and fifty thousand parts

00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:50,910
traveling together and sometimes you

00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:53,190
have to look at the locomotive is the

00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:54,960
big hunk of iron sometimes you have to

00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:57,090
look at the part and figure out where is

00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:58,920
the right Depot where is the spare parts

00:12:57,090 --> 00:13:00,990
and were the other locomotive the dets

00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:03,720
part is installed in all those things

00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:05,310
are things that we have to think about

00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,230
it and solve it ourselves because

00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:10,200
frankly there's nobody in the ecosystem

00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:12,770
that will do it other things we rely on

00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,770
Cloud Foundry

00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:21,220
so a case in point is a wind turbine if

00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:22,870
you look at the wind turbine it's a

00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:25,360
magnificent thing by the way if you get

00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:26,800
all the way up it's awesome but if you

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,960
look at that if you think about what

00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:31,150
we're doing wind turbines it's like a

00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:32,890
wolf it's never basically it never hunts

00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:35,320
alone never deployed alone usually you

00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:37,900
have a wind farm and the interesting

00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:39,580
about wind farm is that when you have

00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:41,710
all this wind it is coming to you you

00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:43,750
can optimize the operation of a specific

00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:46,240
turbine but by doing that you're going

00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:48,280
to create wake turbulence that will

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,350
compromise the operation of the turbine

00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:52,150
behind that so what you want to do is

00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:53,710
you want to create the analytics that

00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:56,260
will allow you to optimize the

00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:58,240
performance of the whole farm and so

00:13:56,260 --> 00:14:00,640
some of the execution will have to be in

00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,530
the predict system some of the cues the

00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:04,540
execution of the analytic systems have

00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:05,920
to be at the controller level and some

00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:08,410
of the execution has to be at the

00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:11,110
specific turbine all those things have

00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:13,570
to be dynamically balanced because

00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:15,550
sometimes the issue is local sometimes

00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:19,930
the issue is regional and sometimes the

00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:21,940
issue wind and everything else is is you

00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:24,580
know much more sec toriel in that

00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:27,430
respect now the data that you get is

00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:29,170
about happening you collect data that if

00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:32,650
you look at that at the time serious

00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:34,270
data it's pretty much every fraction of

00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:35,890
a microsecond and so there's a lot of

00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:37,630
data to ingest we have to put it

00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:40,690
somewhere we have to not analyze that

00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:42,880
that what Cloud Foundry does for us or

00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:46,950
that what Cloud Foundry enables us to do

00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:50,680
as we go and solve the predicts problems

00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:54,970
so to that extent we had to do two

00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:59,500
things we were excited to do two things

00:14:54,970 --> 00:15:01,390
one is to build the incubator for the

00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:03,400
industrial protocols if you think about

00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:05,710
what we're doing we have a lot of data

00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:08,650
that we need to generate those pieces of

00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:11,140
data cannot just flow an edge and on an

00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:12,820
HTTP channel which is what we got we got

00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:15,780
from Cloud Foundry but in the best

00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:19,720
period of open community we have built

00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:21,970
we are working on the FTP level of

00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,170
protocol routing in such a way that

00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:25,970
we'll be able to take those industrial

00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:28,819
protocol and move them into the cloud

00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:30,589
and we are contributing the result of

00:15:28,819 --> 00:15:33,679
that project back to the open source

00:15:30,589 --> 00:15:35,899
community and the other thing looks like

00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:38,479
everybody every real person need a dojo

00:15:35,899 --> 00:15:40,069
so we have a dojo - and this dojo is

00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:41,449
that all about the industrial Internet

00:15:40,069 --> 00:15:45,319
and that's really Internet is too big

00:15:41,449 --> 00:15:48,019
for GE even as a 350,000 people company

00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:49,579
to take on itself and so this is

00:15:48,019 --> 00:15:51,349
something that we opening up on the

00:15:49,579 --> 00:15:53,539
other side of the bay and our local

00:15:51,349 --> 00:15:55,279
headquarters in San Ramon and what we

00:15:53,539 --> 00:15:57,439
would like to see and what we start to

00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:59,839
see now that other than pivotal and GE

00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:00,879
and some other distinguished members we

00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,959
would like to see pretty much

00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:05,029
representative of the whole community

00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:06,879
coming and work with us on really

00:16:05,029 --> 00:16:11,179
pushing the envelope on what we call the

00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:13,999
industrial Internet at the end of the

00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:16,220
day this is just the beginning so now

00:16:13,999 --> 00:16:17,959
that they explained why G is here I'm

00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:20,179
looking forward to being here again next

00:16:17,959 --> 00:16:22,999
year or any time other time in between

00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:25,039
annex and actually working with you

00:16:22,999 --> 00:16:27,349
folks and anybody else that want to come

00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:28,999
and join us on really pushing forward

00:16:27,349 --> 00:16:30,750
this industrial Internet I think it's

00:16:28,999 --> 00:16:33,659
