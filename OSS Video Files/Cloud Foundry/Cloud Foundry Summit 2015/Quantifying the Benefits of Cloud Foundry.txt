hello everybody my name is Andrew your

00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:09,690
kovitch and I'm with altars thank you

00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:11,639
for choosing my boring topic will will

00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:14,969
not speak about any fancy stuff like

00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:18,420
ladies like Diego about microservices

00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:21,830
will speak about numbers but numbers of

00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:24,029
positive will measure benefits today

00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:26,760
unfortunately Mike Jacoby who was

00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:29,039
advertised as a co speaker was unable to

00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,890
join me today on the stage but I promise

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,170
you my best effort to deliver this

00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:44,190
presentation and live the content that

00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:47,160
latitude that you chosen to to hear so

00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:50,789
let's start with with traditional survey

00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:53,270
show me a hand who didn't hear this

00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:53,270
phrase before

00:00:53,840 --> 00:01:02,760
okay nobody my next question who agrees

00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:06,360
with this principle who does agree who

00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:11,250
does okay just half of that Indies okay

00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:13,860
interesting and show me the hand who

00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:18,439
regularly uses this principle in your

00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:22,860
professional life okay nice

00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:25,530
unfortunately fewer people and then ends

00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:29,280
and and and still why using matrix is

00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:32,340
challenging we you know it's not

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,860
something that we urge to do or CH to do

00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:37,590
that we have to do it's something that

00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:41,220
is important but not every not mandatory

00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:44,970
urgent so we prefer to procrastinate and

00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:49,590
I hope that my my presentation today

00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:52,439
will will help you using that using the

00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:54,240
use of the matrix in York called for

00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:58,229
implementations and my last question to

00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:01,049
you who who view is studying Cloud

00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:05,369
Foundry implementation or thinking about

00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:11,009
implementation in the near future okay

00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:12,370
nice yeah so it's it's for you and

00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:16,540
[Music]

00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:19,120
why why do we need metrics Universal

00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:27,810
answer is that we need metrics to take

00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:31,450
decisions and in Cloud Foundry keys I

00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:33,849
assume that you're champions of quad

00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:36,489
foundry and since you are here you

00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:39,940
already sold already sold on the idea of

00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:41,370
cloud family and you took your decision

00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:44,290
you're already interested in that

00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:47,620
however you're not sure about maybe not

00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:50,170
sure about about implemented or

00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:52,569
thundering your organization and you

00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:55,390
need to understand why exactly you need

00:02:52,569 --> 00:02:58,720
you need Cloud Foundry what goals are

00:02:55,390 --> 00:03:05,430
goals you have you also need to

00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:09,489
understand your alternatives and metrics

00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:12,819
will help you as a champion to convince

00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:16,000
people around you who work with you work

00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:18,459
the whom you report

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,670
maybe you manage people and you also

00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:25,209
need to convince them that it's it's the

00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:27,340
right thing to do maybe not maybe it

00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:28,510
will appear that it's right and not the

00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,519
right thing to do and you need to do

00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:33,910
something else but again you will have

00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:39,579
an answer so we need to go in some some

00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:43,090
other direction also metrics will help

00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:47,470
us track our progress where we go how

00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:49,120
fast we go and get get feedback now what

00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:52,090
we approaching our destination point

00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:56,880
where we are moving may be in in some

00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:58,750
some wrong direction and I represent

00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:02,139
alturas professional services company

00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:04,090
and why we came up with with this

00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:06,900
metrics we work with companies from

00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:11,169
different stages of of code for adoption

00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:12,910
we work on trainings we help implement

00:04:11,169 --> 00:04:16,239
called foundry and we help a dog called

00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:19,690
Chronicle foundry and this is exactly

00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:25,060
what I was telling and telling to you

00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:26,380
about the champions challenge and the

00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:29,880
champions dilemma

00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:31,900
is that's quite often people who are

00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,720
convinced about college who are

00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:38,740
passionate about it they're struggling

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:42,370
to promote promoted to to to their

00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:44,320
colleagues and I suggested this topic

00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:51,550
for for the assignment and it was

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:53,530
accepted so it's based on on my my real

00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:55,630
experience of dealing with with

00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:58,420
different customers and leads our

00:04:55,630 --> 00:05:04,480
locations our customers so normal

00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:07,180
marketing this is my version of why we

00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:11,950
need called foundry you probably have

00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:14,740
your own version maybe some you saw some

00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:17,560
presentations and most likely other

00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:19,720
speakers were suggesting other reasons

00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:22,630
why Godfather we should be used my my

00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:24,730
version is that the major major

00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:27,310
advantage is decreasing time to

00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:30,760
production you have fast your

00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:35,440
application on the market also you can

00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:37,030
iterate faster that it's clear you can

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,070
increase productivity of developers a

00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:42,910
lot of features that are already

00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:47,620
embedded into the platform have not to

00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:50,700
be to be developed because they already

00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:53,800
know platform it's also obvious

00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:56,050
quadfather also helps to improve quality

00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:58,710
of the prodigy of the products that that

00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:01,320
you develop primarily in terms of

00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:07,390
latency a low latency high availability

00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:09,460
and in high security efficient so that

00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:12,210
the operations also clear the high level

00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:14,770
to mention the utilization of hardware

00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:18,640
also could be could be quite essential

00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:21,910
for for some companies in my practice

00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:25,350
also wastes other reasons why my

00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:27,430
companies have chosen cloud foundry for

00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:30,960
for the IT departments for the

00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:33,060
enterprises like for instance unity of

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,290
environment across multiple locations

00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:37,360
for some companies especially in

00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:40,390
regulated industry it's very important

00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:44,650
because they don't have to certify

00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:55,120
each new location in your case that may

00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:57,640
be may be somewhat different and now the

00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:01,210
question that that you needs to ask

00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:01,720
yourself is why exactly do any quad

00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:04,360
foundry

00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:07,570
what exactly are my goals it could be

00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:11,530
all of them it could be two of these

00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:13,600
three items to two or three of these

00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:15,390
items it could be something different

00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:20,170
but you need to answer trans question

00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:22,750
why do I need that and another important

00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:26,050
question to ask yourself is what are my

00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:28,590
alternatives what can i what are the

00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:33,010
other other ways that I can can choose

00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:34,510
what are the paths that I can go maybe I

00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:37,450
will be happy with the infrastructure

00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:40,690
service maybe it's it's the way to go or

00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:45,820
maybe I can have capacity and desire to

00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:48,870
build some custom platform maybe maybe I

00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:52,090
just don't need to choose anything and

00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:56,310
in my situation rather bad and I'm

00:07:52,090 --> 00:08:01,450
probably going into some radical some

00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:03,730
some radical change and radical shift in

00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:06,550
my organization is it's not the way to

00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:11,080
go so we need to understand what what

00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:15,430
alternatives are and the next step is as

00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:18,490
to identify how how much money how much

00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:23,850
it will cost to us in terms of time in

00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:26,680
terms of money in terms of effort and

00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:28,870
also infrastructure is clear we need

00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:32,380
infrastructure to run applications also

00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:38,950
Cloud Foundry doesn't come for food that

00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:42,970
doesn't come for free and and it it has

00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:45,070
several components that that basically

00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:53,470
an overhead in the system recruiter like

00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:55,990
blobstore like cloud controller that's

00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:59,500
all the components that we need to to

00:08:55,990 --> 00:09:01,750
keep in mind and understand that a

00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,410
quatrain will be my applications plus

00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:07,770
something else

00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:10,840
there was an overhead we need software

00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:13,810
acquired who were taken from from a

00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:17,530
third party we need to develop several

00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:19,870
tools on our platform like automated

00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:21,790
scalability maybe security framework

00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:25,720
maybe authentication for your work but

00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:29,560
if we have a platform it it makes sense

00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:30,940
for us to to integrate several several

00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,980
components that we would have to create

00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:34,510
in all our applications or in most our

00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:42,630
applications in turn on to the platform

00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:42,630
level integration were clear

00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:49,960
infrastructure and the software support

00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:56,010
also also clear our people need to be

00:09:49,960 --> 00:10:00,070
trained and probably the most important

00:09:56,010 --> 00:10:03,550
investment investor Titan is the

00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:07,150
cultural change as angel Dias total the

00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:10,300
Kinki keynote yesterday that platform

00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:11,760
without culture is toxic so we're good

00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:16,780
we're good phrase we shall like a lot

00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:19,240
and you will have to to spend time money

00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:22,330
to to train your people to evangelize

00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:26,080
your platform to wanted to make sure

00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:28,690
that your people really really create

00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:33,100
Clayton called native applications that

00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:36,730
you invest into into the culture of

00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:40,750
creating micro services agile culture so

00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:46,180
you don't you don't deploy quite far we

00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:49,060
just suggest because you're fine and all

00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:54,130
we are human and we understand that

00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:56,190
humans don't like change and we we have

00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:59,110
to do this change and we need to spend

00:10:56,190 --> 00:11:06,460
to spend and spend our time money effort

00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:10,710
in it so the next the next stage is

00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:14,650
we know how much it will cost how to

00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:17,200
have to implement it we know how much it

00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:20,140
will cost to to support us and our

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:23,680
vendors will help to understand how much

00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:26,680
it will take to to purchase software to

00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:32,170
to buy professional services to allocate

00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:36,430
our internal people to to implement a

00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:39,310
platform and supported and the right

00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:43,270
pane of the scale is filled with with

00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:45,810
some amount some amount of money and now

00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:53,550
we will balance well as the skills and

00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:53,550
feeling feeling the next data pin

00:11:57,390 --> 00:12:04,630
previously when I listed list of the

00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:07,780
benefits of what fund real the first one

00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:11,230
who was decreased time production and we

00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:17,470
will try to calculate how much time to

00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:23,980
production is worst off so it's now long

00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:27,760
time to do the math formerly simple our

00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:30,850
effect will be time savings multiplied

00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:33,400
on cost of delay and the lambreaux

00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:37,510
application that we have cost of delay

00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:42,130
would be would be amount of money that

00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:44,320
we earn or save if we have the

00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:47,800
application running already in

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:50,560
production and let's say in our case it

00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:53,430
will be two thousand bucks a day it may

00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:55,480
be maybe a lot maybe mummy not much

00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:57,600
depending on the size of organization

00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:01,019
but

00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:05,370
I think it's it's about to be true like

00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:08,839
for organization of this size cost of

00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:11,160
and benefit of Haven application

00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:17,639
application up and running could be

00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:19,860
something like mm mm mm a day let's say

00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:21,779
we have 20 plication you know Department

00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:24,630
we are going to develop 20 applications

00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:28,319
within the next the next year you only

00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:33,019
have so we need to calculate time

00:13:28,319 --> 00:13:33,019
savings how are we going to do this

00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:45,990
let's say we have a value stream map to

00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:47,880
assess to set this timeline and one of

00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:50,040
the major component of starting a

00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:56,490
project or this provisioning provision

00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:59,759
of the infrastructure and this this map

00:13:56,490 --> 00:14:03,029
is a relatively simple it has just four

00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:05,250
stages in most cases for most

00:14:03,029 --> 00:14:08,760
enterprises that will be much more than

00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:09,839
these four stages that could be 15 or

00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:12,060
even 20 or 30

00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:16,560
the bigger the organisation the longer

00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:24,449
is the chain and the most important the

00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:26,459
most important time that is being spent

00:14:24,449 --> 00:14:28,740
on this provision of over the

00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:30,870
infrastructure is not the time that we

00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:35,639
do the work actually it's a lead time

00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:37,589
how much how much time is spent when

00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:40,920
task is being held over between one

00:14:37,589 --> 00:14:45,480
specialist to another specialist so in

00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:49,170
all cases let's say hardware's provision

00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:53,209
to within three hours but it's it's

00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:56,339
being queued for three days

00:14:53,209 --> 00:14:58,259
IP address allocation to two hours but

00:14:56,339 --> 00:15:01,680
again after its provision it could be

00:14:58,259 --> 00:15:04,259
held over to another another specialist

00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:07,980
and this task will we'll be waiting for

00:15:04,259 --> 00:15:11,330
for two days to implement it so on and

00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:15,240
so forth and in my example

00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:17,370
let's say it takes 10 days 10 days to

00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:19,230
provision the infrastructure now what do

00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:25,710
you think is it optimistic or

00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:30,110
pessimistic yeah now I think I think the

00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:32,700
time I'm a bit optimistic but let's

00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:35,270
let's use this this number for our

00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,270
calculations

00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:45,920
besides provisioning there are other

00:15:39,029 --> 00:15:48,360
aspects of of time to production savings

00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:54,980
besides provision infrastructure we will

00:15:48,360 --> 00:16:00,360
save time on developers on developers

00:15:54,980 --> 00:16:02,430
setting up the environment also let's

00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:06,480
assume let's assume we'll have 4

00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:09,950
releases per day and in our case it

00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:12,930
could take three days then in the

00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:15,150
old-fashioned way of of doing the

00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:19,200
release in quad fun with wigwam a much

00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:22,050
less also very interesting interesting

00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:25,080
aspect is developer's productivity as a

00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:28,680
set of the beginning platform already

00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:30,450
has several functions embedded so

00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:32,580
developers don't have to spend time on

00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:38,460
developing developer dysfunctions these

00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:44,190
features and let's say in my keys my

00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:47,940
keys we have 29 days of savings before

00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:56,550
our application is being first released

00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:59,280
to production now what does it mean it's

00:16:56,550 --> 00:17:02,760
over a million for 20 applications I

00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:04,410
don't know maybe maybe it's not too much

00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:09,390
maybe too much depending on the scale of

00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:11,910
organization and I assume that the big

00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:14,699
organization is the longer it will take

00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:17,520
to provision infrastructure the higher

00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:22,650
will be a cost of delay for publications

00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:24,209
not being not being running and the

00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:25,860
number of plication could be

00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:28,529
it could be bigger so using this

00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:33,270
approach we can calculate what is the

00:17:28,529 --> 00:17:36,840
value of time to production and how how

00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:45,809
we can justify usage of God finally just

00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:47,850
in just in one aspect let's take another

00:17:45,809 --> 00:17:50,850
another example we have a small

00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:54,779
organization and the number of

00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:58,980
application is is lower now the cost of

00:17:54,779 --> 00:18:03,779
delay is also lower and the organization

00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:06,390
is not so bureaucratic and it takes less

00:18:03,779 --> 00:18:09,919
time to provision infrastructure and the

00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:15,929
savings are not 30 days but just 10 days

00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:18,929
in this case it's not so much so when in

00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:22,970
this case it's not that valuable and we

00:18:18,929 --> 00:18:25,799
probably better consider other options

00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:28,320
or don't don't do the change change and

00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:32,370
change at all if time-to-market is is

00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:42,029
the only the only benefit that that

00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:46,049
we're targeting and I won't stop on all

00:18:42,029 --> 00:18:50,880
the all the benefits and we won't do all

00:18:46,049 --> 00:18:55,320
the math and make the total business

00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:57,120
case but I would just like to share some

00:18:55,320 --> 00:19:04,529
some ideas some approaches what could be

00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:07,010
measured to how benefit can be measured

00:19:04,529 --> 00:19:14,539
and how they could be converted into

00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:17,779
into money into actual savings besides

00:19:14,539 --> 00:19:20,750
we already use developers productivity

00:19:17,779 --> 00:19:24,330
in our previous previous example and

00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:27,240
developers productivity helps us save

00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:30,029
save time to market and have our develop

00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:33,090
have our application delivered to to

00:19:30,029 --> 00:19:36,240
production faster however there is

00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:37,590
another another face to it that

00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,929
developers don't spend that

00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:43,049
time the Duncan salary and all these

00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:48,360
features so this another another savings

00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:51,360
for our organization for habitability we

00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:54,450
can use percentage of availability

00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:57,390
number of incidents and we can convert

00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:59,520
it into when dollar value with the cost

00:19:57,390 --> 00:20:01,500
of downtime and the cost of customer

00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:04,710
acquisition assuming that some of our

00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:11,190
customers will will just leave if the

00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:15,149
services and is not stable for service

00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:17,610
quality and also we can connect to the

00:20:15,149 --> 00:20:18,690
customers customers lifetime and revenue

00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:22,799
per and per customer

00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:26,760
how much customer gives gives the

00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:31,919
organization during its lifespan he his

00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:38,970
or her life span with the professional

00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:41,730
efficiency we can we can link to amount

00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:45,570
of time that has been spent on on

00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:48,450
supporting maintenance on our system and

00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:53,549
production of all platform also converge

00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:56,010
to $2 this salary also clear harder to

00:20:53,549 --> 00:20:59,669
position is its percentage of ram being

00:20:56,010 --> 00:21:03,330
used and the cost of ram and if you use

00:20:59,669 --> 00:21:05,340
let's say such such geometric as

00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:09,000
avoiding software infrastructure service

00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:13,370
like you look in now we can we can use

00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:17,820
time and several professional services

00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:20,820
that we don't have that we that we may

00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:23,309
spend to make rate to another to another

00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:26,070
platform how much we are anchored to

00:21:23,309 --> 00:21:27,990
this specific specific infrastructure

00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:34,559
and how much to cost for us to go

00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:36,890
somewhere else besides that my dear

00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:45,200
champions you may use additional

00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:45,200
additional benefits that that could be

00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:51,100
monetized and quantified could be

00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:54,259
could not be monetized to quantify it

00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:57,500
but you may expect that with the

00:21:54,259 --> 00:21:59,330
properly functioning functioning the

00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:03,500
platform you will have more satisfied

00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:06,429
developer customers also quite important

00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:09,820
could be a lower management overhead and

00:22:06,429 --> 00:22:16,570
also lower barrier to to initiate

00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:21,110
initiating project sorry

00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:24,200
again if if you don't if you didn't

00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:25,970
justify justify your the values or and

00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:28,970
your expenses into the platform before

00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:31,789
now with the metrics that we used on on

00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:35,179
previous slide now then you can dig in

00:22:31,789 --> 00:22:37,850
into this matrix where it lies you're on

00:22:35,179 --> 00:22:44,000
your own goals and you're on your own

00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:47,659
benefits and let's see would say we we

00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,669
calculated 10 million potential of quad

00:22:47,659 --> 00:22:57,230
called foundry usage confirm utilization

00:22:49,669 --> 00:23:01,580
and if nobody uses it we can calculate

00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:05,059
the effort and effect and then I'm

00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:08,690
suggesting to to use another dimension

00:23:05,059 --> 00:23:14,120
of our metrics which are adoption

00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:17,539
metrics to see how how much actually

00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:21,230
your organization is utilizing utilizing

00:23:17,539 --> 00:23:24,799
the platform in terms of application

00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:28,519
that being hosted so these are some

00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:33,409
examples some examples of metrics that

00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:40,909
you can use to track track the adoption

00:23:33,409 --> 00:23:42,620
and with with increase of adoption you

00:23:40,909 --> 00:23:44,450
will he will increase the value of our

00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:48,289
platform for for your company

00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:52,190
organization and yeah we were working

00:23:48,289 --> 00:23:55,190
sort of development industry and the RAM

00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:58,519
agile methodologies that tell us how to

00:23:55,190 --> 00:24:02,270
develop our our software and we may

00:23:58,519 --> 00:24:08,300
apply this scientific method or Lina

00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:12,530
into organization and to iterate move to

00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:14,630
our goal see how we have achieved all

00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:21,980
metrics and how have achieved our goals

00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:26,480
and as a summary we're close to to the

00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:29,929
end of my presentation in order to to

00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:33,110
convince and to to be successful in cod4

00:24:29,929 --> 00:24:35,300
implementation I suggest that the

00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:41,450
champions of code Ferrari should

00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:43,850
understand the goals identify metrics be

00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:47,270
clear about what they want to achieve

00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:49,040
and what's achievable assess possible

00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:53,650
result and they've the results are

00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:57,230
satisfactory if it's worth of pursuing

00:24:53,650 --> 00:25:00,140
these goals then just to act you take

00:24:57,230 --> 00:25:04,010
your decision and you act on them now

00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:07,370
also having metrics helps helps us to to

00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:10,750
track the progress to get a proof of

00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:13,670
success and we need to understand that

00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:17,660
just doesn't come for free and we need

00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:19,940
to to iterate to change culture to

00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:34,429
convince people around us and to be the

00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:36,700
leaders thank you questions okay do we

00:25:34,429 --> 00:25:36,700
have questions

00:25:40,330 --> 00:26:21,340
yep yeah we're a good question actually

00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:26,140
I would suggest to to use the the

00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:27,730
metrics that are objective to and to

00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:33,550
utilize the actual processes that

00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:36,550
organization is utilizing and try to to

00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:38,170
identify the hidden processes what we

00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:42,270
didn't whatever didn't calculate what we

00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:42,270
do and to be as objective as possible

00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:22,409
the number of locations okay

00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:27,210
uh-huh we have in my equation you have

00:27:22,409 --> 00:27:31,440
three three elements it's cost of delay

00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:33,960
its its manometric now then the cost of

00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:38,789
delay per day and so we have to multiply

00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:45,620
it by a number of DS and also number of

00:27:38,789 --> 00:27:50,920
obligations did address a question okay

00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:55,089
other questions yeah thanks again

00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:55,089
