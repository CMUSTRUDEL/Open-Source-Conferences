Description: 
	How I Accidentally Used Open Source Ideology to Make a Bestselling Novel - Andy Weir, Novelist, Programmer and Space Nerd

Andy Weir was first hired as a programmer for a national laboratory at age fifteen and has been working as a software engineer ever since. He is also a lifelong space nerd and a devoted hobbyist of subjects like relativistic physics, orbital mechanics, and the history of manned spaceflight. The Martian is his first novel.

well as I said I'm Andy weir and I wrote

00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:07,200
the Martian and what I'm gonna do is I'm

00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:10,139
gonna tell you the story behind this

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,360
story which could you know I think the

00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:13,740
title of it yeah how I accidentally used

00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,690
open-source ideology to make a

00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:19,350
best-selling novel yeah that's pretty

00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:20,609
good title bungle into a best-selling

00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:24,660
novel might have been a better set of

00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:26,250
verbs basically so just so you know I

00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,560
come from a software engineering

00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:30,449
background I spent 25 years as a

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,040
software engineer I always wanted to be

00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:33,690
a writer but I also liked eating

00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,000
regularly and not living under an

00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:37,649
overpass so when the time came to choose

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,500
a career I was like hmm software

00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:45,360
engineer or writer money so I ended up

00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:49,399
going to school dropping out of school a

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,780
kind of standard engineer story and I

00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:53,309
got a job in the software industry and I

00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,710
was happy I liked it I like programming

00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:57,930
computers and I'm reasonably good at it

00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,340
because you can't do something for 25

00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:03,239
years and not get at least a little

00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:06,180
competent but I also always wanted to be

00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:07,979
a writer and so around the late 1990s

00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,439
when I was working for America Online I

00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:12,150
they merged with Netscape and I got Murr

00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:15,090
I got laid off with about eight hundred

00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:17,759
of my closest friends and because I

00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:19,530
happened to get hired at AOL at just the

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,900
right time I had a bunch of money worth

00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:23,880
of stock options and because I got laid

00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,380
off at just the right time I ended up

00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,479
being forced to sell them when they were

00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:29,189
at their peak I assure you I would not

00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:32,520
have made a wise financial decision left

00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:36,390
my own devices but I was forced into

00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:38,670
this so I ended up with a bunch of money

00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:41,070
and I thought there we go I'm gonna take

00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,960
my chance I'm going to be able to write

00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:44,490
a book and try to get it published I've

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,320
got enough money I can I can go years

00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:50,909
without having to work so I did it I

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:55,229
took three years off I wrote a book it

00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:58,290
is not the Martian you have not heard of

00:01:55,229 --> 00:02:01,770
this book have you because it wasn't

00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:03,810
very good and it's the standard writers

00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:05,579
story I spent three years are why I

00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:07,320
wrote it and then I couldn't get an

00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:09,420
agent I couldn't get a publisher

00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,970
interested I it just completely fell

00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:13,230
flat and so I thought like well now I

00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:15,239
don't need to wonder what my

00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:17,370
have been what what what could have

00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:19,290
happened I took a shot at following my

00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:21,810
dream now we'll go back into engineering

00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:23,760
which I really enjoy so it's not like

00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:25,980
I'm hanging my head low and going back

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,620
you know to something I hated I really

00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:31,819
like programming computers in fact I

00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:34,470
just quit my full-time programming job

00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:36,330
just over a year ago to go full-time on

00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:38,370
the writing and that was a bittersweet

00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:41,160
moment for me I like to work it I worked

00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:45,180
at mobileiron but that was the last job

00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:47,340
I had I liked it I liked my boss I liked

00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,079
my co-workers I liked the environment I

00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,310
like being a computer programmer so

00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:52,980
don't get me wrong it's not like this

00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:55,200
was some huge life failure but it was

00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:57,629
time to move on so around this time the

00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,040
internet was just kind of increasing

00:02:57,629 --> 00:03:01,200
more and more in popularity and I

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,060
realized I had an Avenue where I could

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,040
be creative at people without having to

00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,690
get published so I started writing my

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,599
own stories and just posting them on to

00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:13,620
the Internet the world wide web very

00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:16,709
exciting I I made a bunch of web comics

00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:18,540
I made short fiction I did stuff like

00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:20,280
this for about ten years and during that

00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:22,440
time I accumulated a reader base of

00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,900
about 3,000 people and here's where we

00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:28,650
start to get into the open source II

00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:30,239
thing right around the time I started

00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:32,370
writing the Martian I also wrote a short

00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,799
story called the egg which some of you

00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:36,180
may have heard of I don't know but that

00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,819
was really popular and it made the

00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,410
rounds on the internet and it got posted

00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:41,880
around from blog to blog and that ended

00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:43,919
up bringing a lot of people to my site

00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:45,690
that turned out to be really handy

00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:48,480
because I ended up with a mailing list

00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:50,400
of a modest about 3,000 people because

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,620
of it so when I started writing the

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,470
Martian I was just posting at a chapter

00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:58,139
at a time to my website I usually it was

00:03:55,470 --> 00:04:00,480
a serial it was like you know the follow

00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:02,819
Adventures of Mark Watney on Moz and it

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,190
was just like the idea was to just I

00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:06,930
don't know just wander or meander with

00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:10,620
it forever I didn't even think of it as

00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:12,810
a book initially and what was really

00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:16,019
cool about this is they kind of bungled

00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:18,150
into this is so I had a bunch of really

00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:21,719
scientifically minded regular readers

00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:23,969
that means nerds just like me and they

00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:25,320
would read everything I wrote and go

00:04:23,969 --> 00:04:28,669
through it with a fine-tooth comb and

00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,669
tell me if I did anything wrong

00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:35,400
so this was extremely helpful to get the

00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:37,680
feedback as I'm iteratively posting one

00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,720
chapter at a time of the Martian and

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,490
that worked out really well to make it a

00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:44,100
much more solid story I think than it

00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:46,170
would have been if I had just made it as

00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,850
a fait accompli and done the entire book

00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:49,440
at once I got to respond to their

00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:54,600
feedback so it's kind of like an agile

00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:56,460
release process for a book so anyway I

00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,960
finished the I finished the book I

00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:00,180
finished the last chapter and I called

00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,890
it a day and I'm like okay I'm done off

00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:03,600
to other things and I started to get

00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:05,520
email from people saying like hey I

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,630
really like your book but I hate reading

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,870
it on your website because your

00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:12,720
website's crappy and it it was it is it

00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:14,250
still is and they said can you make an

00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,530
e-reader version and so I'm like okay

00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:18,330
sure here's what I'll do I figured out

00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:19,710
how to make an ePub and a mobi version I

00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:21,990
posted them to the site I said all right

00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:25,500
everybody there you go you can knock

00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:27,840
yourself out download it go to town it's

00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:30,690
still free okay then I got other emails

00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:34,080
from people saying hey love your book

00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:36,090
hate your website but I I really don't

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,590
I'm not very technically savvy and I

00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:39,200
don't know how to download a thing from

00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:41,970
the internet and put it on my e-reader

00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:44,610
can you put it can you just put it up on

00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:46,740
Amazon so I'm like alright let's see how

00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:49,110
that works so I used Amazon Kindle

00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:51,020
direct publishing which is you can just

00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:53,700
post whatever you want up there and

00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:56,130
you're not allowed to give it away for

00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:59,700
free they want to make money so they

00:05:56,130 --> 00:06:02,310
have the minimum price of $0.99 and so I

00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:05,700
set the price to $0.99 meaning that they

00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:08,580
get like 69 cents and I pull down a cool

00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:09,960
30 cents profit per per copy the

00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:12,480
absolute minimum that I was allowed to

00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:14,310
set it so then you give it to them it

00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:16,380
doesn't cost you anything and they hold

00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:18,150
onto it for like 48 hours just to make

00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:26,940
sure it's not goat porn or something and

00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:28,410
then don't judge okay so they they hang

00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:30,960
on to it and then and then they push it

00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:33,210
and then that's it and so then I told I

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,680
told my readers I'm like alright you can

00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:36,180
read on my crappy website you can

00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,520
download the e-reader versions for free

00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:39,940
or you can pay amazon a buck to put it

00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:42,880
on your Kindle for you

00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:45,940
basically and more people paid for it

00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,920
than downloaded it for free which really

00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:49,810
shows you the reach that amazon has into

00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:51,280
the readership market and also shows you

00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:53,020
that people are willing to pay a buck to

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,780
get around technical hassles because

00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:57,460
it's just a bug so anyway the book

00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:59,230
started to sell really well and it kept

00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:01,120
selling and it kept selling people gave

00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:04,000
it a lots of positive reviews which is

00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,860
awesome and it starts showing up in

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,840
Amazon's you might also like blaaah

00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:11,200
lists and you might also like this and

00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:13,060
it started a really kind of steamroll it

00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:15,010
got into the top sellers lists for

00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:17,490
sci-fi hard sci-fi a bunch they have

00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:19,900
about a million top sellers lists and

00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:22,210
once it got into the top ten of sci-fi

00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:24,850
then it really started to roll because

00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:26,080
of course you know you're like oh I want

00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:27,880
to read a book I don't know what I want

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,650
I want sci-fi one of the top 10 sellers

00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,480
in sci-fi let's take a look and so

00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:33,160
that's why it dramatically increases

00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,330
your odds of making a sale once you get

00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,640
up under those lists so you get this

00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:39,850
kind of exponential thing well that

00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:41,730
caught the attention of an editor at

00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:45,040
Random House named Julian Padilla and

00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:48,340
Julian was talking to a colleague of his

00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:50,770
an agent who agent named David Fugate

00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:51,910
and he was like I'm getting a lot of I'm

00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:53,860
hearing a lot about this book the

00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:56,560
Martian but I don't know if it's just

00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:58,990
gonna be you know engineering porn or

00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,720
something that's like really people

00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:03,280
might like and so David who's a literary

00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,720
agent said like well you realize you

00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,540
just told me you might be interested in

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,100
an unpublished book so I'm gonna go read

00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:10,780
it now and if I like it I'm gonna end up

00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:12,730
being that guy's agent is that a problem

00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:14,380
when Jillian's like yes or whatever so

00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:15,790
he read it he liked it and emailed me

00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:18,490
and said like hey do you need an agent

00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:20,740
so at this point after three years of

00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:23,200
not being able to get an agent early in

00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:25,870
life right sending out letters helped I

00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:29,410
want agent stuff like that no no no but

00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:30,910
now one comes to me so that was a bit of

00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:33,039
a surprise and I'm like sure that sounds

00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:35,830
good and then Random House is like okay

00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:37,599
we'd like to make you a we'd like to

00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:40,830
talk about making a book deal and I'm

00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,830
like well talk to my agent and

00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:47,630
so and around the same time that that

00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:49,970
David was working out the deal with

00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:52,400
Random House then 20th Century Fox came

00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:55,220
for the movie rights so that was pretty

00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:57,410
exciting and so David has another agent

00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:59,300
that he uses a colleague that he uses to

00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:00,620
work out film rights deals and all these

00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:05,600
things were going on at the same time

00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:07,580
and ultimately the the book deal and the

00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,400
movie deal were agreed upon four days

00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:14,060
apart so that was a very very eventful

00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:15,620
week for me and by the way at this time

00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:17,600
I'm still working at mobileiron as a

00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:19,040
software engineer so I'm sitting there

00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,290
at my desk you know in that cubicle

00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,290
fixing bugs then I gotta go take a call

00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:26,600
about my movie deal and then back I go

00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:29,540
fix for bugs and so that was uh I was a

00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:32,090
really surreal life in fact I I didn't

00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:36,230
really believe it initially I actually I

00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:37,610
was like am I being scammed it's like

00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:40,880
these are all just voices on the phone

00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:42,410
and like texting my email I mean it's

00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,790
like but once they started sending me

00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:49,160
the checks then I started to believe

00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:52,160
them then of course over time I after

00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:53,680
once the once the book came out it got

00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,240
under the New York Times bestseller list

00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,140
which made Fox start to take it a lot

00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,440
more seriously

00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:02,270
so Drew Goddard attached himself to the

00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:05,920
project and wrote the screenplay and

00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:08,840
then he was also set to direct and then

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:11,060
you know so that's like step one of like

00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,770
oh cool we're gonna get it's a little

00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:14,570
more likely to get green-lighted because

00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:16,850
you got to realize like movie companies

00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:18,680
they'll get the film option on a book

00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:21,140
like they'd buy breath mints I mean

00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:22,850
they'll go get hundreds of film options

00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:25,760
for every one movie they make out of a

00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:27,380
book it's not it it doesn't really mean

00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,930
much and you don't get a bunch of money

00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:33,980
unless they actually greenlight the film

00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:34,970
so anyway Drew Goddard wanted to write

00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:37,100
the screenplay and he wanted a direct

00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:38,450
okay now it's more likely and then Matt

00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:41,180
Damon said he wanted to play the lead

00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:43,280
okay now it's much more likely right and

00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:45,200
then Drew Goddard had to leave to go

00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:47,540
direct the next spider-man movie okay

00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,430
well then it became less likely and then

00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:53,970
Ridley Scott said well all directed so

00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:55,950
then it was like okay this is happening

00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:59,010
a lot of people ask me what my role is

00:10:55,950 --> 00:11:01,440
in in the movie production and I can

00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:03,750
just tell you that as the writer of the

00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:09,050
novel my primary job on the film was to

00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:12,570
cash the cheque and I've done that so

00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:14,610
what what the so what's the moral of

00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:16,650
this story the moral of this story is

00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:18,960
that you can be an intellectual property

00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:22,110
sharing hippie and a money-grubbing

00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:26,180
capitalist at the same time because I'm

00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:26,180
