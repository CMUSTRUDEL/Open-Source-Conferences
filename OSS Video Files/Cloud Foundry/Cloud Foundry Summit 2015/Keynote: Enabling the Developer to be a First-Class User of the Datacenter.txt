hi I'm Kate Kolbert running a new team

00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:05,960
at VMware called cloud native

00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:08,510
applications and the focus is really on

00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:10,200
how do we enable our customers to

00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:12,750
embrace these next-generation

00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:15,269
applications you know as James and Josh

00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,619
were discussing earlier this is a trend

00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:18,119
that we're seeing across all our

00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:20,070
customers and everyone's thinking about

00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:21,390
this so one of those notions that you

00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,859
know Marc Andreessen said a long time

00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,810
ago right software is eating the world

00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:26,099
every company's becoming a software

00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,960
company we're seeing this to get in

00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:29,609
again I mean even this week's issue of

00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,800
The Economist they're talking about how

00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:34,079
financial institutions are now really

00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,180
worried about tech startups coming and

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,380
disrupting them right so everyone's got

00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,950
to figure out how they can embrace these

00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:43,620
things and move faster let's see here we

00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,850
go so as that's happening you know it's

00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,129
kind of these new imperatives for

00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:48,690
business right given that software it's

00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:50,579
becoming the major way that these

00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:53,070
companies interact and engage with their

00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:54,149
users you know that companies don't need

00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:56,340
to think about how they can create the

00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:58,559
best experience on those software

00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,329
platforms this isn't just saying you

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,190
know having a good mobile app or a good

00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:05,040
web app it's also doing things like Big

00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:06,390
Data Internet of Things so on and so

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,189
forth so you can get large amounts of

00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:10,260
data that you can then analyze and give

00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:12,049
insights back to those customers it's

00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,040
about engaging them at a deeper level

00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:15,119
but it's not just about doing that once

00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,520
right we've talked we've heard this

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,500
before how is how quickly you can move

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,060
right Ewing was just talking about this

00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,619
and you know I had certain requirements

00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,240
for how fast and how often they need to

00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:26,070
be provisioning stuff into production

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,869
and so there's you know all these

00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:30,030
technologies out there and in the open

00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:31,560
source world James and Josh talked about

00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:33,090
Netflix and all the great stuff they've

00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,490
done and given back so you actually

00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,840
absolutely have to engage and you know

00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:38,670
leverage those things as much as

00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:43,290
possible you want a structured platform

00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:45,000
as they said so the interesting thing

00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:47,100
from VMware's perspective you know we're

00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,840
looking at it from the IT ops data

00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,759
center side is what we're seeing is that

00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,369
the infrastructure itself is also

00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:54,840
changing so traditionally you know the

00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:57,799
focus of IT was all about saving money

00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,909
right how can we drive efficiencies and

00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:01,619
consolidate workloads this is you know

00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:03,270
something that we really help customers

00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:05,100
to do to move all these disparate

00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:07,290
workloads on many servers Consulting

00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,580
them down to fewer servers but as we go

00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:10,709
to this next generation world it's not

00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,880
really about efficiency and capex

00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:14,800
savings so much as it is about

00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,660
deeper user engagement it's about

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,610
reaching those users and actually

00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:20,290
driving top-line business growth rights

00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:21,400
how do I should get more revenue and so

00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:22,960
anything about that you think about

00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,790
scale you think about distribution you

00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:26,560
think about how quickly you can move and

00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:28,000
so really it becomes less about the

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,340
infrastructure a lot more about the

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,300
applications and how you can leverage

00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:35,410
infrastructure to help those

00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:36,730
applications scale so that in mind your

00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:38,650
mission that we have within our team at

00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:42,040
VMware is really to make developers a

00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:43,300
first-class user the data center and now

00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:45,220
for many folks in this room you may say

00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:48,490
yeah of course obviously that's what we

00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:50,080
need to do and yes it's true the problem

00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:52,330
though is that today data centers aren't

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,460
really optimized for developers you know

00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:56,770
developers don't want to file a ticket

00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:58,270
and wait whatever-it-is weeks you know

00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:00,610
days or whatever to get that thing done

00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:02,230
they want to call an api have it done in

00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:03,970
seconds right they don't want to be

00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:05,320
exposed to the complexity of a data

00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:07,570
center they want the data center

00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:09,730
essentially to be fronted by a giant API

00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:11,500
they can call and get stuff done right

00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:13,870
so all that complexity down the data

00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,980
center should be hidden from them so

00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,000
that's a lot of what we've been trying

00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,440
to do I mean this is a direction

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,790
environments been going in with this

00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,020
whole software-defined data center

00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:21,220
vision we've had which is really

00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:22,860
enabling our customers to get the

00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:25,660
tooling the tools to actually build

00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:27,070
these API is on top and automate that

00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:29,500
data center but we want to do a little

00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:31,000
bit more so we're looking at how can we

00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,010
build and really engage when

00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,020
technologies that span the application

00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:38,380
lifecycle all the way from a developer's

00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:40,570
laptop to the production stack we want

00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:42,010
to empower the offs teams to support

00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:44,110
these next-generation types of

00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:46,030
applications we want to move IT to

00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:47,290
beyond able to say yes we can support

00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:49,750
that we want to do that we want to see

00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:51,910
how fast we can move here and finally we

00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:53,860
want to do that in an open way right

00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:55,800
leveraging open source technology open

00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:58,030
standards but also contributing back

00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,290
because as we said this is where a lot

00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,420
of the innovation is happening is in the

00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:03,130
open source world

00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:04,420
so specifically cloud foundry right very

00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:07,090
exciting stuff I don't need to pitch you

00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:09,550
guys on how cool cloud foundry is we've

00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:11,440
been you know incubate incubated cloud

00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:14,680
foundry at VMware for many years and

00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:15,970
then we when pivotal was created we you

00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,170
know gave a lot of those assets to them

00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:18,730
and they've been driving yet now it's

00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:21,190
great to see a whole foundation around

00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:22,690
and this huge community is there and you

00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:23,919
know as they were saying James and Josh

00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:25,770
were saying earlier this really is a

00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,419
structured platform for an a

00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:29,819
and customers to move faster and that's

00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:31,169
great so the question is you know what

00:04:29,819 --> 00:04:33,240
else needs to be done how can we help

00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:35,129
call a foundry to accelerate how can we

00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,470
help our customers embrace Cloud Foundry

00:04:35,129 --> 00:04:38,970
even more and so as we start thinking

00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:40,680
about it there's of course lots of stuff

00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:42,479
to do it's still a new space but

00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,949
probably the biggest issue that we hear

00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:47,610
and biggest concerns that we hear from

00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:48,840
customers are around security right how

00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:50,580
do you secure these next-generation

00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,470
applications and you think about there's

00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:54,270
a lot of challenges because I'm not

00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:56,129
talking about apps with just one or two

00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:58,349
or maybe five instances a lot of times

00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:59,310
now the ability to dynamically scale up

00:04:58,349 --> 00:05:00,930
this stuff means you're gonna have

00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:04,560
dozens or hundreds or maybe even

00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:06,180
thousands of instances and you have a

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,590
lot of different infrastructure topology

00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,729
you know changing application topology

00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:10,409
how do you ensure that all these

00:05:08,729 --> 00:05:11,520
different things can be trusted right

00:05:10,409 --> 00:05:13,979
how do you ensure they can talk to each

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,990
other properly and so in order to do

00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:18,060
this you need a few different things you

00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:20,190
throw this identity infrastructure for

00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:22,259
these applications you need good network

00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:24,240
isolation and dynamic network topology

00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:26,039
support and finally you need a secure

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,479
and trusted runtime so I'll kind of walk

00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:32,789
through what we're doing in each of

00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:34,349
these different areas so first it's kind

00:05:32,789 --> 00:05:35,819
of a high-level architecture diagram

00:05:34,349 --> 00:05:38,759
that we'll use to walk through some of

00:05:35,819 --> 00:05:40,680
this so what we see here is of course

00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:42,150
you know Linux hosts where you're

00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,279
running your containers and container

00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:46,080
engine living living inside Cloud

00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:48,300
Foundry the crown foundry itself does

00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,250
scheduling orchestration may you may

00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:52,020
have a repository you may not and then

00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:53,090
some network underneath to connect all

00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:55,229
your different Linux hosts

00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:56,069
so the thing that's missing is some sort

00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:58,440
of identity and access management

00:05:56,069 --> 00:06:00,750
solution that can really tie all these

00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:02,039
pieces together you know it's like when

00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:04,139
you think about Cloud Foundry how can it

00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:05,550
trust the hosts that is running on when

00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:06,990
you think about that host house the

00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:08,699
hosts know that the containers about to

00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:10,500
execute is actually the container it

00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:12,029
should be executing right the thing I

00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:15,150
always talk about is it's kind of funny

00:06:12,029 --> 00:06:17,880
that most folks iPhones are more secure

00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:18,360
than most data centers all right I mean

00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,370
think about it

00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,690
you know exactly what apps or it are

00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:23,819
allowed to run on that iPhone or I mean

00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:25,080
Apple has that ecosystem controlled top

00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:26,580
to bottom everything is

00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,919
cryptographically signed you can attest

00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:30,330
to the code they don't let anything in

00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:32,099
the App Store they don't approve and if

00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:34,020
your company is an MDM solution you can

00:06:32,099 --> 00:06:36,300
further control what apps actually go on

00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:37,649
to that phone but in a datacenter you

00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,909
don't have any of that right I mean you

00:06:37,649 --> 00:06:39,510
just have a bunch of hosts much IP

00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:41,910
addresses

00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:43,920
you can exact whatever process you want

00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:45,570
and you're off and running right I mean

00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,310
how does it how does Daytona get locked

00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:49,020
down the same way that our iPhones are

00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:50,520
now well this is exactly we want to do

00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:52,190
and so this is the idea behind this

00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:54,660
thing we're calling project light wave

00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:56,730
so project light wave is an identity and

00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:58,320
access management solution or component

00:06:56,730 --> 00:07:00,660
that's focused on cloud native

00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:02,640
applications containers and so forth so

00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:04,800
the idea there is that we're not really

00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:07,290
focused on user identity so much as

00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,610
different component application

00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:10,410
component or infrastructure component

00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:13,140
identity now how do you tie all those

00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:14,400
different things together so the host

00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,600
can validate the container so that

00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,820
different containers can validate each

00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,380
other and within within that application

00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,310
so the cool part is that this thing

00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:23,310
supports a bunch of different protocols

00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:24,960
you know the reality is that these new

00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:26,280
cloud foundry instances you create are

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,840
not going to be little islands by

00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,220
themselves but a Syrah sure can be

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,780
interacting with a lot of the existing

00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:32,370
data center services you have and so you

00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:34,320
need to support all those different

00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:35,850
protocols it needs to be scalable this

00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,410
thing is multi tenant so just like Cloud

00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:39,270
Foundry as multi-tenancy you need multi

00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:40,700
tenant so you sort of top to bottom and

00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:42,600
as I said we're open sourcing this

00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:44,850
hopefully this week or next week it

00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:46,320
should be going out very soon under the

00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:47,760
Apache 2 license to some pretty cool

00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,050
stuff we've had a lot of different

00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:51,480
interest from partners and working

00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:53,490
closely if the Cloud Foundry folks and

00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:55,950
you know folks like pivotal to really

00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:59,520
integrate this and combine this with the

00:07:55,950 --> 00:08:01,710
great cloud foundry technologies so

00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,330
that's the first piece how do you kind

00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:05,100
of secure from an identity and

00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:07,590
authentication standpoint and do that

00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:09,780
for the components now the second piece

00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:11,820
is around the Linux so is how do you

00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:14,880
ensure you have trusts and security

00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:17,610
there and so we're looking at sort of a

00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:20,250
VMware deployment what you really want

00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:22,410
is how do you combine and integrate that

00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,880
Linux distro as much as possible into

00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:25,950
the hypervisor to really simplify

00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:27,690
management and to drive up security so

00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:30,420
that's why we announced something called

00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:32,790
project photon so project photon is

00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:34,349
actually a Linux distro from VMware the

00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:35,700
idea here is as optimized to run

00:08:34,349 --> 00:08:39,260
containers so it's extraordinarily

00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:42,000
lightweight we're also optimizing it for

00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:43,080
for our hypervisors or frac browsers in

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,240
general for virtualization

00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,290
so as you can see here we support bunch

00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,510
of different containers out of the box

00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:51,180
obviously very tightly integrating it to

00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:52,740
Cloud Foundry the thing we wanted to do

00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,790
though is actually as you can see

00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,650
further down the slide actually take

00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:57,570
that a bit further and actually build a

00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:59,790
stem cell for Cloud Foundry leveraging

00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:01,170
photon so that's in the works and the

00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:02,550
idea there is again you know when you

00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:04,650
talk to enterprises and you talk to IT

00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:06,210
ops they really an IT security they

00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:08,040
really want you know standard building

00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:10,020
blocks they can trust in their data

00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,400
centers so we've been very successful at

00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:13,230
this over many years working closely

00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,820
with the IT security folks to get their

00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:16,740
heads wrapped around our vcr hypervisor

00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:18,840
and we want to extend that with Photon

00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:20,700
right so they've secured trusted runtime

00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:22,530
for quad foundry and their other

00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:24,240
applications so some really cool stuff

00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:26,580
we're doing there and the idea is you

00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,440
know again from a usability management

00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:30,210
perspective the ideas photons kind of

00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,430
built in when you get vSphere you get

00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:34,920
vCloud air it's just there it works you

00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:36,270
have you know integrated support one

00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,160
throat to choke right one phone call to

00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:39,600
make all these great things and so as we

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,540
said we're also open sourcing this one

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,070
under the GPL v2 license and this is out

00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,390
today we've had a bunch of folks testing

00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:47,250
it out kicking the tires on it

00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:51,540
submitting pull requests so a lot of

00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:54,180
good stuff going on there ok so identity

00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:57,870
access management the compute runtime

00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:59,820
the third piece is the network and you

00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:01,440
really want some sort of networking

00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:03,510
technology that can handle the dinette

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,400
work network dynamic network topologies

00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:07,200
of a cloud native application you're

00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,580
thinking about you know again dozens or

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,010
hundreds or thousands of instances of

00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:12,840
ZAP all you know coming and going over

00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:15,090
time you wants and now a network

00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:16,770
technology that can handle that so we

00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:17,580
have a network virtualization product

00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:19,710
called nsx

00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:21,510
essentially virtualizes you know there's

00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:22,950
physical network concepts and allows you

00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:26,700
to control them through software and via

00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:28,050
an API it's a really cool stuff right so

00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:31,530
if you look at how this stuff works

00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:32,670
today basically you're running a

00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:34,890
container inside of a virtual machine

00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:36,450
and so what we do is we have all sorts

00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:38,490
of support for virtual machine

00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:40,860
networking NSX can do something called

00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:43,290
micro segmentation down to a VM provides

00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:45,480
dynamic security firewall load balance

00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:47,850
etc for that VM all the containers

00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,890
inside the VM is sort of share that

00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:51,090
network context and you may have a NAT

00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:52,950
or something else you're doing there

00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:55,470
this actually works it works for many

00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:57,120
people today right but we want to do

00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:58,860
something a little bit more than that so

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:02,550
we're actually moving forward to do a

00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:03,900
second level of network virtualization

00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:06,270
if you will actually virtual

00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:07,140
at the container level so the idea

00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:10,260
there's you can actually have multiple

00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:12,030
containers inside a single VM all of

00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:13,770
which or each of which has its own

00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:16,020
unique security properties you can do

00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:17,340
different firewall settings different

00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:19,020
load balancing rules different routing

00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:21,510
rules etc for each of those containers

00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:23,280
so this is really pretty cool and

00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:24,780
something we're looking to extend NSX as

00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:27,330
well as doing an open source project

00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:28,980
called ovn open virtual network to

00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:32,190
enable that as well so a lot of good

00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:34,260
stuff happening there now one question

00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:36,390
we do get around this notion is you know

00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,500
do we still need a hypervisor in this

00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:40,230
case like why can't we just have a

00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:41,760
containers running on bare metal so you

00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:43,410
know when we talk about security the

00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,360
really important piece here is you know

00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:47,520
multi-tenant security ensuring that you

00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,930
really have safety between folks you may

00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:51,090
not trust and that doesn't have to be

00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:52,560
different businesses maybe different

00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:54,480
organizations within a business you know

00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,700
some of the security folks we talked to

00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,620
a major organizations actually say that

00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:00,540
there are biggest threats in their mind

00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:02,150
are from their internal employees not

00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:04,500
from someone attacking them outside

00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:06,300
party you're kind of wondering why that

00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,250
why yeah I get some new employees and if

00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:10,140
that's you know the biggest problem but

00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:11,790
nevertheless it's true right so they're

00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:13,710
very very sensitive to this so that

00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:15,150
means they want security top to bottom

00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:16,710
they want multi-tenancy to top to bottom

00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:19,380
they want that and the network layer as

00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:20,550
well so the problem is if without using

00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,780
a virtual machine see if you can break

00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:25,800
out of the container you can get access

00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:27,900
to the virtual switch or you know the

00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,400
switch locally on that host there and

00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:34,020
then you can go out and kind of go out

00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:35,640
to the entire network the beauty of what

00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:38,130
a hypervisor enables you to do is really

00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:40,110
protect that if you break out of a

00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:41,610
container into that local VM the

00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:43,350
hypervisor can still protect that VM

00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:46,410
traffic it won't happen you know you you

00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:48,360
can set the in the VM you can set your

00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:49,500
NIC to promiscuous mode just don't be

00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,510
able to see any traffic because the

00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:53,370
hypervisor can protect you from that so

00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:54,870
the notion of a VM sort of changes in

00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:56,910
this next-generation world right

00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:58,830
it's not about managing VMs anymore it's

00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:00,240
about managing applications but the

00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:02,640
beauty of virtualization is that it

00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:05,640
actually offers you a really tried and

00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:08,010
true and proven security domain so VM

00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:10,590
kind of become software driven security

00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:12,540
domains and so you may say okay I have

00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:14,460
some containers some instances of this

00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:16,110
app that I trust each other they can be

00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,100
provisioned within the same security

00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:18,210
domain same VM

00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,980
others that don't they need to be

00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:21,240
separated out so that's the beauty of

00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:22,830
what we see it kind of is better

00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:25,020
together between virtualization and

00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:27,480
containers at the network and the

00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:29,310
compute level so a bunch of different

00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,930
stuff we're doing as I said you know

00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:32,400
this goal is to make developers a

00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:34,200
first-class user the data center

00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:36,060
something that should have been done a

00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,860
long time ago but it's been very hard

00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:39,990
for IT to move in that direction this

00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:41,280
they haven't had the technologies but

00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:42,510
now we're seeing those technologies are

00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,520
coming to the forefront things like

00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:46,350
Cloud Foundry are helping to force that

00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:48,030
discussion so we want to do is help

00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:50,160
those customers at the infrastructure

00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:52,290
layer with the compute with Identity and

00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,700
Access Management and of course with the

00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:55,080
networking piece and so you can see some

00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,240
of these different technologies out

00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:58,920
there photon or light wave both open

00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:02,370
source both available for you to go kick

00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:03,630
the tires on and try out so with that I

00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:06,060
want to say this is just the beginning

00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:08,550
right don't assume that photon and light

00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:10,350
wave and you know NSX by themselves are

00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:11,730
the solution there's a lot more work to

00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,200
do as I said security is kind of the

00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:14,730
first piece but there's a lot more stuff

00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,710
around management around automation

00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:17,880
around governance and so forth not to

00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:20,250
mention more infrastructure things we

00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,510
can do so look for more announcements

00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:23,220
from us throughout the year and next

00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:25,350
year but for the time being please check

00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:26,560
us out on github and follow our Twitter

00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:29,860
thank you guys

00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,860
