hi everyone welcome to the first Cloud

00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:08,429
Foundry summit to be held virtually

00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:10,800
before I talk about the platform or the

00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:12,210
event I want to spend a moment to

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,070
comment on some of the extraordinary

00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:18,900
things happening in the world today

00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:20,550
we're here virtually because each one of

00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,529
us in one way or another is dealing with

00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:27,000
the novel coronavirus that emerge in

00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:29,039
late 2019 most of us are still isolated

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,539
at home many of us are concerned for the

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,090
health and safety of friends family and

00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:34,079
ourselves this is a very challenging

00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:36,450
time for the whole world

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,090
from individuals to companies to

00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,890
governments our goal as a community has

00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:43,170
always been to help developers go from

00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:46,110
idea to production in days and hours not

00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:48,480
weeks and months and so even in this

00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:50,070
uncertain time we can feel proud that

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,050
our platform has helped countless

00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:53,989
organizations respond to new

00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:58,079
requirements and changing conditions

00:00:53,989 --> 00:00:59,160
rapidly they're examples of governments

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,149
that have been able to get much-needed

00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:06,299
benefits out to their citizens very

00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:08,520
rapidly they're kept many examples of

00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:11,130
companies who have been able to survive

00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:14,570
and sometimes thrive but responding

00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:17,009
quickly to changing conditions now

00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:18,869
certainly cloud founder isn't the only

00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:20,610
way to make that happen but many of

00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:24,290
these stories involve the Cloud Foundry

00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:28,290
platform being in place and helping

00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:32,250
developers for those organizations get

00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:36,030
new software and changes out quickly we

00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:38,610
should be proud of that simultaneously

00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:40,650
in the United States and increasingly in

00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:43,259
countries around the world we're also

00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:45,740
experiencing an overdue necessary and

00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:47,939
important reckoning with systemic racism

00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:50,250
now our community has always prided

00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:54,270
itself in being welcoming and inclusive

00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:55,770
and working hard to be diverse while we

00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:58,229
may not have the power is our community

00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:01,979
to fix all the injustice in society we

00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:03,960
are a place for conversation each of us

00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:07,140
should spend the time to understand our

00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:09,479
biases both explicit and implicit each

00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:13,390
of us should spend time having empathy

00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:14,920
for those around us I also encourage

00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:18,100
all of you to attend the diversity event

00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:20,110
later today it's been a highlight of

00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:22,270
summits for years and we've covered a

00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:27,250
range of topics related to diversity

00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:29,490
equity inclusivity at this virtual event

00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:33,220
we'll be focusing specifically on

00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:35,140
systemic racism and we're really honored

00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:37,690
to have dr. Shakti Butler of the world

00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:40,000
trust educational services come to speak

00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:45,430
to this community about exactly that

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,170
topic now the foundation will continue

00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:49,660
to work to do our part to help dis

00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:51,340
dismantle systemic racism in particular

00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:54,370
in technology but wherever we account

00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:57,130
encounter it but everyone needs to do

00:02:54,370 --> 00:03:00,010
their part and so we welcome your ideas

00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:02,040
about what we can do to help drive

00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,040
change

00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:07,959
now turning to Claude founder itself

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,150
when I took over as executive director I

00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:13,750
realized the energy of our community was

00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:15,489
growing around a new focus bringing the

00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:17,290
world-class developer experience of

00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:19,420
cloud foundry to kubernetes

00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:23,489
infrastructure everywhere and we've come

00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:23,489
a long way a very short amount of time

00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:28,959
there are two upstream projects today

00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:31,090
that are both intended to provide that

00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:34,660
Cloud Foundry developer experience on

00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:38,440
top of kubernetes both coops EF and a CF

00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:40,239
for Kids project now they come at the

00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:44,200
problem from different but complementary

00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:47,709
perspectives coop CF has a history going

00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:50,620
back into Susa as an open source project

00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:53,500
but also a part of their commercial

00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:55,720
product it's designed to provide the

00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:58,239
full Cloud Foundry experience as you

00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:00,940
know it today on top of kubernetes and

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,860
it accomplishes that by packaging up

00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:04,630
Cloud Foundry and making sure it can be

00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:08,110
deployed and managed in a kubernetes

00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:10,720
based environment the CF 4 gates project

00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:13,090
is fundamentally about reimagining our

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,220
architecture it takes a slightly

00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:18,160
different approach in that it's going to

00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:23,650
build from the basic functionality CF

00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:26,290
push and grow in capability over time

00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:29,050
each project team is using it as an

00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:31,530
opportunity to reaaargh affect the way

00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:35,229
that their component of the system works

00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:37,030
to include more projects from the

00:04:35,229 --> 00:04:39,280
broader cloud native open-source

00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:41,770
community whether it's the inclusion of

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,990
fluent D or Prometheus whether it's the

00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:46,600
deeper integration with is do whether

00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:50,470
it's reimagining how our own code can

00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:53,470
exist as C or DS within kubernetes now

00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:55,360
both coop C F and C F for kate's are

00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:56,740
progressing quickly in both projects and

00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,300
their teams behind them are

00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:02,169
collaborating actively and frequently

00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,389
they did start with different

00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:05,710
perspectives but they're very

00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:10,000
complementary and they're moving

00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:11,550
together into the future the other

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,160
exciting announcement that we made

00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:18,310
earlier this year was in the launch of

00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:20,620
the Paquette o build pax project it was

00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:23,380
launched in April and it's a collection

00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:25,000
of build packs that are built by the

00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:26,800
same team that's been maintaining the

00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,960
cloud founder Bill pax for years with

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,449
all of that knowledge about what makes a

00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,039
high-quality build pack and all the

00:05:31,449 --> 00:05:34,630
processes in place to make sure that

00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:36,550
they're constantly kept up to date with

00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:39,460
the latest features for your languages

00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:43,599
and frameworks but also from security

00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:45,250
updates picado really represents a bit

00:05:43,599 --> 00:05:47,919
of a rebirth of that build pack effort

00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:51,070
it aligns with the CNCs cloud native

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:53,979
build pack project specification which

00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:57,310
means that it's compatible with many

00:05:53,979 --> 00:06:00,159
platforms the picado build packs can be

00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:01,449
adopted across the broad cloud native

00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:04,630
open source community including

00:06:01,449 --> 00:06:06,550
kubernetes users I think that we should

00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:07,900
all be proud and I am in particular

00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:09,639
proud that our community is sharing this

00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:12,430
deep expertise that we have over many

00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:14,650
years with the powerful build pack

00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:18,270
concept to all of those that are just

00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:20,830
being introduced to it and its benefits

00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:22,870
the news today though is that we

00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:26,560
announced the general availability of

00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:27,970
the Cloud Foundry CLI version 7 now this

00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,650
has been a long time coming and it's a

00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:31,590
very important release because it

00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:37,070
represents the first version of our CLI

00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:38,840
that uses the v7 copy API is entirely

00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:43,550
now if you don't know what that means

00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:46,370
that's okay here's what that means you

00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:49,430
get more capabilities more granular

00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:51,710
control but some of the exact same

00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:53,540
simplicity that past versions of a

00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:56,930
developer of our developer experience

00:06:53,540 --> 00:07:00,020
have had whether it's ease of deployment

00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:03,320
using rolling application patterns or

00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:05,090
whether it's running component steps of

00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:07,790
what the full-si f.push process actually

00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:09,980
provides today right imagine exercising

00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:12,170
granular granite granular control over

00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:14,000
the process these commands you know they

00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:16,790
break down the process and the steps

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,180
that you can run independently and can

00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:21,500
be run multiple times or repurposed you

00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:24,140
can also push an app with multiple

00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:26,300
processes in the same container or as a

00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:27,680
sidecar container really cool

00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:30,710
capabilities to bring up to the

00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,330
developer and in case you happen to

00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:34,700
deploy a lot of applications as many

00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:36,950
users do you get much more advanced

00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:38,630
metadata for custom tagging to help you

00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:41,690
better organize and track your resources

00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:42,860
so congratulations to all the

00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:46,310
contributors that made that possible

00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:48,740
from the CLI project itself to the cloud

00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:51,470
controller team to the services API team

00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:53,540
to every other team that's been involved

00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:59,360
in building the capabilities that are

00:07:53,540 --> 00:08:00,560
being delivered to developers one other

00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,420
announcement we want to make this

00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:06,560
morning is to present a community award

00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:08,840
now we have three different community

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,360
awards that will be we'll be honoring

00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:13,880
someone with over the course of this

00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:18,200
event today though we're going to focus

00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:19,910
on the inspirational user now in the

00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:23,000
past this category has been awarded to

00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:24,920
companies or organizations this time

00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,860
it's a little different in that the

00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:31,030
winner is an individual and this was

00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:33,410
because the the winners nomination

00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:34,970
talked so much about and several

00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:37,790
nominations talked so much about how

00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:39,800
inspirational they are as a power user

00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:43,010
of the platform of cloud foundry of Bosh

00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:48,020
and concourse of the practices that make

00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:49,880
teams effective using the system he

00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,840
regularly pushes Cloud Foundry to its

00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,370
limits and shares

00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:56,120
ideas with the rest of the community his

00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:58,960
guidance his insightfulness its thanked

00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:01,850
by many in the community so I'd like to

00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:04,180
congratulate Andy Payne

00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:07,220
who's with engineer better and

00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:09,080
previously of the UK's government

00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:11,180
digital service for winning the

00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:16,570
inspirational user award congratulations

00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:20,000
Andy I'd also like to take a minute to

have a code of conduct and our

00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:45,170
communities welcoming diverse and

00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:47,980
inclusive environment is made possible

00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:51,800
because many of our participants

00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:54,290
implicitly understand what's in that

00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:57,560
code of conduct but here in the virtual

00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:58,730
event you need to abide by it if you

00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,780
have any questions about it it can

00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:03,050
easily be found in there in your

00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:05,260
dashboard and if you have any other

00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:08,840
questions we need any type of support

00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:10,760

00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:13,220

00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:18,760
people waiting to answer those questions

00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:23,480
that you might have last but not least

00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:26,750
let's talk about future events the

00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:29,930
European summit was intended to occur in

00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:32,120
Dublin in October that event

00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:35,590
unfortunately due to the global pandemic

00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:38,330
is going to be going virtual as well

00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:42,200
timing for exactly when that will be is

00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:44,060
still to be determined we actually want

00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:46,700
to hear your feedback about how this

00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:50,560
event works and what could be improved

00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:53,540
or just fundamentally become different

00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:55,310
will we intend to craft a virtual

00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:57,620
experience that takes from our learnings

00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:58,540
from this first attempt and makes it

00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:02,240
even better

00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:04,820
