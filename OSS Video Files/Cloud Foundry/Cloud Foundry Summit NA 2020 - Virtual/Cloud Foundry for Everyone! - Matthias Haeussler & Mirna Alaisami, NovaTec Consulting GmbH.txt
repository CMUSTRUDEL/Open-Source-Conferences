Description: 
	Cloud Foundry for Everyone! - Matthias Haeussler & Mirna Alaisami, NovaTec Consulting GmbH 

For more info: https://www.cloudfoundry.org/ 

This talk will give an overview of the various possibilities to easily access and get in touch with the Cloud Foundry platform. Cloud Foundry comes in various flavors, there is a big range of commercial hosted offerings, private deployment options and various development environment alternatives. This presentation is intended for users who would like to get their first hands-on experience or for others who might want to evaluate an alternative deployment option. The analysis will compare the public offerings based on the metrics of price, availability, options and available services as well as the self-deployed options in terms of simplicity in setup and handling and requirements. It is supposed to cover the breadth of the Cloud Foundry offerings and give an easy entry path to the technology. This is an updated version of the talk with strong focus on new Kubernetes-based options.

welcome to the presentation Cloud

00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:13,460
Foundry for everyone today given by Luna

00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:15,900
and myself we too are both working for a

00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:19,830
consulting company in Germany called

00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:22,140
Nova Tech and as we only ask a limited

00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:24,420
on time today we only have like 15

00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:27,510
minutes for this we're not going to do

00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:29,519
much more integration introduction than

00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:32,009
that if you find out what I was trying

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:37,860
to find out more feel free to check out

00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:42,420
our Twitter handles now the the reason

00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:44,940
for giving this talk originates a bit of

00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:49,280
like two years ago um when I was

00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:52,230
teaching a class at a university for

00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,239
cloud native software development and I

00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:56,579
knew that most of my students were all

00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:59,100
new to this container platform

00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:03,379
microservices world and I hired two of

00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:07,700
them to like to do a bit of research and

00:01:03,379 --> 00:01:11,010
just to see how they would figure out

00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:12,990
what is cloud foundry and and how can

00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:15,810
you get access to that without giving

00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:18,479
any further information just like to let

00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:22,950
them run and and see what they come back

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:26,100
with and so on all the path they went

00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:30,659
through and it's something we trying to

00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:33,299
document with this talk now to be fair

00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:36,930
this talk is not it's not the first time

00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:39,720
that we're doing this we have done to

00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:45,899
worse to initial versions of this in the

00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:47,549
CF summits during 2019 and the today's

00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:50,520
structure is a little different so first

00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:54,090
of all we are kind of short on time

00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,710
that's why we going to sacrifice a

00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,310
couple of things that we did back then

00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:03,420
so please feel free to watch the videos

00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:06,600
in turn the way how you would access

00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:08,819
form start accessing cloud foundry has

00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:11,430
also changed over the last year in

00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:13,800
particular and so for this talk

00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:17,550
we want to rather focus on

00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:20,940
lighting the new ways of accessing Cloud

00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:24,720
Foundry what has what has been added and

00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:27,020
we're gonna give you both examples on

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,020
that

00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:33,770
so when you walk away from this talk we

00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:35,990
would like you to know where you can get

00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:38,840
info box out foundry what are the basics

00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:40,550
how to use the CLI and most of all like

00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:43,460
how you can you get help if you cannot

00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:46,220
move any further and and of course as I

00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:49,459
said before answer the question what is

00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:52,220
not foundry and how can I access that so

00:02:49,459 --> 00:02:53,750
for the introduction and basics about

00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:58,030
cloud foundry I would turn over my

00:02:53,750 --> 00:03:01,040
colleague Munna and let her go from that

00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:04,340
yeah hello everyone thanks Matias

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:08,239
so let's now have a look on some basic

00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:09,860
information about cloud foundry maybe

00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:15,020
Matias you can help me to go to the next

00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:18,140
slide so now if we look at cloud foundry

00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:23,420
from a high level perspective seeing it

00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:25,730
as a black box what can we see we can

00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:28,100
have a very simplified overview about

00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:30,590
cloud foundry so we can see two main

00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:33,410
categories of users interacting with it

00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:35,690
the developers and the consumers the

00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:39,110
developer brings an application to the

00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:41,269
platform the cloud foundry platform does

00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:44,299
something inside it processes that

00:03:41,269 --> 00:03:46,790
somehow and returns back a URL to the

00:03:44,299 --> 00:03:52,840
consumer then use the application and

00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:52,840
consume that location logic next slide

00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:59,140
now if you want to go a little bit more

00:03:56,410 --> 00:04:03,640
into the details to know how it really

00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:06,580
works from the inside so the developer

00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:10,390
brings a piece of code to the platform

00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:14,560
using the magical CF push command then

00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:17,620
this application is pushed internally to

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:20,560
the platform and a so called droplet is

00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:22,560
being created and the droplet is the

00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,060
application along with the build Park

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,280
the application along with everything

00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:30,940
which is needed in order to run it and

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:33,430
if needed we can bind this application

00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:36,100
to a database service a messaging

00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:38,200
service and so on using the CF create

00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,940
service and bind service commands and

00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,440
the great thing here is that the

00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:43,840
developer does not have to care about

00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:49,780
any configuration of connection settings

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:51,850
and finally a URL will be returned back

00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:54,160
to the user who can then use the

00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:56,950
application and this is kind of the

00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,320
fundamental understanding that you

00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:01,480
should have before linking more deep

00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:03,660
into the details and trying Cloud

00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,660
Foundry

00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:09,130
next slide

00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:11,620
Cloud Foundry offers you different

00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:13,900
options to use it so you can either use

00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:16,060
it locally using one of the local

00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:17,860
installation on your machine or you can

00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:21,040
use one of the different public

00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:24,180
providers or you can even use one of the

00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:30,520
hosted options on larger data centers

00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:33,280
next however no matter where you run

00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:35,440
Cloud Foundry using it locally near

00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,940
machine using one of the different

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:41,979
public providers or even hosting in

00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:44,590
larger data centers you will always end

00:05:41,979 --> 00:05:47,800
up seeing this generic maybe I across

00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:51,669
the different options which is the Cloud

00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:54,310
Foundry CLI and you will have this basic

00:05:51,669 --> 00:05:56,020
set of Cloud Foundry commands PCF push

00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:57,729
in order to push your application to the

00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:59,590
platform this yes skill in order to

00:05:57,729 --> 00:06:01,870
increase and decrease the number of

00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:03,400
instances of your application the CF

00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:05,860
marketplace in order to offer the

00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,420
different services or to see the

00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:09,640
different services offer

00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:11,410
there and the CF create and find

00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:13,480
services command in order to create a

00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:16,110
service instance and bind it to your

00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,110
application

00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:24,450
and now if you decide to get started you

00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:29,060
want to try it out you want to push your

00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:32,790
first application to Cloud Foundry next

00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:35,220
you can find many different community

00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:37,770
resources which may help you so there is

00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:40,460
the Cloud Foundry slack channel in which

00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:43,350
you can find help from different users

00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:46,320
there's the Cloud Foundry github

00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:48,270
repository there is the mailing list the

00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:51,240
Cloud Foundry Ambassador Program in

00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:53,820
which you also find a lot of members who

00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:57,920
are happy to help you they also declare

00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:57,920
for a Twitter channel and Stack Overflow

00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:07,440
and also California offers you different

00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:10,020
kinds of tutorials and guides which may

00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:13,550
help you and maybe hear much yes you can

00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:13,550
give me the right to share my screen

00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:24,940
so I'll just yeah

00:07:23,229 --> 00:07:27,639
but quickly to the homepage of Cloud

00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:29,919
Foundry here you can find different

00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:32,440
links for different tutorials and

00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:37,270
trainings and if you go with this links

00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:40,599
with this link here sorry you can also

00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:42,789
find different tutorials about the basic

00:07:40,599 --> 00:07:44,289
info and having a quick overview about

00:07:42,789 --> 00:07:45,940
Cloud Foundry you can also find

00:07:44,289 --> 00:07:48,430
different tutorials about integrating

00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:51,610
Cloud Foundry and Cuban niches together

00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:54,460
and if you want to try it you have also

00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:57,550
different options it may be the easiest

00:07:54,460 --> 00:08:01,569
and best option to start with is using

00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:04,419
it in your browser on kata coda or you

00:08:01,569 --> 00:08:08,139
can even use it use it look really on

00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:11,020
your machine or if you are not so

00:08:08,139 --> 00:08:13,509
comfortable with using the Cloud Foundry

00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:16,900
CLI then you can use the graphical

00:08:13,509 --> 00:08:21,219
option the Stratus UI which will be

00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:23,590
available soon and now a little bit

00:08:21,219 --> 00:08:25,750
about critical de it's an interactive

00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:28,150
learning environment where you can

00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:30,130
create life symbols you use or try new

00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:32,320
technologies create training

00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:35,979
environments and so on it's pretty cool

00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,870
to use and if we go to start tutorial

00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:40,029
here link

00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:42,550
we are directed to this page where we

00:08:40,029 --> 00:08:45,850
can start a scenario trying Cloud

00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:48,250
Foundry and we have all the basic info

00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:51,070
here description we can start the

00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:53,200
scenario we will see a different kind of

00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:56,170
commands here and if we click the

00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:58,300
command it will be directly execute it

00:08:56,170 --> 00:09:00,520
in the terminal here you can continue

00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:07,810
till the end and it's pretty cool I

00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:12,660
advise you just to give it a try you can

00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:16,269
continue with yes I'll just stop sharing

00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:19,540
okay well thanks very much I mean this

00:09:16,269 --> 00:09:21,550
is something which I also think is it's

00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:23,260
really cool so I'm you can see I have it

00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:28,060
here in my web page as well as you log

00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:31,020
in and in comparing to start using CF in

00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:33,010
your in your browser and and code away

00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:34,899
now

00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:38,199
going back to the presentation you know

00:09:34,899 --> 00:09:40,329
we've seen this there are also a lot of

00:09:38,199 --> 00:09:42,399
provider options that would give out a

00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:44,860
hosted platform with free trial options

00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:47,260
this is something we talked about quite

00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:48,820
a bit in the two previous talks and

00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:50,889
something we're not gonna do today

00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:52,449
so these offers change quite a bit from

00:09:50,889 --> 00:09:54,310
time to time so I would recommend you

00:09:52,449 --> 00:09:56,560
also to check this out on the website

00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:59,019
and see what the what the various

00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,820
providers offer you as in free to to get

00:09:59,019 --> 00:10:02,649
started now

00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:05,589
something that has significantly changed

00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:08,620
over the last few years in particular is

00:10:05,589 --> 00:10:11,889
the integration of cloud foundry and and

00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:14,139
kubernetes which also brings a lot of

00:10:11,889 --> 00:10:16,839
new options to the table how you can

00:10:14,139 --> 00:10:18,370
interact with with cloud foundry now in

00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:20,769
the beginning there was only God found

00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:22,510
read and kubernetes came in brought a

00:10:20,769 --> 00:10:24,940
major disruption to the to the

00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:26,829
technology there and out of that word

00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:29,019
came to technologies called Iranian

00:10:26,829 --> 00:10:30,430
quartz one to run your Cloud Foundry

00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:32,110
have spun cloud foundry

00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:35,290
and one to basically run cloud foundry

00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:37,420
itself on Critias I mean I mean in

00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:39,459
Iranian and running here have sown in

00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:44,880
pollinators like pushed through cartel

00:10:39,459 --> 00:10:47,410
foundry API now qcf is a resulting

00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:49,839
project out of this which can now be

00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:51,910
used and exists a very easily and

00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,399
there's an even newer one which is

00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:55,990
called seer for AIDS which is so new

00:10:54,399 --> 00:11:00,459
that it even doesn't have like a logo

00:10:55,990 --> 00:11:03,100
yet but it's very very easy to install

00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:07,000
and set up and we're gonna look at this

00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:08,980
option right now so I mean the major

00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,199
advantage that you can get through this

00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:13,959
is there are many more kubernetes

00:11:11,199 --> 00:11:16,089
offerings all around then that used to

00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:17,949
be for playing our foundry and the good

00:11:16,089 --> 00:11:20,589
thing is I mean you can pretty much use

00:11:17,949 --> 00:11:22,029
all of those and just that put cloud

00:11:20,589 --> 00:11:24,160
foundry on top of it and start using

00:11:22,029 --> 00:11:26,680
that and have that additional developer

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:29,500
benefits over the abstraction of the

00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:30,819
kubernetes layer itself now there I'm

00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,170
not gonna read through all of those so

00:11:30,819 --> 00:11:34,500
on the bottom you can see the matrix out

00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:36,970
providers they offer public offerings

00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:39,819
most of them will come along with like a

00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:42,220
free tier where you can play around with

00:11:39,819 --> 00:11:43,569
the cloud resources and given that it's

00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:46,060
pretty easy to spin up a company's

00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:46,450
cluster and put something on top say you

00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,980
know

00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:50,050
local options won't cost you anything

00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:53,620
they just might require a bit of like

00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:56,200
commuting power on your machine so once

00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:58,660
you have that there is an excellent list

00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:01,570
of blogs and tutorials all around

00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:03,070
I mean I'm gonna highlight three year or

00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:05,800
the main country is for those things

00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:07,380
from like services target Wayne and yam

00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:10,810
but ton so basically the previous

00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:13,690
pivotal folks we still invested of time

00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:16,029
in that and you can get you to Taurus

00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:19,000
for those technologies and stuff just

00:12:16,029 --> 00:12:21,250
like start working working on them now

00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,380
especially you can see here deploy cloud

00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:27,190
found in to google kubernetes in ten

00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:32,670
minutes I've just done something similar

00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:36,130
on my environment and I installed the

00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:38,170
cloud foundry for four kubernetes on on

00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:41,170
both my local top of the desktop and

00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:47,980
owner communities in India environment

00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:49,690
and I mean the the the behavior just

00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:52,060
stays exactly the same

00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:56,260
so you can see right now I'm not logged

00:12:52,060 --> 00:13:00,339
into the environment on on a show that I

00:12:56,260 --> 00:13:03,730
redirect with this DNS name so if I do

00:13:00,339 --> 00:13:06,040
CFS I can see that some app started in

00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:07,660
here over there you may or may not be

00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:10,360
able to see this you can see the

00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:12,370
workloads actually running as kubernetes

00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:14,769
resources they are being built as

00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:16,390
community resources this is something

00:13:14,769 --> 00:13:18,940
you can see on the cover but you won't

00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:21,100
be able to see you know basically don't

00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:24,279
need to see when you interact through

00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:26,620
this so over here is your standard cloud

00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:29,470
foundry in the face you can check for

00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:31,720
example your marketplace I just

00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:33,880
installed a mini pro go down so you can

00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,769
have access to services and and you can

00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:38,320
pretty much go together you've not found

00:13:35,769 --> 00:13:40,779
within your own style what it takes is

00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:43,360
basically an editing of a younga file at

00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:46,060
a few configuration properties of your

00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,130
environment and you're free to go so if

00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:52,180
I for example log out of this one now

00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:54,760
and just like point the api to another

00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:57,040
one this one here then it will I will

00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:58,930
basically have the same environment on

00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,860
the darker desktop of my local machine

00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:02,260
so I

00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:03,910
can't go any deeper into that and I will

00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:06,220
stop it now but I just wanted to give

00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:09,730
you an impression it has become a lot

00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:12,130
easier to work on Cloud Foundry from in

00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:13,540
in a free way from your own environment

00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:18,370
given the new latest kubernetes

00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:21,070
options so wrapping those things up I

00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:22,660
mean as Mona said there are of course a

00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:24,820
lot of people very friendly and helpful

00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:26,920
to get to start it with this there are

00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:28,800
all sort of companies doing earning

00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:31,000
their money with bats and can help you

00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,709
with getting your environment up and

00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,430
running and move forward with this

00:14:32,709 --> 00:14:39,399
so list is from out on this page and

00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:41,500
with that I'm pretty much done here so

00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:43,269
the only final thing I want to say is

00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:46,089
this particular thanks to Steve

00:14:43,269 --> 00:14:48,370
Greenberg he's like a fellow ambassador

00:14:46,089 --> 00:14:50,860
he's done most of the work on that cat

00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:53,110
ACOTA a new tutorial thing basically

00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:55,360
category is accessible to everyone now

00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:57,459
the tutorials you can pretty much do one

00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,260
on any fun environment that you have and

00:14:57,459 --> 00:15:01,120
he wants to make sure continue to that

00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:02,529
and there's been a lot in the space of

00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,260
getting people started with Cloud

00:15:02,529 --> 00:15:08,560
Foundry so thanks for this and now I'm

00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:12,300
going to open up the line for some for

00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,300
