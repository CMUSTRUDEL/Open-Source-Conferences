Description: 
	Cloud Foundry on K8s - Path to the Next Generation - Patrick Hartz & Martin Valencia Flores, anynines GmbH

Even now when Kubernetes is becoming more and more popular CF is still a great choice to make micro services available to the outer world. The portability of applications, the easiness of scaling and the dynamic routing are just some benefits. Nowadays VMs are starting to be left behind in favor of containers, and CF is a prime candidate to bring to Kuberntes. For all the reasons mentioned above, and for the user experience that has been gained and built over the years. Progress does not imply starting with a totally clean slate, progress is built upon strong foundations. In this talk we will take you with us on our journey, and tell you why and how we deployed CF on Kubernetes and what challenges came along this road.

hello and welcome to our talk cloud

00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:06,480
foundry on kubernetes

00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,680
our path to the next generation in the

00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,000
next 15 minutes

00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,080
we will talk about our experience we

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,480
made when we deployed cloud foundry with

00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:18,480
the cf for kubernetes project

00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,480
but first let us introduce ourselves

00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,760
my name is patrick harts and i'm a sales

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,920
and platform engineer at anylines

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,760
i'm in the world of cloud foundry since

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,279
more than four years now

00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:34,000
and i really enjoy being on summit

00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,920
also if it's just a virtual one when i'm

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,640
not working i'm doing too many things

00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,600
at a time so it became a habit and now

00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,920
i'm here

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,399
with my colleague to talk at the cloud

00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,640
foundry summit about our experience

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,879
we did hi my name is martin valencia

00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,399
flores i am a platform engineer at

00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:55,760
any nines and when i'm not working

00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:57,920
so outside of work i like to play

00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,680
role-playing games tabletop games i'm

00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,800
currently a dungeon master

00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,800
and paint miniatures

00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,520
so why do we believe in cloud foundry

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,240
besides the fact that

00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,119
we're in a cloud foundry summit well we

00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,880
believe in the

00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,200
transcendent success of cloud foundry

00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,600
itself by being around it

00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,320
directly or indirectly we have also

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,600
witnessed

00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,439
the growing potential of a solid user

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,320
experience

00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,960
born from the success itself the

00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,159
benefits

00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,479
are in plain sight you can easily port

00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,920
your

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:36,640
applications you can scale up down

00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,920
left right whatever whatever direction

00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,119
you want

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,079
with an easiness that it's not usually

00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:45,360
seen

00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:47,520
you have integrated dynamic routing and

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,799
personally the best of all a really

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,079
intuitive

00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,960
cli it's really straightforward which is

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:57,119
something that is

00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:59,840
quite agreeable in my own opinion

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,280
lastly progress does not imply starting

00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,759
with a clean slate

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,439
progress is built upon strong

00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,640
foundations and what better

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:10,080
foundations that the wonder built a good

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,080
user experience on so

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,360
cloud foundry and kubernetes our

00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,120
perspective

00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,800
let's talk about how do we see both

00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,480
we will call cloud foundry an

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,879
application pass

00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,720
it comes with a staging layer for 12

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,200
factor apps

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,640
it is easy to push applications and make

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,040
use of the self-service

00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,519
capabilities of cloud foundry when it

00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,599
comes to consumed databases

00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,440
it brings the load balancer by default

00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:40,160
it's called the go router

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,480
it has great logging facilities and it

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,760
is

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,239
easy to get metrics by default

00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,800
cloud foundry also come along with a

00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,280
great

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,840
multi-tenancy support where it divides

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,879
users

00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:55,760
in augs and spaces we see kubernetes as

00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:58,080
a container path

00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,400
you can deploy container with any kind

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,879
of applications

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,720
pods share one dedicated network which

00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:08,319
makes pot communication

00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,440
really easy the architecture is

00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,800
extensible

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,280
that means where it is necessary you can

00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,800
add

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,920
third-party software quite easily

00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:23,280
and the kubernetes ecosystem has a large

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,920
and active community now container

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,680
images

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,120
or build packs well let's start with

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,519
container images

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,560
container images have quite a few

00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,720
advantages

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,319
they are more flexible on how you pack

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,480
and distribute the software

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,319
they are good for legacy apps and it's

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,840
portable in the sense that it can run

00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:45,599
in any os that has the container runtime

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:47,760
present testing locally is quite easy

00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,040
the biggest disadvantage though the

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,599
developer takes

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,640
more of the responsibility for the whole

00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,040
container stack

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,640
now build packs buildbacks have also

00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,280
have some advantages

00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,159
first of all separation of concerns the

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,680
standardization

00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:06,560
of the way to deploy software no

00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,360
need to worry about how to ship it and

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,920
it's

00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,959
quite agreeable with microservice

00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,879
architectures

00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,159
if this sounds familiar to you it's

00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,079
because it

00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,160
leads you to a road where you're being

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,840
already 12 factor compliant

00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,600
which we know by experience to go a

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,240
really good path already

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,240
the biggest disadvantage though is it's

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,040
hard to deploy legacy apps on it when it

00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,639
comes to

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,560
how to deploy cloud foundry on

00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:33,120
kubernetes

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,440
there's a question which solution to

00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,440
choose

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,639
we know that there are two main projects

00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,080
out it's

00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,479
at first the cloud foundry for

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,800
kubernetes and cube cf

00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,479
we choose cloud function for kubernetes

00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,720
since for our needs

00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,960
it stands out as the new way of cloud

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,040
foundry deployed on kubernetes

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,880
to put it simply let us borrow what was

00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:58,479
said in the first announcement

00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,360
for cloud 40 for kubernetes it is cube

00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,759
idiomatic

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,919
cloud foundry for kubernetes was first

00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:07,120
announced in april 2020

00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:11,759
with version zero one

00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:15,039
in our tests we used version 0.6

00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:17,520
so at the time of writing of this post

00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,560
a newer version was released the new

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,720
version

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,759
comes with the possibility to add

00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,880
external

00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:27,520
blob storage

00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,039
the proc file can be correct handled now

00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,560
by the by the platform

00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:33,120
and there are some improvements

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,759
regarding the language detection

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,639
in kpac cloud foundry for kubernetes is

00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,039
built on top of

00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,759
well-known kubernetes projects like

00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,160
capec

00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,840
which replaces diego somehow it uses the

00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,000
package build packs

00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,680
istio enforce encryption communication

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,199
between components

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,720
app workloads and english envoy is used

00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,520
as a service proxy

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,720
and fluently to collect all data around

00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,960
logging

00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,880
tooling around so we cannot let all of

00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,919
the work to cloud foundry for kubernetes

00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,160
that wouldn't be fair

00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:05,199
fortunately cloud foundry for kurdist

00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,639
doesn't come along

00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:11,680
it comes around with this great tool set

00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:14,639
it includes ytt for templating

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,120
your general structures k app as a cli

00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:19,520
that encourages you to

00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,600
well manage resources as a kubernetes

00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,080
user cube ctl which is

00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,520
a must when working around with

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,560
kubernetes

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,120
the cloud foundry cli that as i

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,160
mentioned

00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,960
is a godsend it's straightforward i love

00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,919
it

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,039
and bosch the bosch cli which is needed

00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:40,160
to generate

00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:43,120
secrets and certificates what are the

00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,120
prerequisites

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,960
we took the prerequisites from gita

00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,360
prepo as given

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,280
we wanted to question it so far so we

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,360
could not make any statement

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,120
how powerful this installation then will

00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,639
be so on the slides we

00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:01,280
copy just we copied the prerequisites

00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,160
out of the gita prepo to get you an

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,639
overview

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,160
what you need to deploy the next

00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,039
question is

00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,199
where to get a cluster from luckily at

00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,720
any nines it is not a miracle to deploy

00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,319
a kubernetes cluster with those

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,880
requisites

00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,360
we got help from our internal apo team

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,800
so

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,400
thanks at this point now preparing the

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,120
deployment

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,840
to prepare the deployment it's the first

00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,800
part is just

00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,840
straightforward you go and you clone the

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,520
repo

00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:35,919
then you assign a wildcard dns name

00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,360
and we are using docker hub as our

00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,039
container registry

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,520
to keep preparing the deployment you

00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,400
have to create as a cloud foundry values

00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,240
file

00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:48,720
now this file will hold the cf values

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,080
it will contain our secrets our certs

00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,400
anything you need to run

00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,479
a cf installation also you have to

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,520
prepare your kubernetes manifest

00:07:54,479 --> 00:08:00,639
for this reason we have ytd

00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,879
and as i said the repo already provides

00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,000
it

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:07,120
in a config folder this config folder

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,039
and the cf values get provided to the

00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,520
manifest as it's rendered

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,160
okay what to say now when everything is

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,360
prepared

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:17,360
there's just one step left

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,479
now it's time to deploy when the

00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,560
deployment manifest

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:22,160
is rendered it is easy to use cap to

00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,759
deploy the cloud foundry

00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,319
installation to equipment to the

00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:28,639
kubernetes cluster okay

00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,560
i have to admit there's again one step

00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,800
left

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,080
what we need before we can deploy the

00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,120
sample application

00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:41,120
is we have to adjust the wide cut dns

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:43,599
to point to the issue gateway

00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,800
you can find instructions on how to get

00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,279
the ip address

00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,800
of the istu gateway also in the

00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:51,680
repository

00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:53,360
now deploying the sample application to

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,560
deploy the sample application

00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,680
we go to our already known route we log

00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:01,120
into cf

00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:03,120
we create an org and a space and we push

00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:06,839
it

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,399
and as you can see very nice great

00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:11,920
success

00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:14,240
and there we have it let's talk shortly

00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,839
about our experience with the whole

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,480
process

00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,720
i like bosch no i love bosch and for me

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,720
as an old hand in the it business

00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,959
it is always an adventure to try out new

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,640
technologies we think cloud foundry for

00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:29,200
kubernetes provides an easy way to

00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:31,600
deploy cloud foundry on kubernetes

00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,080
the repository is documented in a way

00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,920
which gives you a fast way to success

00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,160
unfortunately we missed a graphical

00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:40,880
overview which would explain

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,000
in more detail what we deployed in the

00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,480
end

00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,560
after our experiments when we cleaned up

00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,480
the cluster we had some leftovers

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,959
but we didn't invest it why this is the

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,160
case i'm pretty sure we made a mistake

00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:55,600
here

00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,880
so we say thank you to all the people

00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,920
working on this project

00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:02,240
you did absolutely create an amazing job

00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,959
and we will keep an eye on this project

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,279
thank you

00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,480
thank you very much for being with us

talk we want to remind you that if you

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,920

media as you can see

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:36,720
thank you very much hi i'm sorry i had a

00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,200
few difficulties it showed that it was

00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,480
live but

00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,720
apparently i wasn't broadcasting um

00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,920
going back to the question that was

00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,959
asked at the beginning

00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:49,760
um yes we did try to

00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,880
uh go side by side with the cloud

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:55,040
foundry on bosch and

00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:58,160
class foundry for coordinates and

00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,640
the results were favorable enough that

00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,760
we

00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:05,040
decided to keep looking

00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:08,079
into it as a probable

00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:11,519
option um quick side note

00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:15,760
my colleague is sick for today so

00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:18,240
it will just be me on this live

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,240
q a

00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:29,839
any other questions

00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,480
so once again sorry for the technical

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:43,839
difficulties

00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,839
at the beginning my ipad

00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:51,360
[Music]

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:54,320
uh well well i

00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,000
wait for further questions uh remember

00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,519
that we are available in

00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,760
our virtual booth in case you have

00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,959
other questions or think that it will

00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,639
take

00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:10,160
a bit more time or are just in general

00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:14,880
interested in

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:24,880
what we do feel free to drop there and

00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:28,240
oh question

00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,240
the same data stores

00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,440
when you run them side by side wait

00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:41,600
there

00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,480
data stores if your schedule nkx could

00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,880
you see it on

00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,880
bosch

00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:54,720
i would have to get back to you on

00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:54,720
that question

00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:04,959
when you're running with a

00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:09,040
sorry i'm a bit of a mess first time

00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:11,120
presentation uh schedule and k-8 could

00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:15,920
you see it

00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:19,519
um i don't follow the

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,000
the comparison here uh when we ran them

00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,120
side by

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,480
side i meant that we ran

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:30,079
uh completely different the

00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:34,240
things one here and the other one in

00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:36,720
uh coordination we more or less compared

00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,680
in a couple of simple tests i don't know

00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,040
if i am

00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:44,959
misunderstanding your question or

00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:49,839
actually replying and

00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:49,839
as expected

00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,360
um

00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,920
oh

00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,240
no problem uh i think we misunderstood

00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,800
each other uh

00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,360
but as i said more than welcome to come

00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,399
to

00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:14,079
the booth if the questions are

00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:17,440
get a bit too uh how to say a bit more

00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:20,320
complex if i am not able to

00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,279
understand or provide a question uh we

00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:25,040
can

00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:28,480
always uh ask around to my

00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:31,519
colleagues as well so you know

00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:35,760

uh any further questions

00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,680
i don't know how much time i have left

00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:45,839
due to the

00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:45,839
little complication at the beginning
