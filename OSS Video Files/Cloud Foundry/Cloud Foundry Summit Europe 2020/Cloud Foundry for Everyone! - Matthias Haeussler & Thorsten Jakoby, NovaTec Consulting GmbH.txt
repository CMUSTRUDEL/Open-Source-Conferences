Description: 
	Cloud Foundry for Everyone! - Matthias Haeussler & Thorsten Jakoby, NovaTec Consulting GmbH

This talk will give an overview of the various possibilities to easily access and get in touch with the Cloud Foundry platform. Cloud Foundry comes in various flavors, there is a big range of commercial hosted offerings, private deployment options and various development environment alternatives. This presentation is intended for users who would like to get their first hands-on experience or for others who might want to evaluate an alternative deployment option. The analysis will compare the public offerings based on the metrics of price, availability, options and available services as well as the self-deployed options in terms of simplicity in setup and handling and requirements. It is supposed to cover the breadth of the Cloud Foundry offerings and give an easy entry path to the technology. This is an updated version of the talk with strong focus on new Kubernetes-based options

	00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,319
so hello everyone and uh welcome

00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:07,279
to today's presentation called cloud

00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:10,320
foundry for

00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:14,480
everyone where

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:17,840
my oh next slide please

00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:20,960
thanks where my my um co-speaker

00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:23,760
and i thorsten are going to tell you

00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,720
a few things about cloud foundry which

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,960
we think

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,279
uh can help you to get started with the

00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,840
technology and the platform

00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,320
so you can see us in a very very tiny

00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,040
version

00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,800
on the top right of the screen and

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,760
because it's so very tiny

00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,600
we have made uh some bigger pictures in

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,640
here that you know who we are

00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,360
you can also find us on twitter

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,520
and follow us there we we try to tweet

00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,120
as much as cloud native content as we

00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,559
can

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:58,000
okay um next one please

00:00:54,559 --> 00:01:01,840
okay so um this

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,879
is an introductory talk um

00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,360
we don't expect anything uh you to know

00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,280
from

00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,119
or about cloud foundry so it's really

00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,159
about getting started with it

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:14,479
what you should know what you could know

00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:17,119
and what could help you to get started

00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:19,280
with so

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,880
you would basically resemble that little

00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,520
person here wondering what all that

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:27,040
cloud foundry thing is about

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:30,880
next one

00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:33,840
so um in one of my

00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,040
roles besides working at nova tech i'm

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,640
teaching

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,320
uh cloud native software development at

00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,520
university and

00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,079
um i did an experiment with two student

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,840
ones

00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,520
that that i knew had a bit of a

00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,560
background in

00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,520
programming but not necessarily micro

00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,840
services

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,200
or um they were not aware i knew they

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,079
were not aware of container technology

00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,200
and all that

00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,840
so i gave them the task to like figure

00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,680
out

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,200
what is cloud foundry and how can you

00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,240
access cloud foundry basically just

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,880
start

00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,880
from xero and see where you can find

00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,319
information and how easy it is to get

00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,080
started

00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:12,319
they came back with some really good

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,440
results and were able to deploy their

00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,360
first application

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,640
on a web-based cloud foundry version

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,400
very early

00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:22,319
and that base basically later found

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,599
later foundation for this

00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,319
for this talk today so what are we gonna

00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:29,920
do

00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:30,400
um next one all right i should mention

00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,519
this

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,160
and um for the ones that have been

00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,360
cloud foundry summit visitors in the

00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,360
past

00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,400
you may have noticed that we have given

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,400
this talk before

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,720
and there was my colleague mirna

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,280
assisting me in the two tft summits of

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,120
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,560
she would love to join us today but

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,239
unfortunately she couldn't

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,120
i probably should say fortunately she

00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:58,720
couldn't because she just had a baby

00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,879
and so we that brought in

00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,280
our friend torsten who has been with us

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:06,319
at the cf summits before

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,480
um so we wish her all the best and uh

00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:11,840
hopefully hoping for her that she can

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,920
join us in the future again all right

00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,599
next one or basically i think at that

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:20,080
point i will

00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:23,519
give the um the voice over to torsten

00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,519
to for the next part of the talk

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,040
our intended takeaways for you from this

00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,440
talk is

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,280
that you know or learn where you can get

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,280
information about cloud foundry

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,519
and what are the basic technology

00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,560
principles which are

00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,920
under the hood of cloud foundry you will

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,560
learn how to use

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,360
that's how the cloud foundry cli can

00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,799
work for you

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,799
and even though that the cloud foundry

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:50,640
cli exists

00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:52,319
you will learn how you can

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,640
reach out to the cloud foundry community

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:57,760
and how it could help you

00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,640
and which options they're out there for

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,400
use

00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,840
and bring cloud found into your project

00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,680
probably and

00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,640
of course what you can expect from cloud

00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,640
foundry in the future

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,040
let's start with some basic information

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,959
with a picture

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:17,680
from a high level so there's you

00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,600
the developer who is pushing your

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,079
application code to cloud foundry by

00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,440
using

00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:26,639
cloud foundry cli push command

00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:29,520
and cloud foundry will do something

00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:32,080
to make the application accessible to

00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:35,199
your consumers by a url

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:38,320
so the something is maybe

00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:40,400
interesting for you or maybe not there

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,639
will be a lot of magic under the hood

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,400
how the application will be accessible

00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,560
for your consumer

00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,759
let's have a more detailed look what

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,520
happens

00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:54,240
when you hit the see if push command

00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,680
your application will be put into a

00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,479
container

00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,160
a container is called a droplet in this

00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,240
cloud foundry world

00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,280
and first of all the container starts

00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,520
with a build pack

00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,880
and on top of that build pack your

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,240
application code

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:13,520
will be put so the build pack

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,120
will do a lot of things for example it

00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,960
will start a runtime environment for

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,240
your application

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:22,960
just assume the application is based

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,680
on the spring framework then the build

00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,400
pack

00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,440
will start a java virtual machine in

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,880
order to run

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:32,720
your application let's further assume

00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,440
that your application

00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,320
is using a sql database and a message

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,320
broker

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,240
both of them are services that can be

00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:43,280
run inside of cloud foundry

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:46,240
managed for you the build pack

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,280
can bind that service to your

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,039
application

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,120
and will take care of injecting

00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:53,680
credentials and configuration

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,759
in to your application almost

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,800
automatically

00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,479
once the droplet is ready to run and

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,479
instantiated

00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,240
cloud foundry will create a route to

00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:07,840
make the application accessible to you

00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,840
and your consumer

00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:16,080
there are many or well there are three

00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,240
ways

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,280
to use cloud foundry and run cloud

00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,880
foundry

00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:25,520
one is locally you can run a

00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,000
cloud foundry on your developer machine

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,520
or

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:33,120
wherever and start using with it

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,000
you can use a public offering on premise

00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,800
off-premise

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:41,919
is possible by using hosted instances or

00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,759
public on any cloud provider if you use

00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,600
if you choose a hosted instance you can

00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:48,000
start on-premise

00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,880
without any internet connection just

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,599
install

00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:54,000
your cloud foundry instance on a data

00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:54,000
center

00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,520
in depending on on which way or which

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,680
target you installed cloud foundry

00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,599
the cli will provide you the same

00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,160
experience

00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,039
you can push your application to locally

00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,880
to

00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:10,479
to your data center wherever you can

00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,199
scale the application

00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:14,560
you can browse the marketplace by using

00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,960
cloud foundry marketplace

00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,160
command and create services which are

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:22,000
later on bar

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,000
binded or bound to your application

00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:29,440
well that was a lot of things where

00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:31,759
we dropped pictures and told you what is

00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,880
possible now materials will take over

00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,520
the part and show you

00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,479
how and where you can get started to do

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,160
so i will stop

00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,160
my screen sharing and get over to my

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:45,280
tears

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:49,120
all right um give me a second

00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:52,639
okay so now i will try to capture the

00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:56,479
screen sharing here and i hope

00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:57,759
you can all see my screen now now

00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,560
there are a couple of community

00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:02,639
resources that you can um leverage to

00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,879
get started with cloud foundry

00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,400
um most helpful one most likely is the

00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,759
cloud foundry slack that you can turn of

00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,319
course for free

00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,199
and this is basically where all the

00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,560
developers

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:16,319
collaborators and users come together

00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,160
and can exchange

00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,080
there's of course a public twitter

00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,240
account with all the news

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,240
and there's a helpful group of people

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,759
called the cloud foundry ambassadors

00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:30,080
where i am a proud member of so

00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,199
you can find a list of those also on the

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,200
website

00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,680
and and reach out to out of them

00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,800
individually and

00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:40,880
they will very very likely be able to to

00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:44,320
help you forward

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:47,200
now to try cloud foundry

00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,640
i will probably switch from a

00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:52,000
presentation to

00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:55,040
a kind of live mode so

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,399
this is the the cloud foundry website

00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:00,240
um as you can access that um on the top

00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,839
there the news about the

00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,959
kubernetes integrations this is

00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,160
something i'm definitely going to talk

00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,160
about later

00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,240
and if you scroll down a little there's

00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:11,600
the tutorials and training section

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:15,040
um going here will take you to this

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:17,200
tutorials page and um

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,640
one new thing that i want to highlight

00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,880
or fairly new thing is that

00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,440
katakura integration so if you don't

00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:26,640
know what katakota is this is like a

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:29,760
um the training platform from

00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:33,360
o'reilly um within that

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:36,800
you can open up a browser-based

00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,680
shell um and access various training

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,920
scenarios

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,959
cloud foundry is one of them so you

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,360
don't need to install

00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:45,040
any code whatsoever um the terminal is

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,440
right there for you

00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,880
just before i start here i want to kick

00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,080
up some click of something in the

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,440
background

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,440
that i want to show you later on

00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,880
all right that seems to work now going

00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:05,040
back here

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:08,240
um you get your cloud foundry

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:10,480
api in the terminal let me just refresh

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,480
that

00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:15,940
[Music]

00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,839
okay

00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,480
okay that looks better so

00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,079
you have your cloud foundry command line

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,040
right here

00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:32,000
and um there are some guidance steps

00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,000
that you can follow here

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,600
but you can of course do all the things

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,399
that you want to try yourself

00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,040
there is a little sample application in

00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,440
here

00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,600
so this is basically your quickest path

00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,640
to get your first cf push done

00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,160
it's basically opening a web page

00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,079
i think you have to register but you can

00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,200
do that with existing github or google

00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,120
credentials whatsoever

00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,360
it doesn't cost anything and then as you

00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,920
can see here um you don't need really

00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,720
to do anything and can use the platform

00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,160
straight away

00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,000
there's a sample service that you can

00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:05,120
use for binding and

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,680
um to to get your first steps this is

00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,480
probably

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,920
the the quickest way to do now yep the

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:14,079
application is already running

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:16,720
so if i do a cfs i also get a url

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:18,000
um so it's not just like built into the

00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,040
browser for

00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,360
interacting with the ui you can also

00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,560
run your application there so that's

00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,760
definitely

00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:31,440
easy now going back here

00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,440
into that slide deck um

00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,640
i've covered that you've seen that live

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,000
so there's still a couple of provider

00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:41,279
options where you can

00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:44,399
try cloud foundry on a public pass level

00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:47,920
um unfortunately the um

00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:49,600
pivotal uh web services platform is is

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,720
being sunset so this one goes away as

00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,880
one of the options

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,320
but the other ones still persist so if

00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,240
you've been using that one

00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,519
it would you know a good time to to

00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,240
migrate that

00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,680
um but of course they're still um

00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,160
investing heavily

00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,279
in the development of uh new kubernetes

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,040
based options

00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:09,120
which basically brings us right to the

00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:12,160
next to the next chapter

00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,360
so if you look at cloud foundry and what

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,399
it is in the past

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,000
to the very left when they were very

00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,959
like separate technologies

00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,839
with a certain function overlap this has

00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:25,760
changed over the years

00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,880
especially through the iranian quarks

00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:30,480
technology

00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:34,800
and have now come out with two projects

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:38,480
uh within a fairly stable

00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:41,600
maturity level so there's qcf and cf

00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,600
for cades which uses the

00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,880
package to build packs on the cover this

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,639
is kind of a

00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,320
spin-off project of the of the

00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,240
organization it's um

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,079
it's not really an old platform but it

00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,680
uses the cloud for technology to build

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:56,079
standardized containers

00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:58,079
that you can use for kubernetes directly

00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:59,200
but the cfocates also uses that under

00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:02,320
the hood

00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,519
now why am i telling you all this it's

00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,480
because

00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:08,480
there are so many easily accessible

00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,760
kubernetes offerings either like on your

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,800
local machine

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:15,600
um or from um designated

00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,480
um cloud platform providers most of them

00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,560
have like free

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,240
trial tiers or things like that that you

00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,959
can easily use um

00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,600
to roll out your cloud foundry platform

00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,560
there

00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,480
and start playing around so um this

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,920
would probably be the next step or the

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,040
next logical step

00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:35,360
after you have uh done your first

00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:38,480
initial steps on catacota

00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:41,440
now what i tried to do in the meantime

00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,800
um when i switched over to that screen

00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,440
was kicking off

00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,839
a cloud foundry for kunis deployment on

00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,120
um

00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:50,480
on a microsoft azure environment and the

00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,680
real impressive thing here

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,440
is if i do get services and

00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,120
parts i'm interacting through the

00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,040
kubernetes cli

00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,959
it's really the time stamps here so you

00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:04,560
can see

00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:07,920
it's around three minutes and something

00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:09,839
what it took me to deploy cloud foundry

00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,639
onto an existing kubernetes cluster so

00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,680
this is

00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:17,360
um a single node instance

00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,920
on uh on a mediocre powerful machine so

00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,600
to say

00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,120
within the azure environment but it's

00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,639
just to show you how quickly you would

00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:26,240
actually get there

00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:28,320
now to

00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,639
to access the environment you need uh to

00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:33,279
deploy with an external ip

00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,160
um there are guide there's guidance to

00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:37,440
do that

00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:40,720
you need a certain login um that you can

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,320
also easily get but with that

00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,600
we're already connected to the api

00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,560
endpoint because i had deployed it

00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,480
before

00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:50,800
you can now log in and have an access

00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,240
to a cloud foundry environment so it's

00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,639
totally naked

00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,680
you have to create your own space

00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,800
initially

00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:01,120
but once you're there you can start

00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,399
you can start using that and it just

00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,600
behaves exactly

00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:09,199
like any cloud foundry environment so

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:11,279
um i wish i could demo a little

00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:12,800
more here unfortunately i'm running out

00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,560
of time

00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,480
the only thing i might be able to

00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,680
highlight here is trying to push the

00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,720
first example

00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:23,279
where you would then be able to see

00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,959
the the usage of the of the package

00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:27,199
build packs under the hood

00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,160
especially for java developers this is

00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,959
quite an

00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,959
advantage to um to the classic version

00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:36,079
of cloud foundry because now

00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:39,360
you're able to push source code i mean

00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:40,800
i didn't specify any deployment manifest

00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,519
here so i just

00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,160
did traded i did a cf push on an on a

00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,040
mavencom

00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:49,279
xml and it will be detected that is a

00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:52,720
java application the necessary

00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:55,759
um build and and runtime

00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:58,720
pieces will be downloaded by by packado

00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,839
and then you get you have a running

00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,399
kubernetes

00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,959
containerized application that you just

00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,199
pushed

00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:07,279
providing the source code so you can

00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:10,399
probably see that here now

00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:13,040
before i start um

00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:15,279
fading out so yeah you see there's the

00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,880
pacquiao build packs showing up here now

00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:19,519
it is detected as a springboard

00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:22,079
application and being built by maven

00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,440
so now it's gonna run all the maven

00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:26,480
build tasks

00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:29,839
and i'm just going to close it with that

00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,680
so coming back here

00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,839
the things that i did now work fairly

00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:36,720
quick there are
