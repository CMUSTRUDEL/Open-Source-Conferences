summit europe

00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,040
i'm yui kao cf open source product lead

00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:11,360
at vmware and cloud foundry pnc council

00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,360
chair

00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,320
i'd like to share a bit about our

00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,439
progress in growing

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,359
a community of users and contributors as

00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,640
we bring the cloud foundry developer

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,880
experience to

00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,359
bernetti's there's been an amazing

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,519
amount

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,119
of progress and growth in the community

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,440
since the last summit

00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:34,960
the new maquetto buildpacks project is

00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,440
really taking off

00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,879
i'm truly impressed in how the team has

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,559
really invested

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:44,079
during the last couple of months to

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:46,000
improve project visibility at all levels

00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,640
they've invested in making the project

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,840
more approachable for new users

00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:55,120
as well as potential new contributors

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,640
they've worked on writing rfcs as much

00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,559
as possible

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,640
to make sure their decision-making

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:03,039
process is out in the open

00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,600
and ready for for comments from the

00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,600
community

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,200
also it's worth highlighting the growth

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,080
and collaboration i see on the cube cf

00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,560
and cf for kate's projects which has

00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,840
been

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,840
truly amazing and i'm starting to see

00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:23,439
how these two projects

00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,560
who started they started with different

00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,640
approaches

00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,920
and they're really coming together

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,759
learning from each other

00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,759
and collaborating closely together

00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,119
an example of that is how they've

00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:39,520
collaborated

00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:42,720
on the use of quark secrets how the qcf

00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,439
project had recently adopted the native

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,079
uaa

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:51,119
image it's just really great to see

00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:54,399
the cf for kate's project itself

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,439
i want to celebrate it just reaches 1.0

00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,719
release

00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,920
and it's just seen tremendous

00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,960
collaboration between

00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,159
community members to get there i'm just

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,159
loving seeing

00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,840
folks in the community contribute guides

00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,200
for how to deploy it on different kids

00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,239
clusters

00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,959
there's um some great contributions from

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,640
the sap

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,400
team who've been really putting it

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,440
through its paces in terms of scale

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,800
testing

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:23,280
in fact i believe

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,360
the reason why there was a rc candidate

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:29,200
for the cf for kids project

00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:32,640
was so that um the sap team

00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:37,280
could do one last pass at it um

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:40,480
before 1.00 is officially declared

00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,280
um i want to call out there's also just

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,519
been some

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,440
amazing progress collaborating with

00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,480
other nearby communities

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:52,239
um taking advantage of other

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,920
nearby projects the istio integration

00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,720
with cf hurricanes

00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,920
it just has so many possibilities but

00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,400
one of my favorites

00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,879
that made it into the 1.0 release of cia

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,959
for cates has got to be that

00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,319
all the communication paths are

00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,319
encrypted i

00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,640
know quite a few community members

00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,920
who've been looking for that to be true

00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,440
of cloud foundry

00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:19,360
and now it is um with the

00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,400
kpac integration another integration i'm

00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,760
really

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,840
proud of um we're able to build oci

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,760
images from your app code and store them

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,760
in a registry

00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,360
while still maintaining a simple user

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,799
experience

00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,480
um i'm really looking forward to what's

00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,519
next in

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:42,319
for the community there's a lot of

00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:44,239
other projects coming up or that are out

00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:47,360
there to explore

00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:49,200
there's um a great uh

00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,080
some some great talks to check out this

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:55,360
afternoon um prometheus and k native

00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:58,319
are are giving their roadmap talks

00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,159
um and these are two other communities

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:02,400
that i think would be great for

00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,840
the cloud foundry community to

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,840
collaborate with

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,560
to help build better developer

00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,560
experiences

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,120
now with paquetto c for cates and cube

00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,519
cf

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,320
it's never been easier to get started

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:23,199
with build packs and with cloud foundry

00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,479
as a community we can take that as an

00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,199
opportunity

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,400
to introduce the power and simplicity of

00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,960
cf push

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,479
to more people and more teams than ever

00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,720
before

00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,919
paul warren on the release integration

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,400
team shared with me

00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:40,720
today that the latest getting started

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,360
tutorial for cf for cates can be done

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,040
with

00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:48,960
just one node with four cpu and six

00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:52,080
gigabytes of memory um i know

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,400
i like i i'll be able to try that out on

00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,400
my laptop very easily

00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,440
and you can get to cf push in just 10

00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,080
minutes

00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:02,080
i'm so excited about how much easier it

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,720
is to try these things out

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:08,160
not to mention how much this simplifies

00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:11,199
the contributor experience

00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,759
for those of you who have been part of

00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:17,360
the cloud foundry community for a while

00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:20,560
um and i i wanna ask

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,680
um as the pro projects progress and

00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,120
change

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,720
um i'd love for you to help us to focus

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,199
on these three areas

00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,320
to help us continue to grow our

00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:34,880
community of users

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:37,520
and contributors so the areas being

00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,759
share knowledge collaborate openly

00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,240
engage with users and contributors

00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,360
so so repeat it with me it'll be a

00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,560
little awkward

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:49,600
it'll be fine just share knowledge

00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,520
collaborate openly engage with users and

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,880
contributors

00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:58,400
so so i got you to say that hopefully

00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:02,000
maybe um but but what do i mean by that

00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:05,280
um so share knowledge um

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,720
that means make knowledge

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:12,080
uh easily shareable um

00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:15,520
as as community members read the readmes

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:18,080
or or as team members read three admis

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,960
do they make sense um are they up to

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:24,000
date

00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:27,280
uh your docs the getting started guides

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,240
for users and contributors are

00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,120
do they make sense are they up to date

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,160
um

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,800
other things around just

00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,400
wayfinding if you've got a lot of

00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,520
related repos

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,800
make them easy to discover and make it

00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,400
easy to find

00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:49,759
your way back to the main repo

00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,720
if you've got project wikis make them

00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:54,479
public

00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,919
if you've got adrs or rcs or feature

00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,560
proposals whatever

00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,960
you might call those those things make

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,240
them

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:04,160
discoverable maybe even from your readme

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,919
um those are a lot of things

00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,840
contributors can do

00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:12,560
but um community members like

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,280
help help us help keep us honest on that

00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,280
um

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,400
and encourage us to to share knowledge

00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,759
there

00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:23,520
um collaborate openly

00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:26,880
so so what do i mean by that um

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:29,759
well we have the code it's public

00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,400
um it's all in the cloud foundry github

00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,560
orgs

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,319
but but this is really about more than

00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,680
that it's

00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:39,440
um it can be about um

00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,960
publishing a maintainers file and

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:44,479
keeping that up to date

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:48,400
so people know who they can reach out to

00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:51,440
it's looking at processes and tools

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,840
that you're using looking at whether

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,440
they're

00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:58,720
transparent and inclusive to

00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,400
other community members and adopting new

00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,680
tools and processes

00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:06,800
if they're not um and

00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:10,080
and yes i if if you're wondering i am

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:12,560
advocating um in a way

00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:16,160
for the cloud foundry project teams to

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:20,080
move away from using pivotal tracker

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:22,800
i i love pivotal tracker but i

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,440
i think it's time for for us as a

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,199
community

00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:30,240
to move to using github issues

00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:33,519
and github projects or zenhub and

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:36,719
adopting different flows

00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,599
some teams have already and while it

00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,760
took

00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,719
some time for them to find their rhythm

00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,200
the positive

00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,240
impact of these changes on collaborators

00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,399
is huge

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:51,519
and in my opinion well worth the effort

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,720
lastly when i say engage with users and

00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,480
contributors

00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,480
please think about how you can make the

00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,760
experience more welcoming

00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:02,480
and inclusive some of this

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:05,519
is staying on top of issues in prs and

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,680
not letting them go ignored

00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,600
some of this is thinking about whether

00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,640
the experience of submitting an issue or

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,680
pr

00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:17,920
um is it pleasant or

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:20,320
owner or or is it onerous and confusing

00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,519
how can we make that better as a

00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,959
community

00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:28,399
um or try taking some of these issues

00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:29,600
um and labeling them as good first

00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,640
issues as

00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,839
targets for people who are attempting

00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:37,360
their first pr

00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:40,160
or labeling issues

00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,000
with help wanted so that people who

00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,800
would like to help have an idea of where

00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,800
to get started

00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:52,880
some of this could just be as simple as

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,320
scrolling back up in slack to see if

00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,360
there were any questions

00:09:54,320 --> 00:10:00,000
asked in slack your your team slack

00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,600
overnight or the day before that went

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,720
unacknowledged and

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:07,760
help point those people on their way

00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,480
now these are some ideas and suggestions

00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,880
it's

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,720
um really up to the project teams to

00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:16,240
consider adopting these but

00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:19,120
i really hope that um

00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,440
you keep these in mind i think these

00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,160
will

00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,360
help us to continue to grow the cloud

00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,880

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:29,200

00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,959
