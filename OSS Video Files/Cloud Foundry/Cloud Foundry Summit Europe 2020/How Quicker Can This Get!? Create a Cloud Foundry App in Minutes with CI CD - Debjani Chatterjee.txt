Title: How Quicker Can This Get!? Create a Cloud Foundry App in Minutes with CI CD - Debjani Chatterjee
Publication date: 2020-10-26
Playlist: Cloud Foundry Summit Europe 2020
Description: 
	How Quicker Can This Get!? Create a Cloud Foundry App in Minutes with CI/CD - Debjani Chatterjee, IBM

This talk is for anyone who's getting familiar with cloud-native and has just heard about Cloud Foundry. Or for a beginner getting started with creating web apps quickly. In this session, Debjani will explore the seamless developer experience Cloud Foundry provides while deploying an app in a few minutes on a Cloud platform. She will also create a continuous delivery pipeline for the app so that any changes made on the Git repo will be automatically integrated to trigger a new build to reflect the changes on the app. The demo will be followed by a question and answer session open to all participants. This presentation is intended for users who would like to get their first hands-on experience or for others who might want to evaluate an alternative deployment option.

00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,840
so

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,760
hi i didn't mean to confuse you with yet

00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,879
another marketing stack

00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:56,079
and you must be uh wondering

00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:59,520
what does this have to do with

00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,559
the cloud foundry 101 or how quicker can

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,080
this get

00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:07,200
um about creating a cloud foundry app

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,200
in minutes with ci cd well i'm here just

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,960
to do that today

00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:15,680
i work at ibm

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,320
as a developer advocate and we work with

00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,680
the mantra code content and community

00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,680
which basically means that

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:29,680
i work with a very

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,799
bright and wonderful set of developers

00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,400
like you

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:36,960
who are a part of the community and

00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,680
the kind of user experience that you

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,400
have

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,560
depends on what we take from you as a

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:46,079
feedback and give to our product teams

00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,479
to develop better on the code and we do

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,759
so

00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,759
with the help of content

00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:55,840
for you today's takeaways will be

00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,600
to finally take that plunge to cloud you

00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,399
have been thinking about

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,320
and deploy a very simple quiz

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,280
application in a few minutes

00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,399
uh which is a cloud foundry app and

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,360
implement

00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:12,000
continuous integration and delivery for

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,800
that particular app

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,920
but trust me uh just get started with

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,280
cloud for me

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,959
wasn't as easy as uh it is going to be

00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:25,200
for you today

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:28,640
no it was frustrating and

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:33,040
it was difficult i did not start with

00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:36,879
the defined pathway to learn

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:41,200
and i jumped in and learned

00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:41,200
to whatever i could get my hands on with

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:50,800
so let us take a step back and

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:53,280
take that plunge and see what we can do

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,480
open up your browsers on your phones or

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,760
your laptops

00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:01,040
and hit this website

00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:03,840
github basically and for the ones who

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,120
don't have a cloud account yet create

00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,640
one for free

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:11,680
on this link here if you navigate to the

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:14,239
github repo you'll have a deploy to ibm

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,239
cloud button

00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:24,000
go ahead and click that and

00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:24,000
you'll be able to deploy a tool chain

00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:32,000
to ibm cloud which will

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:34,480
get you a cloud foundry app

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,480
created

00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:49,760
let's follow along

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:53,599
so there has been a slight change

00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:55,760
with the regions uh in the past few days

00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:58,319
and hence i'm selecting london as a

00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:01,840
region if you get that notification

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:02,480
i want my application to have a clean

00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,080
name

00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:09,120
hence i remove the numericals if you see

00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:11,360
there is a delivery pipeline where you

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,519
have to create a new api key

00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,079
there are also screenshots given on the

00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:20,479
github repo

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,479
click create to get one generated

00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,759
and again create one

00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:29,840
to get started with the application

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:43,840
if you see there is a delivery pipeline

00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:47,280
created for you

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:49,440
it takes a few seconds it has got two

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:53,120
stages for us here

00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:55,120
one build and another deploy

00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,040
you can view the logs and history while

00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,280
the build is taking place and you can

00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,680
take a look at the steps that are

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,680
happening

00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:17,199
once you start the deployment procedure

00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:21,440
a git repo is created

00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:25,600
on the ibm cloud git lab

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:27,520
in private for you if you want to do

00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,600
that on your github

00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,400
i will come back later and show you how

00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,400
that can be done

00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:41,199
well the build stage is passed for us

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:43,280
and next comes our deployment stage

00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,360
similarly you can again take a look at

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,240
the logs on the history

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,320
to see what is exactly going on behind

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:54,479
the process

00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:58,240
in the meantime i'll take a look

00:05:54,479 --> 00:06:01,360
at the git repo that was created for you

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,360
that i was talking about

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,479
so this has cloned the entire

00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,479
application

00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:17,199
that was there on my public

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,199
git repo

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,840
as you can see

00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:31,680
the deployment usually takes a

00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:35,280
few minutes one or two minutes mostly

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:40,319
but especially when you're on the

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:43,919
demo day it does take a little more time

00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:46,960
i guess if you have been in other

00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:50,479
summits or other deaf conferences

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:52,319
you must have seen sweaty people on

00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:55,759
stages

00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:58,000
waiting for their deployment to get over

00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,759
i'll start i'll try not to fret up on

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,319
that

00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,319
and just wait uh for a few seconds

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,160
so with that

00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:20,639
i'd like to say a few things about why

00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:23,360
i am taking this as a demo i have chosen

00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:26,080
this is a demo for

00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,080
the day-to-day

00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,080
so when you go home today or you are at

00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:35,599
home already when you

00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,039
take a step back from all the sessions

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:40,560
that you have

00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:41,039
watched today i'll come back to that

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,319
later

00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:45,039
for the time being our deployment is

00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,160
done

00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,160
and it is successful

00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,440
if you click on view console you will be

00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,720
able to see more information about your

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,280
application

00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,840
and with that your public url will be

00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,840
exposed

00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:09,520
and that's your simple no drama

00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:13,280
no ux not a lot of css

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:15,599
simple quiz application

00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,599
for you

00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:24,960
take the quiz and

00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,840
let's uh take a look at what cloud

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,840
foundry is

00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,399
so there are a lot of buzzwords you will

00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,959
be hearing

00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,039
once you are in this industry you'll

00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:38,320
hear a lot about containers you'll be

00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:41,200
hearing a lot about

00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,240
cloud native technology building apps on

00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,360
cloud building

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:50,000
uh apps on certain infrastructures and

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:52,640
you'll have to think about what kind of

00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,519
base what kind of an infrastructure you

00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,440
would need

00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,680
for your app to build on but for a

00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,160
beginner for a starter the one who

00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:03,440
doesn't want to think of a lot of

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:05,519
options for that particular moment when

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,640
you just want to create an app and see

00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,160
how it feels like

00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:13,279
cloud foundry gives you just that it is

00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:17,200
an open source platform as a service

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:20,480
in the truest of terms it has got a nice

00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:24,560
a very nice user experience with

00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:27,839
cloud native development on focus and

00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:31,279
it lets you create apps

00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:34,320
test them and deploy them

00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:37,040
and get their production ready for you

00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,760
and you also have an option to automate

00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,760
all that flows

00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:47,680
so we are going to be doing just that

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,640
next we are going to uh take a look at

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:52,399
uh triggering automatic uh bills for the

00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,560
application

00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,720
so that is already in place for the

00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,839
application that you have created

00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,920
in the pipeline however

00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:05,839
uh we'll take a look at if that's

00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,839
working and how that's working

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,160
so going back to that same git repo that

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,800
was created for you

00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,800
not the one that you have cloned from

00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,920
but the one that is created

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:33,839
and i'll just go to the index.html

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:33,839
and i'll try to put down a few changes

00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,640
we have this okay how many questions uh

00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:42,720
do you think you can answer maybe all

00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:46,560
that's all i'm going to be uh changing

00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:48,959
for now

00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,360
a very small one and let's see what

00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,360
happens

00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:58,560
my commit is done here i didn't want to

00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,360
get into the hassle of

00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,760
doing this on the cli to keep things

00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,760
simple

00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,079
and this is what it was before

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,040
i'll go back to my tool gene and if you

00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:16,160
see

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:29,839
that my build has already been triggered

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:29,839
and already running 60 percent

00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:43,839
the build stage is successfully passed

00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:50,639
so like i was saying sometime back that

00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:53,760
you can also choose to have

00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:56,000
have your own github repository

00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:59,200
so that you can do your changes right

00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,519
there so for that you'll have to use

00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,120
this particular integration instead of

00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,839
the git lab

00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:11,839
integration that has been added on this

00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:11,839
tool chain

00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:19,839
so while the deployment uh stage

00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,760
gets passed it is 30 percent almost

00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,279
right now

00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,440
i'll be back to the things that i was

00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:29,040
saying sometime back

00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:32,399
so not always do you want to focus uh

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:35,839
on the infrastructure right and it's not

00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,839
always possible or

00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:43,600
to jump start your uh you know

00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,320
studies or you jump start your learning

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,880
from

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:49,120
uh the very beginning so this is where

00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,920
cloud foundry comes into place

00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:54,320
and here we have cloud foundry on ibm

00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,320
cloud

00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:01,519
you can build applications you can

00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:04,079
scale them you can control them

00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:06,399
and there are multiple application

00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:10,079
runtimes available

00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:13,360
there is great documentation for this

00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:15,440
you can take a look at all the tutorials

00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,600
if you go ahead and create a cloud

00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:20,720
foundry sample app

00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:24,240
you'll be able to do that for

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:27,279
maybe notice maybe swift

00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:31,279
or go or a php application

00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:31,279
and ours is a nodejs application today

00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,279
well the deployment stage has also

00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:41,120
passed

00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:41,120
and if i take a look

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:51,760
well that's your automated build

00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:51,760
reflected on the page

00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:03,680
so what we did today is we have

00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:06,959
used the cloud foundry app tool chain

00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:09,519
with the issue tracker

00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,399
so that if there are issues raised on

00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,399
your

00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,680
git repository you will be able to view

00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,440
them

00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,720
you will be able to do changes on your

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,000
repo

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:22,880
which goes to the pipeline on ibm cloud

00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,360
you can also do your changes with the

00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:27,760
web id that is provided for you

00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:30,720
and you can add or delete more

00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:33,680
integrations as and when you like

00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:36,160
with that said we can add a devops

00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,160
insight

00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,800
as well

00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:46,480
i hope with this

00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:49,920
you have got a very

00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:54,639
beginner's understanding to

00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:58,160
get started with developing

00:14:54,639 --> 00:15:01,279
one application at a time on cloud

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:04,760
and take the plunge

00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:07,760
i am now open for questions thank you so

00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,760
