welcome this is the project update for

00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,759
the stratos project

00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:07,919
my name is neil mcdougall i am the

00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:11,120
project lead for the stratos project

00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:13,040
and i work for souza hi

00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,880
and i'm richard cox and i'm a software

00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,480
developer at suster

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,000
brilliant so today as i said we're going

00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,800
to give you an update on the stratos

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,840
project

00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,000
talk about some of the work we've been

00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,680
doing since the last summit and give you

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,080
a demonstration of the new kubernetes

00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,080
features

00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:32,559
okay very briefly what is stratos

00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,760
stratos is a web-based user interface

00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:35,520
for cloud foundry

00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,760
and it provides a rich management

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,239
experience for both developers

00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,320
and administrators it was created by

00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,239
souza back in 2017 and

00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,600
over the years we've now progressed and

00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:49,840
we're a top level cloud foundry project

00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,520
so in this session i'm going to go

00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,600
through the slides very quickly

00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,680
and we're going to focus the time on a

00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,879
demo so richard will demonstrate the new

00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,800
features that we've got for the new

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,800
version 4.2

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,719
two things we want to talk about in this

00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,360
session the first of those is

00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,400
stratos.app so this is a new website

00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,479
that we've put together

00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,680
that really makes it easy for you to

00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,159
find and browse

00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,439
the documentation around stratos so

00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,799
before it was all in github is a little

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,759
bit difficult to find

00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:19,280
and browse around now we've got a nice

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,799
documentation browser and we're building

00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,000
out and improving the documentation as

00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,840
we go forward

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,920
the second one that i've mentioned

00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,119
already is 4.2 this is the latest

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,840
release that we've just

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:32,079
put together before the summit um you'll

00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,840
be aware of this thing called kubernetes

00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:35,439
cloud foundry foundation and the

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,920
projects are starting to embrace that so

00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:39,439
we see

00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,759
cube cf we see cfo kate irene quarks

00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,920
and stratos 2 is embracing kubernetes

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,880
and in fact it's done so for

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,320
over two years um as soos are we

00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,680
building extensions to support

00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,079
kubernetes and helm

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,520
and what we're announcing at this summit

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,040
is that we are upstreaming those

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,840
extensions to the cloud foundry

00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,360
foundation

00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,439
now they've always been available in

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,960
open source but now they will be

00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,880
moved upstream and they'll live in the

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,119
main stratos code base

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,719
and we're also making it easy for people

00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,600
to take stratos and build it with or

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,200
without those features

00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,640
so if you just want classic stratos you

00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,920
can still have that

00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,160
so those features are out now and

00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,840
they're included in 4.2

00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,440
there's a couple of slides in this deck

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,120
that you can look at afterwards

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,959
that give you a summary of the cube and

00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,200
the helm features i'm not going to go

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,640
through these uh today

00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,239
instead i'm going to hand over the time

00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,520
for richard to give you a much more

00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,680
in-depth demo where you'll get a good

00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,040
feel for what we can do

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,879
uh so i'm going to walk through some of

00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:37,840
the cube and health features that we

00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:37,840
bring into stratos

00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,319
so here we are at the stratos

00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,480
applications screen and here we can see

00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:46,560
uh i've got a cloud foundry attached and

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,720
we can see there's one application there

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,560
we can also dive down into the cloud

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,400
foundry and see more information about

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,840
the the cloud foundry we can see the

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,360
organizations and routes we can drill

00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,680
down to the organizations

00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,680
the numbers has changed here but let's

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,040
go to the marketplace

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,480
and for for the cloud foundries that

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,640
i've got attached you can see we don't

00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,840
have any services so wouldn't it be cool

00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,319
if we could add some

00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,760
services to this cloud foundry and the

00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,800
way that we're going to do that

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:15,920
is by installing mini broker

00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,480
and many brokers base they'll be able to

00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,239
provide

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,519
the services that we want in the service

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,440
marketplace

00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:24,480
and to install mini broker we're going

00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,959
to install its helm chart to kubernetes

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,879
or via stratos and to do that we need to

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,799
connect a kubernetes some kubernetes

00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:33,440
endpoints and some help endpoints

00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,720
so let's switch to the endpoints page

00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,599
and here we can see that cloud foundry

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,280
that we have

00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,120
for those that don't know about stratos

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,879
and the endpoints

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,200
endpoints are basically a way that

00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,319
stratos communicates with other systems

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,879
and they can be cloud foundries

00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:48,319
kubernetes helm repositories

00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,319
and the basic flow is that a

00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,920
administrator would register these

00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,599
endpoints and then users would be able

00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,640
to connect to those endpoints with their

00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,840
own credentials

00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,519
and that will allow stratos to

00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,000
communicate with these systems as if

00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,560
they were

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,519
the user so we've got our one cloud

00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,200
foundry we need to add some kubernetes

00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,720
so i'm going to click register and here

00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,799
we can see all the different types of

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:12,400
endpoints that we can supply

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:14,640
and let's go for installing some

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,280
kubernetes by importing them from a cube

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,400
config

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,160
because that's just the quickest and

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,120
easiest way to do it so i'm going to

00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,440
select that

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:25,520
i'm going to supply a queue config

00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,800
and the status will read that in and

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,440
work out the context that you have in

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,680
there

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,280
i've got two here so i'm going to select

00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,759
both of those

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,759
now if the user associated with this

00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,040
context is something that we can process

00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,960
and then we will automatically connect

00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,280
to that for the mini cube that i have

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,600
here

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,880
it has local file certificates so we

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,639
have to do that in a second step and it

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:48,000
tells us that underneath

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,919
i'm going to hit next and here we can

00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,040
see the steps that are going to be done

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,440
we're going to register and connect to

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,720
the

00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,000
the kind instance that i have here and

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,360
then we're going to register the

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,080
keyboard mini coupe

00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,759
i would hit import and that's all done

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,720
and we can see we now we have two extra

00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,840
side nav

00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,639
um items here related to those ones that

00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,840
we've added

00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,360
we're gonna go back to the endpoints

00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,919
page and we can see we've got one

00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,080
connected

00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,440
and one disconnected i'm just going to

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,800
connect to this manually now

00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,800
by supplying the certificates

00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,960
and there we have our kubernetes that we

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,840
can install our mini cube

00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,199
oh sorry our mini breaker too but before

00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,000
we do that i'm just going to dive down

00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,639
into

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,440
a mini uh kubernetes this mini cube and

00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,120
this is all new now in 4.2

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,800
you can see here we can see some uh

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,360
summary information about this

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,800
instance uh we can list the nodes that

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,080
are here

00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,600
the name spaces and the pods

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,440
and here in the pods view we can see

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,639
that their state we can also have a look

00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,680
at the containers

00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,880
in these pods let's switch back to the

00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,720
summary

00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,479
there's a few features that we have the

00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,520
are in what we call tech preview so

00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,000
these are disabled by

00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,280
default and can be enabled if you'd like

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,560
to try them out

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,479
so the first of these three features

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,600
here i'm going to show is the kubernetes

00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,639
dashboard

00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,560
so to make it easier to be able to view

00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,840
the kubernetes dashboard you can install

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,319
it via stratos

00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,880
is it's pre-installed and then you can

00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,440
click on

00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,440
view dashboard and without having to log

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,840
in you can see this kubernetes dashboard

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,039
here

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,520
with all of the normal functionality

00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:29,840
you'd expect you can do things like

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,919
select your

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,960
selected namespace see stats for those

00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,160
namespaces

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,360
you can even collapse that header to

00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:39,360
make it look a bit nicer as well

00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,800
the second of the tech preview features

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,199
is the

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,400
terminal so we can open a terminal which

00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:49,039
is going to provide us

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:51,120
cube ctl and helm cli access

00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:53,120
to that instance so you can do auto

00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,319
complete as usual

00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,840
you don't have to worry about logging in

00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:59,680
these are using the same credentials

00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,680
that you had when you connected to the

00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,880
kubernetes

00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,800
you can even list all names in there as

00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,680
well so that's the

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,520
the terminal now we're going to have a

00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,880
look at the third

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,120
of the tech preview features this is

00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,240
analysis so you you can run various

00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,560
analysis tools

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,919
by stratos at the moment we only have

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,440
one that's popeye

00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:26,319
so i'm going to run that on the cluster

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,840
and we can see that this automatically

00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,039
updates and we've had one that's running

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,720
and it's completed

00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,880
we can click on that and we can see the

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,560
results of this

00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,840
you can also run this analysis tool at

00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,400
different levels as well that i'll talk

00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,520
to

00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,520
in later on

00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,800
so now we have our kubernetes instances

00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:48,000
installed we need to add

00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,879
some uh helm repositories and home

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,440
repositories

00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,960
uh a collection of help charts browse

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,759
and then install

00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,680
so i'm gonna go back to the endpoints

00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:00,879
click register

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,879
click on helm and then

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:07,120
add a couple i'm gonna add souza

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:13,840
and i'm gonna add one for our mini

00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:13,840
broker as well

00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,479
uh and then it might say synchronizing

00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,400
and that's when um stratos is just

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:22,479
working out what charts are in there

00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:25,520
and working out how we can display those

00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:26,879
as well so now we've got two installed

00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,039
we can see now we've got an extra side

00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,599
now item called helm we can click on

00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,280
that

00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:34,479
and we can view all the charts that are

00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,479
in these two home repos

00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,919
so let's have a look at one we're going

00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,399
to drill down actually into the stratos

00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,719
chart

00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,480
that's in the souza helm repo here you

00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,399
can see the rebie for the chart

00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,000
you can see you can flip to previous

00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,760
versions

00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,120
uh we go to the top one if we wanted to

00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,440
install this

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,560
we can click on install we would select

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,920
a name i'm not going to go through this

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,200
so i'm just going to click some junk in

00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,880
here

00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,040
you specify a helm chart or a helm

00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,839
install name and a name space to install

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,959
too

00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,920
and then you get to the point where you

00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:07,200
need to supply helm values

00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,120
if the helm chart has a schema

00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,760
associated with it we can dynamically

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,560
generate

00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,120
a form and that will allow you to easily

00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,959
enter those

00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,800
those values so for instance here we

00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,320
have one for api keys

00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,640
it's a drop down with some specific

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,480
values so i'm going to select all users

00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,839
so this is one way you can supply values

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,600
another is a more free-form yaml editor

00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:29,120
so i switched to this and now you can

00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,959
see the the one that we've added there

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,839
so as we've got on our schema

00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:35,279
we could actually enter junk here and we

00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,320
can syntax highlight or there's a

00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,200
synthetic highlighting to show that

00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,519
there's a problem with this

00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,880
if i hover over you can see it says that

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:44,880
we've got an invalid value there

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,120
other things you can do with this side

00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,720
you can copy from the chart values

00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,640
and let's go overwrite our current

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,440
values but that's fine and this brings

00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,399
in all of the

00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,320
the values with the defaults in you can

00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:59,680
see on the right we've got that

00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,800
that outline there as well if we were to

00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,079
edit some of these

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,440
and then we want to maybe get rid of the

00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,399
ones that we haven't edited you can

00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,800
easily

00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:09,680
diff with that chart and you can see it

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:12,560
just retains the one we've changed

00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,600
so that's for the for the stratos one

00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,440
but we won't want to install that we

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,800
want to install our mini broker one

00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:22,560
so let's go back to the helm view and

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:24,480
find mini broke when you broke it sorry

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,640
uh mini broker uh so we're going to

00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,079
install this we're going to call it

00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,959
mini broker and we're going to install

00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:34,240
it to the mini broker

00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:36,959
namespace and we click on next and we're

00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:39,279
going to bring in some values i've

00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:42,399
prepared from earlier

00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,399
and i'm going to hit install

00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,959
and then we're going to switch to the

00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,640
workloads view and i'm going to quickly

00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:48,240
go to pods

00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,480
so these are the pods associated with

00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,760
the mini broker workload and you think

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,560
of workloads as maybe

00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,000
um instances of helm charts you can see

00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,079
there that it's this

00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,079
this part has gone from coming up to

00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,200
running and we can expand that as well

00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,160
and we can see the container in there

00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,600
that's all happy

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,160
i'm going to switch to another workload

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,519
that we can see a bit more detail on

00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,519
so to show off some of the features in

00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:12,720
workloads i'm just going to switch

00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:14,399
to another workload so this is a stratos

00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,480
metrics workload

00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,519
and at the top here you can see a few

00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,560
interesting things we've got the

00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,480
analysis

00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:23,040
so we can run an analysis on this

00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,040
workload

00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:31,839
and once that's done

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,200
we can then overlay uh some information

00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,959
at the bottom so a few details about the

00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,600
screen so yeah we can shoot we can show

00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,800
some very

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,760
basic details about where it's installed

00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,040
too whether the helm chart the porting

00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,399
containers in

00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,560
in this workload and all the other

00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:47,040
resources as well and we've run the

00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:50,399
analysis tool

00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:52,240
and then we can overlay

00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,000
the analysis run and we can see here

00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,120
we've got some items associated with

00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,680
that resources

00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,959
so i'm just going to click on this one

00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,639
and we can see them listed here for

00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:03,600
services in this workload there's a few

00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,600
things we might want to address

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,519
other things upgrade so you can see that

00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:12,399
we've got some upgrades available

00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,959
on the right if i click on upgrade you

00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,040
can see there

00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,959
we've got one two one installed and

00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,880
there's one available to install as well

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:21,760
we can then could go through and upgrade

00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,760
to that if we wished

00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,040
other things in the workloads view you

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,760
can see some notes if there were

00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,680
supplies

00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:30,000
you can see some values i would click on

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,720
that um because it's got some other

00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
interesting values in and history so if

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,560
we were to do an upgrade we would see

00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,360
that

00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,480
in the history you can see the analysis

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,600
that we've run as well

00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,360
uh in a more um separate view

00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,959
and the fourth of the tech preview

00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,399
features that i'm going to show you is

00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:49,120
the overview

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,680
and the overview is a graph layout of

00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,839
all your

00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:54,480
kubernetes resources and how they

00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:56,639
interact and connect to each other

00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,839
what you can do is add an add the

00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,399
security overlay

00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,600
and you can see an outline on ones that

00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:07,360
you might want to look at

00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:09,760
with their warnings as well

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,279
so we have our mini broker but we still

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,440
don't see it in the marketplace

00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:15,040
i am going to run one script in the

00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:21,839
background that's just going to run the

00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:21,839
cli tool to register the service broker

00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,680
now i'm going to hit refresh and here we

00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,160
are with all of the service offerings

00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:31,760
that mini broker provides

00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:33,519
if i was to go down to readers

00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,839
let's say we want to create an instance

00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,839
of this

00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,880
i'm going to select a organization in

00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:43,680
space for our cert new service instance

00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,959
i'm going to select a version if i have

00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,560
the service plan and i'm going to give

00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:51,360
it a name

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,639
finish so that's then in cloud foundry

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,160
our service instance

00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:59,279
we can also switch back to kubernetes

00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:02,240
and go to namespaces

00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:03,600
and if we find find our mini broker

00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,720
namespace we can actually go in there

00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,519
and we can see

00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,480
the pods that the mini broker is

00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,079
bringing up

00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,600
and there's the the sorry the mini

00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,959
broker is bringing up this

00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,279
pods to support the service instance

00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:17,120
that we've created we can see the status

00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:19,839
of those as well

00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,040
thanks richard so what's next well we're

00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,680
continuing to add support

00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,600
for the cloud boundary v3 api we're

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,920
adding support for localization

00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,600
making it easier to extend stratos

00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,399
making sure irene works well within

00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,800
stratos

00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,880
and continuing to refine the ui and fix

00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,720
bugs

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,079
there's a couple more sessions at this

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,399
year some that you might be interested

00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,480
in

00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,160
so we have a stratos project out officer

00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,079
hours session if you want to drop by

00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,680
and ask us questions we have time to do

00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,839
that we'll be available to to answer

00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,440
them and speak to you

00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,959
tomorrow we have a hands-on lab where

00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,279
you can learn uh

00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:54,560
yourself to deploy stratos to kubernetes

00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:57,279
and explore the new features that we've

00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,279
shown you today

00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,680
so thank you very much for attending um

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,120
we rely on your input if you use

00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,360
straddles please let us know

00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,320
please engage with us in the slack

00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:12,480
channel

00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:14,399
we're more than happy to help

00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,839
okay if there are no questions i mean we

00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,560
will just um

00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:20,399
we can add lib well while we wait so as

00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,639
i say there's a q a box on the

00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,920
right hand side ask a question there

00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:25,680
we'll ping it in the um

00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:28,240
just the message chat and we'll get onto

00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:31,759
it we do have two other sessions that we

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:35,839
uh we showed in the video you just saw

00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:38,560
so um later on today there's a stratos

00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,600
office hours so um if you want to talk

00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,279
to the team further

00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,880
then come because there and we have a

00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:45,199
hands-on lab

00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,920
tomorrow what are you most excited about

00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:49,120
people to try

00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,800
that's a great question so i think

00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,399
the new all the stuff we've done on the

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:55,680
kubernetes is stuff that

00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,720
um we built a while ago and we've been

00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,639
improving over the last

00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,920
at least two years and that's been it's

00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,560
been open source but it's in it's been

00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,639
in the super

00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,240
souza repo and so this is the first

00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,040
release where we've upstreamed all of

00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,120
that

00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,880
the two you know the suitor version of

00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,160
the um upstream cloud branch

00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,240
version are pretty much identical now

00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,839
apart from just some branding changes so

00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,959
this is great to see all of that go

00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,160
upstream and be available to the

00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,519
community

00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,279
as well as the kubernetes stuff we've

00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,079
just been polishing the ui across the

00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,360
board so

00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,519
from release to release hopefully you'll

00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:26,320
see it just look a little bit nicer

00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,759
um a bit slicker so i'm just hoping

00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,120
people can give it a try

00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,560
there's lots of different ways deploying

00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,199
it i'm excited to see if people are

00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,560
gonna

00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,480
uh deploy it into cloud foundry and

00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,279
sorry into kubernetes with helm give it

00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,759
a whiz

00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,399
try connecting cube clusters as you see

00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,839
we can

00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,839
connect to you know the public cloud

00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,720
ones as well as your kind of on-premise

00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,480
clusters

00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,560
uh and the helm functionality i think is

00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,880
probably the most uh

00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,639
most exciting that i see we've kind of

00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,079
spruced up recently we've added artifact

00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,320
hub support

00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:56,000
which is a recent changer from helmhub

00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,839
so um yeah i'm hoping you can give it

00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,199
dig in give it a try and we always

00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,880
we always look for feedback right so

00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:02,639
we're looking for feedback from the

00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,680
community as to what features they would

00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,160
like to see

00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,039
obviously your bug reports um i'm sure

00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,799
there are some so

00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:10,160
we're happy to take those and get on top

00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,600
of those as well as

00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,760
get your input on what you would like to

00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,559
see either you know the features we have

00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,880
already

00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:18,319
where we should take those next um small

00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,000
improvements right things that will just

00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:22,480
make it a little bit easier to use

00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,760
as well as you know new stuff where we

00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,880
either have gaps or

00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,400
you kind of say hey have you thought

00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,959
about adding this or taking it in this

00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,200
direction

00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,240
we'd love to get all of those so head on

00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,160
over to our

00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,919
github repository obviously there's the

00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,679
the stratosphere app website now

00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,200
where we've tried to bring together all

00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,720
the documentation i think that's been a

00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,240
good achievement and something we're

00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,720
looking to improve and i'm hoping that

00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,600
will help people have a focused place to

00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,240
go

00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,760
for stratos to to redox to understand

00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,120
how to install it in the capability

00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,200
capabilities we have

00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,039
but um kind of bugs and improvements

00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,400
head on over to the github repo

00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:57,280
and just file as an issue um intended

00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,440
audience

00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,039
so that's a great question so we try and

00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,200
aim at both developers and

00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:06,559
administrators i guess we have

00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:10,000
slightly more on the developer side um

00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:11,679
for cloud foundry um in terms of being

00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,840
able to view applications create org

00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,679
spaces

00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,120
deploy applications from the ui so it's

00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,679
probably more developer focused there

00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,360
are

00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,039
there's a little bit of um

00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,480
administrative capability

00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:24,400
you know some of those can be done by

00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,400
you know org or managers so the ability

00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,640
to create quotas

00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,080
uh if you click onto the cloud foundry

00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,600
view you get a lot more of your

00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,960
administrator but there's probably more

00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,120
of a focus on the developer

00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,480
with the kubernetes side maybe the focus

00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,480
is slightly more on

00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,360
the administrator than the the developer

00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,280
although you know developers can go in

00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:45,120
and use the functionality obviously with

00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,720
our back you'll only get access to the

00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,200
resources that you've been

00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,080
granted permission to so we try and aim

00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,720
at both

00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,000
um we are you know we are trying to

00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,360
cover the developer a little bit more i

00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,320
think that the administrator

00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:00,080
and that's something we're trying to

00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,080
improve over the coming releases as well

00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,720
great great questions thank you i think

00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:11,039
we're out of time that went quickly

00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,559
so um thanks for joining thank you for

00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,320
watching the session as i say

00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:16,480
there is plenty more stratos in this

00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,600
summit yet so come and find us later on

00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,840
in the office hours

00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,440
or you know come and try the hands-on as

00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,600
well where you'll get to fire up

00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,880
uh kubernetes cluster you'll deploy

00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,840
strategy through helm

00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,039
and really explore some of the

00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,440
functionality that richard walked you

00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,440
through today

00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:35,760
otherwise enjoy the rest of the summit

00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,760
