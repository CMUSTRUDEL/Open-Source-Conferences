hi there welcome

00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:07,040
to the cloud foundry summit europe

00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,800
virtual edition

00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,240
here in a very interesting year of 2020.

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,480
first i want to thank all of you for

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,519

it means the world to the community

00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,880
second

00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,039
i want to actually extend a special

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,720
thanks to all the speakers and the panel

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,279
participants

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,039
all of the sponsors all of you that are

00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:30,880
frankly inviting us into your homes

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,040
so that you can share what you have to

00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,520
share

00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,960
now today i want to spend time with you

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,520
talking about where we are as a

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,360
community

00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,879
where we're going as a community and to

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,480
celebrate some of the

00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:45,760
successes that we have in april when i

00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,520
stepped into the role as executive

00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,440
director of the cloud foundry foundation

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,879
i shared that our community had a new

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,399
north star

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,640
it was to bring cloud foundry and

00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,199
kubernetes together and we did this

00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,440
because

00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:00,960
we know that our users are increasingly

00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:03,039
using these technologies together

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,000
you know in fact here's a little preview

00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:07,040
of the data that we're

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,240
collecting from our 2020 user survey the

00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,360
survey is not complete

00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,560
and by the way feel free to go on

00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:15,920
cloudfoundry.org and

00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,720
tell us about your user stories but what

00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,560
we've seen

00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,840
in the data we've collected so far is

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,920
that nearly

00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:26,080
90 of users are already using or

00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,840
evaluating kubernetes and 60

00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,400
of all users are using kubernetes and

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:35,119
cloud foundry together

00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,119
and users are what drive our community

00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:43,439
our mission this year has been to

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,280
bring the benefits of cloud foundry

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:49,360
to kubernetes clusters everywhere

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,680
this mission has brought us together in

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,640
a new way it's re-energized the

00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,720
community it's

00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,320
it's driven fresh thinking in the

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,399
architecture

00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,439
we've included kubernetes and istio and

00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:03,119
fluentd

00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:04,640
envoy kpac we've also spun technologies

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,680
out so they could be used in

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,200
other contexts picado is a great example

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,440
the picado build packs collection of

00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,480
build packs are now being adopted in

00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,920
contexts all over whether it be public

00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,520
cloud providers or

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:21,760
open source ci cd platforms

00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,440
this has been a process of fundamentally

00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,879
moving cloud foundry towards new

00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:29,440
audiences

00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:29,440
new use cases and new users

00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:37,040
now today we can be proud

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,480
that we have made this transition you

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,200
can say with me

00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,680
cloud foundry is a developer experience

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,200
for kubernetes

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,640
while there's more work to be done both

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,239
to help existing users make the

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,560
transition and to

00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,920
keep pushing and maturing the shared

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,480
path

00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,920
make no mistake about it development

00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,640
teams

00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,680
large and small can take advantage of

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,599
cloud foundry

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:05,840
to simplify deployment and management of

00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,840
their software on kubernetes clusters

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,720
with that in mind we have some project

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,640
announcements

00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,840
the first is that the cf for kate's

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:21,200
effort has released version

00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:23,440
1.0 this project is all about going from

00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,640
kubernetes to cf push in less than 10

00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,720
minutes

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,159
it includes app staging using kpak and

00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,319
paquetto

00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,840
it's got encrypted communications with

00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,000
istio and envoy between all the

00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,599
components lifecycle management uses the

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,680
suite of tools

00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:41,760
called carvel like k app ytt k build

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,040
metrics log and event collections using

00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,959
fluentd

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,560
it's really embraced with the community

00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,440
building it likes to call

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,040
kube idiomatic architecture you can

00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:55,040
learn more about this project by going

00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:57,760
to cf4kates.io

00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,760
give it a try

00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:02,879
now cf has also been making significant

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,000
progress

00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:08,319
coupe cf has been about taking the

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,640
cloud foundry that we know and love the

00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:12,840
classic cloud foundry

00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,319
and deploying it into a kubernetes

00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,280
cluster

00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:18,880
with the 2.5 release that project team

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,799
is happy to announce that they have

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:24,479
production ready support for irene

00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:27,440
included you can use the diego scheduler

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:30,320
or you can use arena you get life cycle

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,080
management through the helm tool chain

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,720
and it's really again it's about classic

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:39,440
cloud foundry with modern infrastructure

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:42,400
learn more about kubecf at coopcf.io

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,160
now both of those projects cf for cates

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:47,199
and coop cf

00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,199
really just represent different paths to

00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:52,080
get to the same outcome

00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,120
kubernetes cloud foundry working well

00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,919
together

00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,479
with a focus on supporting software

00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,479
developers

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,560
the third bit of news today from the

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,320
open source community

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,520
is that stratos 4.2 is out

00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,120
now for those of you that don't know

00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,280
stratos it's the open source

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,080
multi-cluster ui for cloud foundry and

00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,840
now

00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,000
for kubernetes and even helm

00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:19,120
repositories

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,240
4.2 is actually adding management of

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,840
helm charts

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,320
or the helm chart repositories it's

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:27,440
adding management of kubernetes clusters

00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:29,280
and the project has been

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:32,479
able to add those to a very kind

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,479

how they're using cloud foundry what

00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,080
open source efforts they might have

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,840
going on around cloud foundry

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:53,039
and how they see cloud foundry and

00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,039
kubernetes coming together

00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,520
in addition to the member news in

00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,039
addition to the project news we have a

lot of member news that's been announced

00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,319
today i won't go through all of these

00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,240

our ecosystem i encourage you to dig

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,080
in find out what each one of these

00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,440
companies has been up to

if you're looking for help from a

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,720
systems integrator and making the

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,639
transition with the community

00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,000
find one of them if you're looking for

00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,440
an interesting take on

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,759
how these open source projects come

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,039
together into a product

00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,520
go talk to some of these product

00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:32,319
companies amazing innovation happening

00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,319
in our ecosystem

00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,680
the heart of a conference is about the

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,319
sessions

00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,360
today and tomorrow we have two tracks

00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,759
two parallel

00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,599
session tracks put together spanning

00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,520
three different topics

00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,720
new to cloud foundry or introductory

00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,800
material

00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,919
then there's the developer experience

00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,039
topic that's

00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,360
all about experiences that developers

00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,960
have

00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,560
interacting with the software ways that

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,120
they can extend it themselves ways that

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,759
they can take advantage of its features

00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,160
and our contributor topic is really it's

00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,599
about

00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,599
getting to know the contributors that

00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,039
you might not know

00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,960
it's also about contributors

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,639
collaborating with each other

00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,400
a lot of really interesting informations

00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,360
being shared in the sessions i think

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,000
that the

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,919
track chair committees have done an

00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,520
amazing job of picking these

00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:25,520
sessions i also want to point out that

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,919
sprinkled throughout the event you'll

00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,400
find sessions being brought

00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:32,080
to brought in from communities that we

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,479
now rely heavily on

00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,240
whether that is a talk about kubernetes

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,719
and it's roadmap or whether it's a talk

00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,159
about istio and it's roadmap

00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,440
we're building more bridges to these

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,320
communities they're building bridges

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,399
with us

00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,680
um use this as an opportunity to

00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,680
collaborate and learn more

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,839
when you're in a session two things to

00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,080
keep in mind first is the session

00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,200
chat right talk with fellow attendees

00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,360
keep it lively

00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,720
speakers might be there too have a great

00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,880
conversation

00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,839
and after the session recording is done

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,880
playing switch over to the session q a

00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,880
you should be able to have a live

00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,760
conversation with some follow-ups

00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,519
that's the collaboration angle to get

00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,519
there after each session video plays

00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,680
click on the sessions up next tab

00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:18,080
to get to the live q a for that that

00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,080
session

00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,480
you can also dig deeper if you want to

00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,880
get hands-on

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,240
we brought back our hands-on labs

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,480

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,920

00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:40,160
recently

00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:41,519
the second is cf for kate's it's digging

00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,360
in

00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,040
into the internals understanding how cf

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,560
