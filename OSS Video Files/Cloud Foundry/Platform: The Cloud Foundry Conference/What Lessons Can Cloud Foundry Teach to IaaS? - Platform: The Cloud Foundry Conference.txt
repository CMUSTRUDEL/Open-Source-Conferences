00:00:06,109 --> 00:00:10,590
so I'm Lukas Carlsen I've been a

00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:14,639
programmer for about 20 years and before

00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:16,590
I started at Fogg which was platform as

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:19,199
a service company it started out as PHP

00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:21,449
fog and I personally wrote that

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,570
technology myself and I saw cloud

00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:27,990
foundry come around I said wow that's

00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,699
cool and that was a pretty much at the

00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,740
beginning of where cloud foundry was and

00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:33,559
I started thinking I might just want to

00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,570
replace my code with their code and

00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:39,000
build on top of that so I did that

00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:42,120
and signed up about a hundred fifty

00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,309
thousand developers for our platform as

00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:46,230
a service and three months ago

00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:49,590
CenturyLink acquired us so we're very

00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:53,250
happy and it was really interesting

00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:55,170
being acquired by a company that wasn't

00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:56,670
just doing platform as a service in fact

00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:59,160
they weren't really in the platform as a

00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,600
service space at all and so I came in

00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,780
and we've been doing platform as a

00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:06,960
service we've been developers thinking

00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,549
about developers for a long time but one

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,689
thing I hadn't been thinking about is

00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:14,580
infrastructure as a service and that's

00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:16,229
something that uh yeah I'm not doing the

00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:21,960
slides on purpose you guys have seen

00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:23,930
enough slides what is infrastructure as

00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,549
a service to a developer anymore

00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:30,240
infrastructure as a service made tons of

00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:32,130
sense six years ago ten years ago it was

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,479
just an amazing mind-blowing thing but

00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:35,790
what does it mean to us

00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:39,450
you know we're developers in this room

00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:42,150
what is infrastructure mean in the world

00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:45,509
of platform as a service because I'm

00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:50,640
curious how many of you guys use Amazon

00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:54,450
Web Services good and how many use like

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,790
vSphere VM we're technologies okay so

00:01:54,450 --> 00:02:00,030
it's kind of half and half so we we have

00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:02,969
both right and whenever any of us go in

00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:07,259
and we look at what infrastructure as a

00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:10,259
service is to to a developer you know we

00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:12,210
can get our job done real quick I'm also

00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:15,320
curious about one more question

00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:19,890
how many of you have deployed to either

00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:23,100
Amazon or vSphere and done like you know

00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:28,740
a lot of servers like hundreds of

00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:30,960
servers thousand plus servers ok it's

00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:32,880
not as many people but let me tell you

00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:36,000
we've done that we did it because we had

00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:39,600
to deploy applications for 150,000

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,640
developers and it doesn't really look it

00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,260
doesn't make sense anymore when your

00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:46,590
infrastructure as a service account has

00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:48,900
a thousand servers in it what do you do

00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:52,500
how do you figure out what application

00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:56,220
is talking to which database you know

00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:58,580
all your VMs are in one list and all

00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:02,010
your databases are in a different list

00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:05,460
it's and and what's talking to what what

00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:07,440
firewalls to what it's all weird because

00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:11,370
as a developer we think of applications

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:14,040
and we think about what is an

00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:15,660
application do and what does it need and

00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,430
what are the components how does the

00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:19,050
object storage and the buckets talk to

00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:21,240
the databases and how do they all

00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:22,740
interact how do you backup stuff these

00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,540
are all the questions that a developer

00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:26,190
cares about but it's not really what

00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:29,820
infrastructure as a service is set up to

00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:32,190
do and one of the things that I've been

00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:35,670
thinking about a lot lately is what can

00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:37,640
we think about in terms of applications

00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:40,110
one of the biggest things that I think

00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:43,980
platform as a service and cloud foundry

00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:45,600
has done for us as developers is let us

00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:49,650
think about applications as a

00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:52,140
first-class citizen and if we think

00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:54,260
about what as an application mean in the

00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:58,290
context of cloud foundry it's actually

00:03:54,260 --> 00:04:00,510
pretty specific it's great it's easy

00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:02,460
because we can kind of get right to the

00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:04,740
core of the application needs right from

00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:08,790
the start but it's very specific

00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:11,670
it's a managed Linux container right

00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:14,220
it's like a runtime into your build pack

00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:17,640
and you have some control there but it's

00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:22,530
a managed container so that makes sense

00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:24,870
but as we grew and we've seen a lot of

00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:25,889
use cases in that fog we've gone behind

00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:29,219
firewalls

00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:31,229
we've installed app fog on premise with

00:04:29,219 --> 00:04:34,680
customers we've dealt with a lot of

00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:38,129
enterprise use cases and people love it

00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:40,020
it makes sense but then we get questions

00:04:38,129 --> 00:04:44,610
like well what do we do when we need to

00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:46,620
edit the the every single configuration

00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:49,020
file or what do we do when we need to

00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:52,050
start adding virtual machines or object

00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:54,840
storage well you know okay well you log

00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:57,060
into that control panel or you go into

00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,699
this control panel you go to all these

00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:01,889
different places just like your app is

00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:04,979
one thing but it's it's becoming a

00:05:01,889 --> 00:05:06,710
distributed thing and that didn't make

00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:09,300
sense to me

00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:11,669
applications I feel like have been

00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:13,580
elevated but they've also been

00:05:11,669 --> 00:05:15,210
constrained and

00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:17,699
infrastructure-as-a-service hasn't

00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:19,770
really been helping and as we became

00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:21,330
part of a company that does

00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:23,669
infrastructure as a service I started

00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:26,300
thinking what is what could

00:05:23,669 --> 00:05:29,159
infrastructure as a service look like

00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:31,159
learning the lessons from platform as a

00:05:29,159 --> 00:05:34,589
service learning the lessons that

00:05:31,159 --> 00:05:37,020
applications matter that applications

00:05:34,589 --> 00:05:39,509
can be at the center of something and I

00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:44,669
asked some questions like what happens

00:05:39,509 --> 00:05:48,139
if you could have managed runtime

00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:51,930
containers sitting right next to

00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:55,050
unmanaged once what if you could have

00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:58,169
virtual machines in the same context of

00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:59,639
an app be right next manage virtual

00:05:58,169 --> 00:06:01,949
machines that you can do anything you

00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:04,550
want with configure in tune exactly the

00:06:01,949 --> 00:06:08,969
way you want and that's part of your app

00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:11,960
you're not logging into one place to do

00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:16,520
virtual machines in a different place to

00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:19,319
see if push it's all in the context of

00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:22,529
your application what if your object

00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:25,279
storage in your database was more

00:06:22,529 --> 00:06:27,599
complicated than a simple service and

00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:30,479
isn't a database part of your

00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:34,560
application what if an infrastructure as

00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:37,620
a service was something larger and

00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,750
learned from the lessons of platform as

00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:42,720
a service

00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:45,470
what if Cloud Foundry could teach Amazon

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:48,870
Web Services and VMware a lesson and

00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:50,850
could be reimagined and if any of you

00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:52,800
guys are thinking that that's

00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:54,360
interesting I'd love to talk to you I'd

00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:58,830
love to work on this together

00:06:54,360 --> 00:07:01,530
it's called ctrl C and we've got some

00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:03,300
progress we've got a great company that

00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:06,930
is doing awesome things with Cloud

00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:08,700
Foundry CenturyLink is now one of the is

00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:11,600
on the advisory board for a cloud

00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:14,010
foundry we're committed at Foggs awesome

00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,900
continuing we're doing fantastic stuff

00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:18,180
with platform as a service without fog

00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:19,910
but if anything that I just said makes

00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:23,070
sense to you come find me find

00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:25,080
CenturyLink find out fog love to talk

00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:26,060
thank you so much
