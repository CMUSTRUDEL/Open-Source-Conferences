00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:11,400
so let me talk to you about tools for

00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:13,889
the world we live in today you look at

00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,929
the tools that businesses are using

00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:18,840
today and I'm thinking Microsoft Office

00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:21,810
those tools are mostly there to help you

00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:24,150
create documents small pieces of data on

00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:25,680
PCs and that was pretty much to where

00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,359
MultiPlan worked 30 years ago

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,460
and for the last 30 years things haven't

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,500
changed very much now you fast-forward

00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,050
and you take a look at the world we live

00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,820
in today it's not so much about creation

00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:37,140
of new stuff it's more about curation of

00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,809
stuff just look at the Twitter feed

00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,190
that's been going on lots of retweets

00:00:38,809 --> 00:00:42,180
it's all about documents anymore it's

00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:44,280
about big data

00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:46,170
it's not about pcs anymore it's about

00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,660
mobile devices so essentially we need to

00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:51,239
reinvent the tools of business based

00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,770
upon these three new assumptions that's

00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:53,969
essentially what's Tariq has done and

00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:57,030
we're building that on top of that

00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:58,890
foundry so in the past we had documents

00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,690
in the future we have apps essentially

00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:04,890
we need to be able to turn documents

00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:06,990
into apps in the past we had to pick

00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:09,000
between public deployment or private

00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:12,570
deployment in your data center in the

00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,830
future we go hybrid and this is pretty

00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:15,659
much what we are doing so we turn

00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:18,060
documents into apps what that means is

00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:19,619
that you give us a spreadsheet this is a

00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,080
spreadsheet that came from Excel that I

00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:24,409
put into my drive on Google you go to

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,939
stir it you click on import spreadsheet

00:01:24,409 --> 00:01:29,820
you pick the spreadsheet that you want

00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:31,740
it will run for maybe 10 seconds and it

00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,150
will create an app out of it the way it

00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,250
works is that we look at the spreadsheet

00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:36,930
and we try to extract an object model

00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:38,759
out of it and we do that because we've

00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,200
looked at 24 million spreadsheets all

00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:42,060
the spreadsheets that Google cleaned

00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,009
eggs and we know the ton load about

00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,780
spreadsheets you know how they are cold

00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:48,210
the names of the columns the format's

00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:50,280
pretty much everything so we create a

00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:52,740
object model for it we then put the data

00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,899
into a database in the cloud running on

00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:56,610
cloud foundry then we create an API on

00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:58,469
top of that and on top of that we create

00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:00,950
a user interface which you see here and

00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:03,659
that takes just one click of the mouse

00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:04,950
now that we have an object model if you

00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:06,930
don't like what we've done you just

00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:08,489
click on a column and you can change the

00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:09,959
object model to your heart content so

00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:10,470
you could say for example this field is

00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:12,090
required

00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:13,480
essentially you start building a real

00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:16,129
app from the tool

00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,659
and if you want to see what the object

00:02:16,129 --> 00:02:19,310
model looks like because it's not just

00:02:17,659 --> 00:02:21,019
one sheet when worksheet in the

00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:22,579
spreadsheet it might be multiple of them

00:02:21,019 --> 00:02:24,859
that reference each other with complex

00:02:22,579 --> 00:02:26,900
formulas we also extract an object model

00:02:24,859 --> 00:02:28,219
show it to you there we also keep the

00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,250
formulas for doing that we're

00:02:28,219 --> 00:02:33,019
implementing the full language of

00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:34,819
formulas in Excel in JavaScript because

00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:36,590
we kind of like JavaScript event so it's

00:02:34,819 --> 00:02:38,810
scripting in the web browser we actually

00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:40,159
are not the J's guys and we like it very

00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:42,769
much thank you

00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:45,439
so we reimplemented all the functions of

00:02:42,769 --> 00:02:47,750
Excel there are four not fifty of them

00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:49,849
in JavaScript including all the bugs and

00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:53,000
the bugs are a big deal because well we

00:02:49,849 --> 00:02:54,379
talked about that ramadhir now that we

00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,120
have an object model we can do cool

00:02:54,379 --> 00:02:57,739
things like reverse lookups for example

00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:00,349
so I'm a pilot this is an app that I

00:02:57,739 --> 00:03:02,090
build to track all my flights and I fly

00:03:00,349 --> 00:03:03,709
on different types of airplanes so I can

00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:06,469
see for example all the flights that I

00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:08,540
did on Cessna 172s P on the different

00:03:06,469 --> 00:03:11,299
airplanes that actually flew on that

00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:13,129
comes off free from there because we

00:03:11,299 --> 00:03:14,840
analyze the data we know for example

00:03:13,129 --> 00:03:16,549
with a data's or we know with an

00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,680
addresses that allows me to show the

00:03:16,549 --> 00:03:21,859
airports that I flew it on to an app

00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:23,659
that also can for free or maybe showing

00:03:21,859 --> 00:03:25,489
the flights on a calendar that's another

00:03:23,659 --> 00:03:27,109
perspective that we show you for the

00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:30,349
data so essentially we turn that

00:03:27,109 --> 00:03:31,970
spreadsheet into a full-blown app it's

00:03:30,349 --> 00:03:34,250
also available on mobile devices so we

00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:36,680
create a native app for the different

00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:38,900
platforms out of the schema that we got

00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,340
where you can for example add a fly and

00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,780
because it's a native app you've got

00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:45,500
access to the features of the phone like

00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:47,150
taking pictures from there we add more

00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,949
and more perspectives for example this

00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:51,609
is the one called Gantt that allows you

00:03:48,949 --> 00:03:54,259
to implement a fully functional clone of

00:03:51,609 --> 00:03:55,900
Microsoft Project which is a spreadsheet

00:03:54,259 --> 00:03:58,250
you do that in about five minutes or

00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:00,680
this one is called Kanban that

00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:02,269
essentially gives us the equivalent of a

00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,189
pivotal tracker you might have used

00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:05,720
pivotal tracker that took us a few days

00:04:04,189 --> 00:04:08,780
to build a full clone of people don't

00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:10,519
write you're using stoical this one is

00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:12,709
the mind map that's essentially like

00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:14,959
mind jet 9 manager you turn a

00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:17,690
spreadsheet into a mind mapping tool and

00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,519
it goes on underneath there is a few

00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:21,620
databases including elasticsearch that

00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,090
allows you to do full-text search on

00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:24,770
pretty much everything that you put in

00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:26,490
there and you can connects to it to your

00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:28,050
email to do the same so you

00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:30,389
type of keyword and you've got the

00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:31,560
result across all the objects that are

00:04:30,389 --> 00:04:33,830
in the system so you don't have any

00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:36,150
limitation of the relational databases

00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:37,919
there's analytics there's all kinds of

00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:40,650
cool things and you can even build real

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:44,970
apps so for example we built a fully

00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:46,350
functional functional clone of which is

00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:47,910
called Stack Overflow I'm sure you just

00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:48,389
stack overflow the qns site for

00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:50,460
programmers

00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:52,110
so we built a clone of that including

00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:54,690
the full gamification engine for the

00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:56,130
badges in less than five days and it

00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:57,780
doesn't have to look like the standard

00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:59,610
UI that we have this is engine

00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:02,520
essentially looking very much like Stack

00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:04,229
Overflow so what is it built on it's all

00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:07,349
built on Cloud Foundry we started 18

00:05:04,229 --> 00:05:09,080
months ago and it's JavaScript all the

00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:11,370
way through nodejs on the server

00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:13,740
JavaScript on the client the reason why

00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:15,389
we use javascript is because so far it's

00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:17,400
the only language that's running on both

00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:20,340
sides that allows me to run the entire

00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:22,500
stoical server on my phone so that I can

00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:25,050
go offline right so you can have the

00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,849
full business logic of the platform put

00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:28,710
it on your phone go offline work on the

00:05:26,849 --> 00:05:30,120
data set that you want then you can back

00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:32,780
online and it will synchronize

00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:35,130
everything together on the back end it's

00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:37,440
working with multiple data stores both

00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:39,210
sequel and the sequel the primary data

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,250
store is elasticsearch so that it can

00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:43,639
scale today we're running the system

00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:46,650
with about a terabyte of structured data

00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:48,750
and by the middle of next year we should

00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:50,820
be able on a hundred terabyte the goal

00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:54,270
is by 2015 to the most ready to a

00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:55,949
petabyte welcome that later one of the

00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:58,169
apps that we built on top of stoic or

00:05:55,949 --> 00:06:00,030
we're actually finishing that is a

00:05:58,169 --> 00:06:01,349
virtual drive and it's one of the apps

00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:03,090
that you might be interested in if

00:06:01,349 --> 00:06:05,490
you're a bad to deploy or you already

00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:07,199
deployed cloud foundry one of the apps

00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:09,270
that you might want to give to your user

00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:12,030
is an equivalent of Dropbox or Google

00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:13,620
Drive that stores the file in your data

00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:17,070
center that's essentially what we've

00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:19,590
done plus the ability to map external

00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:23,630
public drives such as Dropbox on to

00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:25,889
subfolders of your private drive and

00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:28,229
this is all built on Cloud Foundry plus

00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:31,020
about 95 libraries javascript libraries

00:06:28,229 --> 00:06:34,259
over with being an open source if you

00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:36,090
want it pricing $25 per month for a

00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:38,430
gigabyte compare that to frost dot-com

00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:40,320
which is $2,000 compare that to intuit

00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:42,210
QuickBase which is 25

00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:44,520
for a gigabyte of structured data per

00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:46,230
month that matters because if you want

00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:48,480
to go Big Data and I'm sure many of you

00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:50,550
want to do that if you look at the

00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:53,220
pricing per year in twin Queen base will

00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:55,410
cost you a quarter of a billion dollars

00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:57,690
every year for a terabyte think about it

00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:59,250
you want to go petabyte well that's

00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:02,250
essentially a quarter of a trillion

00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:06,420
which is about the GDP of Singapore and

00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:10,200
160 countries after them so if you're a

00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:12,750
petabyte just give us a call and so far

00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:16,550
you can buy it also on the store go to

00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:18,630
store comm stic comm thank you very much

00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:21,769
