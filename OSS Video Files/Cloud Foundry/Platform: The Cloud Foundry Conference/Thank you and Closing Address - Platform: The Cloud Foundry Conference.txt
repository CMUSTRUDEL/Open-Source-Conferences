I'm so I'm Rodney I was at thunder of

00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:14,910
pivotal labs pivotal labs was acquired

00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:18,560
by iam speak AMC and and now we're spun

00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:23,670
out again into pivotal of all things and

00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:26,310
and I have more to do now than I used to

00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:28,949
so first off I just wanted to thank

00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:31,679
everyone for coming this was this was

00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:34,739
really a lot of hard work put on by

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:37,469
Michaels you heard and James and a lot

00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:39,270
of folks from from pivotal a lot of

00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:42,420
other folks from IBM and another

00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:44,160
companies too and so thanks to everyone

00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,899
who put it on put it together thanks for

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,300
all of you for coming out I I think the

00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:49,559
energy here has been tremendous and I

00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,090
know all of you feel that everyone's

00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:54,840
been talking about the buzz and so I'm

00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:57,090
really excited about all that so before

00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:02,399
I go I'm just gonna say a few few short

00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:05,729
things about about openness and about

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:10,500
about sharing so I was raised in an IBM

00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:17,070
family my dad worked in storage of all

00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:18,689
places for 35 years at IBM I had a

00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:20,790
scholarship to college from IBM because

00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:23,130
I was you know the child of an IBM or

00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:26,520
this is a really great thing they do and

00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:28,920
if you're just sort of medium ok in

00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,150
school it's like here will help you out

00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,619
so it's really cool at least they used

00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:38,130
to do that I don't they do that anymore

00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:41,070
probably not I got lucky and and then I

00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:42,360
worked in internships at IBM and went

00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,500
and worked in their Tokyo Research Lab

00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,780
and did all kinds of cool things that

00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,299
you know I probably shouldn't have

00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,890
shouldn't have been doing but um but it

00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:54,329
was all because I was in an IBM family

00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:56,930
and so you know in the 90s my dad was

00:01:54,329 --> 00:02:00,899
talking a lot about a company called EMC

00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:02,390
because my dad was in storage and 1990

00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:04,409
along comes this company called the EMC

00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:08,580
suddenly upsetting everything was

00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:10,349
unassailable IBM thing and and I just

00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,060
remember he used to say they're fierce

00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:15,570
competitors

00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:19,290
fierce competitors absolutely fierce

00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:21,030
competition so you know at that time I

00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:23,910
had already started pivotal labs and one

00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:28,860
of the things that I never did with

00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:31,380
pivotal was compete I just never thought

00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:34,440
about it I thought let's just do things

00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:37,890
well and it'll work out furthermore

00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:39,480
let's open the door right for all of our

00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:41,790
competitors and all the people we do

00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:44,130
business with let them come in teach

00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:46,920
them everything we know share learn from

00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:50,270
them and the philosophy being it'll come

00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:53,670
back and the result of that was

00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:56,040
tremendous it came back tenfold had all

00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:57,209
kinds of companies you know once we had

00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,700
some success there were smaller

00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:02,070
companies that actually said proudly

00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:03,360
that they were mini pivotal and I

00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:05,850
thought that was the greatest compliment

00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,410
that we'd ever received and for all of

00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:08,670
those companies we didn't compete with

00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:10,920
them but we brought them into the fold

00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:14,820
talking what we knew sent them business

00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:16,590
and they went out and evangelized for us

00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:18,900
and they told everyone how cool pivotal

00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:20,400
labs was and and they you know they

00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,690
would they would talk about our process

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,549
and talk about what we did and they'd

00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:26,160
send business our way and they they grew

00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:28,049
the community for us so all of that

00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:34,320
sharing and all of that openness made a

00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:36,870
huge huge difference so now with cloud

00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:39,690
foundry I have the chance to do that

00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:42,090
again alright so it's all about the

00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:45,900
openness and cloud sound rate foundry is

00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:47,730
open source it's open infrastructure and

00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,860
there's one more thing that I want to

00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:51,690
mention is that we have an open door and

00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:53,549
this is something that you guys have

00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:57,600
heard about something we call open dojo

00:03:53,549 --> 00:03:59,280
but really it's for those partners and

00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,950
infrastructure providers and customers

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:05,130
and developers who want to come and work

00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:07,290
with us you can walk through the door at

00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:10,200
pivotal labs and I mean literally walk

00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:14,130
through the door and come and sit and

00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:16,290
work with us and join the team so we

00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:20,010
want to really put the open into open

00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:22,830
source with this project and I think

00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:24,090
that you know if you want to talk about

00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,910
this you can talk to any of the people

00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:26,320
wearing the pivotal

00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:28,420
shirts they can they can tell you about

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:34,450
it excuse me the Cloud Foundry shirts

00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:35,140
the platform shirt but it's something

00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:36,460
it's something that we're really excited

00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:40,780
about and it's something that people are

00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:44,350
participating in in particular iBM is

00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:45,610
too participating in this and you know

00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,930
so it's it's something that's really

00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:48,280
really exciting to me to be able to

00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:51,040
collaborate so much with other companies

00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:53,620
and to go from IBM family to its

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,330
fiercest competitor EMC and now come

00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:56,770
back and collaborate with IBM and have

00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:59,460
them co-sponsor something like this

00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:02,710
along with lots of other great companies

00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:03,550
and so rather than being fierce

00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:05,590
competitors

00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:08,080
I'd like to leave you with a phrase that

00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:12,760
I think should inspire this community

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:14,110
which is fierce collaboration it's not

00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:17,120
about the competition it's about the

00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:24,439
collaboration thanks a lot

00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:24,439
[Applause]

00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:32,720
