[Music]

00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:10,170
yeah so I've been working on that cloud

00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,420
friend it was actually a codename

00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:16,350
internally was a plaid it started in a

00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:18,510
2009 I joined in in early 2010 and and

00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:22,949
then we launched it in 2011 so I don't

00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:24,539
know how many of you around then and so

00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:26,490
I'm still the entire foundry it feels

00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:28,800
like an eternity frankly at this point

00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:30,660
but today's happy day I work for a

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,740
public company so all of you read that

00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,600
raise your hands when you're done

00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:39,840
reading it says we might not do what I

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:40,770
say we might do okay thank you so I'm

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,800
going to tell you a little bit about

00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:45,059
pivotal CF today and and so you know

00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,090
it'll give you a little background right

00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:49,079
so when we started higher parenting when

00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,399
I joined the group so it was really

00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:53,070
small as six people or something like

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,840
that it was a small effort and and we

00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:57,469
knew kind of ballpark what we wanted to

00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:03,210
do right and we're ballpark there now

00:00:57,469 --> 00:01:05,100
but um and so we we kind of worked away

00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,689
at it and we did a kind of quiet public

00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,340
launch than we did a public launch and

00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:11,070
we keep but what we really wanted to do

00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:13,110
and we're working at VMware right was

00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,520
how do we get this to VMware's customers

00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,290
and VMware is a lot of customers or eve

00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,090
like order magnitude like several

00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:20,280
hundred thousand customers tens of

00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:22,380
millions of VMs on vSphere it's a big

00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,820
you know scale at organization right we

00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,770
wanted to take advantage of that and so

00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,110
what we really wanted to do was give

00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:30,060
them software that they could run

00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:32,250
in-house right and you know kind of

00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,170
obvious right turned out to be really

00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:38,009
hard right so I've talked about it

00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:39,869
publicly a lot right I have not yet been

00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:42,450
able to show a demo of that product

00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:44,360
because I didn't have one so I tweeted a

00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:47,040
demo video the pivotal guys put together

00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:49,500
just before I started so if you got my

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,700
Twitter handle there if you check that

00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,310
out and I'll tweet it again just

00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:55,409
afterwards of a demo video we put

00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:58,079
together of this product installing on

00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:59,939
vSphere it takes a the demo videos are

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,590
about four and a half minutes so that's

00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:03,350
one of those sort of cooking show demos

00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:06,180
right it takes about an hour to install

00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:08,310
and it's something that we were working

00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,950
on as I said for a long time when we

00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:12,160
spun Cloud Foundry out into a pivotal

00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:13,750
you know which

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,580
we continue to work with pivotal on

00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:17,470
doing that right and making making this

00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:20,650
great product and so going to ship of

00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:22,690
this year and first version the first

00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:25,090
version and and it'll target vSphere and

00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:27,370
and our infrastructure as a service we

00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:29,650
play at hybrid service and undoubtedly

00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:31,540
pivotal will target and wonderful lots

00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:33,490
of other platforms as well over time but

00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:35,140
I'm for right now this is what we're

00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:37,410
focused on from the VMware point of view

00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:40,060
and mostly focused on the enterprise IT

00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:41,680
developer and development right so it's

00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:43,450
not particularly focused initially at

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:49,060
least at huge public clouds it's this

00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:50,830
this kind of target developer and so so

00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:53,590
what is it well it comes as a it comes

00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:55,930
as a virtual appliance the pivotal CF VM

00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:59,140
which you run on top of your vSphere or

00:02:55,930 --> 00:03:01,150
vGHS infrastructure and so that

00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:03,850
basically a proprietary thing a package

00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:05,800
right but it contains them it contains a

00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,880
bunch of of open source code it contains

00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,150
the code from the open source project

00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:11,440
and so you know the first thing you do

00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:12,850
deploy it and then give it tell it about

00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,250
your infrastructure as a service so in

00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:17,170
the case of a vSphere this is a

00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:19,300
screenshot of it you can see your

00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:20,770
vSphere thing on the left there and you

00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:23,710
just go ahead and configure that and you

00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:25,270
basically give it your your credentials

00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:26,950
right so in the case of vSphere you're

00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:29,620
telling it you know here's how you log

00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:32,080
in to V Center and do stuff give it

00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:33,790
things like network configuration you

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,670
know an interesting thing it's actually

00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:38,800
turns out its source of a lots of fun

00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:40,390
inside of large enterprises getting IP

00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:44,110
addresses that are don't conflict with

00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:45,490
other things so so give it these kind of

00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:47,440
credentials so that it's going to be

00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:48,910
able to go start installing VM so it

00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,810
actually goes and creates VMs and so

00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:55,390
forth so when once you've done that that

00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:56,590
M virtual appliance starts to create VMs

00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:58,870
and the first one it creates is called

00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:00,760
micro Bosh right so those of you

00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:02,290
familiar with the project you know mosh

00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:05,790
and micro Bosh is essentially a single

00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:09,040
virtual machine version of Bosh and so

00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:11,710
and what we're gonna do is use that to

00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,920
deploy Cloud Foundry so Bosh is open

00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:16,600
source and and basically before we even

00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,310
start deploying and so on you've told us

00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,600
about how big you want your cloud run do

00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:20,770
we actually go ahead and validate make

00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,540
sure the networks are there that you

00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:24,700
said the storage make sure there's

00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:25,510
enough capacity so a bunch of things one

00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,280
of the

00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:28,540
the for those of you who've actually

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,340
tried to deploy Cloud Foundry from

00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:33,100
open-source you know that there's lots

00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:34,980
of them lots of ditches between here and

00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:37,270
there's they say in Ireland right and so

00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:38,830
one thing is running out of capacity and

00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:41,020
it's not like the logs say oh you're out

00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:43,330
of capacity right and the logs say

00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:46,600
something completely incomprehensible so

00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:48,430
um so this is it deploying right so now

00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,830
you're asking my kibosh to go ahead and

00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:53,050
start deploying and here's the beautiful

00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:54,880
and status update I gotta say by the way

00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:57,460
the pivotal guys do a fantastic job

00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,890
right don't they so the the beautiful UI

00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:01,780
and and a fantastic user experience and

00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:04,000
this so it works its way down through

00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:06,190
the list of different actions and

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,310
different activities to go ahead and

00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:11,800
deploy a Cloud Foundry right and so

00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:14,350
you've told us during the initial stages

00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,460
how big you wanted to be so how many Das

00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:17,380
and flight controllers and all the

00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:19,450
different things that you want and and

00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:22,030
so we go ahead and use micro Bosh to

00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:23,320
deploy cloud foundry and put the

00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,670
developer console on there right in the

00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,410
developer console is essentially a

00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:30,760
customized version of what you get on

00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:32,350
run octavio right so again a fantastic

00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:34,810
piece of work from from the pivotal guys

00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:36,340
ok so at this point you can run user

00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:38,110
applications right you have a running

00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:41,290
Cloud Foundry it took us about an hour

00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:42,790
to do this and obviously depending on

00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:45,670
the size but that's about right so you

00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:47,710
can deploy user applications and so you

00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:48,910
should be able to use it away right but

00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:52,930
of course at some point you're gonna

00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:55,840
want to update it and so it's pretty

00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:59,380
simple mechanism right to upgrade your

00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:01,450
version of 7cf basically replaced the

00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:03,010
virtual appliance right now if you just

00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:05,290
did that it wouldn't know about the

00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:07,030
existing installation so essentially

00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:08,380
there's a mechanism to export the config

00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:10,030
and important right so you're moving

00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:12,220
your configuration from one to the other

00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:14,770
and so now the new one knows all about

00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:16,000
the existing installation right so and

00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:17,320
then it'll offer you to check all the

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,340
versions and so on and offer you an

00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:23,770
opportunity to update it for services so

00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:25,630
we do have some stuff in the box and the

00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:28,120
the pivotal guys are working hard and I

00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:30,820
think MySQL is in the screenshot there

00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:33,520
and in the demo and I'll let James tell

00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:35,530
you about anything else so there is some

00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,150
stuff in the Box what you know I've been

00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:38,110
talking to big enterprises about this

00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:39,850
for a long time and

00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:41,890
have all my various other colleagues in

00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:43,780
this world and a lot of the enterprises

00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:46,330
are always pretty much said hey we

00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:49,120
already run Oracle or sequel server

00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:51,490
whatever it is we run stuff right and so

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,920
what we really want is access to to

00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:55,420
those existing services and so that is a

00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:57,490
use case that we expect to see a lot of

00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:59,410
right and we call either provided

00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:01,090
services in the the cloud foundry world

00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:01,960
they may named I had a really terrible

00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:04,260
name for it

00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:06,970
what I call it a service broker I think

00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:09,390
service connector then yeah some user

00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:12,160
provided services like proper marketing

00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:13,900
so named people can understand and so

00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,480
that's what's happening here at the

00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:18,270
bottom right is is basically making it

00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:20,710
easy for you to connect your existing

00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:22,720
services so maybe an existing Oracle

00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:25,270
database - Cloud Foundry and what we

00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,190
what we do there is essentially and you

00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:30,040
you tell us about the connection string

00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:32,560
for Oracle whatever it is right so IP

00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:34,480
address port number database name user

00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,610
ID and password right and we'll present

00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:38,680
that information to your application in

00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:41,290
the same way as we would present it if

00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:44,650
you had created that database using a

00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:46,990
built in service okay so that lets you

00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:48,760
not build in production credentials in

00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:50,740
your source code and lets you leverage

00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:52,570
the existing mechanisms without having

00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:55,950
to with with while being able to use the

00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:59,380
services you already have on Prem okay

00:07:55,950 --> 00:08:00,550
all right that's what we're doing at the

00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:03,910
moment is where we're hardening

00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:06,070
hardening the V cloud CPI and for for

00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:08,530
Bosh right and so that basically means

00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:11,290
that's to allow us to deploy on top of

00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:13,270
the viet lat hybrid service or and and

00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:14,560
and make that work well right and so we

00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:17,200
have actually had this an open source

00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,390
for a while I don't think we at least

00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,590
hadn't used it in anger up until now so

00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:22,840
we're doing that right now

00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:24,430
and and actually I'm just if anybody

00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:26,410
else is interested in working with us on

00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:28,300
that and right now we think it's pretty

00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:30,340
good but we'd love other people to try

00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:32,740
it out and tell us that or otherwise um

00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:34,000
because obviously that's much better so

00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:37,150
we'd love to work with anybody else

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:41,229
who's interest in that area obviously um

00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:42,910
so vSphere provides really reliable

00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:45,190
underlying virtualized infrastructure so

00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:46,960
using a che a DRS and these various

00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:49,270
other facilities and the hypervisor so

00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,180
obviously we are making sure that all of

00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:51,529
those will work well

00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,670
the context of this cloud family

00:08:51,529 --> 00:08:55,100
deployment right and we can take

00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:56,540
advantage of it so ultimately that's

00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,649
just trying to make us stable and

00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:01,399
installation of Cloud Foundry as

00:08:57,649 --> 00:09:03,020
possible where we go next is basically

00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:04,790
continue to integrate with some of our

00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:07,100
other products so for example we have a

00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:07,610
log management product log inside SRM

00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,680
4dr

00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:12,770
things like that right and I think you

00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,970
know it fairly probably pretty obvious

00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:16,420
the kind of things that we would do

00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:19,130
there to integrate it across the board

00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:22,730
for more broadly for Cloud Foundry

00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:24,110
though um you know and I think there's

00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:25,850
some really interesting stuff coming up

00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:28,010
and and from a technology point of view

00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:31,880
but there's also like why would you care

00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:33,410
right and the use cases so to me I'm one

00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:35,240
of the things I've wanted to do with

00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:36,200
tile foundry is and we've all been

00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,240
trying to do for a long time as

00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:41,000
proliferated right so we open sourced it

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,500
we set up the the service the path

00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,230
service the public service made it free

00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:48,260
lots of people got to use it right and

00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:50,330
to me packaging it that'll help a lot

00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:51,830
and don't net will help a lot right and

00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:53,990
so I'm very very enthusiastic about

00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:55,580
getting it into cloud foundry a lot of

00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:57,440
the people we talked to they want to use

00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:59,660
it for you know first for a tier 2 & 3

00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,980
apps they want to use it for various

00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:02,240
other kind windows apps and so on they

00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:03,890
basically want to use it in context

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,540
where Windows is important to them and

00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:07,250
to me also Microsoft kind of gifted us

00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:11,029
the opportunity to do a really good net

00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:12,050
pass um so thank you so I kind of want

00:10:11,029 --> 00:10:13,370
to take advantage of that because

00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:16,700
they're not in the habit of handing out

00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:18,770
those opportunities um I'll skip at the

00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:22,430
end just for a second distributed

00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:24,620
key-value store everything really useful

00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:28,700
and I think Kathy had entailment and

00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:30,650
identity as a service the the first use

00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:32,270
case here active active deployment right

00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:34,010
so starting to see some of that and that

00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:36,079
is where people run active active and

00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:38,540
multiple data centers I've seen it in in

00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:42,140
several of our more sophisticated users

00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:44,779
or customers of Cloud Foundry um and so

00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:47,329
there's distributed stores important for

00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:48,260
that but I think so I don't know how

00:10:47,329 --> 00:10:50,740
many of you know what Software Defined

00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:52,430
Networking means it's it's basically a

00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:53,390
technology that allows you to build

00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:55,310
networks on top of your existing

00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:57,829
networks and the new ones are completely

00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:59,089
logical so just to give you an example

00:10:57,829 --> 00:11:01,390
one thing you could do is create a

00:10:59,089 --> 00:11:03,460
network that your app runs on and

00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:04,900
it's its services its databases and no

00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:06,760
other app is running on that network

00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:08,260
it's a logical network so that lets you

00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:10,270
do things like multicast maybe between

00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:12,880
nodes of the app which lets you do

00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:15,310
clustering right so there's some pretty

00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:18,790
it's obviously also a secure useful for

00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:21,130
security so Sdn is a I think it's got

00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:23,380
really interesting uses in isolation and

00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:24,850
security and also I'm kind of intrigued

00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:26,170
us that what will happen around active

00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,670
active right can you stretch your

00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:28,270
network across datacenters does that

00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:29,710
make sense

00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:31,750
do we stretch an instance of Cloud

00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:36,280
Foundry across datacenters right and

00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:38,980
does that make sense right the mobile

00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:41,260
apps is I think an obvious and great fit

00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:43,030
for Cloud Foundry right and we're tight

00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:45,880
around really becomes an API server

00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:47,740
right so you build api's on the backend

00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,540
and run them on Cloud Foundry scale them

00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:51,550
independently and something I actually

00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:53,440
haven't seen yet is people using Cloud

00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:56,020
Foundry as a packaging mechanism for

00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,840
on-prem software I'm kind of I'm kind of

00:11:56,020 --> 00:12:00,610
wondering if if and when that'll happen

00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:02,110
if you're an ISP excuse me that would

00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:03,640
give you a quite an interesting

00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:05,110
opportunity to maybe scale your

00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:07,510
application and provide standardized

00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:10,210
mechanisms for ingress and egress and so

00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:11,770
on for for your application and give you

00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:14,710
a kind of a stable platform to deploy on

00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:16,240
leverage the work that the pivotal team

00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:17,530
had found routine we're doing to make

00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,770
Cloud Foundry work well on lots of

00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:22,810
different infrastructures security I

00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:25,090
think they addressed it already around

00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:27,010
Sdn though I think was Kathy who

00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:29,110
mentioned identity for me identity as a

00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:31,360
service especially an enterprise it

00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:33,730
seems strikingly useful right not many

00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,740
enterprise guys using oauth2 and things

00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:37,960
like that yet and they generally have

00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:39,340
Active Directory and so to me this seems

00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:41,140
like a really great place for us to

00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:42,700
inject some of the newer web

00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:45,610
technologies into enterprise their

00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:46,600
development use cases the last one you

00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:49,810
know something I've been talking about a

00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:52,330
long time really is is just doing using

00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:54,490
Cloud Foundry as an analytics platform

00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:56,020
and you know hopefully that the pivotal

00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:57,640
guys will come out with something much

00:12:56,020 --> 00:13:00,100
tougher than anything I'm talking about

00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:02,860
here but you know I think about things

00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:04,780
like our as a as a language platform in

00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:07,420
cloud foundry right and can you use that

00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:09,550
as an allylic platform to use Hadoop as

00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:11,650
a service or MapReduce as a service in

00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:13,870
some form various other analytic

00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:16,190
services so I think there's a set of

00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:20,060
really interesting things

00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:21,560
that we could do and and make a well

00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:23,060
open up some new use cases for tight

00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:25,970
render because right now it's kind of a

00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:27,590
webby right it's mostly used for h2

00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:33,160
serving HTTP requests and that's about

00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:33,160
it so that's it for me

00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:44,250
