00:00:05,509 --> 00:00:11,309
so yeah I'm teach you have active States

00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:12,960
been around since 97 you made know

00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:16,139
things like active pearl and active

00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,810
Python nowadays a lot of our focus is on

00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:21,779
staccato platform-as-a-service

00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:23,010
all built on Cloud Foundry and I'm going

00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:26,670
to talk a little bit about the path

00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:29,880
staccato bit about how it differentiates

00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:34,380
builds upon Cloud Foundry and where we

00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:35,969
are so just a bit of the timeline we

00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,989
were actually building something we

00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:42,390
called it multi pass and the prior to

00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:47,070
cloud foundries announcement and in

00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:50,550
April 2011 evaluated it made a quick

00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:53,129
pivot and then started with a whole new

00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,719
product named staccato and you can see

00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:56,129
going through pretty mad development

00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,570
cycle that actually is missing a whole

00:00:56,129 --> 00:01:02,160
bunch of releases it was basically every

00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:03,719
30 to 60 days new versions and it's

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,510
great you know building on top of Cloud

00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:08,670
Foundry we've been able to make a whole

00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:12,300
brand new seven figure business and

00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:13,729
growing with customers in finance

00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:17,909
[Music]

00:01:13,729 --> 00:01:19,320
high-tech and defense and it's pass is

00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:20,220
definitely getting very interesting and

00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,890
I want to talk a little bit about

00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:26,549
staccato 3.0 which is going to be coming

00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:27,750
soon but first you know there's there's

00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:30,680
a lot of features we're talking about

00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:33,450
and you'll want to show a few of these

00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:36,930
you might recognize them as we talk

00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:38,820
about them in cfv - well they're all

00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:41,909
about the right timeframe for actually

00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:44,490
they all were first seen in staccato so

00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:47,430
micro cloud Linux containers that was

00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:51,180
way in 2011 for us groups now called

00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:53,549
orgs and cfv - so we like to you know

00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,920
affectionately think that's v2 is kind

00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:58,409
of like staccato v1 we appreciate

00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:03,780
everything that's been built up but we

00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:07,200
were one of the original youth partners

00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:09,660
with the Python tech community lead

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,599
and you know those who've worked in the

00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:14,700
v1 ecosystem it while it was open source

00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:16,650
it wasn't particularly open so we're

00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:20,310
looking forward to a lot more engagement

00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:23,099
in the v2 ecosystem so again looking

00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:25,290
mostly were recognized what it that's

00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:28,980
pretty close to what you would see for a

00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:30,690
Cloud Foundry diagram this one that has

00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:33,540
a few features in it that are specific

00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:37,170
to staccato but you know again some of

00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:38,790
the features oh and the next one there

00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:41,690
on the list the staccato client yeah

00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:44,760
single file executable Windows Mac Linux

00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:48,450
thanks guys for realizing nobody likes

00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:50,180
rubygems Komodo integration which is our

00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:54,480
ID either as already Eclipse integration

00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:58,530
Komodo is one of the primary IDE s for

00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:01,739
PHP Python Perl Ruby users then you get

00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:04,650
some extra features there SSH and DB

00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:06,590
shell application access staging and

00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:08,760
runtime hooks support for cron

00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:11,069
management console persistent file

00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:13,410
system service log yard it's essentially

00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:16,049
a logger Gator except we're probably at

00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:18,750
a v2 version of it by now

00:03:16,049 --> 00:03:21,750
centralized cluster management ports as

00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:23,760
a service something that replaces UA a

00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:26,130
because I think that most people who've

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,380
had to instantiate UA a would love

00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:31,530
anything that replaces it oracle DB

00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:32,760
provisioner stuff like that what I

00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:35,310
really want to talk about though is

00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:37,440
staccato v3 so I mean that's all there

00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:40,370
right now let's look a little bit about

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:44,579
what's coming so a few new things in the

00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:47,870
the console is there's new dashboards so

00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:50,790
these are completely real-time using our

00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:53,190
rewritten router for high performance

00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:56,400
it's all WebSocket use the speedy things

00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:59,519
like that this is you know interactive

00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:02,250
will bounce around those little gauges

00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:04,170
if you're hammering the system app store

00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:06,590
in there which didn't mention but again

00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:09,900
you can you know push button for Jenkins

00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:14,280
Bugzilla whatever you want to do out of

00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:16,769
the box then one of the biggest features

00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,659
is to caught a timeline you kind of

00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:20,850
think of it maybe it's chatter but for

00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:22,200
path systems

00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:24,930
and it's basically the difference

00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:27,690
between you know git and github right

00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:29,670
get great you put your sources in it but

00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:31,230
everyone likes github because oh look I

00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:33,630
can comment exactly on this particular

00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:35,580
line of code or hey I want to make a

00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:37,890
pull request well in the staccato

00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:39,720
timeline you can actually say oh there's

00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:42,920
a pushed application oh I need to make a

00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,920
comment oh you didn't set these

00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:46,860
environments and other things like that

00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:49,350
and you can see in the picture on the

00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,970
left right whichever one it is you know

00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:54,840
two people having a discussion around an

00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:58,380
application all that's done real-time so

00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:00,360
a few more things about v3 you know

00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:02,040
we're around I'm around you can always

00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:05,280
find me so just in order to keep this

00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:10,860
quick I won't read these off but there's

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:11,970
plenty more coming and so want to get

00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:15,090
the last part the Cloud Foundry

00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:18,360
ecosystem so one thing to note is

00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:20,400
staccato v3 is based on the CF v2 trunk

00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,500
so we are working right off the head now

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:26,010
and obviously we have a vested interest

00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:27,630
in the strong ecosystem and you know I

00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:30,540
must say I'm I'm really encouraged by

00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:33,060
some of the the way pivotal really

00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:35,910
opened things up from where VMware had

00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:38,850
it stuck in building a real actual open

00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:40,950
ecosystem but I do think this really

00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:42,390
needs to extend to design as well as bug

00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:44,700
fixes it's nice to be able to make a

00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:47,250
pull request for anybody but there's a

00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:50,250
lot of aspects of design that you know

00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:53,100
did more than one company should be

00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:54,900
talking about and that model of open

00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:57,660
governance is important you know there's

00:05:54,900 --> 00:06:00,030
Oracle claims open governance so does

00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:02,670
the Apache Software Foundation but they

00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:04,680
totally go about it in different ways so

00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:09,450
that was a quick sneak peek of staccato

00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:10,840
v3 and with that say thanks

00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:14,350
[Applause]

00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,350
