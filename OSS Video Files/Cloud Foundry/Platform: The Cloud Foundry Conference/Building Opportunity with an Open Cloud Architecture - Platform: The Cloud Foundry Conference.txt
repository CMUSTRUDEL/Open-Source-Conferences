as we go through this all right

00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:42,059
look we are living in an incredible time

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,770
right now it is a renaissance occurring

00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:47,309
all around this I mean you guys feel it

00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:48,809
you feel the vibe in the IT industry you

00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:50,969
know obviously there's a credible vibe

00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:52,559
around Cloud Foundry no clown around you

00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:54,449
know platform-as-a-service but in

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:57,059
general we are going through an IT

00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:58,949
renaissance and it's is simply amazing I

00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:00,989
mean you know Paul talked about this

00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:03,149
yesterday towards the end and and who

00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:05,790
you know I assume most of you were here

00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:07,860
yesterday right by the way uh Chris

00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:09,780
you're here James James may or may not

00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:12,840
James you here how you feeling that good

00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:15,360
good excellent excellent James is

00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:19,619
working hard last night he was he was

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:23,159
working with Johnny Johnny Walker so so

00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:26,159
I didn't work with Johnny last night so

00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:29,280
I'm good and you know these guys pulled

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,750
off an amazing event it's it's truly

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,880
historic because I really do believe

00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:35,040
that this is going to help change the

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,840
industry moving forward you know speed

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,579
is the new currency developing

00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,140
applications quicker is extremely

00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:42,899
extremely important this technology

00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,549
helps you do that so feel good you know

00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:45,720
take a breath feel good this is the

00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:48,659
first of I guess we're gonna have

00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:51,270
another one to two a year six weeks

00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:53,450
James ed yeah and I'm also told that the

00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:55,920
next conference is going to be in Maui

00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:59,009
so this is excellent

00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,049
no I'm kidding I'm joking I don't know I

00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:04,380
don't know where you're going to be but

00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:06,570
over the past twelve months there's been

00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:10,349
over 700 developers contributing code

00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:13,080
there's been over five hundred thousand

00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:13,500
lines of code written twenty thousand

00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,480
commits

00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:18,030
it's truly truly amazing so we should

00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:21,360
feel good as a community about what

00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:23,070
we've done but fun's over let's think

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,230
about the reality that we're in just

00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:27,090
think about our clients let's understand

00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:29,340
the folks that we serve what they're

00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:31,050
trying to deal with the applications

00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:33,480
that we're building the infrastructure

00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:36,270
that we need to scale and provide them

00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,590
right there are literally billions of

00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:40,050
physical assets out there with

00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:42,110
intelligence that will connect in some

00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:44,700
way to our applications right

00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:47,160
smartphones billions of smart I own

00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,720
about five different smart phones just

00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,040
me that's not my daughter or my wife

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,160
it's just me

00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:55,080
right the traffic the i-ight there's a

00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,690
shift in how Internet traffic is

00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:00,920
occurring right - more cloud base and

00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:03,830
then in light of all this you have a

00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:06,240
continued threat around cyberattacks and

00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:08,010
security and all these other realities

00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,630
that we need to face this is what our

00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:11,790
clients are telling us this is are the

00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:15,330
things that we need to worry about so on

00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:17,570
one end you need to create a platform to

00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:20,190
create an open architecture for cloud

00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:23,480
that allows you to address these things

00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:27,239
but also deliver the new currency speed

00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:30,630
right interesting challenge right if we

00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:32,459
want all of these markets or all of

00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:35,640
these technologies things like social

00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:38,100
mobile big data to succeed in the

00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:40,080
marketplace we have to deliver this new

00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:42,600
platform we have to deliver on cloud if

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,370
we don't these other markets won't be

00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:47,400
able to the scale won't be able to

00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:50,250
handle it so feel good about where we

00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,959
are but also have a dose of reality of

00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:54,390
what we need to accomplish moving

00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:56,910
forward and there's something really

00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:59,160
really important that will make this

00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:01,620
work and I think it's really culture and

00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:03,750
people so let me ask you a couple

00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,620
questions so I know it's early it's 9:00

00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:09,090
in the morning by the way

00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:10,650
James NFL kickoff was yesterday I mean I

00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:12,180
was here as having a great time

00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:15,090
I'm not gonna lie I was on ESPN

00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:17,040
SportsCenter watching you know Hut's

00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:18,359
let's try not to do it at the beginning

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,340
of the NFL season

00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:25,330
I got a fantasy football league

00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:29,889
stressful you know what we're talking

00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:31,060
about oh all right people people so how

00:04:29,889 --> 00:04:33,940
many folks here are application

00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:36,070
developers develop apps how many folks

00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:38,350
are say line of business people people

00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:40,840
think about a couple of those okay how

00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:43,300
many folks our platform engineers data

00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,220
you know data centers all right yeah you

00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:49,330
love the network right that's right baby

00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:52,720
okay look all of you answered the

00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:56,860
question incorrectly yes because to

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:58,840
succeed in this new world you need to

00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:01,600
develop t-shaped skills you can't just

00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:03,880
be a data platform engineering person

00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,640
you can't just be an application

00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:08,320
developer you can't just be a line of

00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:10,000
business over here in the front a line

00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,890
of business person you need to

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,640
understand how technology can help you

00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:14,260
that's why you're here

00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:16,030
how acknowledge II can help you do more

00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:18,100
but technologists need to understand

00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:19,330
what you're doing ok so everyone's

00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:21,430
talking about we're hiring

00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:22,900
yeah we're hiring alright but you got to

00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:24,430
make sure you hire the right people the

00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:27,550
people who understand the scope and the

00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:29,440
context that they're in ok that's the

00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:31,030
change that's going on right in the

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,860
industry in addition to the Renaissance

00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:36,669
or on my team so I'm gonna try to ground

00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:39,669
what I say into three easy pieces ok the

00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:41,680
first one is as we look at contributing

00:05:39,669 --> 00:05:44,860
to cloud foundry as we look at growing

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:47,410
the ecosystem as we look at building

00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:48,419
applications continue to push on the art

00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:52,240
of the possible

00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:54,850
relentless reinvention don't be tied to

00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,460
models of the past use those learn and

00:05:54,850 --> 00:06:00,700
move forward the second is ground what

00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:04,479
we do in use cases and I got to tell you

00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:06,669
one of the beachhead use cases for a lot

00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:08,350
of what I see in this whole platform as

00:06:06,669 --> 00:06:10,990
a service area is frankly mobile

00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:12,490
analytics systems of engagement type

00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:15,820
applications and I'll talk about that in

00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:18,220
a moment but in the end whether your

00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:19,870
user the technology so what I would

00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:21,910
consider a client or person who's

00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:24,100
building the technology you need to

00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:26,680
understand that it is important to have

00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:27,910
a dynamic cloud strategy what that means

00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,800
is you need to have an open architecture

00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:31,960
from top to bottom

00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,210
you need to have interoperability you

00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:36,270
need to have freedom of choice

00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:39,330
why right what why do you need to have

00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:42,270
those things it's not because I'm a I

00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:43,320
love peace and happiness and joy to the

00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:45,449
world I mean yeah those are all great

00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:49,680
things I'm not an open-source hugger

00:06:45,449 --> 00:06:52,669
like a tree hugger right I do this for

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,960
very simple business reasons okay

00:06:52,669 --> 00:06:56,240
IBM's a big company four hundred

00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,680
thousand people we've got a lot of great

00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,780
intelligent people we could do a lot

00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:03,000
we've done a lot of amazing things but

00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:04,830
I'm not arrogant enough to think that I

00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,500
could out innovate the world right

00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:10,259
vendors who believe that taking a

00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:13,740
proprietary approach okay to any

00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:16,710
technology simply cannot sustain you

00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:22,130
cannot out innovate the world and the

00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:25,349
other aspect to this is market adoption

00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:28,110
you can accelerate the markets by

00:07:25,349 --> 00:07:29,970
gaining gravity around technology at

00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:31,740
different layers in particular for cloud

00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:34,169
whether it's the hardware the

00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:36,509
infrastructure the platform how people

00:07:34,169 --> 00:07:38,760
interact through mobile and other and

00:07:36,509 --> 00:07:41,789
other aspects okay and we've seen this

00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:43,860
pattern before think about all the

00:07:41,789 --> 00:07:46,020
biggest innovations that are really

00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:47,849
occur in IT industry since the late 80s

00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:51,330
early 90s it's been really built around

00:07:47,849 --> 00:07:54,539
open remember the beginning of HTML and

00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:57,210
CSS and HTTP right Tim berners-lee I

00:07:54,539 --> 00:08:00,270
worked with Tim on HTML I worked on I

00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:02,280
co-chaired CSS does anyone know what the

00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:04,500
the use case was for XML like coach

00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,909
shared that mostly what was the use case

00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:09,720
for the extensible markup language

00:08:05,909 --> 00:08:11,210
it wasn't config files trust me it

00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,919
wasn't

00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:19,229
does anybody know Chris you can't raise

00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:21,229
your hand anybody else come on guys good

00:08:19,229 --> 00:08:24,240
good no no I'm sorry

00:08:21,229 --> 00:08:26,370
the mathematical markup language guys

00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,520
that was the first instance the first

00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:31,530
DTD schemas didn't exist DTD right

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,180
that was the U that was drunk the the

00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:35,490
web was created to disseminate physics

00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:38,279
information great use cases trust me I

00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:40,349
love math I come out of IBM research

00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:43,930
with Jerry we love Matt we love

00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:46,960
computing with math right

00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:49,450
we didn't understand at the time and we

00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:51,280
were lucky that folks were able to see

00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:54,460
and use this technology in more

00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:56,830
interesting ways the world has changed

00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:59,650
we've learned it's not just a bunch of

00:08:56,830 --> 00:09:02,290
us geeks in a room coming up with

00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:04,330
interesting stuff we are involving end

00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:07,690
users so the point I'm trying to make is

00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:11,580
very simple and users are as important

00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:13,960
as the technology itself or more

00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:15,970
understanding the use cases of what

00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:18,190
you're building and why you're building

00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:20,200
it and what the beachheads are and how

00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:22,200
you should architect things is extremely

00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:25,000
important and that will help accelerate

00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,650
this ecosystem that's occurring make

00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,890
sense all right

00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:31,720
so say no to math say yes Analects no

00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:33,270
I'm just kidding okay you can't do

00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:36,970
analytics though math guys I'm sorry

00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:39,400
anyway so we have a we run a survey and

00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:41,020
this this is important I think certainly

00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,490
the line of business people should wake

00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:44,590
up because they love you know surveys

00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:46,390
and and things like this but but I think

00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:48,070
this is very telling because it's

00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:50,050
important for us to understand where we

00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:51,550
are when it comes to platform

00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:54,340
as-a-service in terms of adoption we

00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:56,260
surveyed about 500 or so of our clients

00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:57,670
the charge would be available so you can

00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:59,640
you know have to take pictures and stuff

00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:02,800
but you know I'm sure they're available

00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:05,020
and right now pass is kind of at its

00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,190
early stages right being adoption

00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:09,700
there's a lot of folks who are

00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:12,220
considered you know pioneers trying to

00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:13,840
use this stuff in production a lot of

00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:16,990
people experimenting which is very good

00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:19,870
I think to many observers right and who

00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:21,160
are these preparers that's certainly not

00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:23,170
me I'm not one of those people who

00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:24,880
overly prepare like analysis paralysis

00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:27,930
but there's some prepares but when you

00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:30,850
dig deeper into the data there's two

00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:33,130
kind of use cases two reasons that they

00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:34,960
see that are very important this is why

00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:38,170
I show you this data use case use case

00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:41,650
use case and that is analytics powered

00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:42,790
by mobile that's driving the creativity

00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:45,550
around a lot of these new style

00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:47,440
applications that need a flexible pass

00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:50,470
infrastructure like Cloud Foundry an

00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:54,610
open one right and the other one is

00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:56,350
efficiency speed okay so yeah speed is

00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:57,410
the new currency so let's talk about

00:10:56,350 --> 00:11:00,039
this use case

00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:03,979
analytics is in the eye of the beholder

00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:05,269
okay has anyone taken a plane you guys

00:11:03,979 --> 00:11:08,059
are afraid to answer because I said your

00:11:05,269 --> 00:11:10,249
last answer was wrong wrong it's okay

00:11:08,059 --> 00:11:14,209
you can take planes when you take planes

00:11:10,249 --> 00:11:16,189
right you've seen this this hsbc ad in

00:11:14,209 --> 00:11:18,319
the tunnels of these three photos is the

00:11:16,189 --> 00:11:19,099
back of jerry Cuomo's head here right

00:11:18,319 --> 00:11:21,079
sorry Jerry

00:11:19,099 --> 00:11:23,359
and but depending on who you are

00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:25,189
depending the context that you're in

00:11:23,359 --> 00:11:28,579
this could be a style statement you're

00:11:25,189 --> 00:11:31,009
cool right you could be a soldier or you

00:11:28,579 --> 00:11:33,289
can be a survivor right it's context

00:11:31,009 --> 00:11:35,749
context is very important and context

00:11:33,289 --> 00:11:38,029
changes so you want speed and

00:11:35,749 --> 00:11:40,159
application development but your context

00:11:38,029 --> 00:11:41,869
is constantly changing things like time

00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:43,579
and location social behavior

00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:45,499
multi-channel let me just give you an

00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:47,629
example a lot of us took flights to come

00:11:45,499 --> 00:11:49,429
here I took a flight although I live

00:11:47,629 --> 00:11:51,289
here as well as in New York I go back

00:11:49,429 --> 00:11:54,349
and forth it's not glamorous at all so

00:11:51,289 --> 00:11:56,119
you took a flight right and you checked

00:11:54,349 --> 00:11:57,949
in but two hours prior to that you

00:11:56,119 --> 00:11:59,089
checked in at the gate two hours prior

00:11:57,949 --> 00:12:01,909
to that you're on your phone you're

00:11:59,089 --> 00:12:04,339
checking your reservation right you

00:12:01,909 --> 00:12:06,439
arrive you arrange a car service you get

00:12:04,339 --> 00:12:08,600
in your car two days later you know you

00:12:06,439 --> 00:12:10,369
may be half your luggage didn't make it

00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:14,539
you got to go buy some clothing right

00:12:10,369 --> 00:12:17,329
time is a very location is a very very

00:12:14,539 --> 00:12:18,709
important context for any application

00:12:17,329 --> 00:12:20,539
it's going to help someone in their trip

00:12:18,709 --> 00:12:23,359
so for you to be successful in

00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:25,629
developing an app you need to be able to

00:12:23,359 --> 00:12:28,449
connect to these types of services to

00:12:25,629 --> 00:12:31,549
essentially detect what's going on

00:12:28,449 --> 00:12:33,759
enriching the experience so that folks

00:12:31,549 --> 00:12:37,369
can do the things I just described

00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:39,769
perhaps even perceive that oh my they

00:12:37,369 --> 00:12:41,239
didn't get their luggage so let's you

00:12:39,769 --> 00:12:44,179
know it's got some coupons go buy some

00:12:41,239 --> 00:12:47,479
clothing right but ultimately act do

00:12:44,179 --> 00:12:49,789
something right because you know as as

00:12:47,479 --> 00:12:52,549
the big boss and IBM always says friend

00:12:49,789 --> 00:12:55,249
Steve you know vision without execution

00:12:52,549 --> 00:12:56,989
is hallucination right you need to be

00:12:55,249 --> 00:13:01,669
able to do something need to able to act

00:12:56,989 --> 00:13:04,549
ok so in order to do all of this we need

00:13:01,669 --> 00:13:07,159
a platform that can be very flexible for

00:13:04,549 --> 00:13:08,539
change right because those applications

00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:11,150
are going to change the context is going

00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:12,620
to change you know location services

00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:13,730
with all the smarter cities and all the

00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:15,080
different kind of a little rest

00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:16,520
interfaces we connect to are gonna

00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:18,440
change right you need to be able to

00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:21,260
adapt and by the way our line of

00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:22,940
business friend over here sorry you're

00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:27,320
you're like the only one and you're in

00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:28,760
the front you know you're gonna you're

00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,650
looking at the competition you're like

00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,839
dude this app needs to do this this and

00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:34,400
that and you want the app to change so

00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:37,400
it can't be written in cement so you

00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:40,370
need to have a platform that allows for

00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:42,260
continuous change and this is recursive

00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:44,330
guys it's not just the apps you build

00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:47,180
but it's how we build the Cloud Foundry

00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:48,920
platform as well it needs to be open for

00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:52,130
change open for improvement relentless

00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:53,029
reinvention okay people talk a lot about

00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:57,080
DevOps

00:13:53,029 --> 00:14:00,080
right collaboration of data center folks

00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:03,350
over there application folks right well

00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:05,600
this is like DevOps on steroids okay and

00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:08,810
but that's the use case we need to keep

00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,940
in mind as we build that make sense so

00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:12,980
important use case for folks who are

00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:15,140
building applications and folks are be

00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:17,240
contributing to Cloud Foundry now let's

00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:21,529
talk about an open cloud architecture a

00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:23,900
dynamic cloud strategy okay what's

00:14:21,529 --> 00:14:25,459
happening around us is that an open

00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:27,770
architecture is emerging and there's not

00:14:25,459 --> 00:14:29,660
a client that I speak to that does not

00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:31,820
want to ensure that they have freedom of

00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:34,190
choice at each of the different layers

00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:36,440
where there's the hardware someone

00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:38,450
mentioned network yesterday did you guys

00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:40,640
hear software-defined network that's hot

00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:42,550
right things that are happening in open

00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:44,240
daylight that's really important right

00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:45,950
infrastructure there's a couple good

00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,970
mentions of OpenStack

00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:51,380
with anybody from pivotal here I see it

00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:54,350
okay good good good

00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:56,510
want to make sure right a couple

00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:58,730
mentions of how cloud foundry works on

00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:59,540
pivotal right there's some that was

00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:01,250
really interesting

00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:04,370
sorry cloud foundry works on Opus X and

00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:06,230
really interesting examples of that but

00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:08,630
this open architecture is emerging and

00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:11,750
at each of these layers there are

00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:14,510
ubiquitous open source platforms and

00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:17,209
innovations occurring okay whether it's

00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:18,800
the hardware but things like open power

00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:21,790
the network with things like open

00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:24,020
daylight OpenStack which has become

00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:24,680
frankly a de facto ubiquitous

00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:26,839
infrastructure

00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:29,210
of service open source platform Cloud

00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:31,279
Foundry which is really positioned to

00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:33,230
become a ubiquitous platform as a

00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:35,779
service platform hopefully that's why

00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:38,720
we're all here right that's what we want

00:15:35,779 --> 00:15:41,180
right we're at the beginning but also

00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,190
how you interact I mean think about the

00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:46,220
applications right you write it you

00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:49,670
write a mobile app do you really write

00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:53,270
directly to iOS your app or do you use

00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:55,820
html5 in Cordova most applications use

00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:57,260
html5 now unless you're playing Infinity

00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:58,970
Blade or minecraft or something that

00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,450
uses theme of the graphics engine okay

00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:03,110
fine

00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:05,149
but most you know normal apps now on

00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:07,760
game apps that normal people use right

00:16:05,149 --> 00:16:09,649
are built using html5 in an open source

00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:12,589
project use Cordova so from top to

00:16:09,649 --> 00:16:15,980
bottom open source is driving innovation

00:16:12,589 --> 00:16:17,600
now let's just take a little case study

00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:19,399
here listen let's look at the

00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,690
infrastructure as a service layer for a

00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:24,050
moment okay and I just want to talk a

00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:29,480
little bit about about about OpenStack

00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:32,750
okay you know I am just constantly

00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:34,760
amazed and humbled at what has happened

00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:36,950
with OpenStack over over a very short

00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:39,830
period of time I mean it started you

00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:42,470
know guys from Rackspace NASA you know a

00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:45,440
small group of people you know a couple

00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:47,240
dogs a cat and a parakeet right building

00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,029
this and great code but one thing that

00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:54,230
OpenStack has and one thing that Cloud

00:16:50,029 --> 00:16:57,680
Foundry has is a strong community okay

00:16:54,230 --> 00:17:00,050
that matters a lot and and and at one

00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:03,020
point in time the folks decided hey how

00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:04,819
can we better nurture the community how

00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:06,670
can we try to get more folks to

00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:09,380
understand and leverage this technology

00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:11,720
right and participate in the development

00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:14,630
of the technology and use the technology

00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:19,699
and in about a year OpenStack has grown

00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:21,530
from 250 or so folks to over 11,000 this

00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:23,360
just is dated this child was told this

00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:24,770
is dated and apparently these are images

00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,010
so I couldn't change the numbers so you

00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:30,970
get in old numbers but there's over

00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:34,400
11,000 people involved in OpenStack ok

00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:36,730
it is bigger than Linux it has surpassed

00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,680
Linux in terms of an open source

00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:41,750
ecosystem in about a year

00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:43,580
it's it's possible because we live in a

00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:45,800
different world now we are much more

00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:47,240
connected now there we are in the middle

00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,680
of a Renaissance it is more than

00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,610
possible for us to do this and we will

00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:53,290
do this together

00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:57,020
so let's talk new people ask you know

00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:58,310
what what's up with you know IBM and

00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:59,540
what do we what do we want to do with

00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:01,310
the foundry what are we trying to

00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:03,020
accomplish so we thought one good thing

00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:05,350
would maybe do a little press release

00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:08,210
just to kind of tell the world hey look

00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:09,650
we're using Cloud Foundry we like it we

00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:11,330
like the people we like the code we like

00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:14,840
the approach right

00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:18,170
we like the ecosystem and moreover right

00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:20,450
we like the fact that we're moving

00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:23,420
towards an open model for contributing

00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:25,280
code for governance etc because that's

00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:27,230
how we will grow this community to

00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:30,230
20,000 a year right Chris and James

00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:32,240
20,000 yeah very very easy and there

00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:34,130
were really two you know lots of you

00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,440
know whatever you do these things a lot

00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:37,790
of people comment and you know kind of

00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:40,100
take things out of contact but there's

00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:41,570
two really good kind of press analyst

00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:44,690
things I encourage you look at one was

00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:46,880
by pundit IT and the other is from from

00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:49,370
the register the first one talks about

00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,720
and they really get it why we do this we

00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:52,700
don't do this because we're tree huggers

00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,920
we do this because we're trying to

00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:57,440
accelerate a market we want to create

00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:59,690
get more folks to move from

00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,910
experimenting to pioneers to deploying

00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:04,790
so we can make more money helping them

00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:06,650
right and there is more skills that's

00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:09,350
the equation all right

00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:10,550
very very simple all right the register

00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:13,310
talked about what we did with Liberty

00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:15,620
yeag and how you doing gangs like the

00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:17,330
god of Liberty here for if you know what

00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:19,340
everyone know what Liberty is our web

00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:20,990
spirit container right it's great you

00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:23,270
have a bill pack we're announcing today

00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:26,270
right that's open sourced so you can go

00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:29,900
use Liberty inside of Cloud Foundry so

00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:31,610
specifically we recognize that like

00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:33,380
anyone else and we're new to the game

00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:34,910
right I mean a lot of you all have been

00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:36,470
using foundry for a long time I mean you

00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:38,210
saw a couple cool presentations of

00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:40,010
things that we built but we're new we

00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:42,950
got to earn our stripes so we're gonna

00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:45,590
start dealing with bugs closing issues

00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:48,380
blocking tackling helping automate

00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:51,200
testing okay we have a special interest

00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:52,310
on Bosch everybody seems to have an

00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,810
interest in Bosch

00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:55,940
particular boss how that ties with the

00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:57,290
OpenStack right we already contributed

00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:59,750
the WebSphere Liberty pack there's be

00:19:57,290 --> 00:20:01,180
more from us coming right but the things

00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:03,680
that we're gonna do we're gonna earn

00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:05,450
we're not gonna come in here and we're

00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:07,670
not gonna say oh we think we got to

00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:09,530
change everything no we're gonna learn

00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:10,850
how things are done we're gonna continue

00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:12,950
to contribute like we have and we're

00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:17,720
going to grow there is a lot of people

00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:19,880
in IBM playing with using Cloud Foundry

00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:21,620
whether it's building applications or

00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:25,360
working on the code base itself proper

00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:28,010
okay there is we had a hackathon

00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,540
internally we kind of do we have an open

00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:32,540
source internally movement in their own

00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:33,620
and IBM itself iBM is a four hundred

00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:35,840
thousand person company we have over a

00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:37,850
thousand people participate in sanika

00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,980
thon one day we had for building apps

00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:42,830
for Cloud Foundry that's pretty pretty

00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:45,860
amazing stuff okay a lot of energy there

00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:49,070
clearly not all here right now we had to

00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:51,500
stop people from coming so so that's how

00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:52,310
much energy we have now let's just take

00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,680
a moment talk a little bit about

00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:57,260
ecosystem and growth I think I've I've

00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:59,720
kind of hit hit at home that it's really

00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:02,750
really really important for any

00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:04,640
technology to have a strong community

00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:06,590
perhaps even more important so than the

00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,030
code a lot of things have been

00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:12,710
accomplished everything from how we

00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:14,510
exchange information how we fix bugs how

00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:16,370
some we're working on guidelines and how

00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:18,410
to how to contribute code and and I

00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:19,370
think we announced I mean the blog is up

00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:22,160
so I think we're now instead this

00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:25,760
Community Advisory Board Chris and James

00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:27,530
and Adrian in here too yeah you know and

00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,030
so if you want to learn more about how

00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:30,500
this is how to get engaged and think of

00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:32,090
the community by advisory board is

00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:34,250
almost like the BIOS in an operating

00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:37,340
system it's gonna boot strap how we

00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:38,720
together funnel feedback into Cloud

00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:41,120
Foundry how we work with Cloud Foundry

00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,500
and then how over time we continue to

00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,570
create a more open governance model

00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:46,760
alright so talk to those guys if you

00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:50,150
want to learn more about them all right

00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:51,620
now just let you know and you know and

00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:55,190
another important question that comes to

00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:56,510
me is is well so what's your product

00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:58,460
plans but what are you doing what would

00:21:56,510 --> 00:22:00,500
you know how do you make money I kind of

00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:02,030
explained the meta meta money the meta

00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:04,190
game but now let me explain you know a

00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:06,200
little bit more look for up for us

00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:08,299
you know cloud can be a private

00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:10,429
a public cloud or integrated system okay

00:22:08,299 --> 00:22:11,749
and we have something to call our smart

00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:14,600
cloud foundation which instead of Cove

00:22:11,749 --> 00:22:17,659
that essentially makes it easy for folks

00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:19,309
to stand up those clouds or use them all

00:22:17,659 --> 00:22:22,009
right they're all built on open

00:22:19,309 --> 00:22:23,989
technologies they all incorporate

00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:25,340
OpenStack for example a lot of the stuff

00:22:23,989 --> 00:22:27,440
we're doing on software-defined networks

00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:29,710
all the stuff we're doing with html5 and

00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:32,090
Cordova et cetera is all in there right

00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:34,190
and over time we'll certainly include

00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:35,359
aspects of Cloud Foundry as we continue

00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:37,789
to work on this okay

00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:40,309
that is our intent that's how we do this

00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:42,230
now for the time being though you can

00:22:40,309 --> 00:22:45,950
start to see in preview what we're

00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:48,889
thinking so I invite you to visit the

00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:50,509
IBM area over there which is kind of

00:22:48,889 --> 00:22:52,730
neat that all of our areas are in here

00:22:50,509 --> 00:22:55,190
right and go check out something called

00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:57,080
bluemix and I'll give you a screen shot

00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:59,899
demo here of a second of what that is

00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:01,279
and test out what we're trying to do to

00:22:59,899 --> 00:23:02,929
make it even easier for folks to build

00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:05,690
applications and frankly us learn more

00:23:02,929 --> 00:23:07,549
about Cloud Foundry it's a tech preview

00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:09,739
it's not a product you can download it

00:23:07,549 --> 00:23:12,320
you can use it it's how we are learning

00:23:09,739 --> 00:23:14,830
and how we're trying to understand how a

00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,759
lot of our clients are moving from

00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:19,309
experimenting to pioneering to actually

00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:22,789
deploying and of course if you want to

00:23:19,309 --> 00:23:25,070
collaborate with us on any community

00:23:22,789 --> 00:23:27,559
issue how do you get involved in

00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:29,090
community what we're trying to do or if

00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:30,289
there's a piece of code you want it was

00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:32,059
a lot of interest in that dashboarding

00:23:30,289 --> 00:23:33,649
stuff yesterday like 50 people came to

00:23:32,059 --> 00:23:35,840
me you wanna learn how to collaborate

00:23:33,649 --> 00:23:37,190
around that stuff we'd love to I got a

00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,629
big team here in the valley we can work

00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:40,480
together I mean we can work anywhere we

00:23:38,629 --> 00:23:44,509
go to the dojo whatever you want right

00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:46,190
you can ask high five man we've got five

00:23:44,509 --> 00:23:49,639
minutes you're going over we're going

00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:52,460
over all right you can connect with

00:23:49,639 --> 00:23:53,049
Chris or Todd where's Todd hey there's

00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:57,409
time all right

00:23:53,049 --> 00:23:59,690
okay bluemix demo by the way has I have

00:23:57,409 --> 00:24:01,070
a couple Easter eggs anyone noticed the

00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:05,119
first Easter Egg in this presentation

00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:08,210
the guy coming out of the taxi was Jerry

00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:10,340
it's Easter Egg number one I got it you

00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:13,309
didn't notice that put your face on the

00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:16,489
guy there's a couple other Easter eggs

00:24:13,309 --> 00:24:18,440
so let's uh so you can see and you can

00:24:16,489 --> 00:24:19,549
talk to Ed and the J star team over

00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,899
there there's Ed but

00:24:19,549 --> 00:24:22,429
to get engaged how to get started with

00:24:20,899 --> 00:24:23,840
bluemix but I just want to give you a

00:24:22,429 --> 00:24:25,369
feel of what we're trying to do so when

00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,200
you use bluemix you get this very simple

00:24:25,369 --> 00:24:29,360
page and let's say you want to build an

00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,559
app and you basically have a bunch of

00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:33,169
different runtimes that you can ground

00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:35,539
your app in alright anybody heard of IBM

00:24:33,169 --> 00:24:39,529
worklight it's amazing

00:24:35,539 --> 00:24:41,360
yes okay good it's work light is a is a

00:24:39,529 --> 00:24:42,950
platform developing mobile apps right

00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:47,509
and it allows you to build

00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:49,669
cross-platform high fidelity mobile

00:24:47,509 --> 00:24:51,440
applications using html5 and Apache

00:24:49,669 --> 00:24:54,169
Cordova check it out but anyway in this

00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,789
example we're using nodejs so like click

00:24:54,169 --> 00:24:58,070
and I select okay I'm gonna build an ojs

00:24:55,789 --> 00:24:59,269
app give it a give the app I don't think

00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:00,950
you guys can see that I certainly can't

00:24:59,269 --> 00:25:04,100
see this let me know over here you give

00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:05,720
the app a name you have some code that

00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:08,239
you're gonna seed and throw into in

00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:10,669
there right so I go and I do that and I

00:25:08,239 --> 00:25:12,470
add this and and I add the app into my

00:25:10,669 --> 00:25:14,779
catalog of applications so now I'm gonna

00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:16,609
start to add services this is the whole

00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:18,080
dynamic behavior right you're gonna see

00:25:16,609 --> 00:25:20,149
some services that are perhaps more

00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:22,340
common like say right to do some

00:25:20,149 --> 00:25:23,980
no sequel stuff so I'm gonna add a

00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:27,559
service to that particular application

00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:29,659
you're able right in context just you're

00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:32,059
able to start editing the code so you

00:25:29,659 --> 00:25:34,399
could you know write the authentication

00:25:32,059 --> 00:25:35,090
for how are you gonna connect to

00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:36,919
some of these different services

00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:39,169
together etc start doing some of that

00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:41,690
business and then you want to add say

00:25:39,169 --> 00:25:43,100
another app and out of that out of the

00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:45,320
hackathon we had all kinds of

00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:47,629
interesting applications developed

00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:49,399
someone wrote up front-end to Watson

00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:51,529
anyone know it wants it the thing that

00:25:49,399 --> 00:25:52,970
played Jeopardy who knows this and you

00:25:51,529 --> 00:25:54,379
can ask it questions and so forth but

00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:56,600
we're not gonna use the ones in that

00:25:54,379 --> 00:25:58,399
we're gonna use an ANA social analytics

00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,749
app which was actually pretty cool what

00:25:58,399 --> 00:26:02,299
it does is that this was a little app

00:25:59,749 --> 00:26:05,149
that analyzes Twitter feeds okay and

00:26:02,299 --> 00:26:07,519
there's some analytics on sentiment

00:26:05,149 --> 00:26:08,809
analysis right so now what do I have is

00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:11,509
I've got a little application I've built

00:26:08,809 --> 00:26:14,029
a node application it's got it's

00:26:11,509 --> 00:26:16,220
got this social analytics thing in there

00:26:14,029 --> 00:26:18,230
I wrote a little bit of code and then

00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:20,799
right there inside the same environment

00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:23,029
I can stand up and test and start to do

00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:25,279
sentiment analysis see who's commenting

00:26:23,029 --> 00:26:27,559
on a particular topic just by you know

00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:29,480
providing the the hang of the the hash

00:26:27,559 --> 00:26:30,980
tags of what I'm looking for looking for

00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:32,870
the social graph of how people are

00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:34,250
related and so forth very

00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:36,410
quickly line of business folks get

00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:38,240
excited over this it was done very

00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:41,360
quickly it's a toy little application

00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:44,780
but it shows you the power of providing

00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:47,720
easy accessibility to standing something

00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:49,340
up and the power of being able to bring

00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:51,140
different runtimes different executions

00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:54,650
together in a framework in a coherent

00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:55,870
way right so check out bluemix over

00:26:54,650 --> 00:27:00,530
there

00:26:55,870 --> 00:27:02,270
alright so now let me lead you with a

00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:05,240
couple of leave you with a couple of

00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:07,670
thoughts first of all if you haven't

00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:08,179
already go to Cloud Foundry comm check

00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:11,900
it out

00:27:08,179 --> 00:27:14,720
right OpenStack I think is extremely

00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:16,190
important so if you haven't heard of

00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,650
OpenStack I don't know what rock you're

00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:20,470
living under but but if you haven't

00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:23,150
you're not involved please get engaged

00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:26,000
it's a great community you want to

00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:27,980
experiment with bluemix and see kind of

00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,350
the stuff that we've done we and IBM

00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:33,620
have done with Cloud Foundry you can

00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:36,910
talk to Ed over there use J start and

00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:39,710
there's also kind of you know we like to

00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:41,030
we like to talk you like to blog we like

00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:42,320
to kind of you know we're living in a

00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:43,730
Renaissance we like to kind of write

00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,860
down what we're thinking so there's a

00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:48,830
lot of interesting blogs around how this

00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:50,600
open architecture we see evolving Chris

00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:51,860
Ferris and myself and others have

00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,690
written a bunch of interesting blog so

00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:55,550
there's some links here for blogs as

00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:59,300
well so hopefully at the end of this

00:27:55,550 --> 00:28:02,150
you've kind of seen a landscape of

00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:05,450
really what's important for us we want

00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:07,220
to grow this community together we want

00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:08,600
to add developers we want more people

00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:10,970
using cloud files we want more people

00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:14,210
contributing to Cloud Foundry the gate

00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:17,320
way of doing that is fostering an open

00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:22,429
ecosystem we want to become a ubiquitous

00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:24,860
platform as-a-service . that's it done

00:28:22,429 --> 00:28:27,650
ok that's what we want

00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:30,809
[Applause]

00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:30,809
