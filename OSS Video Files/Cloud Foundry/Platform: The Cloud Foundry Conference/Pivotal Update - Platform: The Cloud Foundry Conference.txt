00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:11,910
so I I have two happy duties tonight

00:00:09,469 --> 00:00:13,769
number one is to thank you again for

00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:17,460
coming here and number two is to tell

00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:20,279
you where the reception is but before I

00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:23,510
formally discharge discharge those

00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:27,960
duties I just wanted to say a very few

00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:33,960
words are firstly I hope you get the

00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:38,280
sense that you're participating in the

00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:40,620
development in the birth of a layer of

00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:43,500
software that I think is gonna have an

00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:46,320
extraordinary profound impact on our

00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:49,320
industry over the next 20 to 30 years I

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,600
really think this layer could have as

00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:56,129
big a impact on the industry as Linux

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:58,050
did on the client-server era and that's

00:00:56,129 --> 00:01:00,770
an incredible opportunity it's

00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:03,420
incredible responsibility to really

00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:06,900
realize that potential we have to come

00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:10,350
at this as an ecosystem as a body of

00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:12,299
people collaborating together and I hope

00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:15,650
you get the sense that we're trying to

00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:18,360
enable that along with the other

00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:20,299
sponsors of this event and participants

00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,740
in in Cloud Foundry and in particular

00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:26,130
once again like to thank our colleagues

00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:29,659
at GE and IBM as well as everyone else

00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:33,509
who's participating in this endeavor I

00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:36,689
will be here tomorrow during the

00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:38,430
unconference so if there is time and it

00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:40,650
does fit I'd be very interested in

00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:43,939
coming back up and listening to some of

00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:47,490
your opinions receiving some free advice

00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:49,619
and answering a few questions and now

00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:51,659
with that I want to say formally thank

00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:53,909
you for coming and certainly the

00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:55,040
reception is down at the pool enjoy

00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:58,139
