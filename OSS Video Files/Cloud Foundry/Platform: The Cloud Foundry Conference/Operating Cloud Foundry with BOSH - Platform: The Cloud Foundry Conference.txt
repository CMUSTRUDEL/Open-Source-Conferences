	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:11,700
I used to work at a company called

00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:13,620
Engine Yard which was one of the

00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,719
original platforms deserves companies

00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:18,060
they do it differently than how Cloud

00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:19,859
Foundry and her could do it but we're an

00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:22,859
8,000 vm's for about a thousand

00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:25,740
customers and when I started hearing

00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:27,180
that that VMware's Bosch product or

00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,880
their outer shell product which is what

00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:33,210
Bosch stands for Bosch stands for Bosch

00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,680
outer shell which when you think about

00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,510
it means they could have called it

00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:40,260
anything of any one of 26 different

00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:44,340
words posh wash anything but they chose

00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:45,270
Bosch and Google's terribly so when

00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,820
you're naming things

00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:48,930
quick quick double check does it is

00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,789
there anything else that shows up on

00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:52,590
Google like I don't know hardware

00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:57,989
products that you use it in for home

00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:59,370
appliances can you get a domain for it

00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:00,840
and can you get a Twitter account if you

00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:02,340
can you're good to go

00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,809
I don't think that said they satisfy

00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,420
that for any of these anyway it's called

00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:09,240
Bosch and here we are I really felt like

00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:12,780
we could have used this engineered no

00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:17,460
one else agree with me so I left and and

00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:19,950
here we are and so I now do consulting

00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:22,170
and training for for Cloud Foundry

00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:23,670
specifically obviously at the moment

00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,900
cloud foundry need Bosch and and

00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:27,000
perfectly fine with that

00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,320
so unless Evan look just in case you're

00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,560
wondering who I am except for allowed in

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:35,130
Australian I decided to show off I think

00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,780
so we have six customers and because I

00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:39,060
don't know I've a lot of spare time or

00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:43,200
my iPhone has stuck to my hand I talk a

00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:44,790
lot on all our mailing lists but but I

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,990
do commute a lot I this is this is the

00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:49,079
pretty picture I love this picture

00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:52,590
because it it explains where on my time

00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:54,270
went I do I do try to do everything i me

00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:56,310
a little bit feel bad because I don't

00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:58,350
don't pair because it wouldn't show up

00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:03,299
on my graph that's alright you know

00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:05,310
appearing bad for graphs all right so so

00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:06,509
I commute a lot but you know I don't

00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:09,479
know if that's good or bad because patch

00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:12,380
every second committees whoops and pep

00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:15,230
talk on know where a core belief in life

00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:17,750
is is everyone deserves nice things and

00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:19,070
you might agree with that and and for a

00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,390
lot of us we've sort of looked at cloud

00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:22,760
founder you see the demo of Cloud

00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:25,400
Foundry you know the CF portion you go

00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:29,990
that's awesome my users are gonna love

00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:34,730
that but what about us who have to run

00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:37,070
Cloud Foundry you know sure not a lot of

00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:38,090
software is written for the delight and

00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:39,920
pleasure of the people they're going to

00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:41,930
run it and one of the reasons I fell in

00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,340
love with Cloud Foundry was it always

00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:45,230
seemed like the Cloud Foundry team

00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:46,970
throughout the years have wanted other

00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:48,680
people to be able to run Cloud Foundry

00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:50,660
and you might think that's a little

00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:53,000
silly thing to say but there's many many

00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:54,910
bits of open source where the solution

00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:02,570
to the question how do I run this is

00:02:54,910 --> 00:03:04,030
we're hiring and and and the VMware and

00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:09,200
people guys have never really said that

00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:10,850
publicly anyway so so so they released

00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,980
bashed me in the first year they they

00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:14,120
sort of shared some chef recipes and and

00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:16,970
that was great and then they released

00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:18,710
Bosh and Bosh has allowed all of us to

00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:21,170
figure out how to run Claire foundation

00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:23,300
for ourselves now you might wonder why

00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:25,430
Bosh well let's put Bosh in from my

00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:27,830
perspective into the ears of computing

00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:30,140
so it's from a let's think of it from a

00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:32,030
packaging perspective first yeah I sort

00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:33,500
of read our packaging and the Debian

00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:36,530
packaging was all about packaged a thing

00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:39,050
and run it chef was packaged and run a

00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:41,000
complete server and I believe Bosh has

00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:42,830
the is the mental model of patchy

00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,470
packaging and and running an entire

00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:47,000
system and you're thinking Nick that's

00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:51,560
great I don't like bullet points I need

00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,810
pictures there's a box there's a

00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:57,650
shipping container with the box inside

00:03:53,810 --> 00:04:00,830
it you're probably thinking this guy's

00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:02,570
pretty handy with keynote there's a lot

00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:03,830
of boxes sitting on top of each other so

00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:05,870
this is what your company might look

00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:07,340
like you Scheffer fight some stuff and

00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,870
you found some appropriate action

00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:12,410
figures to put next to your guard your

00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:14,090
service I'm not sure what we got there I

00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:16,160
think we've got Arnie now you've got Mad

00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:18,109
Max and Indiana Jones which I don't

00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,870
believe ever featured together on the

00:04:18,109 --> 00:04:22,669
big film big screen anyway so you know

00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:23,630
and you've got you've got nine servers

00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:25,820
and you're thinking this is pretty good

00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:27,080
I can do this this is going well

00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:31,010
and eventually a company looks a little

00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:32,420
bit like this Adam Jacobs one of the

00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:34,100
chef guys once talked about there's a

00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:35,870
there's a there's a dangerous spot in

00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:38,390
the system where you go from 50 VMs

00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:40,400
through to 5,000 VMs and about the 500

00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:42,260
mark that's where it's dangerous because

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,790
at that point you still think you've got

00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:47,780
like an understanding what the hell's

00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:51,890
going on and this is what happens about

00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:54,470
that mark it all falls over and that's

00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:56,000
awkward I'm gonna be honest so the

00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:58,430
mental model I have of what is botched

00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,470
is it's the thing that orchestrates all

00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:02,720
the service it does configuration

00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:05,360
management as well but it takes a much

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:08,150
broader grander scope of what it's doing

00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,140
in a way very anti you know UNIX UNIX

00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:11,030
lots of little things to do something

00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:13,360
brushes bug of that I'm doing everything

00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:15,530
and it's gonna be sweet

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,180
so that's very great you know you've

00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:18,680
seen I know how to find pictures on him

00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:20,630
Google Images you've seen that I've got

00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:23,630
a wonderful theme but I now want to show

00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:27,440
you what I fell in love with on April 11

00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:30,190
last year and to do that requires me to

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:35,930
switch to the wonders of live demo

00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:38,600
that's a lie the video but let's just

00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:41,410
pretend it's live because oh look I'm

00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,410
typing anyway

00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:44,990
so let's look I've got a running Cloud

00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:46,400
Foundry system if you for anyone ever

00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:49,990
tried to run Cloud Foundry on Bosh you

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:53,420
might ever go to this point anyway

00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:56,600
but I have one and look I've got a nap

00:05:53,420 --> 00:06:01,240
and everything so that's data thank you

00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:04,490
very much good night all right

00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,750
go demo what do I do next I can't talk

00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:07,520
about it right oh here we go

00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:09,080
I did something all right so next thing

00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,360
you do is uh they're just virtual

00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:13,310
machines what Bosch is orchestrating for

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,480
the promoter part is VMs and putting

00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,930
things in them so here's the different

00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,820
VMs

00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:20,690
and I'm just for the sake you know

00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:22,280
showing off SSH into one because at the

00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:23,600
moment that's one of the places you're

00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:27,110
gonna find you wrote your system logs

00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,880
there is a system blog aggregator but it

00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:30,620
doesn't you know it's fun to demo so you

00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,210
maybe if we have with just tailing the

00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:34,520
logs on one of the VMS it's the router

00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:36,880
and so I'm just going to run a little

00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,930
command and attempt to show you that I

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,470
don't know the internet works

00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:47,210
look there it is inside the router so

00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:50,150
hang on look there it is inside the

00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:54,140
router I should synchronize my own voice

00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:56,150
with the presentation all right so we've

00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:57,410
seen that there are VMs what else can we

00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:59,750
do once you've got a Cloud Foundry

00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:01,520
running and by the way we are getting to

00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,600
the part that I fell in love with I just

00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,169
want to show you some things you may not

00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,669
have seen before

00:07:03,169 --> 00:07:07,430
you've never actually got it working

00:07:04,669 --> 00:07:08,960
before there is a DNS mode you can use

00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:11,560
it to with static copies if you've got

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,970
to Amazon VPS or Ivy sphere or

00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:15,230
OpenStack Neutron but if you don't there

00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:18,110
is a whole mode where you can run it and

00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:19,880
get DNS entries internal DNS to each of

00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:21,919
the VMS a lot of people don't know that

00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:23,630
that's really interesting I think a lot

00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:26,900
of people don't know is you can get some

00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:29,540
basic vitals of each of the VMS which is

00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:32,240
handy as for a quick glance of answering

00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:33,800
some of those basic questions of why I'm

00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,270
you know why am i running out of disk

00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,340
why am i running out of disk am i

00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:39,350
running a ram so here we've got the

00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:40,580
Postgres job you might not want to run

00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:43,010
the Postgres job you might want to run

00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:44,600
Postgres however you normally run

00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:46,700
Postgres and just wire it in but here we

00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:49,850
are running Postgres the pivotal guys

00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:52,310
themselves use RDS for the back-end of

00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:54,800
cloud foundry so up for grabs how you

00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:57,320
want to do that and this is a deployment

00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:01,130
manifest this is the deployment fest

00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:02,540
that works and if you want one of those

00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:04,790
you just come to me

00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:06,530
and I'll show you the the OpenStack

00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:08,570
documentation it's a little bit so what

00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:09,710
we're doing now by the way as I thought

00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:11,720
it'd be interesting to say look hey what

00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:15,080
if we ran out of RAM for our DA's let's

00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:16,940
add some more so we've we added we went

00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,560
from three to six in the DA's that meant

00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:21,170
we need an extra three and the resource

00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,510
pool which a resource pool is describing

00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:25,460
what a server actually is and I have a

00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:27,980
very simple premise of a small map still

00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:32,090
small not very complex and now we're on

00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:35,600
Bosh and look oh my lord it's booting

00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:36,890
service no Amazon console which by the

00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:40,700
way wouldn't work as we're deploying to

00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:42,110
OpenStack no piston classes that we run

00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:44,600
this on piston cloud for the demo and

00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:46,880
look no I should have said that that was

00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,050
poorly timed that was not my point was

00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,380
not to say piston clad and then watch it

00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:52,700
fail but I thought you know when you're

00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,690
doing a screencast you have you can go

00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,640
one of two ways choose your own

00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:58,070
adventure you could fix the problem and

00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:00,230
then appear that it never happened or

00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:02,150
you could show debugging so here we are

00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:04,070
debugging we looked at we've looked

00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:05,810
inside the log of the job so every job

00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:07,430
you're on Bosh because Bosh the server

00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:09,410
base you can get all the jobs you've

00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:10,880
ever run or tasks and see what went on

00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:13,010
so we looked and it said add a quarter

00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,780
and I thought bloody default quarters

00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:16,850
good damn it

00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:18,500
and then I thought you know what this is

00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:21,860
gonna be awesome I'm going to delete

00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:24,680
everything because there is a Bosch cck

00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:26,540
command which will detect that one or

00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:29,240
two or all of my servers have gone

00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:30,770
mysteriously missing and let me fix the

00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:33,110
problem I just think this is brilliant

00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:36,830
so what it said is there are 10 missing

00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:38,510
servers which is all of them and and I'm

00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:39,830
going through going yes please recreate

00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:43,700
that one please recreate that one

00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:46,370
recreate that one etc etc and and it

00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:48,140
will this is truly awesome so we're mad

00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:50,210
when Mac Coco yesterday to have talked

00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:52,250
about moving from way easy to another

00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:56,660
this is another sort of service the boss

00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:58,610
does for you when you can get working so

00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,870
eventually comes up now I don't know if

00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:01,340
you notice it can't really tell because

00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:03,140
I'm skipping through pretty quickly but

00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:04,850
they were coming up one at a time and

00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:06,400
when you'd really stressed because

00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:08,420
you're trying to put a presentation on

00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,220
you don't want them coming up one at a

00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:13,700
time you'd like little current currency

00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:16,560
so what you do is you create ticket

00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:22,740
so this is the bosch project and this is

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:26,040
me typing out a ticket just when you

00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:31,080
might be most stressed your entire

00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:39,680
production system has been deleted by

00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:41,700
someone with dashboard access oh I

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:45,150
couldn't figure how to get ScreenFlow to

00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:47,370
speeded up your head of type faster or

00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:57,330
you're preparing a screencast for

00:10:47,370 --> 00:11:03,090
platform cf boss CK brings back VMs one

00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:11,160
at a time that's how you paste in text

00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:13,200
I think that's oh no that's just for

00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:15,440
commits for when I go in and pick

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:23,280
something I think it wants to torture me

00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:24,780
it loves me but the love hurts so I

00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:27,960
think I'm really telling the story of

00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:33,080
bosses as a person and it's anyway so

00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:35,100
eventually it finishes and at this point

00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:37,380
you look at some of them haven't quite

00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,670
come up all the VMS have come up some of

00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,660
them have come up in a fairly estate

00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,740
that's not a problem cuz we're now going

00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:42,000
to get back to what we were trying to do

00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,770
before which is bring up those three

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,920
extra VMs and everything will sort of

00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:49,170
converge to success and ask me again I

00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:50,610
say yes I still want them a little bit

00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:54,690
accurate because one of them did come up

00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:56,610
and two failed and so that's gonna keep

00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:57,839
going and eventually the jobs will

00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:59,520
restart the ones that need to be

00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,870
restarted the ones that were failing so

00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,980
we've got an affair snatch snatch is

00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:03,830
really important a lot of other jobs

00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:08,040
don't like to work if NASA isn't running

00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:10,320
and an eventually those DA's will come

00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:12,690
up this is brilliant

00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,330
not filing part but failures happen

00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:16,650
anyway all it means is II start bringing

00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:17,870
our biggest systems and you see more

00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:20,339
failures but that's not your fault

00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:24,390
that's that's the silly OpenStack

00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:26,100
quarters not my fault so there it is our

00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:27,540
system running and

00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:29,850
and it's brought back the data so even

00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:32,040
though we lost every server it even

00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:34,769
reattached the volumes back on the

00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:36,329
appropriate jobs and so if you've ever

00:12:34,769 --> 00:12:38,009
had to you know the one reason I fell in

00:12:36,329 --> 00:12:39,329
love with Bosch or the reason I've the

00:12:38,009 --> 00:12:41,160
story I tell about the rest of the world

00:12:39,329 --> 00:12:42,690
and their lack of understanding of

00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,190
everyone that's ever used chef we all

00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:47,009
agree chef and puppet configuration

00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:49,740
management whoo but every single one of

00:12:47,009 --> 00:12:51,449
those people and the more popular it

00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:53,970
gets the more of the every single one of

00:12:51,449 --> 00:12:56,790
the people set grows have either either

00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:59,310
have to manually do this stuff with a

00:12:56,790 --> 00:13:02,160
knife command or whatever puppet has or

00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:03,810
or that Amazon console or they go on

00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,579
write massive amounts of orchestration

00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:09,149
some companies that's their core

00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:10,589
business value engineer Heroku app Fogg

00:13:09,149 --> 00:13:12,899
anyone that's doing this stuff they're

00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:14,660
there this being substantial amounts of

00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:19,380
R&D doing this stuff

00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:21,300
why Bosch why not Bosch why do we not

00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:22,740
deserve something like Bosch it's

00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:26,069
brilliant all right so I want to show

00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:27,300
you one last thing which is uh so so the

00:13:26,069 --> 00:13:29,370
next part and the last thing I want to

00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:30,630
show you so very short is is so great

00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:32,459
you've deployed something and I see this

00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:35,579
all the time with open-source software

00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:37,709
they might say here is here is a VM you

00:13:35,579 --> 00:13:40,410
know Amazon Marketplace boot a VM and

00:13:37,709 --> 00:13:43,260
you've got the system running and and

00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:44,760
I'm expecting to find small print any

00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:47,310
print that says so what happens when a

00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:51,329
new version comes out and they never put

00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:53,760
that print in forth I can't believe it

00:13:51,329 --> 00:13:55,769
to deploy something once is not that

00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:58,410
interesting ok so it's hard sometimes

00:13:55,769 --> 00:14:00,300
but it shouldn't be but the next fifty

00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:01,740
nine months of a system is really you

00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,060
know where the rubber hits the road can

00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:06,120
you keep as if you're going to deploy

00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:08,699
Cloud Foundry you've got new releases

00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,990
come out every week so let's go have a

00:14:08,699 --> 00:14:11,790
look what happens let's look at how

00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:16,019
simple it is to upgrade when you release

00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:17,670
comes out so we're running one three

00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:23,430
eight let's just say one three nine came

00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:24,750
out alright so there you can see I've

00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:27,240
got Cloud Foundry one three eight

00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:29,370
running it's got little asterisks saying

00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:31,290
it's deployed somewhere currently the

00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:35,130
way you get Bush released is you go to

00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:36,720
the repo you download it and it's it's

00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:40,189
stored somewhere in the repo so what we

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,189
can do is upload the release

00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:49,079
there are two steps and we just did one

00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:50,790
of them so what it's doing now is this

00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:52,649
going to figure out all the packages and

00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:54,779
jobs that it's never pulled down before

00:14:52,649 --> 00:14:57,089
and then it's going to upload them to

00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:59,940
Bosh and when I say all the packages a

00:14:57,089 --> 00:15:02,040
Bosch releases basically it's dedicated

00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:04,230
disk drive even though this is running

00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:07,230
on a bun to the these VMs ultimately or

00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:08,790
a bun - we don't use the Bosh releases

00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:11,519
Cloud Foundry nope doesn't use any of

00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:13,260
the ubuntu debian whatever packaging

00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:16,230
system we describe everything from

00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:17,790
source and so it's completely it's you

00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:20,310
know from you can see exactly what's

00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:21,600
coming into it so if you're a security

00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:21,930
minded person and you think that's a bad

00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,970
thing

00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:26,370
great there is the security duct see if

00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:28,230
all my mailing list I don't know if some

00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:30,230
analyst I suspect to just go to Matt

00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:32,070
Ryder's personal email but nonetheless

00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:33,570
Mac you can tell me if that's not

00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:35,430
correct but John talk to Matt if you

00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:40,079
want to join the security aspect of

00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:44,850
Claire foundry then - to people who

00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:47,640
aren't gonna fix the problem but

00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:51,380
nonetheless I don't mean it from that

00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:51,380
perspective I mean you know you delegate

00:15:51,529 --> 00:15:57,269
it so anyway beautiful people I love

00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:59,250
them both I used to work with Matt at

00:15:57,269 --> 00:16:01,199
Engine Yard so now we're gonna upgrade

00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:04,050
to one three nine they will just go

00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:05,790
change the manifest we do a deploy it

00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:08,399
says is that what you really want to do

00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:11,100
can you say you bet you how bad could it

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,120
go I do recommend I mean one of the

00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,560
great things about budget couldn't

00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,820
describe something absolutely completely

00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,839
you only going to change a few little

00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:19,170
things and you can do a staging

00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:21,720
environment deploy in parallel and I

00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:24,620
highly recommend testing any changes in

00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:26,850
that matter first especially upgrades

00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:30,690
and this is just showing the jobs

00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:33,510
restarting and at this point I ran out

00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:35,550
of time and I had to stop screencast and
