Description: 
	Cloud Foundry Foundation surges forward | #OpenStack
by Heather Johnson | Aug 17, 2015

Formed less than six months ago, the Cloud Foundry Foundation, which controls Pivotal Software, Inc.’s Cloud Foundry, has made much progress in a short amount of time.

“We’re waking up in a world where we care about two things: multivendor and multicloud,” said Cloud Foundry CEO Sam Ramji, who filled in theCUBE cohost John Furrier on Cloud Foundry Foundation’s background during OpenStack Summit 2015. “We should be very concerned about single-vendor open source. A year ago IBM announced that Cloud Foundry was going to be part of Bluemix and moved to create the foundation along with Pivotal. Nine months ago when HP made the same announcement around HP Helion, that’s when the ball really started rolling.”

A big-picture approach

The Cloud computing platform takes a big-picture approach to delivery. “It’s not how fast can you get from A to B; it’s how fast can you turn the entire crank,” said Ramji. “The operators have been left behind. With Cloud Foundry, mature enterprises can say, ‘We have a cycle of innovation, we need to turn that crank every week, and we need to do that in multiple departments.’ This is a system that will let you dev, test, operate, maintain, bring it all the way through the cycle.”

Interested parties can visit GitHub and pull sources down from the Cloud Foundry section. “It’s free, it’s portable, it’s consistent and it ships every month,” concluded Ramji.

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,320
next guess I sent Sam ramji the CEO of

00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,910
Cloud Foundry foundation here breaking

00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,100
it down the Opus tech summit welcome to

00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:48,600
the cube awesome great to see you good

00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,030
alone I know usually cut the plane and

00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,590
Vancouver's a great city yeah rock and

00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,010
roll craft beer all kinds of great stuff

00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:58,260
here in Canada you can't get in the US

00:00:55,010 --> 00:01:00,899
so your tweed yeah I YZ the big rush

00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:03,629
songs y y SE y YX is the airport this is

why we are yok bit only the Canadian

00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:07,409
airports start with why as soon as I saw

00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:08,790
y bar I just couldn't get YYZ out of my

00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:10,799
head it's it's one of those songs that's

00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,390
stuck in us rockers heads let's talk

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,189
about cloud fan just ugly what's give us

00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,020
the update i was the OpenStack it's all

00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:18,270
about speed right now getting stuff

00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,380
absolutely the Builder economy we're in

00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,909
right now that's what we're calling it

00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:23,280
you're in the cube a lot of build a lot

00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:25,830
of proof points in the table but Cloud

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,290
Foundry interesting evolution yeah and

00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:30,900
its history great success in the

00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:32,700
business metrics the adoption certainly

00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:36,960
we cover off CGI BM events and all the

00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:38,939
other events you seeing HP IBM Moritz

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,070
kind of shook the tree and kind of

00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:42,960
corralled the industry for cloud foundry

00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:44,159
with the foundation big success since

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,040
the foundation it's been really

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,680
something so last monday was the cloud

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,259
foundry summit it was the 110th day of

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,000
existence of the foundation and my 110th

00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:55,259
day on the job so i think we've had a

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,369
lot of goodwill to ride on but we've

00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:58,649
gotten a lot done in a very short amount

00:01:56,369 --> 00:01:59,939
of time a lot of us including myself a

00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:01,740
little bit pooh-poohing on Cloud Foundry

00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:04,110
because it was a pivotal it smelled like

00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:06,090
it was like a land-grab will partying

00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:07,229
they're cobbling together egg that red

00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:09,509
ass and all the stuff it's just like

00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:10,920
putting the portfolio together but you

00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:12,680
know they were open about it and they

00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:14,450
lot of buzz going on

00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:16,819
but the question was can it break

00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:20,269
through as a pivotal fit Federation

00:02:16,819 --> 00:02:22,849
company BMC VMware a lot of skeptics yep

00:02:20,269 --> 00:02:24,829
but the success really took off when you

00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:27,680
broke it out into the foundation that

00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:29,510
really became the flash point yeah the

00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,090
two Cloud Foundry explain that dynamics

00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:34,400
but he might not know the history so so

00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:36,049
that i'll start with sort of the where

00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,420
we're ending which is that I think we're

00:02:36,049 --> 00:02:39,799
all waking up in a world where we care

00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:41,989
about two things multi-vendor

00:02:39,799 --> 00:02:44,840
multi-cloud you should be very concerned

00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:46,730
we've learned about single vendor open

00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,980
source single vendor open source is

00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:51,049
really not that open right and you still

00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:53,450
have a lot of risk when you adopt it so

00:02:51,049 --> 00:02:55,669
they want multi-vendor so when a year

00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:58,219
ago an IBM announced that cloud foundry

00:02:55,669 --> 00:02:59,540
was going to be part of bluemix and move

00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:01,609
to create the foundation along with

00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:02,930
pivotal and then you know nine months

00:03:01,609 --> 00:03:05,209
ago when HP made the same announcement

00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:06,919
around HP Helion and said they were also

00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:08,450
going to join the foundation that was

00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:10,340
when the ball really started rolling

00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:12,620
they got real serious about getting the

00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:14,030
bylaws and the governance and the end

00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:15,439
you know though the funding and the

00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:17,239
staffing and all that stuff so we could

00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:18,979
create this this brand new foundation

00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:20,389
that's what we're building on right a

00:03:18,979 --> 00:03:22,519
foundation should be something that the

00:03:20,389 --> 00:03:23,569
entire industry can now rest on and

00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:25,040
that's what we're seeing everybody is

00:03:23,569 --> 00:03:26,870
building bigger and bigger stacks active

00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,530
state based right here in Vancouver

00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:31,370
build staccato that's a cloud foundry

00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:33,079
implementation and it sits right on top

00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:35,209
of OpenStack so that's the other

00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:36,680
component right multi-cloud you know

00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:38,750
that you can't build all of your stuff

00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,879
forever on Amazon because we learned

00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:42,889
what happens with single vendor not open

00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:46,220
source solutions in the 90s from

00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:47,750
Microsoft so we're in wave 2 of cloud

00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:49,280
adoption and it's multi-vendor and

00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:51,049
multi-cloud that's I think there's some

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,389
big drivers pushing Claude brown and the

00:03:51,049 --> 00:03:55,909
big big tail winds for you guys is one

00:03:53,389 --> 00:03:58,069
the pressure for all the other incumbent

00:03:55,909 --> 00:04:00,290
vendors that didn't have anything the

00:03:58,069 --> 00:04:02,449
openness OpenStack was really a lot of

00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:04,189
confusion at a time now it's relegated

00:04:02,449 --> 00:04:06,290
to the infrastructures of service which

00:04:04,189 --> 00:04:08,329
where it needs to focus its a action on

00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:10,609
hardening up a lot of the table stakes

00:04:08,329 --> 00:04:13,220
but then it was also I gotta move in

00:04:10,609 --> 00:04:15,169
pivot this is IBM as HP Cloud found you

00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,940
the perfect storm foundation to make it

00:04:15,169 --> 00:04:18,859
open yep where people can compete and

00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:20,419
cooperate at the same time the coop

00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:22,490
petition is the key right the nice way

00:04:20,419 --> 00:04:24,110
to say it is co-innovation sort of the

00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:25,700
Frank way to say it is co-optation it is

00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:26,210
collaboration around the table we have

00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,380
to have

00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:29,240
trustworthy governance and make

00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:30,169
everything work and also embrace that

00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,870
they're going to compete and be

00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:34,880
commercially successful the key is it's

00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:35,840
not just the vendors though its users we

00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,940
were in the Wall Street Journal last

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,319
week with JPMorgan Chase joining the

00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,460
foundation and explaining how they're

00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:43,220
using it as a strategic platform

00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:45,860
internally you'll hear from bank of new

00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:49,460
york mellon right the biggest bank by

00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:52,039
trading volume in the world AT&T Verizon

00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:53,449
use it right swisscom is also on the

00:04:52,039 --> 00:04:55,580
board of the cloud foundry foundation as

00:04:53,449 --> 00:04:57,020
a user so we're going through a change

00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:58,759
where users are taking a lot more

00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:01,009
control that's part of what's exciting

00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:02,720
about OpenStack and that's why on top of

00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:04,490
pretty much every OpenStack we're

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,620
starting to see interest or adoption of

00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:08,660
cloud foundry so having basically the

00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:10,430
evolution of a platform is key right so

00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:12,740
we'd like open shift France and with

00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:14,690
Amazon open shift open was a success you

00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:16,580
see some of that Dockers and Cooper

00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:18,740
Nettie's is emerging with Google Cloud

00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:20,300
and then dr. across clouds you've seen

00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:22,009
some success in this platform yeah

00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:23,060
what's the vision for cloud foundry in

00:05:22,009 --> 00:05:24,770
that regard because you got a lot of

00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:27,380
people betting the farm on Cloud Foundry

00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:30,320
I be IBM is one yeah HP's the other yeah

00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:31,580
so with the emergence of these Cooper

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,650
Nettie's with the doctors of the world

00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:35,330
and the pre-existing stuff you got red

00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:36,830
hat out they got a you know marant us

00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:38,509
out there doing some stuff yeah I said

00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:40,159
all this mean how does what is it how

00:05:38,509 --> 00:05:42,469
does a customer make sense of that I

00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:44,210
think a customer has to look at building

00:05:42,469 --> 00:05:46,789
a single platform to deliver business

00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:48,650
agility right it's not how many how fast

00:05:46,789 --> 00:05:50,389
can you get from A to B it's how fast

00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:52,639
can you turn the entire crank and what's

00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:54,050
been left behind is operators the ops

00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,340
people write the developers have been

00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:56,690
focused on the office people have been

00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:58,940
kind of left in the dark oh we got this

00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:00,650
done really fast but you know an IT ox

00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:02,930
is kind of dropped it on the floor right

00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:05,810
so so Cloud Foundry is something for

00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:07,520
mature enterprises to be able to say we

00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:09,320
have a full cycle of innovation we need

00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,759
to turn that crank every week and we

00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12,590
need to do that in multiple departments

00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:15,560
and here's a system that will actually

00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:17,270
let you dev test operate you know

00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:19,370
maintain bring all the way through the

00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:21,110
cycle read basically getting you to

00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:22,250
continuous innovation and we're at emc

00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:25,310
world and one of the things that came

00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:27,409
out that for me was the realization how

00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:28,430
we you know emcs certainly reorganize

00:06:27,409 --> 00:06:30,259
but they've got the core and they got

00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:32,900
the emerging group yes but they put the

00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:34,219
extreme IO in the core which is actually

00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,930
have a new stuff of them which is going

00:06:34,219 --> 00:06:38,089
to be right a sales killer for them it's

00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:39,139
going to really kick ass I'm really

00:06:38,089 --> 00:06:40,610
going to see I think they're going to

00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:42,349
run the table on that no doubt about it

00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:44,990
in the high end but that brings up the

00:06:42,349 --> 00:06:47,330
question of under the covers hardware is

00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:49,430
getting better and better with flash so

00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:50,930
you have the dynamic of not only the

00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:52,699
operators challenge and getting

00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:54,380
modernized if you will yep with cloud

00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:55,849
foundry you got the infrastructure as a

00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:57,740
service going on all this hardening

00:06:55,849 --> 00:06:59,389
going on in between the toes details of

00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:00,979
you know drivers Neutron ap has

00:06:59,389 --> 00:07:02,839
northbound southbound virtualization

00:07:00,979 --> 00:07:06,199
talking to each other then you got

00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:09,800
actually deployment yeah of gear yes q

00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:12,440
yeah I oh stuff my stream I of new

00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:14,690
storage v san for vmware you gots a nun

00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:16,580
broke a so there's all this like stuff

00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:19,010
going you got IBM SoftLayer right you

00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:20,419
got a very well as a service yes how

00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:22,339
does the ca I mean it's like changing

00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:24,260
the airplane engine out 35,000 feet and

00:07:22,339 --> 00:07:27,139
say oh yeah we got pads for agility like

00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:28,669
wow so they had a mind blow so that's

00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:30,529
how you have to think about it though so

00:07:28,669 --> 00:07:33,260
when you when you look at when you look

00:07:30,529 --> 00:07:36,260
at a platform for applications from the

00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:37,490
top down it's got to look very clean you

00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,599
want to have build packs you want to

00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,490
write a little bit of ruby a little bit

00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:42,289
of note a little bit of java right and

00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:43,639
have it just kind of run you don't want

00:07:42,289 --> 00:07:45,560
to see the duck paddling underneath

00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:47,389
which is what cloud foundry as a

00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,430
platform does and you certainly don't

00:07:47,389 --> 00:07:50,570
want that stuff to reproduce everything

00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:52,759
you've got in your infrastructure as a

00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:54,440
service layer so open stacks done a good

00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:56,000
job of being able to bring in all this

00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,139
different hardware innovation and you

00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,300
know surface it through you know the

00:07:57,139 --> 00:08:01,279
quantum API or the neutron API or it did

00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:03,589
the API centricity will open stacks been

00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:05,060
great that in turn let's cloud foundry

00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:06,560
leverage every single OpenStack

00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:08,300
deployment and make it really simple for

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,580
app developers if you think about what's

00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:12,469
an OpenStack app and OpenStack app is

00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:14,690
like you know high availability or

00:08:12,469 --> 00:08:16,219
network deployments or there's another

00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:18,199
an application developer thinks as an

00:08:16,219 --> 00:08:20,469
app its services yeah they think order

00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:23,599
to cash is an app or they think you know

00:08:20,469 --> 00:08:26,029
Nikes running app is an app or you know

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:28,460
the coke rewards is a nap they can't

00:08:26,029 --> 00:08:30,110
program to OpenStack they program a high

00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:32,089
level languages high productivity

00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:34,640
languages you need these Gentiles that

00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:36,829
needs a that needs a open source to land

00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,169
on needs cloud foundry which then turns

00:08:36,829 --> 00:08:40,699
around and sends that information so the

00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:43,039
question is questions how do you scale

00:08:40,699 --> 00:08:44,360
the paradigm of pass that's the

00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,430
fundamental question in the industry or

00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,980
does it matter that's the flip side so

00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:50,209
the the

00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:52,279
platform has to be clean above it has to

00:08:50,209 --> 00:08:53,420
be open below so none of us is smart

00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:55,269
enough to pick a winner like which

00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:57,800
container is going to win I don't hawker

00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:59,149
great docker files have already won the

00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:01,130
format war right we don't have to have

00:08:59,149 --> 00:09:03,709
the VHS versus Betamax conversation

00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:05,089
anymore there are 50 odd container

00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:06,529
companies that are venture capital fund

00:09:05,089 --> 00:09:09,500
it just in Silicon Valley right now or

00:09:06,529 --> 00:09:10,699
so I'm told me there's a lot of room in

00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,380
container innovation what about

00:09:10,699 --> 00:09:13,610
Microsoft they're coming out with their

00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:16,699
own container they're going beyond the

00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:18,380
job object so creating artificial bets

00:09:16,699 --> 00:09:20,320
within cloud foundry I think would be

00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:23,899
really foolish so what we try to do is

00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,880
run docker run rocket run garden run

00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:28,370
photon right run anything that comes up

00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:30,589
because that layer needs to be able to

00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:31,760
run whatever comes its way in terms of

00:09:30,589 --> 00:09:33,110
the Boche it needs to be able to run on

00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,820
OpenStack where it needs to be able to

00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:36,230
run on amazon web services how do you

00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,760
get portability for that whole

00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:39,829
application workload that's the really

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,269
big question if we can get two key

00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:43,310
things which is number one that

00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:45,350
portability number two ubiquity which is

00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:47,839
starting to be what we see were already

00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:50,360
installed in hundreds of global 2000 and

00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:52,370
if we can get installed in all of the

00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,600
global 2000 then we got ubiquity if we

00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:55,430
get those two things ubiquity

00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,589
portability then we create an ecosystem

00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:58,819
for is vs and I think that's the most

00:09:57,589 --> 00:10:00,769
exciting thing to me about cloud file

00:09:58,819 --> 00:10:02,420
you're looking down to three years in

00:10:00,769 --> 00:10:04,040
the future get some stability in the

00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:05,480
critical mass Yeah right you got that

00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:07,370
with with your partnerships yep

00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:10,870
certainly crossing industry yep create

00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:13,339
kind of an open but yet stable

00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:14,480
customizable place we do can put their

00:10:13,339 --> 00:10:16,850
code base whether that's really mixed

00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,980
versus a hippie they compete if they can

00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:21,529
also play with bluemix then you're

00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:23,750
saying okay differentiation can come on

00:10:21,529 --> 00:10:25,370
top yes that's the is VPS talk more

00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,990
about where you see the differentiation

00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:28,279
and the opportunities so there's two

00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:29,930
layers of differentiation one is what

00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:31,610
are the services you surround your cloud

00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:33,589
for every application with like IBM

00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:34,880
bluemix they include watson nobody else

00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:36,470
has got Watson right so they pump the

00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,720
wat wats an API right in there so people

00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:40,310
can make their apps smarter HP Helion

00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,810
right there differentiating by putting

00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:43,279
it on hardware and putting in you know

00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:44,839
systems monitoring and management that

00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,310
ties into the other stuff that you've

00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:49,160
got you know pivotal cloud foundry ties

00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:50,810
into all their data assets and you know

00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,160
large-scale analytics so that's the

00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:54,829
that's sort of the provider side stuff

00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:57,019
but but riddle me this right what's the

00:10:54,829 --> 00:10:59,660
largest tie is beyond the planet it's SI

00:10:57,019 --> 00:11:00,920
p they build cloud foundry that's

00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,220
interesting why do they do that right

00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,930
it'll

00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:04,639
I was them to have an isv population

00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:06,620
that builds on and around HANA cloud

00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:07,970
platform that they can say yeah we've

00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:10,189
got this thing that runs over on bluemix

00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:12,500
but when it runs on SI p on a honda

00:11:10,189 --> 00:11:13,459
cloud platform it does way more because

00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,930
we're able to get right into the

00:11:13,459 --> 00:11:16,550
fortress or we're getting getting right

00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:19,430
into these business flows another

00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:22,069
enormous is V is documentum right they

00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:23,899
handle vast quantities of what you might

00:11:22,069 --> 00:11:25,610
see at the lower level storage but it

00:11:23,899 --> 00:11:28,910
really it's it's documents and workflows

00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:30,500
and you know you know access control

00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:32,089
management that's built on Cloud Foundry

00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:34,069
and it's in the in the current release

00:11:32,089 --> 00:11:36,800
and why wouldn't you want to do that I

00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:38,480
mean that cal senior was pooh-poohing

00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,389
docker and then the next year at vmworld

00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,579
doctors his partner extension why were

00:11:41,389 --> 00:11:45,230
you not want to have that and that's

00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:46,579
exactly it you shouldn't belittle any

00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:48,769
technology that comes up you should

00:11:46,579 --> 00:11:50,420
define a platform that can bring any of

00:11:48,769 --> 00:11:51,529
those technologies in and manage them

00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,759
effectively and that's what Cloud

00:11:51,529 --> 00:11:54,500
Foundry is alright so there's a lot it's

00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:56,389
still early on it still like 2nd inning

00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:58,160
for in this business what are you most

00:11:56,389 --> 00:11:59,569
proud of right now because you know

00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,519
there's a lot of stats out there X

00:11:59,569 --> 00:12:03,079
number revenue now oh sure that gets

00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,160
booked and whose revenues comes from

00:12:03,079 --> 00:12:05,540
definitely you know we can always look

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,399
at that and you know squint through the

00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:10,220
the marketing but still successes

00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:11,839
success not like it's it's real numbers

00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:14,779
involved what are you most proud of

00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:16,430
what's going on the highlights I guess

00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:18,529
I'd say three things one is the

00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:21,170
awareness of Cloud Foundry is really

00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:23,170
strong we just did a 2,400 person eight

00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:26,420
countries survey including you know a

00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:29,809
Asian countries Western European

00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:31,910
countries us Cloud Foundry name

00:12:29,809 --> 00:12:34,370
recognition is very high and we see that

00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:36,709
happening because IT organizations are

00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:39,230
pulling it in second contribution is

00:12:36,709 --> 00:12:41,120
enormous we have over 2,000 contributors

00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:42,829
to Cloud Foundry so far and we see

00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,389
people are beating down the door to come

00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:46,579
into our dojo program with this very

00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:48,500
structured way of thoughtfully bringing

00:12:46,579 --> 00:12:50,360
people and getting that them to commit

00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:52,250
or status which is a big deal and then

00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:54,920
then the third thing is the ecosystem

00:12:52,250 --> 00:13:01,220
we're starting to see you know EMC IBM

00:12:54,920 --> 00:13:03,230
ASAP HP Intel GE right they each have

00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:06,230
huge partner networks so if you imagine

00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:07,730
each one expanding out right we have an

00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:08,990
ecosystem of ecosystems they're all

00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:11,089
starting to say the cloud foundry

00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:12,860
matters they're starting to transmit the

00:13:11,089 --> 00:13:15,110
cloud find your message get all of their

00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:16,940
partners on board so that makes us not

00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:20,390
only multi-cloud a multi-vendor but

00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:22,339
multi ecosystems so i think that that is

00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:24,350
a privilege to lead that because we have

00:13:22,339 --> 00:13:26,810
a lot of stuff that we can do try not to

00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:28,970
mess it up but it's starting to take its

00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:30,290
starting a starting to take attraction

00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:32,930
it's time to get traction in all those

00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:34,490
areas so that's I mean it makes people's

00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:36,079
i dilute the cloud foundry flag because

00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:37,610
then you know rising tide floats all

00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,930
boats so they say and then people can

00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:40,130
get behind and then see where it goes so

00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:41,720
I got to ask the next question which is

00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:42,920
definitely what worries you right now

00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,140
and you're worried about the delivery

00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:47,029
side of it i mean you know GE i've heard

00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:48,680
some rumblings you know as it's going

00:13:47,029 --> 00:13:50,630
fast got they have a huge different

00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:52,850
requirements also industrial cloud yet

00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:54,560
we the machines or big part of it so it

00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:56,750
might not be as touchy feely assay you

00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,459
know hyper scalar who might be running a

00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:00,589
web presence that's equipment over there

00:13:58,459 --> 00:14:01,760
different ones GE is a requirement and

00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:03,709
then you guys say could be someone in

00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,360
healthcare am deal or something so you

00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:07,130
have different use cases as these guys

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,720
start pushing out there so you worry are

00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:11,329
you what are you worried about and and

00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,250
and about cloud foundry right now what

00:14:11,329 --> 00:14:15,649
worries you at night mostly I stay up

00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:17,660
wondering if we're doing enough to get

00:14:15,649 --> 00:14:19,720
the message out broadly right because I

00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:21,790
do think that there's a once-in-a-decade

00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:24,290
replat forming it happens all the

00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:26,000
customers and prospects for cloud finder

00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:27,829
that I talked to her like yeah we kind

00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,600
of built this hand build platform as a

00:14:27,829 --> 00:14:30,920
service now we're starting to reassess

00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,779
do we want to do the hand-built thing do

00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:34,190
we want to go with open source what's

00:14:32,779 --> 00:14:35,779
our solution or we going public cloud

00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:38,029
private cloud there's there's a lot of

00:14:35,779 --> 00:14:39,199
confusion there if we can just get into

00:14:38,029 --> 00:14:40,820
each of those conversations before we

00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:42,620
even get there yeah right can we scale

00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:44,750
the message so that people realize this

00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:46,550
is already what you need if we don't do

00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:48,230
that then I think we have a few years of

00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:49,850
deep in efficiency and then maybe we

00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:51,649
maybe we fumble the ball right I'd hate

00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:53,600
to be you know Charlie round running up

00:14:51,649 --> 00:14:55,790
to kick the football again yeah you know

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,490
letting Lizzy pull it away so so I worry

00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:59,899
that we're not they were not succeeding

00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:01,490
fast enough with getting the mess and

00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,870
that's what we're is just viability in

00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:04,610
terms of roadmap is that's more of like

00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:06,410
just more of a comfort cross the bridge

00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:07,910
of cloud foundry and when you go into

00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:09,680
the conversations they're much more

00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:11,750
tactical and much more solution driven I

00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,220
think its name recognition right so

00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:15,199
you'll have developers who are thinking

00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:16,610
about continuous deployment and you know

00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,290
and before that continuous immigration

00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:20,000
they're like yeah you know got a

00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:21,560
container strategy and then I've kind of

00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,970
got some puppet chef scripts and I've

00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,920
got it all kind of wired together and

00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:26,660
we're really agile and then they go to

00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,139
IT and I t is like well I don't know how

00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,299
to manage

00:15:27,139 --> 00:15:30,470
and then they don't know what they're

00:15:29,299 --> 00:15:32,059
looking for and you know they call each

00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:33,619
other names and eventually I T goes okay

00:15:32,059 --> 00:15:35,149
I'm going to take over your scripts they

00:15:33,619 --> 00:15:37,279
don't know that this thing a cloud

00:15:35,149 --> 00:15:38,660
native application platform right many

00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:40,129
times they don't even know what pass is

00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:41,720
they don't know there's a there's a

00:15:40,129 --> 00:15:43,489
solution right it's like a guy who's

00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,839
trying to get through from one room to

00:15:43,489 --> 00:15:45,859
another and it keeps walking into the

00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:48,499
wall doesn't know there's something

00:15:45,859 --> 00:15:49,819
called a door so gets out I acts he

00:15:48,499 --> 00:15:52,249
starts chopping down the wall yeah

00:15:49,819 --> 00:15:53,899
you'll get through not the best way to

00:15:52,249 --> 00:15:55,129
get there so when I think about the

00:15:53,899 --> 00:15:57,980
awareness problem it's really not just

00:15:55,129 --> 00:15:59,480
cloud foundry alone but getting enough

00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:01,850
people to realize hey there's a better

00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:03,769
way there's one platform that can be a

00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:05,389
service that makes it easy for app

00:16:03,769 --> 00:16:07,160
developers to get it all of your IT I

00:16:05,389 --> 00:16:08,419
think it cut out that's the thing that

00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,439
we're missing a so share the audience

00:16:08,419 --> 00:16:10,790
right now for the folks that are like

00:16:09,439 --> 00:16:11,749
getting that might see to say hey this

00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:15,049
is pretty interesting I heard of Cloud

00:16:11,749 --> 00:16:19,220
Foundry great you know what's the high

00:16:15,049 --> 00:16:20,779
level cxo pitch I've heard docker are

00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:22,339
you know I can get another round of

00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:24,259
funding from Jerry Chen kicking ass

00:16:22,339 --> 00:16:26,059
Cooper Nettie's Google's pushing that

00:16:24,259 --> 00:16:27,829
yeah orchestration I've this is all my

00:16:26,059 --> 00:16:29,779
cloud stuff I've been thinking about so

00:16:27,829 --> 00:16:32,899
my brains fulham exploding my head's

00:16:29,779 --> 00:16:34,720
going to blow up yep break down what

00:16:32,899 --> 00:16:37,519
does all that mean containers

00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,480
orchestration cloud for the cxl out

00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:41,059
there's just trying to make a path

00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,739
decision yep on what to do yep what

00:16:41,059 --> 00:16:44,839
bridge to build for the future what is

00:16:42,739 --> 00:16:46,519
the kind of the executive conversation

00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:47,959
that the executive conversation that

00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:50,389
I've had that has been very effective is

00:16:47,959 --> 00:16:52,189
very simple the world is changing too

00:16:50,389 --> 00:16:55,160
fast to be able to adapt your business

00:16:52,189 --> 00:16:56,749
using the old ways reda mcgrath of

00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:58,429
Columbia Business School's put out a

00:16:56,749 --> 00:17:00,559
book called the end of competitive

00:16:58,429 --> 00:17:02,179
advantage you can't just own a market

00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:04,250
saturate it and lock it up for years

00:17:02,179 --> 00:17:05,510
these things are constantly changing so

00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:07,699
how does your business change it changes

00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:08,899
through software so what you need the

00:17:07,699 --> 00:17:11,659
solution to the end of competitive

00:17:08,899 --> 00:17:13,490
advantages continuous innovation you get

00:17:11,659 --> 00:17:15,169
there by delivering business value in

00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:16,819
little chunks all the time so you need

00:17:15,169 --> 00:17:19,429
to align your team businessperson

00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:22,059
developer ops they need to have set of

00:17:19,429 --> 00:17:24,470
software that supports them if you use

00:17:22,059 --> 00:17:26,990
your own ingredients and you build it

00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:28,850
Lego block by Lego block you will get

00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:32,510
continuous integration you'll get

00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:36,320
continuous you know activity you might

00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:37,340
not get all of that stuff shipped out to

00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,200
the market on the schedule you want

00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:41,149
because it breaks between development

00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,660
and operations so I'd say for the CXO

00:17:41,149 --> 00:17:46,340
whether you're see

00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:48,770
moc do cio CTO any of those you need to

00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:51,080
look at what is the sake of all of this

00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:53,330
work for it's for the sake of getting

00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:55,730
your business to continue continuous

00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:57,770
innovation to get there all this stuff

00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:59,750
has to be at harmony so you need you

00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:01,850
need to look at the system of containers

00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:03,860
orchestration platform infrastructure

00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:05,750
and say yeah do I get a harmonious whole

00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:07,040
if so then my business can actually win

00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,420
Dave Allen and I always talk about

00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,860
competitive strategy and the queue it's

00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,940
one of our like fun things we kind of

00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:12,800
riff around but you're right it's

00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:15,170
interesting competitive advantage the

00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:18,140
old way was locked down to create nested

00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:20,780
pneus in amid ability lock in and defend

00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:21,890
yep I invite the head and then but

00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:23,600
there's also a concept of barriers to

00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:24,530
entry yep I indifferently shift the

00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,390
difference when I'm a conversation

00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:28,400
various entry could be different right

00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:30,470
what I hear you saying is and we've seen

00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,500
this on the queue like an Amazon the

00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:35,620
speed and differentiation or barriers to

00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:38,720
entry is your speed and feature-rich

00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:41,510
this so there's a diseconomies of scale

00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:44,420
right you can build up an agile that's

00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:46,610
right competitive market by speed that's

00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:48,200
exactly right speed is the only speed of

00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:50,600
iteration and delivery of business value

00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:52,790
is the only barrier to entry now and if

00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:54,200
you don't make it you lose we've seen a

00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:55,130
lot of companies in retail and media go

00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,750
out of business the last five years

00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:58,280
because they haven't kept up but you

00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:59,780
can't believe that you can build a table

00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,830
and now you can build the best table in

00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:02,690
the world and you'll ship that for the

00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:04,130
next 50 years and you mustn't subtle

00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:05,480
it's interesting what you say but dear

00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:07,580
said is if your point about continuous

00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:09,080
innovation that builds a trajectory this

00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:11,330
is classic competitive strategy don't

00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:13,490
know one you can have an outcome have a

00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:16,100
trajectory on and then if someone tries

00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:18,230
to buy a table yes and bolt it in yes

00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:20,630
the diseconomies are how you learned we

00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:22,040
get there yep staff development that's

00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:24,470
barriers to entry yet would you agree

00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:26,300
yeah it's a flywheel right the faster

00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:28,460
that you're splitting the flywheel right

00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:29,690
on innovation on learning on trying on

00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,830
getting new products in the market on

00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:32,450
someone who succeeds some of them fail

00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:34,670
but you're learning along with your

00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:36,350
ecosystem one great frame references

00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:37,850
from Marshall Van Alstyne who's at the

00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:39,800
MIT center for digital business these

00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:41,600
days and he talks about platform

00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:43,760
economics he said in the old days it was

00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:46,730
you'd have products and you compete for

00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:48,920
customers you compete with other

00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:50,570
companies shipping the same thing these

00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:53,090
days you're shipping a platform and

00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:54,940
you're competing based on ecosystems for

00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:57,010
multi-sided markets with customers

00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:58,570
users developers deployers so it's a

00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:59,860
much bigger scale phenomenon if you're

00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:01,390
going to be really really successful now

00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:04,600
you have to build a plan now platforms

00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:07,300
are because of SAS and platform as a

00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:10,150
service yep you can try before you buy

00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:12,460
yes land and expand only by as you grow

00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:14,080
which creates interesting benchmark on

00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:16,180
the competitive piece of it that's right

00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:18,040
and as Marshall would tell you you know

00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:20,370
five of the top 10 companies on the

00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:22,600
planet x value our platform companies

00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:25,630
right bring this back down you got my

00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:26,980
attention I love it I'm on board I want

00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:28,840
to be competitive I want to have an

00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:30,160
advantage i buy it yeah see the

00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,930
trajectory I'm gonna build the core

00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:34,120
competency I'm going to iterate fast

00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:35,410
move fast add new features hire the

00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:37,630
development team great how do I get

00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:39,640
there what do I do next well for you go

00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:41,950
straight to github and unicode a cloud

00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:43,990
foundry you pull the sources down it's

00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:45,910
free it's portable is consistent it runs

00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:47,190
but the midships every months and then

00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:49,390
once you figure out what to do with it

00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:51,010
then you start figuring out where's my

00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:53,050
commercial support going to be right now

00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:54,700
I got hiring decisions i got a new staff

00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:56,140
decision that's right there's all kinds

00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:57,490
of other things that's right there's a

00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:58,570
whole context of that right so then you

00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,740
say you know am I going to work with

00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:01,360
Accenture am I going to work with

00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:03,010
mirantis right which part of the

00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,320
ecosystem I like am I going to go to and

00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:06,460
then am I going to write up myself on my

00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:08,260
premises I'm going to write it in a

00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:09,850
cloud what are the vendor relationships

00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:11,380
I'm comfortable with or am I going to

00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:13,060
build my own core competency to manage

00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:14,350
it myself that's a business decision we

00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:15,940
believe in the cube as we've been seen

00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:18,400
with the success amazon we called Amazon

00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:19,300
way years ago turns out you know they

00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,550
are making a shitload of money

00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:23,650
absolutely the way they release the way

00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:25,120
they move fast they do have a virtual

00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:26,860
bearish entry I guess the way when have

00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,480
we want to call it that is the future I

00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:31,150
totally agree with your thesis there one

00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:33,070
hundred percent Cloud Foundry obviously

00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:35,080
you guys are doing it all right came

00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:36,580
together division you guys just blocking

00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,930
and tackling we're shipping and shipping

00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:40,420
and shipping keeping it going what's

00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:41,470
next what's next for you guys what he

00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:43,360
gonna be next year what do you hope to

00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:44,710
have under your belt for next year under

00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,780
my belt so we've got about 40 members

00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:48,700
now a year from now I'd like to see 80

00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:50,290
members and I'd like to see the balance

00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:52,960
of those be users I think we're going to

00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:55,090
see a tremendous expansion in financial

00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,140
services and in telecommunications we

00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:58,240
already have great companies like

00:21:56,140 --> 00:22:01,000
swisscom on our board companies like

00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:03,250
Verizon as members I think CenturyLink I

00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,660
should make a strong point about a huge

00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:06,670
innovation coming from Centrelink and

00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:08,110
contribution in a cloud foundry I

00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:08,410
they're doing really well at the hybrid

00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:10,030
I to

00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:12,250
they're doing extremely well and here's

00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:14,710
the deal in phase 2 of cloud adoption

00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:16,990
there's a lot of discomfort with using a

00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:18,040
single giant provider based in Seattle

00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:21,870
right you don't want to just have your

00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:23,290
your whole strategy based on Amazon

00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:24,970
telecommunications companies are going

00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:25,930
to start building an inter cloud right

00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:27,430
they've already been doing it at the

00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:29,980
lower layer and appearing right you talk

00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:31,600
to equinix you talk to ATT at the top

00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:32,830
level they're all willing to give up a

00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,840
little bit of differentiation for

00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:37,180
portability to create one cloud market I

00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:38,890
hear it over and over again if operators

00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:41,890
can come back and provide a portable

00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:43,690
cloud environment on Cloud Foundry that

00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:45,160
you can move their pieces a bj they want

00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:47,650
to do that exactly everyone gets a piece

00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:50,980
of the pie so you know grow grow the pie

00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:52,480
make it available to to to everybody who

00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:53,770
wants to get on board and make sure that

00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,170
it's returning a lot of value of the

00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:57,730
members we differentiate herself I think

00:22:56,170 --> 00:23:00,280
from other open-source foundations in

00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:01,960
that we measure our success based on the

00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:03,970
commercial success of our members so we

00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:05,920
expect this to be a commercial

00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:07,210
sustainable ecosystem that continues to

00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:09,100
grow that's what we hold ourselves

00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:10,750
accountable for Sam thanks for coming on

00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,920
Cuban sharing your insight here at

00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:13,420
OpenStack something what's going on

00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,950
OpenStack quick quick and then I'll give

00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:16,540
you the last word OpenStack summit

00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:18,460
what's the vibe here I know you just got

00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:20,140
in town but in the ecosystem is there a

00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:22,660
feeling of movement is there a feeling

00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:24,670
of growth going to slow the pedaling

00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:26,740
faster what's going on yeah the vibe is

00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:29,290
really great Vancouver is a great place

00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:31,330
to have the summit there's a ton of

00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:32,590
people here they're all talking pretty

00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:33,640
happily I've met a lot of people that

00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:36,250
I've worked with on and off over the

00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:37,690
last couple decades I think they need to

00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:39,550
move towards having a reference

00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:41,350
implementation or a reference test and

00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:43,240
ref stack will be very very interesting

00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:44,500
to watch certainly selfishly it'll make

00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:46,360
it much easier for cloud founder you be

00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:48,280
successful if OpenStack has got a

00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:49,990
consistent landing point but I think

00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,760
it's going to help the whole OpenStack

00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:54,160
ecosystem work better if there's a

00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,900
fairly predictable path to OpenStack

00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,980
compatibility and already that there's

00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,630
reference architectures coming out from

00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:59,740
EMC brocade what know a lot of stuff

00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:01,390
happening yep so that's going to be

00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:03,640
really important right what it's

00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:04,870
expanded tremendously fast you can't and

00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:06,850
don't want to put the genie back in the

00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:08,410
bottle but you probably want to organize

00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:09,760
gave it a little easy system to have a

00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:11,800
little bit more shape a little bit more

00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,570
muscle you know sort of half so you know

00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:15,340
so they can be a good partner for all

00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:17,050
the other projects I'm going to have

00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:20,830
mutual dependency right pressures don't

00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:22,020
cloud foundry nodejs right opendaylight

00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:24,850
OPN of the

00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:26,740
openstack there's a there's a family

00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:28,480
here of open source projects that are

00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:30,370
making open data centers that people are

00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,230
deploying today the better that all

00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:34,270
these work together the more

00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:35,290
inefficiency we can remove from today

00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:36,610
and from there and then put the pressure

00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:38,230
is more than ever right now you got as

00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:40,300
yours kicking ass right now retooling

00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:41,830
moving all their installed base as your

00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:43,840
contributed co2 cloud founder you can

00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:46,300
run club found right now no open source

00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:48,700
code delivered by Microsoft to cloud

00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:50,560
foundry right here you go they donated

00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:51,700
Raven really changed they donated

00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:53,680
reference architecture the Open Compute

00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:55,480
I mean the gym CEO there's kicking some

00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:56,740
ass cube alumni as well they're pushing

00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,000
hard on open computer it's very

00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:59,800
interesting to see that I mean it's just

00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,970
a game changes the mindset shift but

00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:03,640
they gotta worry about that this is more

00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:06,340
pressure yes right this is this is a big

00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:08,020
player saying yeah this it validates the

00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:10,210
market in one hand but it gives the

00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:12,270
impression of pedal faster guys or you

00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:14,140
know come on it should be nice to see

00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:17,040
Microsoft consider taking on the

00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:19,930
OpenStack AP is something that

00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:21,310
CenturyLink is done is to OpenStack API

00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:23,440
compatibility even though they're not

00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:24,490
running OpenStack behind it to say look

00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,580
let's just have something that's

00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:28,930
consistent for is Amazon's already run

00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:30,280
hard and said you know we're the

00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:31,810
dominant people we're not going to take

00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:34,180
any attribute and put into our roadmap

00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:36,160
our api's are what they are and you can

00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:39,210
copy them but you'd have to be insane to

00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:42,070
do that for a player like Microsoft to

00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:44,140
cause OpenStack compatibility by taking

00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:45,520
on the OpenStack API Fraser I don't know

00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:47,260
if it'll ever happen they got the mouth

00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:49,240
that would be an amazingly good thing

00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:51,160
for them to do for the planet yeah and

00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:52,120
they could win the whole thing but okay

00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,650
well you and we're going to have a

00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:55,120
survey on Wikibon you can see a new

00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:57,160
survey coming out from us with data on

00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,600
as your the growth will numbers are

00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:00,390
going to pretty rock everyone when we

00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:02,980
should we share that pretty significant

00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:04,510
knowing thought they'd be the later that

00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:06,100
they are but they're winning so Sam

00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:08,110
thanks for coming on CEO of Cloud

00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:09,610
Foundry foundation making it happen

00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:11,320
congressional new successes the cube

00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:13,780
here live in vancouver british columbia

00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:16,090
for all the action for OpenStack summit

00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:18,240
here this year 2015 is to Cuba be right

00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:18,240
