Title: The Case for a Unified and Interoperable Open Cloud Ecosystem - Sam Ramji - OSCON 2016
Publication date: 2016-05-20
Playlist: Cloud Foundry CEO, Sam Ramji
Description: 
	Open source may have won, but without unification and interoperability, the victory could be short-lived. Thereâ€™s a pressing need for an open platform ecosystem. Sam Ramji explains why a platform should come with the expectation of an open and transparent approach. From containers to networking, storage to services, an open platform ecosystem must deliver pluggability as a core aspect of its approach to the data center stack. Sam describes the opportunity for an open cloud ecosystem and explores how transparency enables rapid innovation.

so I'm going to make the case for

00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:11,360
unified and interoperable open cloud

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,590
ecosystem I leave Cloud Foundry and

00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,510
there's a lot of conversation about open

00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:17,160
cloud so I thought in order to

00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:21,930
understand what this might mean I should

00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:23,640
do some research so looking at what we

00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:27,660
learn from open source how can we

00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:29,190
possibly apply that to open cloud open

00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,140
source as we've learned is a positive

00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:33,539
sum game right if you're familiar with

00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:36,030
game theory there's zero sum games where

00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:38,489
in order for you to win I have to lose

00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:40,770
or vice versa in a positive sum game

00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:42,530
like in the game of love the more that

00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:45,210
you offer the more that's available

00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:47,850
that's great but open source is also

00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:50,880
violent competition very different ideas

00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:52,590
about how to construct solutions to

00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:55,500
specific classes of technical problems

00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:58,680
all right so we can get a little heated

00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:01,800
but in violence there's collateral

00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:04,290
damage people who have adopted the wrong

00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:07,530
technology that loses the war end up

00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:09,270
with assets that are meaningless so we

00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:12,659
must agree to minimize this it's our

00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:15,209
responsibility I believe it's a matter

00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:16,859
of professional ethics what is it that

00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:18,600
we want to create what's the world we

00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:20,759
want to be maybe the most important

00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,770
question that we can ask is if

00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:25,529
communities are defined by their ethics

00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:28,020
our standards for behavior what's

00:01:25,529 --> 00:01:30,840
acceptable what's not acceptable how do

00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:33,079
we recover from bad situations how do we

00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,340
clean up after difficult conversations

00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:38,689
we have to ask ourselves what kind of

00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,689
community do we want to be

00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,340
