Title: Sam Ramji tells the story of the Cloud Foundry Phenomenon
Publication date: 2016-03-18
Playlist: Cloud Foundry CEO, Sam Ramji
Description: 
	Sam Ramji is the CEO of the Cloud Foundry Foundation. He says that there's never been a better time in human history to be a developer because there's never been a better time in human history for open source. He says that in the past open source was an outlandish idea advocated only by academics, but they were right and that's why the audience is now attending the Open Tech Summit.

Sam Ramji talks about some of the things the Cloud Foundry Foundation believes and advocates:

We are at the dawn of a new era because we all have supercomputers in our pockets and we're putting "all the things on the internet" This is leading to shifts in human behavior which is leading to shifts in business.

If business aren't able to make the shift, they will die. 52% of the 2000 Fortune 500 list are no longer on the list.

Sam Ramji cites The End Of Competitive Advantage by Rita Gunther McGRath. He says his most important takeaway is that "you must have an innovation proficiency."

Sam Ramji says open source is abut sharing, "Open source is about embracing basic economic principles that says we need to share. When we share non-rival goods like software, it accelerates all of us."

Sam Ramji cites Platform Revolution by Geoffrey G. Parker, Marshall W. Van Allstyne, and Sangeet Paul, Choudary. The looked at a bunch of different business models and observed how radically the competition changes. For example, it's no longer CBS vs. NBC, it's CBS & NBC vs Netflix. He asserts that it's because sharing is now the baseline default.

Sam Ramji says what gets him excited about this and why he's excited to be at the Open Tech Summit, is that instituting sharing by default at a start up is easy, but what about sharing by default at large institutions. He talks about GE's Predix service for managing infrastructure through IoT. He notes that yes, you can manage all that from your phone, but the software has to be written somewhere. He says where are you going to put the code to run your wind turbine? You're going to "cf push" it to cloud foundry.  He says that's the basis for continuous innovation.

Sam Ramji says that most folks talk about "continuous delivery" but they don't actually have it. He says in order to get out of the "waterscrumfall" approach to deployment, we need microservices, containers, and 12-Factor applications. That produces a world that is ephemeral, scalable, and agile.

Sam Ramji presents a quick view of Cloud Foundry:

00:00:04,056 --> 00:00:06,796
RAMJI: I'm going to use my telepathic powers to advance the slides.

00:00:07,296 --> 00:00:11,486
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:00:11,986 --> 00:00:14,536
Ah, there's help.

00:00:15,266 --> 00:00:17,726
So, I'm going to talk to you about the Cloud Foundry phenomenon.

00:00:18,636 --> 00:00:21,786
Tonight, you're all here because you know that it is the best time

00:00:21,786 --> 00:00:23,186
in human history to be a developer.

00:00:23,186 --> 00:00:27,166
That's because it's also the best time in human history for open source.

00:00:28,016 --> 00:00:32,196
This used to be something crazy, an insane collection of academics

00:00:32,196 --> 00:00:35,386
who thought computer science is something like math and everything should be free.

00:00:35,946 --> 00:00:36,946
Well, guess what?

00:00:36,946 --> 00:00:39,186
It should be; they were right; and, you're here.

00:00:39,856 --> 00:00:41,976
That has given rise to the Cloud Foundry phenomenon.

00:00:42,176 --> 00:00:45,236
So, our community is collaborative, it's open.

00:00:45,596 --> 00:00:46,896
We've got interesting speakers.

00:00:46,896 --> 00:00:50,066
This is Cory Doctorow from the Electronic Frontier Foundation looking

00:00:50,066 --> 00:00:51,996
at openness and freedom from every angle.

00:00:52,626 --> 00:00:55,166
Most importantly, we sit around together in person.

00:00:55,256 --> 00:00:59,176
We solve the digital divide arguing over emails and instant messenger

00:00:59,496 --> 00:01:01,756
and we actually work together around tables.

00:01:01,756 --> 00:01:04,716
Here are the things that bind us together.

00:01:04,716 --> 00:01:06,246
We believe that it's the dawn of a new era.

00:01:06,826 --> 00:01:09,286
We believe that you're carrying supercomputers in your pockets.

00:01:10,016 --> 00:01:12,286
We believe that you're driving supercomputers down the highways.

00:01:13,386 --> 00:01:16,646
Because WiFi is so cheap, we're going to put Internet on all the things.

00:01:17,346 --> 00:01:18,356
Internet on all the things.

00:01:19,476 --> 00:01:20,376
Because we can.

00:01:20,866 --> 00:01:22,286
There's been a shift in human behavior.

00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:28,776
So, who here has looked at their supercomputer since this show started?

00:01:30,466 --> 00:01:30,746
Okay.

00:01:30,746 --> 00:01:31,486
Now, be honest.

00:01:31,486 --> 00:01:33,966
Who has looked at the supercomputer since I started talking?

00:01:35,316 --> 00:01:37,576
That's a change in human behavior.

00:01:37,866 --> 00:01:38,426
Guess what?

00:01:38,426 --> 00:01:39,626
That's where you're making decisions.

00:01:39,626 --> 00:01:41,036
That's where you're consuming information.

00:01:41,346 --> 00:01:43,736
That's where your business is going to live and die.

00:01:43,986 --> 00:01:47,196
There is a shift in business matching the shift in human behavior.

00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:50,416
If you don't make the shift, the stakes are high.

00:01:50,576 --> 00:01:54,046
Since 2000, 52 percent of the Fortune 500 are no longer on the list.

00:01:55,326 --> 00:01:57,126
That is an epic level of mortality.

00:01:57,206 --> 00:02:00,186
It's not just that we are getting older and feeling like things are going faster.

00:02:00,696 --> 00:02:02,806
My son is now 18 and going to college

00:02:02,806 --> 00:02:06,156
in the same college I went to, UC San Diego, studying physics.

00:02:06,276 --> 00:02:08,796
That makes me feel old, knowing he's going to the exact same place.

00:02:09,366 --> 00:02:10,946
It is actually speeding up.

00:02:11,066 --> 00:02:13,776
And Rita Gunther McGrath, who is a professor at the Columbia business school,

00:02:14,296 --> 00:02:18,906
looked at the last 30 years of business and divided into two epics of 15 years each.

00:02:18,906 --> 00:02:22,506
And the first half was slow; the second half went fast.

00:02:23,116 --> 00:02:26,206
Looking at that, she wanted to come up with a recipe of how can you survive.

00:02:26,876 --> 00:02:29,186
The most important thing that I took away from her book --

00:02:29,186 --> 00:02:32,826
and I recommend you read it yourself -- is you must have an innovation proficiency.

00:02:33,656 --> 00:02:37,056
We talk about innovation, we often point sort of in a fuzzy way at Amazon

00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:38,826
and Netflix, but what is innovation really?

00:02:39,056 --> 00:02:40,806
It's about speed.

00:02:40,886 --> 00:02:43,056
Amazon's pace of innovation has been blistering.

00:02:43,736 --> 00:02:43,906
Right?

00:02:43,976 --> 00:02:49,456
Year over year, they were producing some single digits to tens to hundreds of new services.

00:02:49,806 --> 00:02:53,336
At their Reinvent last year they announced last year

00:02:53,336 --> 00:02:56,026
that they did 500 new services just in 2015.

00:02:57,836 --> 00:03:01,626
Imagine if you were producing 500 new services for your business every year.

00:03:01,626 --> 00:03:02,366
How would you get there?

00:03:02,716 --> 00:03:05,156
It's because their baseline is sharing by default.

00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:10,396
Open source is not crazy, open source is not just algorithms.

00:03:10,766 --> 00:03:15,946
Open source is embracing basic economic principles that says we need to share.

00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:20,216
When we share nonrival goods like software, it accelerates all of us.

00:03:20,696 --> 00:03:21,536
It takes discipline.

00:03:21,536 --> 00:03:25,586
So, here's a love letter from Jeff Bezos to his organization back

00:03:25,586 --> 00:03:27,386
in 2000 to give them their religion.

00:03:28,236 --> 00:03:29,266
I'll summarize it for you.

00:03:29,266 --> 00:03:32,016
All teams will henceforth expose their data and functionality

00:03:32,016 --> 00:03:34,296
through service interfaces -- that's APIs.

00:03:35,216 --> 00:03:36,916
Anyone who doesn't do this will be fired.

00:03:37,786 --> 00:03:38,786
Thank you, have a nice day.

00:03:38,786 --> 00:03:41,866
There's actually an Easter egg in there.

00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:44,456
He didn't really say thank you, have a nice day.

00:03:45,926 --> 00:03:49,606
So, that's how they get this kind of pace, discipline and commitment,

00:03:49,966 --> 00:03:52,346
because their new baseline is sharing by default.

00:03:53,516 --> 00:03:57,096
Now, there are a few researchers at M.I.T. who put together a book called platform revolution.

00:03:57,096 --> 00:03:57,646
It's out now.

00:03:57,906 --> 00:04:00,496
It's by Geoffrey Parker, Marshall Van Alstyne and Sangreet Choudary.

00:04:01,096 --> 00:04:03,856
They looked at a bunch of different business models that we've all heard of.

00:04:03,906 --> 00:04:05,266
And we wonder...I'm going to, I'm sorry.

00:04:05,266 --> 00:04:09,486
There are 60 slides and I have 600 seconds so they're going

00:04:09,486 --> 00:04:12,126
to go fast, but I will post the entire deck.

00:04:12,216 --> 00:04:13,116
It's all Creative Commons.

00:04:13,116 --> 00:04:16,596
So, they looked at these businesses and they thought, wow, what do they have in common?

00:04:16,746 --> 00:04:18,246
Why is it always up and to the right?

00:04:19,956 --> 00:04:22,686
Why has competition changed?

00:04:22,686 --> 00:04:25,676
Why is it that McGraw-Hill and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt don't look

00:04:25,676 --> 00:04:26,836
at each other as the competition?

00:04:27,286 --> 00:04:29,986
It's not book publishers; it's a nonbook publisher.

00:04:30,476 --> 00:04:33,756
It's not NBC and CBS media companies; it's Netflix taking it all away.

00:04:34,196 --> 00:04:37,486
This fundamental basis of competition has changed

00:04:37,956 --> 00:04:39,726
because the new baseline is sharing by default.

00:04:39,726 --> 00:04:40,656
How do I share my movies?

00:04:40,656 --> 00:04:42,166
How do I share my cars?

00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:45,646
Do you know Uber's valuation is higher than that of Toyota?

00:04:47,256 --> 00:04:48,946
It's about the same valuation as Ford.

00:04:50,126 --> 00:04:53,736
They don't make any cars because they figured out how to do sharing.

00:04:53,736 --> 00:04:58,956
What gets me excited and the reason I'm excited to be here at OTS is startups are easy.

00:04:59,196 --> 00:05:01,366
I've done five startups; I've been at four big companies.

00:05:01,816 --> 00:05:02,966
Startups and no constraints.

00:05:02,966 --> 00:05:03,936
They can do anything.

00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:07,046
They're all so hard, the companies can die.

00:05:07,316 --> 00:05:11,686
But when you take the leaders in insurance, in heavy industry, in telecommunications

00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:14,846
and they start getting this sharing by default, crazy thinks happen.

00:05:15,326 --> 00:05:18,446
So, GE announced the launch of Predix last week.

00:05:19,056 --> 00:05:20,226
Pretty epic software.

00:05:20,496 --> 00:05:25,156
This is a cloud just for the Internet of Things, for heavy industry: for managing giant things,

00:05:25,156 --> 00:05:27,966
aircraft, trains, power plants, hospitals.

00:05:29,086 --> 00:05:31,676
Why hasn't that revolution made it to your supercomputer yet?

00:05:31,926 --> 00:05:32,506
Oh, it has.

00:05:33,256 --> 00:05:35,786
What if you could manage all that infrastructure from your phone?

00:05:35,786 --> 00:05:38,586
But that code's got to be written somewhere.

00:05:38,586 --> 00:05:40,996
So, here's the coolest line that I've seen in a long time.

00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,576
Yes, you need to write code that runs on wind turbines.

00:05:45,576 --> 00:05:46,296
Where are you going to put it?

00:05:46,296 --> 00:05:50,216
You're going to put it in Cloud Foundry and you can just CF push to a wind turbine.

00:05:51,286 --> 00:05:55,056
That is the basis of continuous innovation: knowing that you can make changes all the time

00:05:55,056 --> 00:05:58,976
in real time, have them land on the servers, no change is going to kill you

00:05:58,976 --> 00:06:00,936
because you've got an entire stack.

00:06:00,936 --> 00:06:01,996
Continuous integration.

00:06:02,086 --> 00:06:03,826
Your code is always up to date.

00:06:03,876 --> 00:06:07,046
Everybody knows the true good state of your infrastructure.

00:06:07,506 --> 00:06:08,526
Continuous delivery.

00:06:08,526 --> 00:06:09,776
Getting all that stuff to production.

00:06:10,766 --> 00:06:12,146
Continuation innovation as a result.

00:06:12,336 --> 00:06:16,216
Building business value, making changes, day by day, minute by minute,

00:06:16,216 --> 00:06:19,336
to make sure that your learning about the market is immediately reflected

00:06:19,336 --> 00:06:20,126
in what you have to offer.

00:06:21,146 --> 00:06:21,836
But there's a catch.

00:06:22,846 --> 00:06:26,216
Most people talk about continuous delivery but they don't actually have it.

00:06:26,216 --> 00:06:27,926
Still takes six months to provision a server.

00:06:29,446 --> 00:06:31,806
It's not quite the same as an API call in six seconds.

00:06:32,796 --> 00:06:33,976
That's an anti pattern.

00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:35,686
Any of you living through this?

00:06:38,016 --> 00:06:40,386
So, if that feels horrible, good, it should feel horrible.

00:06:40,386 --> 00:06:41,436
Waterscrumfall.

00:06:41,596 --> 00:06:44,606
It's a beautiful little agile thing stuck in the middle of a very slow process.

00:06:45,306 --> 00:06:49,096
To get out of the waterscrumfall, you need to enter a new world.

00:06:49,096 --> 00:06:51,836
It's one built in microservices, bits of code.

00:06:52,056 --> 00:06:54,906
Tens or hundreds of lines; not thousands or millions.

00:06:55,066 --> 00:07:00,276
Containers, consistently packaged images that can be run on any set of infrastructure.

00:07:00,276 --> 00:07:01,586
[12] factor applications.

00:07:01,976 --> 00:07:05,556
Take out the state, take out the security, take out the identity.

00:07:05,556 --> 00:07:08,266
Put it in a service that you can rely on and across all the apps.

00:07:09,116 --> 00:07:10,606
This produces a world as ephemeral.

00:07:10,606 --> 00:07:12,316
It's scalable, it's agile.

00:07:12,736 --> 00:07:14,716
It's ephemeral because everything is coming and going quickly.

00:07:14,866 --> 00:07:16,536
Containers arise, containers depart.

00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:18,716
Network routes arise, network routes depart.

00:07:18,756 --> 00:07:21,856
It's scalable because now we can just add up more capacity.

00:07:22,036 --> 00:07:23,366
Or we can shrink that capacity.

00:07:23,726 --> 00:07:27,616
And it's agile because no one change will kill you; you can keep making changes all the time.

00:07:28,146 --> 00:07:28,816
We run in the cloud.

00:07:29,136 --> 00:07:33,216
We support any client device because we know there will be 50 billion devices in a couple

00:07:33,216 --> 00:07:34,926
of years and most of them haven't been invented yet.

00:07:36,386 --> 00:07:39,156
So, we have to be able to prepare for unpredictable clients.

00:07:39,586 --> 00:07:42,436
We have to be able to connect to legacy data and process by APIs.

00:07:42,596 --> 00:07:46,776
If you don't, you'll join the Fortune...the Golden 2000

00:07:46,776 --> 00:07:48,256
and Fortune 500 who aren't on the list.

00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:52,606
A quick view of Cloud Foundry is it's a platform that brings everything together.

00:07:52,606 --> 00:07:54,786
We run on OpenStack all the time.

00:07:54,786 --> 00:07:57,896
I'd say probably half of our deployments globally are in OpenStack.

00:07:57,896 --> 00:07:59,166
But we also run in Amazon.

00:07:59,606 --> 00:08:03,386
We also run on VMware [vsware] because we believe that you need multicloud...

00:08:03,466 --> 00:08:05,266
VOICE: And SoftLayer.

00:08:05,266 --> 00:08:06,996
RAMJI: And SoftLayer.

00:08:07,626 --> 00:08:10,136
We know your apps need to run wherever you want them to.

00:08:10,876 --> 00:08:13,496
We know you need elastic runtime to scale them up and down.

00:08:13,976 --> 00:08:16,966
You need a services tier to be able to attach to the things that you care about --

00:08:17,466 --> 00:08:20,006
things in your company or outside your company, like Twilio

00:08:20,006 --> 00:08:22,206
or some API that you found on API Harmony.

00:08:23,216 --> 00:08:27,446
And operations -- a lights-out operations platform that just lets things scale up

00:08:27,446 --> 00:08:29,836
and scale down without adding extra administrators.

00:08:29,986 --> 00:08:34,406
It's about right-sizing digital innovation like the Japanese did at Toyota in the 1950s.

00:08:34,926 --> 00:08:38,006
Focused on cycle time optimizations, smaller teams and faster tools.

00:08:38,326 --> 00:08:39,746
Bring dev and ops together.

00:08:40,496 --> 00:08:47,076
That's what Cloud Foundry is for: harmonizing dev and ops to give you innovation at speed.

00:08:47,636 --> 00:08:50,286
Now, there's a little bit of a quick history lesson here.

00:08:50,826 --> 00:08:55,696
We owe a lot of heritage to great thinking by companies like Google, inventing Borg

00:08:55,696 --> 00:08:57,246
and donating Cgroups to the Linux kernel.

00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:59,756
All of these technologies you'll hear about.

00:09:00,736 --> 00:09:03,786
They have a shared history, but they have a different orientation.

00:09:03,786 --> 00:09:07,356
So, Cloud Foundry is a platform as opposed to a do it yourself approach.

00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:09,666
It's not an either/or; you can do whatever you want.

00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:12,656
But when you need things to run, when you need login, when you need staging,

00:09:12,906 --> 00:09:16,316
when you need core services, when you need a service broker, when you need a database

00:09:16,316 --> 00:09:19,866
that has the true state of the system at all times, you're going to pick Cloud Foundry.

00:09:20,616 --> 00:09:25,106
In the past, it wasn't as open as it could be, but now we've brought in a new era

00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,416
of open collaboration through foundations.

00:09:27,936 --> 00:09:31,006
With the existence of open containers, we've been able to work with Docker

00:09:31,006 --> 00:09:34,196
in the Docker community to run Docker correctly on Cloud Foundry,

00:09:34,576 --> 00:09:37,626
to be able to say containers are built in and we love them all

00:09:38,376 --> 00:09:40,626
because the new baseline is sharing by default.

00:09:42,246 --> 00:09:44,276
Because the new baseline is sharing by default,

00:09:44,356 --> 00:09:46,456
here are all the companies shipping Cloud Foundry.

00:09:46,456 --> 00:09:49,106
So, when I talk about multicloud, I also mean multivendor.

00:09:49,106 --> 00:09:50,816
I mean, multiple footprints.

00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:52,516
I mean multiple deployment models.

00:09:52,896 --> 00:09:56,616
Because you need to not care where your app needs to go in the future;

00:09:56,746 --> 00:09:59,776
you just need to build a great app and move it wherever it needs to go.

00:10:00,726 --> 00:10:05,846
Because that new baseline is sharing by default, we find that customers love it.

00:10:06,746 --> 00:10:08,126
My favorite headline from last year.

00:10:09,386 --> 00:10:10,486
We had nothing to do with this.

00:10:10,486 --> 00:10:13,746
Bank of New York Mellon and JPMorgan Chase came to The Wall Street Journal and said,

00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:16,456
Cloud Foundry prevents vendor lock-in, we love this.

00:10:19,026 --> 00:10:21,826
So does the U.S. government -- so if you go to cloud.gov,

00:10:21,826 --> 00:10:24,976
you'll find some of the best documentation of a Cloud Foundry infrastructure anywhere.

00:10:26,866 --> 00:10:27,956
The foundation has grown.

00:10:28,206 --> 00:10:32,076
We are blessed by the goodwill and strength of many of you in the room.

00:10:32,246 --> 00:10:36,236
We have...we're privileged to have many users among our ranks.

00:10:36,586 --> 00:10:40,066
It's not just vendors; it has been balanced to this environment,

00:10:40,066 --> 00:10:44,286
balanced to this open source project so that producers, consumers become equal.

00:10:45,216 --> 00:10:49,236
So, in this process of rebalancing the system towards user driven roadmaps and control

00:10:49,236 --> 00:10:54,016
of the upstream project, we're also diving in deeply to particular areas: financial services,

00:10:54,066 --> 00:10:56,786
industrial IoT, telecommunications and government.

00:10:57,566 --> 00:11:01,286
And we have focused at the foundation on certification to guarantee portability of apps

00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:05,456
across clouds to make it last and durable and to build the ecosystem of opportunity.

00:11:06,616 --> 00:11:09,156
So, with that, Cloud Foundry is certified.

00:11:09,536 --> 00:11:13,096
I'm very proud to say that IBM Bluemix is one of the very first companies to certify

00:11:13,216 --> 00:11:15,636
on Cloud Foundry, and that we share a wonderful common vision.

00:11:15,636 --> 00:11:17,016
