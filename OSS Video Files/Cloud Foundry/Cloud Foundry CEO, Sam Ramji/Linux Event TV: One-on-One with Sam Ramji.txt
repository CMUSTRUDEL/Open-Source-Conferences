	00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:14,450
I am fascinated by multi-sided markets

00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:16,640
so what we're seeing is all sorts of

00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:18,619
established old companies and some new

00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,590
companies are coming out try to find

00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:23,630
ways to create value for not just

00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:25,430
themselves not just their customers but

00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:27,650
also for their indirect value chain

00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:29,720
right so for developers and sometimes

00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:31,550
developers at multiple levels software

00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,689
and hardware innovations what's

00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:35,449
interesting is that it's not just

00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:37,550
happening with Linux or with Microsoft

00:00:35,449 --> 00:00:39,620
during the tech environment we're seeing

00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:42,170
you know Sears we're seeing TD

00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:44,870
Ameritrade we're seeing 80 we're seeing

00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:46,010
General Motors doing these crazy things

00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:48,290
in becoming software and technology

00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:49,970
companies so they're trying to learn

00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:52,040
from what we've built you know in the

00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:55,190
technology world about building a

00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:56,290
platform and creating win-win-win

00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:59,780
outcomes right these sort of

00:00:56,290 --> 00:01:01,729
collaborative you know good results in

00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:03,110
better improving people's lives making

00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:06,580
more money right making things more

00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:06,580
efficient that's really exciting for me

00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,440
whether there's a mix of addictions

00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,780
they're right there there's technology

00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:18,450
there's the rate of change there's

00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,190
learning from many new people I think so

00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:21,990
many of us are our knowledge and

00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:23,880
learning junkies right you sort of love

00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:25,619
that ramp where you hit something new

00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,470
and your learning curve goes straight up

00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:29,220
and people are willing to share

00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:30,450
explanations of what's happening and

00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,010
then they're willing to share the code

00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:34,320
that implements what's happening which

00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:35,610
is amazing one of the most inspiring

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,130
books I've read in the last few years

00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:41,040
was by Robert right he wrote a book

00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:43,170
called nonzero he said what has been the

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,000
continual arc through human history is

00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:48,149
that we found more ways to call more

00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,530
people self instead of other and trust

00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:52,680
each other right so there's this sort of

00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:54,869
game theory basis of nonzero positive

00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,580
some games the more people you can bring

00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:58,680
into a nonzero game the better

00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:00,509
everything becomes so for me open

00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,660
sources or this very practical

00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:05,009
measurable demonstrable example of how

00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:06,750
this is this is really part of our

00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:08,729
evolving way of how we can treat each

00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,820
other and you know produce better

00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,820
outcomes

00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:17,690
software-defined networking I think is

00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:19,730
quite amazing open flow in particular

00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:22,400
obviously as a technology and how that's

00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:25,580
going to impact linux and open source

00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,950
the opportunity to create all of the

00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:30,520
agility that we have in software down at

00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:33,550
what has been really a very rigorous

00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:35,690
almost ossified layer in the network

00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:37,640
nobody's fault that it's ossified it was

00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:39,140
built that way because at that time it

00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,000
was the only way that they could solve

00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:43,430
really hard problems but opening that up

00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,840
to people who can write code in many

00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:46,700
different languages come up with new

00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:49,070
ways to control the network new ways to

00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:50,990
understand and represent it there's a

00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:52,400
huge opportunity for just making

00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:54,590
everything we're doing easier and faster

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,320
but also bringing in a whole new field

00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:58,820
of software engineers developers right

00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:01,310
to start to participate and think about

00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:04,600
new ways we can use the network so I'm

00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:04,600
