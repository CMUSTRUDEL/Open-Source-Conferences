Description: 
	The Chief Digital Officer Global Forum will focus exclusively on strategic best practices and facilitate high-touch, engaging debate and discussion about key issues and trends in regards to reaching, engaging, converting, and nurturing long-term customer relationships with the increasingly demanding, and often-elusive, connected consumer.  The Global Forum will discuss the new consumer engagement funnel, rapidly-evolving connected consumer behavior and consumption patterns and trends, insights into the minds of digital consumers, digital marketing best practices, current and emerging content distribution platforms, the state of digital commerce and we'll take-a-peek into the future at our traditional "Postcards From The Edge" closing keynote.
Format

The inaugural Chief Digital Officer Executive Forum will offer a mix of "pre-conference" private sessions for qualified digital operating executives and compelling and engaging keynotes, interviews, and high-caliber panels along with ample networking time and unique off-campus social activities for all attendees of the Executive Forum. Overall, the agenda will be balanced and include sessions focusing on timely, relevant industry trends and issues along with sessions that are designed to stimulate thinking, demand consideration of alternative viewpoints, and help our delegates foster creativity and innovation within their organizations and acquire new leadership and negotiation skills.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,570
been an amazing conference my brain is

00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:05,100
absolutely full of new knowledge and

00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,899
hopefully I'll be able to repay the

00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,820
favor a lot of the conversations have

00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:10,469
been around digital advertising media

00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,420
how to get to consumers I'm going to

00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:14,009
take you a little bit inside what we're

00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:16,560
seeing some of the world's top brands do

00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:19,590
with technology so we talk about the

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,660
power of apps and ap is the top three

00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:25,140
reasons that chief digital officers use

00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:27,810
apps and AP is is loyalty engagement in

00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:30,179
commerce it's not about improving your

00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:32,160
media by it's not about your TV

00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:34,020
placement it's about taking the product

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,790
and service their brand relationship you

00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,230
have with consumers putting in their

00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:40,079
pocket and making it something they want

00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:41,640
to come back to every day so why should

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,559
you listen to us we've worked with a

00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,050
hundred thousand developers support

00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:47,670
about 25,000 apps and we've done that in

00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:49,950
the last four years it's an amazing

00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:51,780
burgeoning landscape it's like

00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:54,870
evolutionary biology at work things are

00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,640
changing constantly we've also seen the

00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:58,680
connection between apps and brands so

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,480
we've had the opportunity to build a

00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,129
customer base of 500 enterprise

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,870
customers with half of the top hundred

00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:07,260
global brands and half of the top

00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:08,460
retailers here are two thoughts on two

00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,470
sections on what we've learned first

00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:13,350
every digital every business as a

00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:15,240
digital business second every business

00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:16,799
needs a digital platform we're seeing

00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,140
these being constructed on a constant

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,150
basis some failures some successes i

00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:22,619
want to share what works then finally

00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:25,470
every business has a chief digital

00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:26,759
officer raise your hand if you are a CDO

00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:30,630
or you work for the CEO in your

00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:33,150
organization so we have a few left based

00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:34,650
on the content I've seen so far many of

00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:36,840
you are coming from a marketing

00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:38,549
background with some technology

00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,409
discipline rather than a technology

00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:43,829
background move into a marketing

00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:45,630
discipline what we've seen in general is

00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:47,939
that there's about a 50-50 split between

00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:49,979
people who have titles or roles of chief

00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:51,299
digital officer in a company so one of

00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:52,740
the things that we've started to learn

00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:54,630
is with the job description of what

00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:56,100
makes that person successful I'll tell

00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:58,619
I'll talk about those components at the

00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:01,189
end in terms of being a digital business

00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:05,310
we think of digital business as being

00:02:01,189 --> 00:02:07,799
shaping behavior at scale Walgreens does

00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:10,940
anybody use the walgreens app so

00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:13,020
walgreens had a problem which was

00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:13,770
falling foot traffic into their stores

00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,540
as you know

00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,950
and caps all the things that we like to

00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:19,260
drive people to purchase the drive our

00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:20,990
core core business was starting to die

00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:23,580
away because people were getting

00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:25,890
pharmacy refills over the web they were

00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:27,900
starting to get the satisfaction of

00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:29,430
sharing a photo produced by digital

00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,410
media rather than actually printing a

00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:33,120
photo so what they did is they put an

00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:36,180
API around the store they said we want

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,650
to project a digital impression of a

00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:40,050
physical store and drive people back

00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:41,610
into the store so this goes back to the

00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:44,040
comments that Frank was making yesterday

00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:45,870
about physical is hot it's about using

00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,370
the app in your pocket to drive

00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:49,770
behaviors that you already find value

00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:51,720
from to get back into the store what

00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:53,610
they found was pretty amazing on average

00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,470
walgreens will get about a hundred two

00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:57,780
hundred dollars per month depending on

00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:59,940
where you are in the in the country from

00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:02,940
a given customer their share of wallet

00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:05,190
increases six-fold if that customer is

00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:07,260
also using their app along with their

00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:09,240
website because it gives you really

00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:11,340
useful things pill reminders you can

00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,930
scan refills you can print photos

00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:15,660
directly from Instagram or wherever

00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:17,580
you're wherever your your photos reside

00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:19,380
and produce them in the store which

00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:21,150
draws you back into the store generating

00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:22,920
traffic they're doing a pre script of

00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:24,600
prescription refill every second right

00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:28,080
now and they want an Innovation Award

00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:29,850
for the quality of the app their return

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,590
on investment compared to a digital

00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:37,100
advertising by catastrophic better

00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:39,660
second example and again all of us have

00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:42,480
the Nike experience you can't help it

00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:44,730
right there everywhere fascinating here

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,410
is that Mike nike has just about turned

00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:48,540
off their print advertising you will not

00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:50,280
see a lot of TV advertising from Nike

00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:52,200
these days because the performance of

00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,150
the digital campaign to shape people's

00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,490
behavior at scale has been phenomenal

00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:58,790
now today I'm wearing a suit usually I

00:03:56,490 --> 00:04:01,500
wear my nike shoes and a nike shirt

00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:03,480
because Nike keeps telling me every time

00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,010
I check in with my Fuelband competing

00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,930
with my friends getting that experience

00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:08,790
on my mobile app and then going back to

00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:11,520
the website oh we know you're a runner

00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:12,630
we have on a 120 dollar pair of shoes

00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:15,300
that you didn't know you needed to buy

00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:16,980
but now you'll pick up so their profits

00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:18,450
are up their revenues are up their

00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:21,030
market cap has doubled since introducing

00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:22,560
this product this is a amazing response

00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:24,540
from a company that used to be a t-shirt

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,090
and shoe company and is now the digital

00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,570
leading leading digital sports lifestyle

00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:29,850
company

00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:32,070
so how does that apply to your

00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:34,080
businesses we've done we have a think

00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:38,180
tank called the apogee institute and we

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:42,150
do placed panels of CTOs CMOS and CIOs

00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:44,790
we had a split serve a half CIOs have

00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:46,650
CMOS in 30 industries with company's

00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:48,570
revenue over 500 million dollars

00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:51,780
annually ranging up to about 20 billion

00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:54,060
dollars here's what we found this idea

00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:55,950
of digital business we're going beyond

00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,840
just advertising but actually engaging

00:04:55,950 --> 00:05:00,690
and wrapping your business in a digital

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,150
halo so that you can draw in your

00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:04,560
existing customers get new customers

00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:06,360
increase your loyalty your engagement

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,580
your commerce had these kinds of

00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,950
outcomes dabblers who say you know we've

00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:12,990
kind of checked the box we have a nap we

00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:15,120
have some in app advertising we have an

00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:16,740
API but aren't really committed don't

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,840
have a chief digital officer don't have

00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:20,310
a strategy they're not performing that

00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,350
well right they're not that efficient

00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:24,270
customer satisfaction hasn't improved

00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:26,130
that much revenue hasn't improved that

00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:27,150
much but look at the leaders let me take

00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:30,270
you through what the leaders have done

00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:32,160
differently they built digital platforms

00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:35,430
to compete in this mobile driven era of

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,960
information technology what Dave said in

00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:39,090
the last session was phenomenal right

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,980
mobile first changes everything you need

00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:43,140
to re-engineer and think about how do

00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:44,760
you unleash your employees how do you

00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:46,260
want to lease your agencies how do you

00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:48,270
lonely unleash every part of your

00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:50,160
ecosystem so that you can be generating

00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:51,960
these net new experiences that produce

00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,700
the business results you want it's not

00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,500
about grabbing eyeballs certainly not

00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:58,560
about horrible banner ads it's about

00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:01,290
rapid development of apps because apps

00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,150
or where the behavior happens the second

00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:05,910
part of a digital platform is a pis

00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:08,540
api's drive behavior by delivering data

00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:10,440
apps if I give you different data

00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:12,030
dynamically based on what we know about

00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,290
the user based on the offers that you

00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:16,680
have based on the content that's the

00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:18,000
latest based on the new new news that's

00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,680
going to change behavior at scale

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,810
because you've got 20 million instances

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,990
of the app each person is running it on

00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:26,820
2.3 devices those app experiences are

00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:28,800
coherent and they drive behavior at

00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:31,590
scale but many companies aren't

00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,150
attacking this effectively this is the

00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:34,770
way you get one point of consistency

00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:37,380
across all of your channels whether

00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:39,190
they're a web channel a device channel a

00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:41,920
social channel a partner

00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:43,510
and then finally big data our

00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:45,130
perspective on big data is it's all

00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:48,400
about understanding behavior at scale

00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:50,200
the problem with this enormous system of

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,390
all these signals is which ones are

00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,530
really signals which ones are noise when

00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:55,120
you've collected all the different

00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:56,680
button clicks in your app when you've

00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,480
collected all the Geo locations of

00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,190
everything you've got terabytes and

00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:02,710
petabytes of data most of it meaningless

00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:04,210
so how do you use technology to sift

00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:06,790
through that and bring the noise down

00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:08,830
and bring the signal out so this is how

00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:11,170
we've observed digital platforms getting

00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:13,090
built so hopefully this demystifies some

00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:16,810
of the conversations about apps api's

00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:18,670
and big data this following diagram has

00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:20,140
been very helpful and enabling people to

00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:22,450
understand how they're all connected it

00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:24,490
starts with mobile first and it's

00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:27,070
consumption-driven starting over with

00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:28,450
the user thinking about how do we

00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:30,550
surround the user with a great app

00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:32,140
experience that's the first step who's

00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,400
going to build it as the second step is

00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:35,620
it going to be an internal developer and

00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:37,330
agency develop or someone else that way

00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:39,100
because of that it has to be self serve

00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:41,230
you want people to come to you with

00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:43,480
functioning prototypes I had this great

00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:45,550
idea for customer experience it looks

00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:48,430
like this here it is using a little bit

00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:50,950
of live data then you rely on your API

00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:52,630
team this is typically organized into

00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:53,980
business development marketing and

00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:55,840
engineering a lot of people make the

00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:58,660
mistake of thinking this is simply a

00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:01,150
technology engagement and then finally

00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:02,860
leaning into the scale that you have to

00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:04,750
deal with web scale and carrier grade

00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:07,180
the two comments I want to make here are

00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:08,169
first of all web scale means tons of

00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:10,990
traffic from all over the world

00:08:08,169 --> 00:08:12,430
constantly the way that your systems

00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,960
have been built to handle the web

00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:17,050
monetize the web to measure the web

00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:18,640
that's all fundamentally broken in the

00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:20,530
world of apps how do you do beaconing in

00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:22,690
apps you can't unless you're just doing

00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:24,220
advertising how do you get analytics

00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:26,650
back from this entire system it's very

00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:28,270
difficult and you need to be able to

00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:29,440
handle it at carrier-grade what we're

00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,910
starting to see is businesses are

00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,849
thinking themselves not just as digital

00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:35,800
but being a business as a platform right

00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:37,450
be the salesforce com of your industry

00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,830
so that means now you're a service

00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:43,120
provider so you have to be running and

00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:45,130
think about 49 s 59 s about time so it

00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,410
brings me to the last point what is a

00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:49,420
chief digital officer not every company

00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:51,820
has one by name but every company that

00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:52,960
we've interviewed has won by roll people

00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:55,750
will say oh that's so in

00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:57,760
so who happens to be the most business

00:08:55,750 --> 00:09:00,270
centric CTO in the enterprise he was

00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:03,130
really building fans right you you heard

00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:05,800
speaker from Nike talking about how he

00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:07,300
pushes his CTO direct reports out to the

00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,950
business and he said if you have to make

00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:10,930
a decision between spending time with me

00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:12,760
or spending time with the business go

00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:17,050
spend time with the business that's a

00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:19,120
CDO type role at Nike sometimes it'll be

00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:21,460
in the marketing group but here's what

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,960
we found that drives both internal

00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:25,120
success and out performance in the

00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:27,400
market and it's not what we thought when

00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,740
we ran this survey again with 300

00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,780
different executives in this particular

00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:34,480
panel we were shocked by what we found

00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:35,710
we expected that the top capabilities

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,140
would be things like their

00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:40,030
intellectually curious their tech savvy

00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:41,890
their collaborative they're comfortable

00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:44,920
with uncertainty turns out those are

00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:46,450
just table stakes the really key traits

00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,650
of the highly successful chief digital

00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:49,450
officers the ones that we've found

00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:51,370
consistently in the leaders rather than

00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:55,300
the dabblers in our survey where as

00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:57,100
follows in small type the things that

00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:58,570
didn't matter tech savvy risk-taker

00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:00,820
collaborative intellectually curious as

00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:02,260
I mentioned the four key components are

00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:04,420
they have a strong network of innovators

00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:06,580
those are typically innovators inside

00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:07,840
and outside the company they're very

00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:09,850
comfortable with thinking about new

00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:11,770
ideas and very comfortable with failure

00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:14,410
the key to being an innovator is that

00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:15,760
you fail fast in many corporations you

00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:17,440
can't say I'm going to fail but you

00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,600
can't say something that we've learned

00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,540
is very very good language we're going

00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,130
to test and learn right it's a better

00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:26,920
word than failure and it can get through

00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:29,170
the antibodies 30 days we're going to

00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:30,430
test and learn what did we learn next 30

00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:32,410
days now we're going to do another test

00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:34,480
and learn cycle the second thing they do

00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:35,830
is they simplify complexity well so many

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,110
of the slides we've seen it show how

00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:40,210
difficult this is underneath our mind

00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:41,680
boggling and if an enterprise that

00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:44,050
you're leading is trying to change and

00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,670
they see that much complexity they may

00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:47,560
well give up before they start you'll

00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:48,970
certainly see a ton of resistance so the

00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,980
simplification of complexity is a

00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:53,680
critical skill many people don't have it

00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:56,230
but the successful CDOs do third they

00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,940
manage across departments a CDO is not a

00:10:56,230 --> 00:11:00,070
minister without portfolio but they do

00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:02,260
hold themselves personally accountable

00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:04,900
for the experience that every single

00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:06,550
consumer has with your brand digitally

00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:08,110
so they make sure that they

00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:09,220
work across marketing across business

00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:11,140
development different business units

00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:13,149
different pl's to pull all those

00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:15,010
experiences into one coherent whole they

00:11:13,149 --> 00:11:17,170
think about things like identity so that

00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:19,089
you don't lose the user you don't have

00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:20,500
amnesia when you log into one property

00:11:19,089 --> 00:11:22,360
and then what end into another app and

00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:24,220
then finally they adapt quickly i

00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:26,440
mentioned test and learn this is a

00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:28,690
constantly changing marketplace even

00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:30,940
startups who are operating on a daily or

00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:33,339
weekly cadence our frequently shocked by

00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:35,050
this the difference between weekly

00:11:33,339 --> 00:11:36,490
change and quarterly governance couldn't

00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:38,700
be greater for enterprises we're trying

00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:40,630
to shift so really really effective CDOs

00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:42,730
adapt quickly to changing circumstances

00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:47,649
so just leave with we be with those

00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:49,630
three thoughts and invite drew up to to

00:11:47,649 --> 00:11:50,950
have a quick chat but we found that

00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:52,690
every business is a digital business

00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:54,540
some are more effective than others

00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:57,250
every business needs a digital platform

00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:58,899
everybody's making them making a digital

00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:01,120
platform to varying degrees of success

00:11:58,899 --> 00:12:03,220
and then finally every business has

00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,200
achieved agile officer with the question

00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:06,970
is it is an effective cheap difficult or

00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,430
is it somebody who's lacking those

00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:11,890
skills badly situated and not driving up

00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:14,279
our performance so with that great thank

00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:14,279
