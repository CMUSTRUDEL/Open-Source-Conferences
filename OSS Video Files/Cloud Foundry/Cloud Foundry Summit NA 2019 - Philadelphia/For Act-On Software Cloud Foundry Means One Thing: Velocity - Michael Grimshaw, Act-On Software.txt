Description: 
	For Act-On Software Cloud Foundry Means One Thing: Velocity - Michael Grimshaw, Act-On Software

If velocity is the speed of something in a given direction, then in the startup sector that need for speed is in the direction of providing innovative software to our customers.

Fast innovation while navigating resource limitations is the name of the game.

With Pivotal Cloud Foundry:
The POC took less than 3 days.
Services were deployed to Act-On's Staging environment in under a month.
...all with only a single Engineer devoted to the project.

Cloud Foundry allows Act-On Software to focus resources on our software business by providing us with speed in security, speed in stability and speed in scalability.

In a word? Velocity

good afternoon my name is Michael

00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:09,030
Grimshaw I am with act on software at a

00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:12,840
Portland Oregon and I'm here talking

00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:16,230
about the business of velocity sea in q4

00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,460
of last year my CEO bill piers Nick was

00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,779
preparing to update our board of

00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,210
directors on our decision to move

00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:22,350
forward with pivotal Cloud Foundry bill

00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:25,019
approached me and asked me to put

00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:27,599
together a list of things as to why we

00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:29,130
chose to move forward with pivotal now

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,030
let me ask a quick question has anyone

00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:35,250
here ever worked with engineers before

00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:36,960
one or two of you yeah let me ask you

00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,760
this what happens if you ask an engineer

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,860
to put together a list of cool things

00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:46,140
they like about a technology they are

00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:47,700
totally geeking out about yeah Engineers

00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,140
don't just get caught in the weeds we

00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,910
dig down to the roots and try to

00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,620
determine the pH balance of the soil to

00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:53,960
a confident confidence interval

00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:57,840
stretching out twelve decimal places

00:00:53,960 --> 00:01:00,329
that is what engineers do now bill knew

00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,520
this bills a smart guy he's worked with

00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:04,830
a few engineers over the years so his

00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,320
bill turns to walk away he pauses and he

00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:10,830
looks back at me and he says Grimshaw I

00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:14,790
only need three or four bullet points

00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:16,710
okay great I already had this list

00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:18,240
running through my head and now he wants

00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:22,290
me to try to break this down to three or

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:25,350
four bullet points okay bill so I go

00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:27,540
back to my desk sit down and I start

00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:29,220
thinking through it and I trying to

00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:32,369
figure out okay what do all these things

00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:34,740
have in common what is the core business

00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:37,280
value that ties all this together

00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:40,320
it was at that point it occurred to me

00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:44,090
the business value that all these

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:48,060
features provide comes down to one thing

00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:50,610
velocity velocity is the speed of

00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,320
something in a given direction now any

00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:54,570
one of the things on that list is pretty

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,450
cool on its own but when working

00:01:54,570 --> 00:02:00,750
together as a system pivotal Cloud

00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:03,570
Foundry provides act on software speed

00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:07,350
in the direction of returning business

00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:08,819
value to our customers fast innovation

00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:11,560
in returning business value to our

00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:13,569
customers is kind of a mantra had act on

00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:16,420
and I hope it is for your company as

00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:19,900
well for those of you who might not be

00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:21,850
too familiar with my company act on

00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:24,370
software provides market and marketing

00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:26,770
automation platform specifically focused

00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:30,100
in adaptive marketing and lead

00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:33,069
management being a visionary company an

00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:34,480
innovator a market leader etc is

00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:37,930
something we take really seriously

00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:40,870
tacked on we work hard to be at the top

00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:42,640
right of that top right quadrant we are

00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:45,550
so serious about it that we've doubled

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:48,130
down in our Rd investment over the

00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:51,550
course of this last year pivotal Cloud

00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:55,330
Foundry is a core component tying all

00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:57,250
that our and IVA investment together one

00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:58,959
more thing I want to point out is that

00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:01,989
we are focused on being profitable

00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:06,880
because this is also where velocity

00:03:01,989 --> 00:03:08,530
comes in sure you can get momentum if

00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:11,080
you throw a ton of resources at

00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:14,380
something but that doesn't necessarily

00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:17,739
translate the velocity in fact it can

00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:20,769
even work against it our CEO Kay Johnson

00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:23,320
is an amazing amazing woman to work for

00:03:20,769 --> 00:03:24,090
her background is finance specifically

00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:28,360
in the tech sector

00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:31,239
she has a laser-like focus on ROI yeah

00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:35,079
she will absolutely greenlight investing

00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:37,959
in the business but it better be lean

00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:41,170
and it better be able to demonstrate a

00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:44,920
serious return on that investment kate

00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:46,660
is focused and focus is something that

00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:50,709
often gets missed when discussing

00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:51,329
velocity velocity doesn't mean busy not

00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:53,380
at all

00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:57,910
velocity doesn't even necessarily mean

00:03:53,380 --> 00:04:02,310
speed velocity is speed in a given

00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:05,049
direction velocity requires focus and

00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:06,940
focus on returning value to your

00:04:05,049 --> 00:04:09,160
customers is something that can easily

00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:12,940
get lost the bigger your infrastructure

00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:14,650
footprint becomes the more resources you

00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:17,769
devote towards supporting your systems

00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:20,289
the less resources you have to provide

00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:23,409
new features and new services to your

00:04:20,289 --> 00:04:25,530
customers this is why pivotal Cloud

00:04:23,409 --> 00:04:28,050
Foundry is a core

00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:31,380
component of Acton's technological

00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:33,410
roadmap you see we have business

00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:36,030
requirements that dictate a wide a wide

00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:37,530
infrastructure footprint we have

00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:39,330
customers and services that require

00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:42,180
running in a physical data center

00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:46,500
running on VMware we have customers in

00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:48,690
AWS in Oregon and the EU we are also

00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:51,810
moving into Azure due to market demand

00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:54,930
and we can see a possible need to be

00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:57,150
running on GCP in the future if your

00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:59,940
business case requires more than a

00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:02,460
handful of servers you want something

00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:04,980
managing all that complexity so you can

00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:08,040
devote your resources towards the

00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:12,330
features and services that actually make

00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:15,180
your company money this is the power of

00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:17,370
pivotal Cloud Foundry in the traditional

00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:20,070
IT model you managed and supported the

00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:21,890
entire stack and you paid the price and

00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:24,690
the resources required to configure

00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:27,810
orchestrate manage and support that

00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:30,270
stack then Along Came in Along Came

00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:32,010
infrastructure as a service great a

00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:35,430
significant amount of that management

00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:37,140
support was covered though not so much

00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:39,419
the configuration and orchestration

00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:42,419
parts which themselves also required

00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:44,460
their own management support and while

00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:47,310
not reflected in this image another

00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:49,320
stage that came along was containers the

00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:53,460
level of complexity that containers

00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:56,270
brought basically doubled or removed so

00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:57,870
much of the advantage that IaaS provided

00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:00,060
configuration of especially in

00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:02,580
orchestration configuration artifact

00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:04,950
management all that was added back into

00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:06,450
the stack that ia that a lot of the

00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:09,600
stuff that IAS had removed

00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:11,790
I remember when docker came out everyone

00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,160
was talking about right once for one it

00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:16,650
run anywhere great idea that sounds

00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,140
awesome I want that and that was great

00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:22,530
for developers but one of the things

00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:25,490
that didn't get nearly as much press was

00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:29,190
the management of the run anywhere piece

00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:32,220
the complexity in running anywhere adds

00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:35,729
to DevOps that complexity that running

00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:37,820
anywhere as the DevOps and ops is not

00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:39,800
insignificant

00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:41,840
Cloud Foundry abstracts away your

00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:44,140
infrastructure so that you can have the

00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,960
same rhythms of configuration

00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:50,750
orchestration and management and support

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:53,300
regardless of your infrastructure again

00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:56,540
the more resources you devote towards

00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:58,520
managing and supporting your systems the

00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:01,270
less resources you have to provide new

00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:03,560
features and services to your customers

00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:06,770
you want to abstract all that away so

00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:10,490
you can keep your focus so you can gain

00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:12,470
velocity now I've got to give major

00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:14,990
kudos to the to the person who opened my

00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:17,390
eyes to all of this he's the best CTO

00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:20,180
I've ever worked for and he's a guy by

00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:21,890
the name of Phil Simms and no I am NOT

00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:25,910
saying that just because he is in this

00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:27,470
room since Phil became my CTO I've had a

00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:31,880
crash course on pivotal Cloud Foundry

00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:33,140
and the velocity it brings you see I was

00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,300
the guy that wanted to code all this

00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:36,680
stuff together when Phil came in and

00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,330
started talking about hyper-converged

00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,580
architecture and a multi cloud stack

00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:42,590
strategy I was like yes I love it

00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:45,020
give me some Python give me some ansible

00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:47,420
give him give me give me Bakker and

00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:49,340
let's piece it all together and and and

00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:51,440
oh and let's throw in a whole bunch of

00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:52,960
other software to support that to try to

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:58,670
support that to try to accomplish that

00:07:52,960 --> 00:08:00,950
in fact I had spent four months grinding

00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:03,590
away trying to update an open-source

00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:05,030
platform that let's just say it wasn't

00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:07,640
exactly backed by the Cloud Foundry

00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:10,120
foundation or any other foundation for

00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:13,130
that matter I was at the point of

00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:15,110
hacking the hacking the the building

00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:17,810
Staller together just to try to make it

00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:20,630
work for our specific use case and make

00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:23,240
that clear four months during that time

00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:26,330
my CTO Phil kept talking to me about

00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,950
pivotal Cloud Foundry I hate to admit

00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:30,800
this especially since he's still sitting

00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:32,419
here but I just kind of thought that

00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:36,919
Phil had drankin quite a bit of the

00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:38,450
pivotal kool-aid but I had an epiphany

00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:40,700
towards the end of those four months I

00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:42,919
realized that our customers don't pay us

00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:46,550
to support the infrastructure that we

00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:49,950
want to build our customers pay us to

00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:52,410
support the services they want to use

00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:55,380
so after hitting a wall at four months I

00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:56,970
went to Phil and I said okay I do not

00:08:55,380 --> 00:09:00,630
want to be a blocker to our developers

00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:01,550
and while I am not willing to drink the

00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:04,019
kool-aid

00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:07,350
I'll give pivotal Cloud Foundry a try

00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:10,620
I'll do a proof of concept here's how

00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:12,690
that POC went first day I dug into the

00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:15,570
documentation and got a bunch of and got

00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:19,949
the search together second day I had a

00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:22,279
full pivotal Cloud Foundry pulled full

00:09:19,949 --> 00:09:26,790
pivotal Cloud Foundry up and running

00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:29,040
third day we had services deployed that

00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:31,620
was all with a single a single platform

00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,730
engineer at that point I went back to

00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,649
Phil and I said okay I'll drink the

00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:38,940
kool-aid in fact give me a pitcher yeah

00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:41,149
I'm on and that was just the POC to get

00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:44,850
a staging environment up took one month

00:09:41,149 --> 00:09:46,949
again with a single platform engineer to

00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:48,810
get a full production environment we

00:09:46,949 --> 00:09:50,790
brought in pivotal for a dojo and

00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:53,730
doubled the size of our platform

00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:56,339
engineers yeah we now at two and you

00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:58,709
know what in one quarter we had a

00:09:56,339 --> 00:10:01,380
control plane running concourse we had

00:09:58,709 --> 00:10:05,100
concourse building and repaving a

00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:08,190
production deployment of PCF in both AWS

00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:10,860
Oregon and Germany we had the entire

00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:13,529
building code and it was interacting

00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:15,720
with our existing infrastructure and for

00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:18,470
we had a full suite of production

00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:23,180
services running on it in both regions

00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:26,370
ladies and gentlemen that is velocity

00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:30,029
for us pivotal Cloud Foundry means

00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:32,730
velocity and velocity is the key the

00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:35,250
faster you can provide value to your

00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:37,500
current and future customers the happier

00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:39,569
that makes your customers the happier

00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:43,680
that makes your board and happier that

00:10:39,569 --> 00:10:45,360
makes your team for act on software our

00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:48,360
current and future customers value

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,790
security if they value stability and

00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,199
they value of scalability including the

00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:56,160
ability to scale up new features and

00:10:52,199 --> 00:10:58,260
services so let's take a look into how

00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,920
pivotal Cloud Foundry provides velocity

00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,920
to those values

00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:12,320
Office of Personnel Management

00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:15,260
Equifax Yahoo Marriott Adobe does that

00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,160
bring any bills tell me what let me add

00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:20,900
a few more how about this

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:22,910
Stuxnet flame eternal blue want to cry

00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:24,350
not pitch it okay I think you guys know

00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:25,870
exactly where I'm going think you folks

00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:30,140
know exactly where I'm going with this

00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:32,830
the business cost of not Pecha alone was

00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:34,580
valued at over ten billion dollars and

00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:36,980
that's just the cost of being

00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:39,530
compromised that doesn't cover the cost

00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:42,470
of your customers losing trust in faith

00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:49,690
in you there's also the cost of being

00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:52,100
compliant gdpr ISO 27000 PCI HIPAA NIST

00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:54,920
853 r4 I'm not going to say that five

00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:56,870
times fast hopefully I don't need to

00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:59,570
make the make the case for the

00:11:56,870 --> 00:12:02,150
importance of security I don't think I

00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:04,580
need to make that case because I think

00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:07,970
your customers already are security

00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:09,290
matters part of Acton's R&D investment

00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:11,690
has been a big push in a security

00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:14,600
enablement we brought in a new director

00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:17,300
of security and let me tell you I do not

00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:19,550
mess with our director of security to

00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:23,030
give you an idea our director of

00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:25,580
security is former Army it's fluent in

00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:29,210
multiple languages has a juris doctorate

00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:30,560
oh and is a powerlifter does that sound

00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:31,460
like someone you want to mess with I

00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,660
don't think so

00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:35,780
here let me introduce you to our

00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:38,600
director of security ladies and

00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:40,880
gentlemen this is Hadassah and that is

00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:44,630
another mantra attacked on Hadassah yet

00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:46,790
what Hadassah wants the easier I make it

00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:48,740
the easier I make it for hadass to get

00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:52,520
what she wants the easier my life

00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:54,200
becomes and let me tell you

00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:57,380
pivotal Cloud Foundry makes my life

00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:58,670
easier first way it makes my life easier

00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:02,360
is what it includes straight out of the

00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:03,800
box single sign-on want to turn key

00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:06,020
solution to securing access to

00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:09,230
applications and api's that's what

00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:11,360
there's a tile for that federated SSO

00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:12,410
like sam'l check Active Directory

00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,410
Integration

00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:16,330
LDAP integration octa integration check

00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:19,220
check check

00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:21,230
open ID connect no problem and and

00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:23,420
there's a whole host of other options

00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:26,350
what about secure credential management

00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:28,820
there's a tile for that this is cred hub

00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:31,520
cred hub centralizes and secures

00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:34,430
credential generation storage lifecycle

00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,780
management and access there's a credible

00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:38,420
service broker to handle secret

00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:40,040
management for your applications and in

00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:42,230
case you use hashey core vault

00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:45,830
there is also an integration between

00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:48,650
cred hub and hashey core vault compliant

00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:49,910
scanner you can scan Linux VMs to make

00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:51,800
sure they're compliant configured

00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:52,370
correctly and in addition to all those

00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,320
tiles

00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:57,650
there's file integrity monitoring IP

00:13:54,320 --> 00:14:00,080
security clam AV and those are just some

00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:02,390
of the highlights but to give you an

00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:04,070
idea of the security velocity that they

00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:07,970
came out of the box that we experienced

00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:10,280
it act on the SSO tile took a day to

00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:14,330
install configure and integrate with

00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:15,980
octa one day now we also know that

00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:19,130
security is more than just cool tools

00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:21,530
what about compliance to start with

00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:25,100
those cool tools are there to provide

00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:27,470
velocity towards compliance having a

00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:29,660
platform that makes it easy to integrate

00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:32,780
security features that was a big plus

00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:34,520
for us but it goes beyond the tools no

00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:37,360
small part of clump compliance is

00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:39,980
policies procedures and documentation

00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:42,650
this is also where pivotal cloud founder

00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:44,690
makes your life easier for example with

00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:46,370
gdpr becoming an industry standard

00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:48,050
you're gonna want to know all the

00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:51,440
potential places where PII could be

00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:53,630
stored and your platform here's the

00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,000
documentation for that it even provides

00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:58,910
recommendations on configuration changes

00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,560
required to work in a gdpr compliant

00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:03,230
environment

00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:08,090
what about HIPAA this actually is that

00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:10,730
long and NIST 853 R 4 etc control but

00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:13,040
the HIPAA pH eye regulations can be

00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:15,110
cross-reference to this control set and

00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,790
you see that list on the side the left

00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:19,040
hand it goes through everything in

00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:20,390
pickle Cloud Foundry and tells you where

00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:24,310
the compliance features that are covered

00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:27,069
by covered by the platform

00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:28,899
what you have to do on your own this

00:15:27,069 --> 00:15:30,999
document here can provide wonderful

00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:33,160
guidance how deploy the Tao deployers

00:15:30,999 --> 00:15:35,769
may achieve compliance when using a

00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:37,509
shared responsibility model in addition

00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:38,740
to that pivotal also has quite a few

00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:41,319
white papers that cover various

00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:44,259
compliance use cases the support is

00:15:41,319 --> 00:15:46,410
there if you need it and if also if you

00:15:44,259 --> 00:15:49,389
need it there's professional services

00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:51,069
now unfortunately there's not a tile

00:15:49,389 --> 00:15:53,379
that will magically make your

00:15:51,069 --> 00:15:55,600
organization compliant but there are a

00:15:53,379 --> 00:15:57,790
ton of tools recommendations and

00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:01,660
documentation that can provide velocity

00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:03,220
in that direction now what if you want

00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:06,790
to make your take your platform to a

00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:09,129
whole new level as far as hardening even

00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:10,779
beyond current standards what if you

00:16:09,129 --> 00:16:14,199
want to greatly reduce your exposure to

00:16:10,779 --> 00:16:15,819
advanced persistent threats and want to

00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:17,860
avoid like what happened to the Office

00:16:15,819 --> 00:16:20,379
of Personnel Management and others and

00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:22,660
want to try to keep adversaries from

00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:26,110
gaining a long-term foothold in your in

00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:29,050
your systems let me introduce you to

00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:30,069
repave repair and rotate now I've got to

00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:32,680
admit this is something I've been

00:16:30,069 --> 00:16:36,069
totally geeking out about by leveraging

00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:38,100
Concours Bosh and pivotal Cloud Foundry

00:16:36,069 --> 00:16:40,360
is native high ability high availability

00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:42,569
architecture you can refresh your

00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,939
infrastructure on a regular cadence

00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:47,470
weekly or even daily if you like

00:16:44,939 --> 00:16:49,120
basically long and short of it is every

00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:52,389
week you apply the latest security

00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:55,000
patches rebuild your entire platform and

00:16:52,389 --> 00:16:58,660
rotate the credentials all with zero

00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,279
downtime the best thing about this is if

00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:02,410
you've taken an infrastructure as a code

00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:05,740
approach to your pivotal Cloud Foundry

00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:08,740
deployment you have everything you need

00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:10,839
to implement it right there now sure a

00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:13,419
bad guy might have found a zero-day

00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:16,000
exploit or leveraged a a social

00:17:13,419 --> 00:17:18,100
engineering vulnerability but they

00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,959
really with the repair reap with the

00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:21,760
repave repair and rotate model they

00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:23,439
really have a very short time period to

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:26,949
try to break out of the native sandbox

00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:29,710
and exploit that in a way that causes a

00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:34,169
compromise it's the difference between a

00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:37,120
hacking attempt and being compromised so

00:17:34,169 --> 00:17:38,169
that's the idea of the speed of security

00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,539
we've begun to experience

00:17:38,169 --> 00:17:43,840
act on now let's look at another area

00:17:40,539 --> 00:17:45,549
that our customers value when we brought

00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,169
in pivotal for a platformer dojo

00:17:45,549 --> 00:17:49,119
one of the first questions they asked

00:17:47,169 --> 00:17:52,119
was what our SLA was for that layer of

00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:53,529
our infrastructure when we said five

00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:54,820
nines we were a little concerned with

00:17:53,529 --> 00:17:59,529
the response was and you know what the

00:17:54,820 --> 00:18:00,850
response was okay the more I've done to

00:17:59,529 --> 00:18:02,169
get into the architecture of pivot of

00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:04,570
Cloud Foundry the more I've understood

00:18:02,169 --> 00:18:08,559
why so many organizations both big and

00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:10,029
small use it and Bank on its ability for

00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:13,359
those of you relatively new to pivotal

00:18:10,029 --> 00:18:15,190
Cloud Foundry here's the plot here here

00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:19,989
is the foundation of the platform

00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:24,489
stability Bosh now is anyone in this

00:18:19,989 --> 00:18:26,320
room ever been on call actually my guess

00:18:24,489 --> 00:18:29,499
is everyone in this room has probably

00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:31,869
been on call sure your name might not be

00:18:29,499 --> 00:18:33,850
in the page or duty notification but if

00:18:31,869 --> 00:18:36,700
you're in the c-suite or anything with

00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:38,529
management you shared that same dread of

00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:41,019
that phone call coming in the middle of

00:18:38,529 --> 00:18:44,980
the night now your nightmares might not

00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:47,109
be based on a server on fire but your

00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:49,330
night nightmares might rather be about

00:18:47,109 --> 00:18:52,899
burning through cash flow and burn

00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:54,700
customers while Bosh does unify release

00:18:52,899 --> 00:18:56,950
engineering deployment lifecycle

00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:59,109
management of both the VMs and the

00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:00,460
software they run on the biggest reason

00:18:59,109 --> 00:19:03,730
I love Bosh is because of its

00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:06,249
self-healing ability in a nutshell Bosh

00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:08,470
has the Bosh has a logic built into it

00:19:06,249 --> 00:19:11,139
that if a VM or the application running

00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:13,379
on that VM is operating in less than a

00:19:11,139 --> 00:19:16,179
perfect manner Bosh tries to remediate

00:19:13,379 --> 00:19:18,369
Bosh tries to remediate the issue and if

00:19:16,179 --> 00:19:21,220
it can't fix the issue it says all right

00:19:18,369 --> 00:19:22,509
I'm gonna spin up a new instance I I'm

00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:24,789
gonna spin up a new instance that I know

00:19:22,509 --> 00:19:26,169
works and I'm sending the traffic there

00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:30,190
and then I'm just gonna tear down that

00:19:26,169 --> 00:19:32,289
old instance oh and the other nice thing

00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:34,119
about Bosh is it's based it is built so

00:19:32,289 --> 00:19:35,769
much high availability is built into it

00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:38,919
that you don't have to worry about

00:19:35,769 --> 00:19:41,200
taking a big hit on your SLA s now when

00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:43,389
I was testing Bosh's pager Duty

00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,580
integration I also happen to be in call

00:19:43,389 --> 00:19:48,549
during that time we didn't have any

00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:50,590
filters or rules set up at that point so

00:19:48,549 --> 00:19:51,800
I was I was getting I was getting a lot

00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:53,330
of pages shall we say I was

00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:55,880
getting paged on everything that wasn't

00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:58,760
operating perfectly I got to the point

00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:01,220
where I actually look forward to those

00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:03,560
pages because I first get a notice that

00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:04,910
saying hey this isn't working as we

00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,620
expect it to this isn't working this

00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:08,270
Bosh's expects it to and then

00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:09,860
immediately right after I get a

00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:11,450
notification saying this is how Bosch

00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:13,220
has fixed it this is how Bosch handle it

00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:16,730
so all I've got to do is resolved

00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:17,960
resolved resolved disability pivotal

00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:21,410
Cloud Foundry is built from the bottom

00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:24,890
up and while Bosch is built for pivotal

00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:27,320
Cloud Foundry it's not it's not only for

00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:29,120
running pivotal Cloud Foundry for

00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:31,720
software you can't or don't want to run

00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,770
in containers you can run it on Bosch

00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:35,420
again even beyond the self-healing

00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:37,790
capabilities of boss you have your

00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:39,100
configuration management H a release

00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:41,420
engineering and deployment automation

00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:44,000
hard and operating systems I could go on

00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:45,530
the list is the list is long but one of

00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,900
the things in fact one of the things

00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:49,070
that we are currently doing it act on is

00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:51,290
reviewing our legged it's the

00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:53,510
infrastructure to determine what can be

00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:55,670
run on containers and the things that

00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:57,650
can't be run on containers we are we are

00:20:55,670 --> 00:21:00,560
preparing to do our own Bosch releases

00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:02,480
for and the best thing about it is a lot

00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:04,730
of that stuff we won't have to write our

00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,290
own Bosch release because the level of

00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:09,410
community support out there the Bosch

00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:12,320
releases that are already out we can

00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:13,460
reuse a ton of that I'd recommend if

00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,020
you're looking at a pivotal cloud

00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:17,810
foundry and you're curious about Bosch

00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:19,880
definitely spent some time on Bosch do

00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:21,440
it's an incredibly helpful website and

00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:23,330
if you don't even want to go there go to

00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,980
github and start looking for some Bosch

00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:27,080
releases there's a ton of stuff out

00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:29,180
there for and that's the great thing

00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:31,760
about this platform it truly is a

00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:34,400
platform it can provide stability even

00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:37,160
for the things that you don't run CF

00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:39,860
push on ok here's my final point about

00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:43,250
stability yes

00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:45,560
the platform just works now if you're

00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:47,270
new to the cloud foundry scene or or

00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,860
maybe only at this stage considering

00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:51,050
cloud foundry you might be wondering

00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:54,080
just how much kool-aid I've had to drink

00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:55,540
I understand that I understand that so

00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,520
much because I've been there myself

00:21:55,540 --> 00:22:00,860
not long after Phil my CTO came to act

00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:02,150
on he brought a consultant Demetri that

00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:04,670
he'd worked with and passed

00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:05,630
and besides working with Phil Demetri

00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:09,790
had also spent a few

00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:13,070
years of pivotal on day three of our PCF

00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:14,360
POC Dmitri took me out for coffee and he

00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:18,500
says if you're gonna move forward with

00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:20,150
pivotal you need to know a few things he

00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:22,790
said you need to have an idea what's

00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:25,040
coming and one of the first things he

00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:27,140
told me was be prepared you're gonna be

00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:29,030
accused of drinking the kool-aid he said

00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:30,800
you are going to be you're going to be

00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:33,320
accused of reading only the marketing

00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:35,180
material and and and that is why you

00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:37,100
made the decision and well I've got to

00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:39,980
say Dmitri was darn near prophetic at

00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:41,540
that point because yes it happened I've

00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:42,890
been in that conversation I looked back

00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:44,810
to Dmitri and I said hey Dmitri that's

00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:46,970
not gonna happen I'm a dork you know I

00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:49,910
read documentation I dig through github

00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:50,450
I just built a PCF PCF installation

00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,220
myself

00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:54,980
no one's gonna accuse me of that he goes

00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:57,470
it doesn't matter that's what people are

00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:59,660
gonna say and you know what he was

00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:01,450
absolutely right but here's the thing I

00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:04,220
can't blame people for saying that

00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:06,770
because I was one of the same people you

00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:09,740
think it's the kool-aid but when you get

00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:13,760
in and actually use it you realize this

00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:15,170
stuff just works when you when I started

00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,240
working with it and especially when I

00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:19,690
became responsible for it is when I

00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:22,970
realize this level of stability provided

00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:25,190
now the truth is if you want your

00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:28,250
platform to work for you you have to

00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:29,960
work on it and this leads me to one of

00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:33,410
the last few the last few items I need

00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:36,710
to cover pivotal Cloud Foundry provides

00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:40,780
significant velocity but velocity itself

00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:43,070
also has some significant requirements

00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:45,590
I've mentioned how we got this platform

00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:46,820
through the proof-of-concept and into

00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:49,940
staging with only a single platform

00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:51,380
engineer working on it now in case that

00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:53,450
sounded like I was advocating a

00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:55,880
lone-wolf strategy I want to tell you

00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:59,950
very clearly it absolutely not nothing

00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:02,030
could be farther than the truth first I

00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:04,040
have been blessed through this whole

00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:06,190
process with some great great developers

00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:08,300
some incredible software engineers

00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:09,740
through this whole process I worked with

00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:11,300
a guy by the name of Curtis he's a

00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:13,010
software engineer and team leader tacked

00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:14,690
on and in fact Curtis was the first

00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:18,030
person who called a pivotal and got

00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:22,080
Aaron hire our Account Representative in

00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:23,880
act on itself and even beyond Kurtis

00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,590
there's other engineers a guy by the

00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:27,990
name of a seal a guy by the name of Ben

00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:30,060
that totally dug into the platform they

00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:32,070
had some experience and spring but they

00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:33,930
self-taught dug into the documentation

00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:35,850
and taught themselves how to leverage

00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:39,420
themselves they are boarded themselves

00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:41,640
into PCF and currently today are working

00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:43,080
on building the training building a

00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:46,470
training mechanism to onboard other

00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:49,380
developers you need good developers to

00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:52,650
get good velocity second thing you need

00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:54,480
is an incredible platform team there is

00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:56,250
no way I could have gotten PCF in

00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:59,970
production in multiple data centers

00:24:56,250 --> 00:25:02,340
without a solid platform team Inger

00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:03,750
who's the other platform engineer that

00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:07,890
worked on production and was there with

00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:09,390
a with air through the dojo she has a

00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:11,130
background in both DevOps and web

00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:12,720
development and she is also one of the

00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:13,550
hardest working people I've ever had the

00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,870
pleasure to work with

00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:18,900
in fact during the dojo some of the

00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:20,480
pivotal team said man eager she she does

00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:23,700
the work normally covered by four people

00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,930
that's how hard she works another member

00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:27,090
of our platform team is the guy by the

00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:30,210
name of Gabe he's a QA and he's a QA

00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:32,460
architect and while we were building the

00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:34,100
platform he was testing new QA new

00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:36,390
testing processes he was building

00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:39,120
testing processes he was doing

00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:42,750
significant work in our new our new

00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:44,610
environment of C ICD and he was

00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:46,590
leveraging the Alturas Jenkins tile and

00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:48,180
the cool thing was he was working on

00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:51,360
developing and on PCF while we were even

00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:54,360
building the thing the fourth member of

00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,920
our platform engineering team is our the

00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:57,660
director of enterprise architecture a

00:25:55,920 --> 00:26:02,220
guy by the name Michael Walker who is

00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:03,930
also my product owner now the reason I

00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:05,940
say not just the names but what these

00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:10,560
people's backgrounds are is to give you

00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:12,660
an idea of if you put together a good

00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:14,730
platform team the type of velocity you

00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:17,280
can get out of it I say that to

00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:19,800
recommend as a model it is absolutely

00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:21,990
amazing what happens if you get platform

00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:24,060
engineers with DevOps platform engineers

00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:27,630
working with QA people working with

00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:30,120
architects the velocity that you can get

00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:31,220
out of all those people coordinating

00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:34,310
together

00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:37,910
is off the chart they worked as a team

00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:40,370
to get pivotal in to act on oh and the

00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:43,970
of is the coordination from that type of

00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:48,440
team is off the chart third third point

00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:51,920
here and this is key this is huge is you

00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:54,800
need the support of leadership let me

00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:57,890
rephrase that you need the support of

00:26:54,800 --> 00:27:00,830
leadership no small part of the velocity

00:26:57,890 --> 00:27:05,920
we experienced it act on was due to fill

00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:08,660
my CTO bill my CEO and Kate my CEO

00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:11,330
clearing the runway so we could receive

00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:14,330
of a loss we could get the velocity we

00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:16,100
did they worked as a team to get pivotal

00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:19,880
and to act on and to ensure that the

00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:22,730
project was successful leadership is key

00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:26,170
and leadership is key for this next

00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:29,330
requirement of velocity cultural change

00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:31,730
to get velocity you will experience

00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:34,160
cultural change and in fact cultural

00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:35,980
change will be a requirement you will

00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:38,030
need a customer-centric mentality

00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:39,440
empathy for your customers that was

00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:42,170
covered in the keynote so well last

00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:44,150
night empathy for your customers you

00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:47,990
will need to be grounded in lean agile

00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:52,460
practices you need a DevOps mindset and

00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:55,310
you absolutely absolutely must treat

00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:57,140
your platform as a product give your

00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:59,630
platform give your platform team a

00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:01,700
product owner give your platform team

00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:03,980
the bandwidth to continually develop and

00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:05,570
work on the platform give them the

00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:09,350
ability to treat their developers as

00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:15,070
their customers and be ready for them to

00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:17,230
give you some serious velocity finally

00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:18,280
nail down a clear narrative for what

00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:20,440
you're doing and what you're trying to

00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:23,320
accomplish this is another thing I can't

00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:26,320
overstate narrative matters narrative

00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:28,510
helps turn your use cases into stories

00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:31,150
not just agile stories but

00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:33,490
organizational stories what is your

00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:36,190
story what is the story of your

00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:38,980
organization and make sure it is a

00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:42,070
customer-focused one that really really

00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:45,130
makes a difference and in making these

00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:47,770
stories don't hesitate to leverage your

00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:50,590
demos one of the things that I did when

00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:53,020
we did when I was working on the staging

00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:57,100
deployment was I strap strung together a

00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:58,960
whole series of demos videos all sharing

00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:02,440
the same thing pounding the same thing

00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:04,600
over and over and over again and that

00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:07,720
shared narrative that shared theme

00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:08,890
helped tremendously the reason it helps

00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:11,740
tremendously is it helps set

00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:16,450
expectations and gets people sharing the

00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:18,460
same vision now I don't know what

00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:20,590
exactly I don't know exactly what your

00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:23,710
vision is I don't know what the your

00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:24,940
company's vision is but I can give you a

00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:32,500
list of things that can speed it along

00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:33,870
the path and that path is velocity thank

00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:39,450
you

00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:39,450
