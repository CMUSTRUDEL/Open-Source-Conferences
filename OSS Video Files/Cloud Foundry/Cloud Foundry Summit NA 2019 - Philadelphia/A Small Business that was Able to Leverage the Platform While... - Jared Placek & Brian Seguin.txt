Description: 
	A Small Business that was Able to Leverage the Platform While Focusing Entirely on our Core Business - Jared Placek, DemandBridge & Brian Seguin, Stark & Wayne

Yes, small companies can benefit and afford running Cloud Foundry in production.

It has been two years since DemandBridge, a small business, decided to make their migration to Cloud Foundry. This talk will be about all of the core benefits DemandBridge’s development and product team has realized with their migration to Cloud Foundry. Why DemandBridge chose Cloud Foundry over other solutions as well as the benefits and challenges they have faced having a third-party manage their owned Cloud Foundry platform. 

Jared Placek and Brian Seguin will share their three years of collaboration and answer the question: Would they do it again and what might they have done differently?

so thanks for coming this is this is our

00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:12,870
story of how we got to Cloud Foundry so

00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:16,109
I would start by saying that you know we

00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:17,520
had similar problems and but obviously

00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:20,189
we're at the Cloud Foundry summit so we

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:24,330
came to similar solutions as everyone

00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:27,029
else but give you a brief history of

00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:31,109
demand bridge we are a small technology

00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:33,120
company that has large but kind of a

00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:35,960
niche customer base in the print

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:41,280
industry and we're a Java spring shop

00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:45,260
and we have a our main product is a b2b

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:48,600
e-commerce platform that our customers

00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:51,870
use and resell to their customers and

00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:54,140
and it has about a 20 year codebase that

00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:58,620
that I've worked on for about 12 years

00:00:54,140 --> 00:01:01,649
and you know it's it's it's been through

00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:03,989
a lot and we've we've we've added a lot

00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:06,600
to it and we've not refactored a whole

00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:09,119
lot with it so we had the same problems

00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:12,510
that most of the Cloud Foundry adoption

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:16,259
stories start with we had a large

00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:20,100
outdated monolithic application deploys

00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:23,540
were awful and we wanted to scale evolve

00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:28,409
move faster risk less and deploy more

00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:30,240
but where we differ I think from from

00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:31,170
most people and especially from the

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,650
people that are highlighted in the

00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,939
keynotes

00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:39,240
and and Abby and chip helped us out by

00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:40,740
highlighting Comcast who Comcast's

00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,619
amazing and we've followed them through

00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:47,909
their whole journey but you know they're

00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:50,729
boasting 2,500 3,000 developers 40,000

00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:56,070
app instances we have four developers

00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:58,020
and zero dedicated ops and that's not

00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:01,409
something that we tout it's something

00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:04,229
that frankly it gave us kind of a

00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:06,149
complex where we we didn't feel like we

00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:08,399
belonged and so we would hear these

00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:10,500
keynotes at the Spring Conference and

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,290
and now at the Cloud Foundry summit as

00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,659
we were kind of evaluating

00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:16,040
and you know we kind of felt like this

00:02:14,659 --> 00:02:18,430
stuff a lot of the cutting edge

00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:23,450
technology was just out of reach for us

00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:24,680
so that's that's we tried to remain you

00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:25,909
know relevant we tried to keep up to

00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:29,720
date with things that were going on but

00:02:25,909 --> 00:02:33,049
but we just we just couldn't touch it so

00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:35,840
we were on our own and the reason for

00:02:33,049 --> 00:02:38,180
the zero dedicated ops was we we were

00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,250
for a long time the software development

00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:42,430
arm of a print distributorship who are

00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:44,930
now you know one of our many customers

00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:47,000
but the most we could ever hope for was

00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:48,980
that our application server and our

00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,329
database of VMs were online and

00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:53,450
connected to the Internet and everything

00:02:50,329 --> 00:02:57,260
else was in her hands so you know we we

00:02:53,450 --> 00:03:00,739
cobbled together what we could and you

00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:06,700
know it worked wonderfully for us for a

00:03:00,739 --> 00:03:09,319
long time so due to our kind of

00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:12,829
licensing restrictions mostly on our web

00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:14,720
logic server we were stuck at JavaOne 5

00:03:12,829 --> 00:03:17,989
and that wasn't a problem for a very

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,849
long time because of backwards

00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:24,230
compatibility and and spring did a great

00:03:19,849 --> 00:03:27,470
job of allowing us to use some of the

00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:29,030
newer features but we would attend the

00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:32,329
spring conference every year just to

00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:34,849
kind of stay up to date and over time

00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:37,250
the spring conference even became less

00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:38,780
and less relevant to us because the

00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,829
newer things were just not backwards

00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:41,870
compatible and we couldn't take

00:03:39,829 --> 00:03:43,730
advantage of of the latest Spring

00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:48,160
Framework and that was that was a

00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:51,650
problem and I think that one of the the

00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:53,239
light bulbs that went off was I kept

00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:54,019
hearing about this this monolith and

00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:56,269
we're like what's wrong with the

00:03:54,019 --> 00:04:00,319
monolith we've got a monolith and we you

00:03:56,269 --> 00:04:02,120
know it's it works great for us but we

00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,400
got to a point we're hearing about Cloud

00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,959
Foundry we're here not the infancy of

00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,129
Cloud Foundry from pivotal and it was it

00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:09,349
was it was amazing but we just could

00:04:07,129 --> 00:04:10,010
didn't see where it fit and spring boot

00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:12,260
as well

00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:15,109
we saw spring boot come you know from

00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:16,039
its infancy up to to a point where it

00:04:15,109 --> 00:04:17,650
was it was like a mainstream

00:04:16,039 --> 00:04:20,670
conversation at the spring conference

00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:22,590
but we just didn't see a fit for it and

00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:25,170
and we had a big giant WebLogic server

00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:27,420
and that was all we ever knew and it

00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:32,400
didn't like us doing anything new and

00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:34,830
and and fancy and so I think the the

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,620
light bulb went off when we were sitting

00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:39,930
at one of the spring conferences and and

00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:43,230
it was like everything that was turnout

00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:44,520
of the keynote speech was just over our

00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:46,620
heads it was just something that we

00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:49,320
couldn't reach out for but the monolith

00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:51,900
was resounding like we've got one of

00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:53,790
those that's that's great and then the

00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:55,560
it was the first time I heard the term

00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:58,290
technical debt I said we've got that too

00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,960
that's that's the only thing we can take

00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:04,170
away from this this conference so I

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:07,890
think it was when the the spring cloud

00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:09,600
sweet really came to the forefront that

00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:12,990
we started realized maybe we could take

00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:15,270
advantage of some of these things maybe

00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:16,770
we could leverage some of this new

00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:18,600
technology we've started to wrap our

00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:20,790
heads around the idea of 12 factor and

00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,920
the idea of maybe breaking apart some of

00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:24,750
the pieces of our application and

00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:26,370
hosting them elsewhere so now we kind of

00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:28,050
met back up with everybody that was

00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:30,000
going on this this Cloud Foundry journey

00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:32,490
we've got a problem we know what it is

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,260
it's the monolith we were no longer

00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:37,560
defending our monolith it's it's we

00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:38,880
realized it's the problem so we have to

00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,970
learn what micro services are what

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,380
containers are but you know ok let's

00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:45,780
let's do it we don't have a choice we

00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:48,810
were running into food to performance

00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:50,610
issues and we didn't have a solution

00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:51,870
there was there was no upgrading the

00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:54,450
monolith there was no upgrading or

00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:55,770
WebLogic server there was no there was

00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:59,730
no hardware we could throw at the

00:05:55,770 --> 00:06:02,220
problem so maybe we can use spring but--

00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:04,200
maybe maybe that's our answer and kim

00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:07,980
who see all of our developers are here

00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:10,530
with us today just not a stretch so Kim

00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:11,760
Kim said we came back from the whatever

00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:13,050
the latest spring conference was it

00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,030
really was the one that you know

00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:17,580
technical debt monolith okay we're on

00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:19,230
the same page now and she said we just

00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:23,420
have to build one of these things to try

00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:25,530
it out and we saw the benefits of it but

00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:27,420
like what do we do with these things

00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:30,090
spring boot is great it's going to allow

00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:33,520
us to use newer technologies it's going

00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:35,650
to allow us to to to not worry about the

00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,300
the nightmare of our dev WebLogic server

00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:40,720
versus our pride WebLogic server but

00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:43,060
what do we do with it so for a while

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,759
this this thing which we forced into

00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:47,830
production we forced you know ourselves

00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:52,180
to use it it just lived on an otherwise

00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:54,460
empty VM with Java installed which was

00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:56,139
scary and we thought to ourselves like

00:06:54,460 --> 00:07:01,720
there's no way we can have more than one

00:06:56,139 --> 00:07:03,669
of these things so so what do we do so

00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:06,009
we spent a few months playing around

00:07:03,669 --> 00:07:08,620
with docker and and the idea of

00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:11,800
containerization and and that whole

00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:13,449
methodology was a no-brainer awesome but

00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:18,509
that just really abstracted the the

00:07:13,449 --> 00:07:18,509
problem of where to put these things so

00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:26,050
we we realized that without that

00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:30,550
dedicated ops without without without

00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:35,139
DevOps becoming more a part of our

00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:36,880
culture we have no way of managing these

00:07:35,139 --> 00:07:38,620
other applications these are these other

00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:44,349
environments that we we have no way of

00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:47,560
managing a docker machine we we ordered

00:07:44,349 --> 00:07:48,789
a couple pizzas but that didn't work we

00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,729
were just sitting there eating cold

00:07:48,789 --> 00:07:53,770
pizza but but we realized that we needed

00:07:51,729 --> 00:07:57,729
to solve this problem we needed to we

00:07:53,770 --> 00:08:00,180
needed to to to branch out but we didn't

00:07:57,729 --> 00:08:00,180
know who to hire

00:08:00,389 --> 00:08:04,449
because what are what it what is the

00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:05,530
solution that we're going after we

00:08:04,449 --> 00:08:07,120
didn't want to hire someone fresh and

00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:11,770
say here help us solve this problem we

00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:13,930
wanted to say here are we gonna do is

00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:15,819
docker the answer is or is Swarm good

00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:17,889
enough or are we gonna go with something

00:08:15,819 --> 00:08:19,449
like me sauce or kubernetes you know

00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:21,639
there were all these different things we

00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:24,490
were weighing to try and find okay how

00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:26,050
do we narrow down our search for someone

00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:31,090
to join the team and help us move into

00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:33,339
the future as we were evaluating the

00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:34,750
complexities of miso sand and the

00:08:33,339 --> 00:08:36,399
complexity of kubernetes at the time and

00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:37,719
this was this was in its infancy and I

00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,390
know that it's still very complicated

00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:42,219
but it's also more mainstream now this

00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:43,520
was we were just scratching the surface

00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:47,260
at that time

00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:47,260
and we knew we were in over our heads

00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:53,090
but I guess serendipitously we received

00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:54,380
an invitation to the Cloud Foundry

00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:55,220
summit and this was we didn't even

00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,270
realize that was a cloud foundry

00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:58,400
something we had been hearing about

00:08:56,270 --> 00:09:00,530
Cloud Foundry from pivotal at the Spring

00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,820
Conference and that was awesome again we

00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:03,710
didn't really see how it fit and we

00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:05,060
actually talked to pivotal they came and

00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:08,150
met with us and talked about our

00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:11,150
infrastructure and I think we came away

00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:14,060
with more questions than answers but

00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:15,770
they were extremely helpful more

00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:17,480
questions about about ourselves and

00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:19,010
about the way that we had had structured

00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:22,610
our own application and and how we could

00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:23,660
even move it into the future but we saw

00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:27,590
this invitation to the Cloud Foundry

00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:29,630
summit and it was an open source cloud

00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:32,600
founded the the Cloud Foundry foundation

00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:34,010
it wasn't it wasn't one vendor all the

00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,590
vendors were represented and it was it

00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:37,640
was it was eye-opening and we thought

00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:40,550
we're looking at Mises and kubernetes

00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:43,220
why not try out cloud foundry and CFCF

00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:45,020
an open source cloud foundry you know it

00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,920
is something that we could achieve is

00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:47,600
something that we could maybe hire

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:51,500
someone to help us out with and join our

00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,790
team and and and build and so we

00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:55,130
attended the clock foundry summit and we

00:09:52,790 --> 00:10:00,050
got there and it was it was awesome it

00:09:55,130 --> 00:10:01,400
was eye-opening it was it was the the

00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:04,070
the you know the big lights and the big

00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:08,540
presentations about how wonderful you

00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:13,220
know CF pushes and and and and what

00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:16,400
really spoke to us especially over the

00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:18,530
the docker solutions was how it just

00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:20,330
naturally took our cloud for our spring

00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:23,750
food apps and and and and just the

00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:26,930
spring in general and and and I remember

00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:29,410
listening to on see after you know we

00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:31,580
were we were touting his famous haiku

00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:34,460
listening to him give us give a talk

00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:36,320
about how cloud foundry wants to take

00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:38,900
your app and and and and loved it as

00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:42,140
much as you do and take care of it and

00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:44,990
and we thought that's perfect because

00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:47,300
when we were trying out docker it was it

00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:49,250
was it was it was it wasn't pretty

00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:52,010
as far as as far as what we were able to

00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:55,940
do with it and as far as the image that

00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:56,720
we got it wasn't so much the the big

00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:58,459
beautiful ship

00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,709
with all the containers neatly stacked

00:10:58,459 --> 00:11:03,170
up it was it was more like the the

00:11:00,709 --> 00:11:07,459
second season of The Wire if anyone is

00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:09,319
familiar with you know union reps losing

00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:12,110
containers and I don't know it was it

00:11:09,319 --> 00:11:14,230
was not it it wasn't the the nice

00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:18,259
wholesome story that Cloud Foundry tells

00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:20,540
so we get to the CF summit awesome

00:11:18,259 --> 00:11:24,680
we want to try and do open source CF

00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:26,629
because monetarily the way that the way

00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:30,139
that things broke down when we did talk

00:11:26,629 --> 00:11:31,850
to pivotal was was such that first such

00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:33,910
a small company and I realized that now

00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:36,290
there's probably so many more options

00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:39,379
you know different pricing tiers and

00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:42,439
they're also so many more so many more

00:11:39,379 --> 00:11:43,939
more you know certified distributions

00:11:42,439 --> 00:11:47,689
which is which is awesome at the time

00:11:43,939 --> 00:11:49,730
there weren't many and and and we wanted

00:11:47,689 --> 00:11:53,629
to check out the the open source side of

00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:57,589
things so we got there and at part of

00:11:53,629 --> 00:12:00,709
that as part of the keynote they made an

00:11:57,589 --> 00:12:03,139
announcement about brand new Cloud

00:12:00,709 --> 00:12:05,269
Foundry support for the azure hypervisor

00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:07,189
and we thought wow we didn't even know

00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:09,470
that was a question asked but perfect

00:12:07,189 --> 00:12:13,279
because we use Azure and I guess now we

00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:16,509
can use Cloud Foundry so after the after

00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:19,819
the keynote we ran to the vendor booth

00:12:16,509 --> 00:12:22,819
or the the vendor area and we made a

00:12:19,819 --> 00:12:24,860
beeline for the azure booth you guys are

00:12:22,819 --> 00:12:27,189
who we need to talk to we're on Azure we

00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:30,410
want to do Cloud Foundry tell us how I

00:12:27,189 --> 00:12:33,829
said it's so easy it's so easy you just

00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:36,230
click the install PCF button and and we

00:12:33,829 --> 00:12:38,959
said that's that's awesome I'm glad that

00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:41,420
that works but it just you know for us

00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:43,699
unfortunately that that that model

00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:46,040
wasn't what what we thought was

00:12:43,699 --> 00:12:47,449
sustainable for us and and we probably

00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:50,750
weren't looking at it right but we were

00:12:47,449 --> 00:12:53,329
so focused on the the open source side

00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:54,980
of things and and and we only saw that

00:12:53,329 --> 00:12:58,430
is that our only option for Cloud

00:12:54,980 --> 00:13:01,879
Foundry a monetarily but also our

00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:04,660
ability to scale at a very small number

00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:08,010
of apps steadily

00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:13,510
and have it be you know cost-effective

00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:15,790
so I said no no we're not looking to

00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:18,130
install PCF right now we were hoping to

00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:19,210
check out open source cloud foundry and

00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,280
I think she said

00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:23,500
yikes I don't want anything to do with

00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:27,850
that and I think she actually said yes

00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:30,250
but the general the general theme in the

00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:31,480
vendor area when we talked about open

00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:34,240
source cloud foundry at the time and

00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:37,900
this is one of the earlier CF summits I

00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:40,720
think it was 2015-2016 but the the

00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:45,220
feedback we got was like yikes

00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:46,750
that's really hard good luck and that

00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:49,330
was kind of a bummer for us but we were

00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:51,430
we were determined and so we tried to

00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:54,340
absorb as much as we could and then we

00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:57,490
went back to our hotel rooms and banged

00:13:54,340 --> 00:14:01,150
away at Bosch light and that was a head

00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:03,940
scratcher but we came back and we like I

00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:06,820
said we we were we were kind of a little

00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:08,140
bit beaten down but there was there were

00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:13,300
there were so many things to learn at

00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:15,970
the summit and that year dr. Nick was

00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:19,540
the emcee and he's larger than life and

00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:21,370
and and also and I see you guys are

00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:22,800
wearing the blue shirts and I like the

00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:25,450
blue a lot this is a nice bright blue

00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:27,070
but they had a bright red shirts Tarkin

00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:29,890
Wayne and they were everywhere

00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:31,030
they were like 50th I don't think an

00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:33,190
exact I mean I guess that's an

00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:34,630
exaggeration but but they were the they

00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:37,690
were like the authority and so we said

00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:39,460
okay we spent all night dang way at

00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:40,470
Bosch light trying to get this thing

00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:43,210
working nothing's working

00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:45,730
let's go talk to these star campaign

00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:47,590
guys they seem like an authority and so

00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:50,020
we hammered him with questions and they

00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:54,280
I think we wore on their patience I'm

00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:56,560
sure but I think it's like the solutions

00:14:54,280 --> 00:15:00,370
to our problems and the answers to our

00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:02,980
questions were so complex that we just

00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:05,560
we realized like listen with we can't do

00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:08,260
this alone we understand that now we

00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:10,090
need to find someone with experience to

00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:11,530
help us we realize that it's not

00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:14,290
something that we could Shepherd through

00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:17,390
with with with someone that has a little

00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:20,060
bit of knowledge of CF and maybe

00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:22,460
join our team we need a much bigger

00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:25,600
presence of a much much more expertise

00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:28,340
in order for us to make this happen

00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,110
but we are still in this mindset of like

00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:33,950
do do we deserve this technology we're

00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:35,660
so small and and everything we hear and

00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:38,060
and certainly everything we heard at the

00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:40,340
time is these stories of these big huge

00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:42,470
enterprises and it's amazing and we need

00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:44,840
that and that's so important to make

00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:48,140
sure that we have a you know a platform

00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:50,950
that is that is you know full of life

00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:53,990
and can and can you know carry our our

00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:56,300
platform and our our our our business

00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:58,760
into the future but but we didn't feel

00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:01,250
like we kind of really belong so we we

00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,450
said okay Stark and Wayne these guys are

00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:04,700
these guys are the authorities we need

00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:08,480
to find someone like that but who caters

00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:10,070
to small businesses so we racked our

00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,740
brains and we searched and searched and

00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:17,540
then months later we would tell this

00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:19,340
story and it was a joke because someone

00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:20,510
might it was Brian it was if someone

00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:22,670
came to us and said look we need to have

00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:23,930
a talk like you keep saying that you

00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:25,940
know you were looking for a star can win

00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:28,250
for the little guys and you know haha

00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:29,510
but we ended up with Sark and we and

00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:32,000
they said what are we doing wrong with

00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:35,630
our marketing because why didn't you

00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,790
just come to us and and I say it wasn't

00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:39,290
it wasn't you guys it was it was us it

00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:42,380
was this mentality was this complex it

00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:44,390
was it was this just feeling like we

00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:45,680
were too small to deserve something like

00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:51,440
this to feeling like we were too small

00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:52,660
to to play in this community but we did

00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:56,780
end up we reaching out star can wane

00:16:52,660 --> 00:17:00,470
after walking in circles for a month and

00:16:56,780 --> 00:17:03,080
they were super accommodating they

00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:06,230
answered all of our questions they they

00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:09,110
walked through you know and level set

00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:12,260
expectations with us they talked about

00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:13,880
how you know how complex the the the you

00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:16,010
know certainly Bosh is and just the

00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:17,540
whole the maintenance of Cloud Foundry

00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:19,130
and how you need it to be a living

00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:21,230
breathing thing and you need someone to

00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:24,500
be maintaining it constantly for you and

00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:25,339
so you know whether you're open source

00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:28,940
or you're through one of these

00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:31,460
distributions it's it's it's not an easy

00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:34,100
thing to buy off and it's not it it's

00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:36,710
just not something you can do alone but

00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:40,040
luckily they could help and and we and

00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:41,360
we believe that and so we went through a

00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:44,240
bunch of different options but we ended

00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,470
up saying like let's just this is what

00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,140
we need

00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:50,540
and by the way meanwhile we're having

00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:52,730
all sorts of of the performance issues

00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:54,560
and our customers are noticing and like

00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:55,730
I said we we didn't have another

00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:58,880
solution

00:17:55,730 --> 00:18:02,180
so we said guys please help us and they

00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:06,560
did and they sent a couple people to to

00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:14,840
to kind of immerse us in Bosch and CF

00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:16,880
and yeah I was 2016 the end of 2016 was

00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:18,590
when we were doing our evaluation and

00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,600
when we when we first started down the

00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:23,330
journey I think it was it was maybe even

00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:26,900
January of 2017 that we started the

00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:30,080
actual build with Stark and Wayne so so

00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:31,580
they you know we partnered up and and

00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:35,000
they came out and and like I said they

00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:37,430
sent two rockstars to help us out and

00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,470
they they sat with us for an entire week

00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:41,810
and built out our Cloud Foundry

00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:44,510
environment but they built up with us

00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:45,950
and you know we took what we could from

00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:47,690
what they were teaching us but they also

00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:51,950
taught us best practices and they taught

00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:54,980
us you know how to use a Cloud Foundry

00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:56,210
responsibly and they left us with much

00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:58,940
more than just our Cloud Foundry

00:18:56,210 --> 00:19:02,540
environments they left us with concourse

00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:06,260
which is our second greatest love these

00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:09,440
days next to Cloud Foundry but but other

00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:11,960
things like safe involved and in lots of

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,590
different community contributions that

00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:22,430
that they had vetted and it was awesome

00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:25,340
it was a it was eye-opening to see you

00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:29,510
know the the the inner workings and and

00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:31,940
how deep the knowledge and the expertise

00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:32,810
was that these guys were able to share

00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:39,740
with us

00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:42,890
so after week we had a dev and a prod

00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:47,840
Cloud Foundry up and running in Azure

00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:52,370
we threw our proof of concept at it easy

00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:55,970
simple we threw our spring cloud you

00:19:52,370 --> 00:20:02,840
know sweet at it couldn't have been

00:19:55,970 --> 00:20:09,169
easier it just worked and and and it was

00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:11,210
it was this this parting of ways when

00:20:09,169 --> 00:20:13,549
they left they they they turn the keys

00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:15,650
over to us and and it wasn't here you go

00:20:13,549 --> 00:20:17,720
goodbye and good luck it was alright let

00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:20,900
you know are you ready let's do this

00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:21,770
together and you know it was it was

00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:24,860
awesome

00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:26,929
we really felt like we had a partner and

00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:28,760
you know we had Cloud Foundry but we had

00:20:26,929 --> 00:20:33,950
the backing of Stark and Wayne and that

00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:35,630
was that was excellent so now we had it

00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:38,179
now we started to use him we threw

00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:40,250
everything we could at it and and

00:20:38,179 --> 00:20:44,179
everything that we had seen at the Cloud

00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:45,770
Foundry summits we attended it came to

00:20:44,179 --> 00:20:50,780
life it was it was all real it was the

00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:54,410
the CF push awesome all of the anecdotes

00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:56,990
about the ease of mapping routes and

00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:59,780
binding services and scaling apps it was

00:20:56,990 --> 00:21:01,570
all it was all real and and the I the

00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:03,440
the fact that Cloud Foundry just kind of

00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:05,179
takes care of your app and make sure

00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,210
that's still running it was great and we

00:21:05,179 --> 00:21:09,890
kind of take that for granted sometime

00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:12,350
sometimes we we had an app that was

00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:15,110
failing every 10 minutes

00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:18,169
that we four months we didn't realize

00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:19,760
because it you know Clyde founders just

00:21:18,169 --> 00:21:22,190
bringing it back up before the the the

00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:24,340
second instance was failing and you know

00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:26,929
so we're gonna get better at that but

00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:28,910
but ya know I Cloud Foundry did

00:21:26,929 --> 00:21:30,410
everything that it promised and that was

00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:34,490
amazing and it was amazing for us

00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:37,850
because you know I think it wasn't it

00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:40,880
was emotional I know for me I think more

00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:43,850
than more than just me to to sit back

00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:46,309
and say you know we with Cloud Foundry

00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:48,320
and especially with with the backing of

00:21:46,309 --> 00:21:50,690
Stark and Wayne you know we have the

00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,610
same infrastructure as these big

00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:54,080
enterprises now it's it's it's a matter

00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:56,390
of Diego cells at the

00:21:54,080 --> 00:22:00,050
point and I don't know that was that was

00:21:56,390 --> 00:22:03,140
a huge huge jump for us from you know a

00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:06,770
couple years ago when we were we were

00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:08,930
really doubting ourselves so it was

00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:11,570
awesome it felt really great and the

00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:14,900
most important thing is that with for

00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:16,700
developers we were able to just run full

00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:19,640
speed and not worry about our

00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:20,810
application not worry about the the the

00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,640
application server the the

00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:25,970
infrastructure it was just throw as much

00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:28,730
as you could at it and and and and make

00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:31,400
as much improvement to the system as

00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:34,220
possible and and we were able to do that

00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:35,720
it was it was awesome take advantage of

00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:38,240
all the latest features of Java although

00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:39,560
all the latest latest spring frameworks

00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,080
and everything else that we've been

00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:44,930
dying to get our hands on and and like I

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:49,750
said not worry about how to manage these

00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:52,790
things so you know where are we now

00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:58,910
we have a lot of code just to rewrite we

00:22:52,790 --> 00:23:01,040
still have a monolith but our code base

00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:03,410
and our application architecture is

00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:05,960
vibrant and and it's a pleasure to work

00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:10,010
with and that was not the case for a

00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:14,180
very long time so we it's it's it was it

00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:15,890
was in the span of from getting up and

00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:18,410
running with cloud foundry to throwing

00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:20,330
as much as we could at at the the

00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:23,060
environment it was it was a few months

00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:25,090
and and we as a team just had a complete

00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:27,770
180 in our just our approach to

00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:34,240
development and in our quality of life

00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:34,240
it was just it was just excellent so

00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:43,010
where are we now

00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:44,420
so we're cloud foundry users now it's a

00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:46,820
totally different experience to be at

00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:50,540
the summit and to be at the Spring

00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:53,510
Conference to because we you know we we

00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:55,190
have shared this journey with these big

00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:56,990
companies you know we've had similar

00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:58,850
transformations albeit at a much smaller

00:23:56,990 --> 00:24:02,660
scale

00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:05,420
and it feels great it's and we still I

00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:07,340
know I I slipped back into this this

00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:08,960
mindset of you know you guys are talking

00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:09,770
about things that are just way way out

00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:14,510
of my league

00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:17,300
but but you know we we have a great

00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:19,940
foundation and and and and we have a lot

00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:22,490
of a lot of pride in in in our

00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:24,500
environment in and in you know our

00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:31,100
application and where we're like I said

00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:34,190
we didn't for a long time so where we

00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:38,060
started was we had that large monolithic

00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:40,940
application long painful deploys and the

00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:43,820
need to scale evolve move faster risk

00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:47,990
less and deploy more and so now we have

00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:50,030
a smaller outdated monolithic shell of

00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:51,650
an application you know we've been

00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:53,120
strangling that thing as much as we

00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:54,880
could we were before we even heard the

00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:58,280
term we were like that's let's just get

00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:00,350
rip this thing apart and we had we had a

00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:03,980
means to do it and it was awesome so we

00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:07,430
have one occasional deploy it's it's

00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:12,440
it's it's not every sprint that we

00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:15,530
deploy our monolith but we have now 83

00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:17,810
app instances and 53 unique apps out

00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:19,670
there that's which is mind-blowing -

00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:22,340
they even think about how how we would

00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:23,780
manage that a few years ago and we're

00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:25,580
deploying them constantly these these

00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:27,920
these apps and we're pushing them with

00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:30,860
very little risk to prod and you know

00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:33,170
we're we're doing the same the same

00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:35,600
things that we hear up on on the

00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:40,940
mainstage just like I said at a smaller

00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:43,180
scale when we started we had four

00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:46,550
developers and we had zero dedicated ops

00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:49,700
now we still have four developers but we

00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:52,130
have 10,000 plus ops I like to say which

00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:55,970
is which translates to one primary

00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:58,400
resource at start going 35 members of

00:25:55,970 --> 00:26:01,220
the collective who support us regularly

00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,540
and then all of the Cloud Foundry

00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:06,590
community members which is which is

00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:07,919
awesome and we we work with our resource

00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:11,679
Kevin

00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:15,159
and and so many more on a daily basis

00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:17,320
and and we reached out to the collective

00:26:15,159 --> 00:26:21,700
regularly and and through Stark and

00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:23,409
Wayne we have contributed to and worked

00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:26,590
with and found answers from the

00:26:23,409 --> 00:26:32,980
community you know the whole time it's

00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:34,690
it's it's been great so what's next we

00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:37,750
have we have a lot of work to do with

00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:39,399
our monolith still but we have the

00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:42,639
answer like it's just a matter of

00:26:39,399 --> 00:26:45,610
plugging away and we're we are pushing

00:26:42,639 --> 00:26:49,389
more code than we ever have and we'll

00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:50,740
continue to do that so we want to work

00:26:49,389 --> 00:26:54,909
towards continuous delivery and and

00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:58,299
we're not shy you know about pursuing

00:26:54,909 --> 00:27:01,450
that anymore because you know that once

00:26:58,299 --> 00:27:04,659
we once we got over this hurdle you know

00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:06,610
III think anything's possible and then

00:27:04,659 --> 00:27:08,440
we want to move the recipe we have other

00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:11,980
applications and and and now with all

00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:15,460
the to talk about CFC our that's that's

00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:18,009
a reality for us I think you know these

00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:19,570
guys were talking about Kubo when it was

00:27:18,009 --> 00:27:21,580
first announced and and how can we like

00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:23,139
what can we how can we get you guys up

00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:25,990
and running and and and and let's take

00:27:23,139 --> 00:27:27,429
advantage of this and you know I I'm

00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:35,980
confident that we can and we will

00:27:27,429 --> 00:27:38,889
so that's that was our journey so I mean

00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:43,509
we've been working for two years

00:27:38,889 --> 00:27:49,090
together at least however the production

00:27:43,509 --> 00:27:52,330
has been funny you ask that so there

00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:54,820
there have been production outages we're

00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:56,350
lucky in that we have a we have

00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:58,600
maintenance windows regularly we're not

00:27:56,350 --> 00:28:02,830
we're not always always up or always

00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:08,230
guaranteed up but production outages

00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:09,789
we've had one and but then we've had to

00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:14,200
reach out in like kind of an emergency

00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:17,700
scenario I think three times total over

00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:20,190
the past two years which is incredible

00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:27,290
so yeah that's that's something that I

00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:39,840
feel like we knock on a lot of wood yeah

00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:43,770
anything else yes sure I mean it working

00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:47,250
with working with our java java 1/5 app

00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:48,780
i not just not just anecdotally not just

00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:51,470
in a you know oh you know we're not able

00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:55,020
to use the latest and the greatest the

00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:57,870
features of Java in spring but but that

00:28:55,020 --> 00:29:01,320
old codebase was just painful to work

00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:04,890
with and and we were not able to to

00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:09,060
innovate and and and it and it took a

00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:12,330
toll on us I think as developers we

00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:13,770
weren't happy I you know we were happy

00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:15,720
to work together and we have a great

00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:17,520
team but we weren't happy with the code

00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:21,900
with with the application we are now

00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:23,310
it's a pleasure it really is so that it

00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:29,850
from that perspective our quality of

00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:32,640
life is improved greatly I think yeah I

00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:35,310
mean I don't know that I have any

00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,960
metrics necessarily other than the

00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:38,850
amount of the amount of code that's out

00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:41,580
there right now that and the amount of

00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:44,520
code that goes out every day but we're

00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:47,280
doing a lot more with less I mean it's

00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:51,360
it's I we still have for developers but

00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:53,340
but we used to we used to pull in so

00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,380
many so many extra resources to to

00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:57,810
verify our large you know monolith

00:29:55,380 --> 00:30:00,620
deploys and we we don't we don't need to

00:29:57,810 --> 00:30:03,360
do that anymore we we were able to to do

00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:05,610
you know rapid deployment and and it's

00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:09,120
very simple verification of smaller

00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:11,520
services and it taxes less of the team

00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:15,390
so we're just everyone's more productive

00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:19,950
I think but also we tackle problems from

00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:24,270
from a much different angle now you we

00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:29,100
don't we were very quick to push out you

00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:30,300
know simple solutions that would be very

00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:33,090
complex to

00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:38,810
built into our our you know enterprises

00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:38,810
archive so yeah

00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:55,570
yep

00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:06,860
certainly yes so we knew we knew at the

00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:11,120
time that we had to do something and and

00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:13,400
the we were we were having production

00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,990
issues performance issues and and and

00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,610
our customers were noticing and so we

00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:18,590
knew we had to throw some amount of

00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:23,300
money at this thing we didn't have a lot

00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:26,360
but you know it there was no there was

00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:29,450
no next tier of hardware for a WebLogic

00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:32,150
server that made sense so yeah the Cloud

00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:34,910
Foundry is not cheap you know open

00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:39,010
source isn't free the the infrastructure

00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:41,929
cost is is is you know significant but

00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:43,670
once once you have the brain you know

00:31:41,929 --> 00:31:48,320
once you have once you have the the

00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:52,490
foundation we can scale forever now and

00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:54,380
and we can scale you know with a fixed

00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:56,210
amount of you know resource and and

00:31:54,380 --> 00:32:00,980
support from from Stark and Wayne and

00:31:56,210 --> 00:32:03,760
that's you know we're not going to you

00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:06,890
know outgrow ourselves anytime soon so

00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:09,740
so yeah the the the footprint of Cloud

00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:12,500
Foundry certainly much much larger than

00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:16,190
our WebLogic and apache and oracle

00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:18,200
servers but this is our future and and

00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:20,660
and it's it was them certainly the most

00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,950
cost-effective option that we had found

00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:24,980
first-first something that's going to

00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:28,090
take us you know for as long as we can

00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:31,090
see into the future if that makes sense

00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:31,090
yep

00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:46,600
so as far as our Cloud Foundry

00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:55,000
environment goes strike and Wayne is our

00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:57,140
operations resource they are there

00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:02,870
monitoring and maintaining and applying

00:32:57,140 --> 00:33:05,510
patches you know we we touch CF from an

00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:07,220
app perspective we're in there working

00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:09,740
with it all the time

00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:11,870
and the most we ever have to reach out I

00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:15,110
think on it on a regular basis is to say

00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:17,179
hey Kevin we're gonna push five new app

00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:20,570
instances out do we need to bump a to

00:33:17,179 --> 00:33:24,500
another Diego cell or not but other than

00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:29,059
that we don't we don't touch it we push

00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:32,049
to it and and and these guys are behind

00:33:29,059 --> 00:33:32,049
the scenes doing all the work

00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:18,909
[Music]

00:34:25,909 --> 00:34:34,380
it is it's it's using the latest Genesis

00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:36,870
right so yes yeah that was one of the

00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:39,659
interesting the interesting dilemmas was

00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:43,500
while the azure hypervisor support was

00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:45,870
brand-new but but existed the the

00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:47,820
Genesis you know scripts had to be

00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:49,919
converted because this was the first

00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:52,370
time I think that you guys were

00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:56,040
deploying to like open source to Azure

00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:59,160
and we had to you know K we Jeff and

00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:01,500
Dennis had to can convert existing AWS

00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:03,620
scripts to to you know work with Ezra it

00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:06,050
wasn't a lot of work that I can recall

00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:09,410
but but yeah it's all running through

00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:09,410
through Genesis

00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:13,010
[Music]

00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:45,010
and then we could lose customers so like

00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:47,440
the question is is losing all those

00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:50,620
customers and having like the scale JVM

00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:53,230
cheaper than here as your cons like we

00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:55,780
didn't want to play that game so we have

00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:57,460
maintained business we've grown and it

00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:59,740
is significantly more expensive than

00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:02,680
running what logic jmo the VMware

00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:05,140
internally but it's worth with us

00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:06,580
because you know we don't we don't want

00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:10,130
a lot of business like that's the other

00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:14,570
option I think it was a costly

00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:18,860
did you scare the Jews too

00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:29,300
Colgate smaller than usual push-ups

00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:31,190
in order to lower the kevanna

00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:34,000
I don't know if you even recall the the

00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:34,000
the inception

00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:09,119
yeah just yeah and then there's backing

00:37:07,319 --> 00:37:11,579
services which we use to run our

00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:13,140
business that are I mean we're at the

00:37:11,579 --> 00:37:16,760
point now where we're like why can't we

00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:16,760
just put everything in the country

00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:54,370
I think we had 10 in production it's

00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:54,370
about 10 in Pride

00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:07,540
[Music]

00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:12,059
Colton thanks everybody
