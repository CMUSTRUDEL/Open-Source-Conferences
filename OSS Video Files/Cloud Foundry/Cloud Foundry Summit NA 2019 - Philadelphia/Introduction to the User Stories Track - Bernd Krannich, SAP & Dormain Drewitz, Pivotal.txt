all right it's 11:11 we're gonna go

00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,700
ahead and get started and hopefully

00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:07,770
folks will figure out that they should

00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,970
start filtering into rooms because

00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:11,900
there's just not going to be as much

00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:14,280
interesting conversation in the hallway

00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:18,960
my name is Doreen Dreiwitz I'm on the

00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:21,750
pivotal team Daanish ooh well that was

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,400
long my name is ben connie i'm from sa p

00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,160
working an SME cloud platform as a

00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,170
technical lead so we have the pleasure

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,679
of co-chairing this track which is the

00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:33,809
user stories track a little bit of

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:38,309
background I guess for folks how many

00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:41,850
folks this is their first CF summit okay

00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:44,070
welcome alright welcome a little bit of

00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:47,180
history there for a long time was a

00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:49,950
cloud foundry in the enterprise track

00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:53,370
which was really kind of the one place

00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:56,730
where you know very consciously the user

00:00:53,370 --> 00:01:00,539
stories could be sort of funneled into

00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:04,199
and over the years we started to get a

00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:06,060
lot of user stories and so some of us

00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:08,640
were advocating to the foundation to

00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:13,140
make a little bit more room in the

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,549
overall agenda at CF summit to to kind

00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,590
of make it obvious for folks who were

00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:19,259
submitting that they had lots of places

00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:21,869
where they could share their stories so

00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:23,729
this is kind of evolved and this year

00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:26,759
you'll find especially in the hallway

00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:28,500
you know Cloud Foundry for business

00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:31,829
Cloud Foundry for developers Cloud

00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:35,400
Foundry for operators and even in the

00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:39,030
the kind of extensions and Cloud Foundry

00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:42,390
101 sort of core technical tracks you'll

00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:44,399
actually find user stories distributed

00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:46,560
across all of them because there's so

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,270
much participation from end users at

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,990
this conference which is one of the

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:53,970
reasons I think it's very special and so

00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,549
you know this one we kind of had to

00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:57,960
evolve what the user stories was really

00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:59,790
gonna be about so I don't know if you

00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,009
want to say a few words about that right

00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:04,950
so basically we had a conversation

00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:07,350
around how are we going to like select

00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:10,170
the talks so you essentially get way

00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:12,390
more submissions than we have slots in

00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:13,800
the track so we have a conversation

00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:17,020
around how we would actually

00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:20,050
select stuff and basically we said yeah

00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:21,220
we want to hear and use a story so and

00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:23,770
then we have an interesting conversation

00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:26,170
around like what's with operators are

00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:28,150
these end users in the definition of

00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:29,950
that track and I think we concluded and

00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:32,170
said yes of course like operators are

00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:34,330
end-users too so that's how we how we

00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:37,870
came to the selection and it's a mix of

00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:41,980
and user and users and operator and user

00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:44,440
stories and there's a lot of benefit of

00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:46,990
kind of sometimes hearing the failure

00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:51,280
stories right hearing the challenges and

00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:54,160
I as you know in the pivotal in our

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,870
customer marketing group we get asked

00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,850
okay it's great to hear the successes

00:02:55,870 --> 00:03:00,970
but you know we need to hear the hard

00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:02,890
stuff too and so there are a couple of

00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:05,350
talks in particular and line up today

00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:07,840
that are very focused around you know

00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:10,510
things got hard and here's how we work

00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:13,900
through them so just to kind of quickly

00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:16,990
give you a preview of what's in store in

00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:19,060
this particular track today you know

00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:21,940
what we're gonna start off with bhavani

00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:24,130
from Nasdaq which is kind of a new user

00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:25,810
story and so in terms of what we've seen

00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:27,910
through the years have a knack sort of

00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:30,220
heard a talk from Nasdaq so I'm excited

00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:32,950
about that and the dotnet angle was also

00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:35,200
interesting and so you know always want

00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:37,120
to kind of that's an important workload

00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,910
and a lot of enterprises and so how are

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:43,840
people navigating you know where they're

00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:47,820
running their dotnet sure of course then

00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:51,250
we will hear from Stark and Wayne about

00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:53,860
story around data centers exploding

00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:55,600
ultimately but then like that story

00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:57,940
turning out in in a good way so it's

00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:00,610
called a success story curious to hear

00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:02,800
how they turned that catastrophic

00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:04,450
situation into a success ultimately yeah

00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,070
and that's one where they're they're a

00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:08,230
vendor working very closely with end

00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:09,640
users so you know looking through the

00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:11,019
actual description the abstract it was

00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:13,330
based on something that happened with

00:04:11,019 --> 00:04:16,090
one of their clients so sort of a proxy

00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:19,419
for the end user the next one after that

00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:22,840
the is a deep dive so just a heads up

00:04:19,419 --> 00:04:24,580
this is the the third one that we have

00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,860
lined up here is

00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:29,680
60 minute session all the other ones are

00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:31,990
30-minute sessions so here we're gonna

00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,800
hear from from State Farm and the you

00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:34,599
know the cracks in the foundation

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,280
definitely got my attention right in

00:04:34,599 --> 00:04:37,720
terms of what are some of those failure

00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,849
stories what are some of those challenge

00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,949
stories that we can all sort of learn

00:04:39,849 --> 00:04:44,199
from and you know usually there's kind

00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:45,250
of there's there's sunshine at the other

00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:47,909
end of the rainbow but there's some

00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:52,330
storm clouds you know along the way and

00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:54,789
you know also State Farm again an end

00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:56,259
user that we haven't heard from at CF

00:04:54,789 --> 00:04:58,300
summit so having the opportunity to get

00:04:56,259 --> 00:05:00,969
that story out was definitely one we

00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:02,979
wanted to select right then the next one

00:05:00,969 --> 00:05:05,259
the local heroes from Comcast

00:05:02,979 --> 00:05:07,509
ultimately and I guess we've already

00:05:05,259 --> 00:05:09,940
heard yesterday and and also today

00:05:07,509 --> 00:05:12,819
around the scale at which they are using

00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:16,240
Cloud Foundry so timÃ­s is going to talk

00:05:12,819 --> 00:05:17,919
about how they were actually overcoming

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,740
challenges when it comes to scaling

00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:25,479
cloud foundry two levels that I think

00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:27,789
only very few cloud foundry users have

00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:29,740
have reached and and so it's good for

00:05:27,789 --> 00:05:31,930
like everybody who is on that journey to

00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:35,139
basically see what what's ahead of them

00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:37,930
and how to also deal with certain

00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:43,150
situations and challenges when it comes

00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:45,880
to scaling up yeah absolutely from those

00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:47,800
who Forge the path ahead the the next

00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:50,020
talk after that the air force actually

00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,969
last year in Boston we had a couple of

00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:53,889
talks from the air force so we've been

00:05:51,969 --> 00:05:57,039
hearing a little bit from them this one

00:05:53,889 --> 00:06:00,490
caught my attention as the the tested

00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:04,180
air force I've confirmed the AF stands

00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:08,020
for air force just in case anyone was

00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:10,360
wondering got that one in writing but

00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:12,279
testing all the things something that

00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,810
you know personally I feel really

00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:17,050
passionate about I see someone in their

00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:19,330
concourse team t-shirt over there but

00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:21,699
just you know for the customers that we

00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:24,789
see that are really successful on the

00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:27,039
platform you know thinking about how you

00:06:24,789 --> 00:06:28,930
know writing the tests and implementing

00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:31,150
the test automation and kind of going

00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:34,030
beyond sometimes the obvious of the

00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:37,930
unit tests it seems to be really

00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:39,760
critical in success and so having a user

00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:41,710
like the airforce that's that you know

00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:43,870
been deploying a lot of really critical

00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:44,950
systems onto Cloud Foundry sharing some

00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:47,470
of their wisdom from that seemed like a

00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:49,180
really valuable story to share and then

00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:51,310
last but not least like I talked about

00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:53,080
Comcast being on the upper scale of

00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:55,840
Cloud Foundry consumption

00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:57,930
the last one is Jaret from Demont Bridge

00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,430
accompanied by brine from suckin Wayne

00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:02,650
talking about how a small business can

00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:06,370
actually benefit from Cloud Foundry and

00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:08,310
and how also focusing on the core

00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:10,780
business and the core business values

00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:14,740
basically made them successful using

00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:16,150
cloud for me there's a little bit of a

00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:18,130
notion that Oh

00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:21,070
Cloud Foundry is only for like giant

00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:22,690
enterprises and so it definitely stood

00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:23,620
out to us that oh you know this is kind

00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:26,440
of one of those stories that I think

00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:28,840
will help challenge that perception of

00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:31,510
the project so looking forward to

00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:34,510
hearing that we've got just two minutes

00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:37,240
I think we'll kind of unless there are

00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:39,550
any questions usually there's not a lot

00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:41,200
of deep questions for the track intro

00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:43,570
but that was the easy part

00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:45,490
like the secrets have now the harder

00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:48,280
plan I'm always willing to be proven

00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:51,300
wrong with that well we'll have funny

00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:53,560
and amount of come up to help set up so

00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:56,440
enjoy the day make sure you're live

00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:59,880
tweeting and and thank you for being

00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,880
