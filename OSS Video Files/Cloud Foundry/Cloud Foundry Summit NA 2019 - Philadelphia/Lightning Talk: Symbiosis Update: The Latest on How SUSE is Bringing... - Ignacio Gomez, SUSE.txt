	Lightning Talk: Symbiosis Update: The Latest on How SUSE is Bringing Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes Together - Ignacio Gomez, SUSE

SUSE continues to combine the best of the two leading open source application platforms in the industry — Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes. Through projects like CF Containerization, Eirini, and Stratos, SUSE is fusing the mature development model of Cloud Foundry with the advanced container scheduling capabilities of Kubernetes.

yes I promise not to do too many slides

00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:07,049
because I usually don't like slides and

00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,690
I hate slides so I'll mostly talk about

00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:13,799
what I need to talk about so my name is

00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:16,139
Ignacio Gomez I work at Sousa and we

00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:17,699
have a booth downstairs or downstairs

00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:18,960
it's actually right next door if you

00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:21,390
guys want to come and talk to us about

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,189
what we're doing we have a distribution

00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,619
of a Cloud Foundry which is actually

00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:27,930
quite interesting so my role is I'm

00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:30,359
based out of amia so I live in close to

00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:33,030
London and I'm visiting partners and

00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:35,430
customers all the time just talking kind

00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,530
of what their problem is and about about

00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,870
18 months ago everybody started talking

00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:41,700
about kubernetes how great it was and a

00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:43,620
lot because it really solves our problem

00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,600
from an infrastructure slide because

00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,640
they're able to get so much optimization

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,950
from an infrastructure perspective and

00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,329
then Troy our product manager who's

00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:54,750
sitting right over there and looking at

00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:56,250
his laptop he basically said wouldn't it

00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:59,969
be cool if we could actually deploy

00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:02,399
Cloud Foundry directly on on a container

00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:04,559
platform and that was actually quite

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,170
interesting because you get a very small

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,909
memory footprint and you kind of replace

00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,689
kubernetes with Bosh because one of the

00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:11,670
big things

00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:13,409
Bosh gives you is scalability and

00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:14,670
resiliency and we kind of said

00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:17,040
kubernetes was actually quite

00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:20,640
interesting for that so now we're able

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,049
to deploy Cloud Foundry directly on top

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,470
of kubernetes so it gives you a lot of

00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:27,060
flexibility you can deploy on premise

00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:28,650
with your own kubernetes version or if

00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,000
you're on Google we can deploy on gke

00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:33,990
which we actually just started

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,880
supporting about three days ago nice and

00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:37,799
it just kind of built a very good story

00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,229
for a customer because at the end the

00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:41,549
day we're kind of really mirroring kind

00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:43,820
of the benefits of cloud foundry which

00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:46,200
is great developer productivity with the

00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:48,600
major benefits of kubernetes which is

00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,640
really optimizing the infrastructure and

00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,159
really optimizing the footprint so you

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,049
get a very good kind of bet the best of

00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:56,729
both worlds and at the same time you

00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:58,409
really solve a problem for the customer

00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:00,060
which is actually you don't have to

00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:02,759
maintain different platform so you can

00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:04,649
just maintain a kubernetes platform do

00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:06,390
your other kind of containers there and

00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:08,879
kind of happy days but then if you're

00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:10,649
building cofactor type applications you

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,629
can use a cloud foundry for that because

00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:14,580
that's kind of what it's good for and it

00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:17,010
scales quite nicely

00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:20,160
in Europe yeah you're kind of able to do

00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:22,680
that from the other slide Suzy we're

00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,630
actually working on three main projects

00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,340
from Cloud Foundry one is obviously the

00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:28,770
containerization that I've been talking

00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:30,930
about where we've continued eyes runtime

00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:32,340
the other one is a project ireenie so at

00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:34,950
the end of this month we're coming out

00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:36,660
with one point four which is our version

00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:40,200
of Cloud Foundry and you're going to be

00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:42,239
able to use a kubernetes scheduler

00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,310
instead of Diego so you'll have to you

00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,930
have the option to use either one or the

00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:47,520
other it's not going to be production

00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:51,300
grade yet because that's coming up

00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:52,769
that's a technical preview yes and the

00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,900
other one that we're working on is

00:02:52,769 --> 00:02:57,510
strata which is nice because you can be

00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:59,160
running different versions of of Cloud

00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:01,230
Foundry so you can have IBM you couldn't

00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:03,540
have PCF and you can have Sousa and it's

00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:05,760
all under one single pane of glass and

00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:07,350
that gives you kind of a nice kind of

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,790
way to manage it from an operator

00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:10,230
perspective at the end the day

00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:12,540
everything I've talked about kubernetes

00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:14,430
the de bumper doesn't care about and he

00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:16,650
shouldn't because that's just the way it

00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:18,269
works but from an operator side you can

00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:19,829
just kind of reutilize all those skills

00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:21,540
that you have from a gue kubernetes

00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:23,190
perspective to manage the infrastructure

00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:27,370
side and get those great optimizations

00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:32,789
yep good I think I was

00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:32,789
