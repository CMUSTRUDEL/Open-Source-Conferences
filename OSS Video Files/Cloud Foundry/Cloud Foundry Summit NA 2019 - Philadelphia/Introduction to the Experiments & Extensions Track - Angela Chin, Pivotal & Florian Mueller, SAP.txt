thanks everybody for starting off CF

00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:09,870
summit with us in the experiments and

00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:12,000
extensions track I'm Angela yeah I'm Flo

00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:15,450
and we are really happy to have you all

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,789
here we had a lot of submissions so we

00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:21,779
had to unfortunately throw out a lot of

00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:23,820
talks that were suggested now we are

00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:27,539
down to I think twelve or thirteen

00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:29,580
something like that yeah that's not

00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:32,250
really much to say we will quickly go

00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:34,739
through the agenda for today in tomorrow

00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:38,870
and then we probably can already start

00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:38,870
or with the first session

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,920
okay that's today so we try to depict

00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:49,020
sessions from from different areas so we

00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,719
have some open service broker related

00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:57,239
things we have kubernetes stuff we have

00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:59,789
Bosch things we have UI things we have K

00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:07,170
native somewhere in there and today we

00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:09,600
are starting with service brokers we

00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:12,600
have another session about both

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:16,170
deployments then there will be a session

00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:18,900
about I think it's about ireenie and

00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:21,720
cloud foundry in kubernetes and yoga and

00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,880
things like that another session about

00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:27,290
testing open service progress which

00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:30,540
seems to be a pain point right now

00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:31,560
another session about upgrade of call

00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,600
from reallocations

00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,360
especially in context of database

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,860
migrations and the last one today I'm

00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:41,700
looking forward to is a house

00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:47,759
engineering we hope to learn something

00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:50,670
in this session yeah and then so

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:53,610
tomorrow we can see that it's a little

00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:55,740
bit more kubernetes heavy we start off

00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:56,810
with sort of an introduction in primary

00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,100
to caÃ±edo

00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:01,680
we're gonna look at sort of one

00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:04,110
marketplace spanning across like maybe

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,880
Coverity using Cloud Foundry accessing

00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:07,340
cloud foundry marketplace you can see

00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:12,680
it's a theme from York

00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:14,810
cluster and again in addition looking at

00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:16,940
you know managing your applications on

00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:18,770
both CF and kubernetes so really looking

00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:20,840
at the two of them together

00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:22,580
and then we'll sort of shift gears

00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:26,870
towards the end of the day and we have

00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:30,590
an interesting talk on using vaults with

00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:34,569
Bosch and then finally customizing your

00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:36,849
cloud foundry UI so we're really excited

00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:39,050
hopefully this sort of gives you an idea

00:02:36,849 --> 00:02:41,720
helps you plan your schedule for the

00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:45,440
next couple of days and we'll see you

00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:46,819
back in this room and with that we

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:51,220
really don't have much else to say other

00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:54,530
than we're really excited and we'll let

00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:58,489
Georgie give the first stop of the day

00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:59,959
from sa heat on well we can look at the

00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:02,030
schedule here on the subtle art of

00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:04,459
keeping your broker multi-platform

00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:09,760
compatible which I think he'll start in

00:03:04,459 --> 00:03:09,760
five minutes yeah thanks everyone

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,249
