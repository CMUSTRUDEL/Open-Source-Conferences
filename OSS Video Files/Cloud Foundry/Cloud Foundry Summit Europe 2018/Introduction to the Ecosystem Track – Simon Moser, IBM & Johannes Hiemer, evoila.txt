yeah welcome to the ecosystem Trek my

00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:11,070
name is Johannes I'm from Ebola

00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:13,559
my name is Simon Moser I am from I IBM

00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:16,590
and co-chairing this this ecosystem

00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:18,600
track together so hoping that a bunch of

00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:20,310
more people will actually come inside

00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:24,180
because the tracks are about to start

00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:26,519
everybody is still getting coffee so I

00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:29,070
think we we do have a really interesting

00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:31,349
track together here on the ecosystem and

00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:34,860
what is the ecosystem track fully about

00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:36,719
right ecosystem track is about when you

00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,610
saw Abby's keynote this morning it's

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,190
about this card founder universe like

00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:43,590
what are all the touch pads where Cloud

00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:45,570
Foundry interacts with other

00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:48,090
technologies and we have a lot of really

00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:50,940
compelling examples about this like just

00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:54,660
starting off right now with Ning and

00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:56,550
Thomas talking about dotnet apps on

00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:59,219
Cloud Foundry but we also have other

00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:02,129
stuff where we are looking into how to

00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:03,890
integrate Redis persistent data how do

00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:07,770
you do

00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:09,780
how do you do a Cloud Foundry mallet

00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:14,299
which actually will win the prize for

00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,299
the best talk title in my humble opinion

00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:20,549
and and last but least of course looking

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,310
at all the other stuff like the birds of

00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:25,650
a feather which I think there's a lot of

00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:29,400
great a lot of great talks coming up

00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:31,920
throughout the day so you Hanna's me we

00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,229
will be here parts of the time at least

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,909
so you'll go find us in the room if

00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:39,329
there's any problems with technology for

00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:41,490
the speakers just five and yes if we're

00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:45,210
not here for one of the breaks session

00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:48,979
breaks just do whatever it takes so here

00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:51,979
all the time and with that I think we're

00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:51,979
