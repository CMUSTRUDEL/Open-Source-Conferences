okay so before people disappear we have

00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:08,069
some awards to give out and I'm watching

00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:10,620
people walk out the door okay all right

00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:13,950
so we have a couple of words we want to

00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:16,379
give out the the first is I mentioned

00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,990
that we ran a hackathon right so 24

00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:21,570
hours of coding teams get together they

00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:24,660
come up with interesting ideas and they

00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:27,029
attempt to complete it in a very quick

00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,250
amount of time then they were judged so

00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:32,820
as I walked back over here I'm gonna

00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:35,520
pull out what the prize is we have a

00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:39,030
cool drone for each member of the

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:41,219
winning team and in particular I want to

00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:43,410
thank our judges for helping participate

00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:45,629
I want to thank Chris Clark from my team

00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:47,610
for helping to organize the the

00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:49,559
hackathon event I really do think it's

00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:51,860
one of the most interesting parts of the

00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:56,579
kind of day zero activities that we run

00:00:51,860 --> 00:01:00,180
okay so the winning team was team Bosh

00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:02,550
central I'm not gonna read all that to

00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:05,100
you but basically what they did was they

00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:07,530
created a package manager for Bosh

00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,820
releases they were trying they were

00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:12,510
looking at Bosh looking at some of the

00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:13,830
gaps that it may have and they managed

00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:16,259
to pull something together and I believe

00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:18,630
it also included a web UI so I'd like to

00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:20,490
invite the actual four members of the

00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:22,290
team I think are over here somewhere to

00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:24,119
come on on stage I only have one of the

00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,670
drones but everybody give them a round

00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:29,460
of applause okay we've got genic

00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:33,630
Benjamin Christian and Rene from both

00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:35,369
Ebola and from G stack so here who wants

00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:36,720

00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:38,670
Chris over there for the other one

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,820

chris has the other other drones down

00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:56,619
there awesome okay so besides the

00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:58,150
hackathon we also ran some community

00:01:56,619 --> 00:02:00,610
Awards and one of the categories that we

00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:02,170
had was what we called stealth ops now

00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:03,670
these are folks that maybe kind of fly

00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:07,810
under the covers don't necessarily get

00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:13,239
on stage very frequently but are

00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:14,739
incredibly important to our ecosystem so

00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:17,950
we have two winners and I'm going to ask

00:02:14,739 --> 00:02:21,400
them to join me up here in a second but

00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:23,250
we have Natalie Bennett so Natalie's a

00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:26,290
frequent contributor to the open-source

00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:27,970
discussions the community efforts she

00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:30,250
works in the release integration team

00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:32,080
now for those of you that may not be

00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:34,569
familiar the release integration team is

00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,640
the team that takes all of the various

00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:38,620
components right hundreds of

00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,600
repositories of code and brings it

00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:43,959
through a central pipeline it's really

00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:46,630
critical to to the efforts you know that

00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:48,850
we have to produce this this open source

00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:51,459
platform the other though of course is

00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:53,440
Dimitri Callen so Dimitri has been

00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:55,090
running the Boche PMC for quite some

00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,579
time he recently stepped aside to kind

00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:59,709
of move on to the next career adventure

00:02:57,579 --> 00:03:02,079
he's having you know within pivotal but

00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:03,790
Dimitri has been so important to the the

00:03:02,079 --> 00:03:06,700
Cloud Foundry community overall Bosch

00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:08,260
community specifically and we just

00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:11,049
wanted to make sure that that he was

00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:12,489
rewarded for his time so if Dimitri and

00:03:11,049 --> 00:03:14,590
Natalie could come on up here we have an

00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:16,330

right one other award unfortunately

00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:08,840
they're not able to be here they were at

00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:10,460
our North American summit but we asked

00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,410
for the coolest user story and this is

00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:13,910
something that we're we really want to

00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:15,170
start getting more submissions for

00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:15,890
because there are so many amazing

00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:18,260
stories

00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:20,930
so each summit we want to highlight at

00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:22,940
least one end user that has just an

00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:24,140
incredible story about the adoption of

00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:26,210
cloud foundry how it's changing their

00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:27,590
business making major impact in their

00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:30,410
organization if they're not actually a

00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:32,900
corporation so this year or at this

00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:35,900
event we'd like to congratulate the Home

Depot retail firm predominantly the US

00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:40,130
but global they have fundamentally

00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:42,440
changed the way that they deliver

00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:44,690
software within their organization they

00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:47,510
even have some fascinating approaches to

00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:49,130
finding more developers they look to

00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:50,780
their store associates and find ways to

00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:54,140
elevate people up through career ladders

00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:56,630
an IT so if you haven't heard the home

00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:58,100
depot story go to class battery or you

00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:59,900

there are lots of talks about them as

00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:03,620

sharing not only an opportunity for us

00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:16,200
to all be more welcome and inclusive for

00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:19,680
our community but how we can all be

00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:21,240
better period and I know that was a

00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:25,530
tough thing for you both to do and I

00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:31,710
really appreciate it so by the numbers

00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:34,470
really quickly today and yesterday so in

00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:38,100
two days we've crammed in 144 keynotes

00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:41,880
breakouts and lightning talks we had 65

00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:44,340
member companies here or within the

00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:48,800
community eight certified platforms and

00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:51,150
we had 961 attendees that is a

00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,100
significant jump over last year so it's

00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:58,680
really great to see Europe continuing to

00:07:53,100 --> 00:08:00,930
grow year-over-year thank you again to

not possible

00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:06,530
whenever emphasized that again when we
