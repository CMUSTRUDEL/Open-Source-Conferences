yes hi guys I'm mati scrat's I work for

00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:08,849
Swisscom I'm the head of cloud

00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:11,480
empowerment there we are a small team of

00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:14,389
cloud experts helping our customers

00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:19,080
internal and external customers in their

00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:21,390
journey to cloud-based engineering and

00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:25,730
I'm Dorman drewett's I'm on the product

00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:28,590
marketing team at pivotal and this is

00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:31,650
the first time that I've been doing the

00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:36,540
cloud foundry in the enterprise track

00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:39,360
chair at CF summit and Europe but I've

00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:43,320
done it two times from North America so

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:46,440
we have some observations from kind of

00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,239
what we were able to to look through in

00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,809
terms of the submissions that came in

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:54,350
for this track one thing that we we

00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:57,390
talked about is kind of an important

00:00:54,350 --> 00:01:00,840
criteria for how we look at the

00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:03,989
submissions to build this is you know

00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:06,119
really focusing on real end-users with

00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:08,490
real experiences in the enterprise and

00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:10,799
so while sometimes some of the

00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:16,770
submissions had really interesting

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:19,110
sounding ideas about what they were

00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:23,610
going to show as being possible on Cloud

00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:25,530
Foundry we favored real end users who

00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:26,939
would have not been talking about

00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,600
something that maybe it's just a science

00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:30,659
experiment

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,759
so mathas do you want to go through what

00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:34,530
we've got lined up for day one quickly

00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:37,560
yes sure

00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:41,250
so when we were tor main and I were

00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:43,710
preparing this track we had the nice

00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:47,280
problem that we had a lot of submissions

00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:49,110
to choose from which is as I said a nice

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,930
problem to have because that shows us

00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:54,840
that our community in the enterprise is

00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:57,719
very much alive our stuff that we

00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,090
engineer every day in the Cloud Foundry

00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:04,409
community is being used to create value

00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:06,270
in the enterprise which would be a very

00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:07,829
bad sign if it didn't happen

00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:09,959
it would be very bad sign for us but

00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:12,819
luckily that's not the case and we have

00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:16,230
a brilliant lineup for you prepared

00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:19,150
for today we have contributions by

00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:22,510
talents which will be the starting point

00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:26,260
of this set of this track then we have

00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:30,579
tallest digital Factory and pivotal then

00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:34,299
we have Fiserv then why we pro energy

00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:36,879
and pivotal then we have the Renault

00:02:34,299 --> 00:02:39,099
Nissan Mitsubishi Alliance together with

00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:42,609
pivotal we have the fidelity

00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:44,620
international folks and we finish off

00:02:42,609 --> 00:02:47,889
with the contribution by Air France and

00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:49,930
KLM so as you can see we have a very

00:02:47,889 --> 00:02:53,349
interesting lineup planned for you today

00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:56,109
yeah I think one way to think about day

00:02:53,349 --> 00:02:58,569
one is these are some of the stories

00:02:56,109 --> 00:03:02,019
that were submitted that seemed maybe a

00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:05,230
bit more broad at general about the

00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:08,109
adoption or how some of these different

00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:11,109
organizations have gotten started with

00:03:08,109 --> 00:03:14,739
the platform but as we look to day 2 we

00:03:11,109 --> 00:03:17,620
start to get into some more specific use

00:03:14,739 --> 00:03:19,120
cases and some interesting things that

00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:22,439
are happening inside a couple specific

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,879
organizations like Rabobank data of

00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:28,629
Rijkswaterstaat if i'm pronouncing that

00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:31,780
correctly and a nova tech which is doing

00:03:28,629 --> 00:03:34,750
a lot of work within the the

00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:38,199
german-speaking regions and then finally

00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:42,069
with comic relief which is a uk-based

00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:44,290
charity and that's been using cloud

00:03:42,069 --> 00:03:45,849
foundry for a number of years and

00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:48,370
continues to kind of push the boundaries

00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:50,500
so they're adding the container service

00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:52,989
is going to come up in that panel so I

00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:55,780
think you know getting to sort of today

00:03:52,989 --> 00:03:58,180
is sort of the warm-up you know see kind

00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:00,340
of the the general overview and tomorrow

00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:03,699
is kind of the master's level courses if

00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:06,069
you will but we we both agreed as we

00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:09,039
were talking about this track that it's

00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:11,859
it's obviously the most important track

00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:13,659
in the whole conference I mean and you

00:04:11,859 --> 00:04:17,009
guys are obviously the smartest people

00:04:13,659 --> 00:04:17,009
at the conference no don't leave

00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:25,860
okay - - because of what Malthus said

00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:28,919
that is this is all an indication of the

00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:31,380
the growing health of the community in

00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:33,020
terms of the end users that are really

00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:36,810
putting this to the test inside

00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:39,360
enterprises and last year I think there

00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:41,820
was maybe four or five different and

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,500
user enterprises that were presenting at

00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:46,800
the conference like I said I wasn't the

00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:49,830
track chair last year but I was always

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:53,370
keenly watching those and so this year

00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:55,980
the fact that we had you know more than

00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:58,500
enough to fill the entire track so I

00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:00,180
think about 13 different talks that's a

00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,130
pretty big jump so over a hundred

00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:04,860
percent growth in terms of the number of

00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:06,960
end users that are presenting here and I

00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:09,690
think this doesn't even count arange

00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,910
which is presenting in another track as

00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:13,890
they've they've gotten even more into

00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:16,680
the just going straight into technical

00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:18,120
tracks you know we still consider them

00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:22,650
part of the most important track of

00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:24,570
course that being this one so now and

00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:27,360
it's kind of interesting also this this

00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:29,310
next bit that we've observed as as the

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,260
evidence grows about use of cloud

00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:32,880
foundering the enterprise exactly so

00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:35,660
we've heard a very interesting talk

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:38,550
about diversity in the keynotes and

00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:42,240
again here we observe a lot of cultural

00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:43,860
diversity we have contributions from

00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,039
many different countries in Europe this

00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:48,900
is obviously also a characteristic of

00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:51,690
the European summit we get a lot more

00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:53,910
different countries contributing we have

00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:56,360
people local people then we have people

00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:58,979
from France the Netherlands the UK

00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:01,440
Germany and probably we've forgotten

00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:03,539
some flags here as well yeah maybe some

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:07,680
folks who are on some of the panels or

00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:10,140
add some additional coverage across the

00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,240
globe so this is exciting for me because

00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:16,380
yeah the the North American one it's

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,940
usually like two countries so not as

00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:20,039
many flags so that's always a

00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:22,220
disappointment but I think with that

00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:24,950
we'll hand it over to our first speaker

00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:28,560
thanks to the folks who are coming in

00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:29,880
welcome and enjoy the day and we'll

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,130
start off with

00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:33,750
your Boston from Tonks who's gonna tell

00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:37,020
us about their journey from AWS to

00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:40,080
college foundry thank you very much

00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:40,080
