	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
and I'd like to introduce myself I'm

00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:09,540
Nicola Ricketts working for Swisscom as

00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:11,940
a software engineer hello and my name is

00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,889
pan Cornish I'm a technical lead at sa P

00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:17,279
cloud platform and we both have the

00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:19,740
pleasure to be the coatrack chairs for

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,600
the core projects track and with that I

00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,130
think we've earned the honor to open up

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,449
the track and talk a little bit about

00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:29,160
like what we what we did there so

00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:31,109
essentially as a coatrack chair you are

00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,090
presented with all the submissions for a

00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:36,719
particular track em now the challenge is

00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:39,989
obviously to pick the ones that kind of

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,910
fit that track best so we decided on a

00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:44,700
couple of selection criteria to actually

00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:46,620
do that so obviously first of all and

00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,840
that is maybe also tip for people who

00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,030
are thinking about submitting tracks for

00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,430
Cloud Foundry summit or any tech

00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,260
conference in particular we looked at

00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,789
the title and the abstract and asked

00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,920
ourselves like is there really

00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:02,219
interesting for the people that come to

00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:05,970
the core projects track kind of obvious

00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:07,560
right that then also think about is what

00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:09,210
you're proposing really fitting to the

00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,189
track that you're proposing the topic

00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:13,320
into so we had a couple of interesting

00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:15,659
proposals but we then ended up rejecting

00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,700
those because they did not really fit

00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:20,310
the bill of a core projects track so if

00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,259
you talk about I don't know an

00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:23,970
interesting customer project then maybe

00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:26,280
there's other tracks at Cloud Foundry

00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:29,340
summit where such a talk fits fits way

00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,619
better so that is one and then obviously

00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:34,500
we have to answer the question of like

00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:37,140
what is core projects anyhow and then if

00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:39,119
you look up kind of the Cloud Foundry

00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,310
open source projects on the Cloud

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,290
Foundry homepage you obviously find out

00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:45,630
you have like bigger buckets you have

00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:47,130
Cloud Foundry application runtime the

00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:49,290
thing that was formerly called Cloud

00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:53,280
Foundry I would say then you have Cloud

00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:55,649
Foundry container runtime so Kubo the

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,049
Boche release that takes kubernetes and

00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:59,729
makes that deployable Maya Bosch you

00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:01,649
have obviously Bosh itself as the

00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:04,229
lifecycle management tool or powering

00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:08,789
many of the projects inside Cloud

00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:10,920
Foundry and we also like have talks

00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:12,069
around operations topic so it's not only

00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:14,170
about like those

00:02:12,069 --> 00:02:16,719
technical things but then also how how

00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:18,280
to run that stuff so that was one

00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:22,090
selection criteria and then it also

00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:24,639
turned out that we had like two or even

00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:26,439
more talks that kind of met all that

00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:28,349
criteria but then we're targeting

00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:31,060
relatively similar spaces so we

00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:32,650
essentially ended up kind of putting

00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:35,049
them next to each other saying like

00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:37,389
which of those two or three proposals is

00:02:35,049 --> 00:02:39,790
the most interesting one and uncover I

00:02:37,389 --> 00:02:41,400
can cover the most broad space over

00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:44,769
there

00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:48,549
beginning of June after we were assigned

00:02:44,769 --> 00:02:52,049
this Duty burnden myself synced and

00:02:48,549 --> 00:02:54,549
decided to go for a separate scoring and

00:02:52,049 --> 00:03:00,310
assessment of all the submissions and

00:02:54,549 --> 00:03:03,569
then resync after maybe 10 days and then

00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:06,790
compare and see where we have matching

00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:10,569
assessments and where we disagree to

00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:13,060
then discuss that and I personally try

00:03:10,569 --> 00:03:15,819
to not look at the authors or the

00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:19,329
speakers and the companies when doing

00:03:15,819 --> 00:03:23,259
these assessments to just find out after

00:03:19,329 --> 00:03:26,709
I had scores scored the submissions when

00:03:23,259 --> 00:03:30,489
we compared that we had a perfect match

00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:33,819
so either fully accept or fully reject a

00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:36,639
submission we would then not spend too

00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:39,790
much time on it but there was a rough

00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:42,519
amount of like eight to nine submissions

00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:45,419
where we had some disagreement where we

00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:49,359
discussed and then also like Burns said

00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:51,489
tried I mean because all of these would

00:03:49,359 --> 00:03:56,439
have been acceptable but we had to be

00:03:51,489 --> 00:04:01,090
duel to accept at most 12 talks in total

00:03:56,439 --> 00:04:04,629
so we try to have a overall coverage of

00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:08,439
at most topics that as possible and then

00:04:04,629 --> 00:04:13,150
after these discussions we submitted a

00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:15,519
common scoring ultimately what you see

00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:18,969
in the schedule today and tomorrow in

00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:22,150
the core track will be exactly what we

00:04:18,969 --> 00:04:25,000
submitted so the 12 that we accepted are

00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:25,360
now on the schedule plus one that has

00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,419
been

00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:34,030
add it so you have a total of 13 talks

00:04:28,419 --> 00:04:37,060
in this track okay and with that just to

00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:39,129
round off the the intro a quick overview

00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:41,759
on the tracks that we have finally

00:04:39,129 --> 00:04:44,349
selected including also the

00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,900
corresponding speakers and like the

00:04:44,349 --> 00:04:49,539
rough topic area that we thought this

00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:52,240
tracks would belong to so we're going to

00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:55,780
kick off the day with a talk on on Bosh

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:58,629
leads then we are going to continue with

00:04:55,780 --> 00:05:01,180
the Bosh related topic and look into see

00:04:58,629 --> 00:05:04,599
ICD around Bosh and how to out our great

00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:06,879
versions in inside wash packages next up

00:05:04,599 --> 00:05:09,819
are the colleagues that are working on

00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:12,159
bringing in sto inside Cloud Foundry and

00:05:09,819 --> 00:05:15,039
what new capabilities that this will

00:05:12,159 --> 00:05:17,050
bring then it's over again another

00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:19,120
networking related topic to container

00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:21,370
networking which is obviously related to

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,460
like the overall routing but then a

00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:26,590
slightly different perspective on it

00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:28,569
then a comparison between cloud foundry

00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:30,969
application runtime and cloud foundry

00:05:28,569 --> 00:05:33,550
container runtime obviously that's a

00:05:30,969 --> 00:05:36,550
topic that many people have questions

00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:39,729
about when to pick what then we have

00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:41,589
Marco talking about SL O's and then post

00:05:39,729 --> 00:05:43,599
performance related topics or another

00:05:41,589 --> 00:05:45,639
Bosh topic and I think Marco pointed out

00:05:43,599 --> 00:05:49,449
there's quite a few Bosh related things

00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:52,719
as well so that's obviously part of the

00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:55,659
core track and then we have Metin and

00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:57,279
nikolai talking about the services api

00:05:55,659 --> 00:05:59,500
so essentially the piece in cloud

00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:03,430
foundry that deals with the open service

00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:07,629
program done day two we have free

00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:11,589
talking about I am we have the

00:06:07,629 --> 00:06:14,199
colleagues from IBM talking about topics

00:06:11,589 --> 00:06:16,449
in in the cloud controller area we have

00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:17,710
Adam talking about a new component in

00:06:16,449 --> 00:06:20,710
the area of logging which is called

00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:22,509
Lokesh we have a talk that we put in

00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:24,729
like the operations bucket which is

00:06:22,509 --> 00:06:27,250
around a disaster recovery of the

00:06:24,729 --> 00:06:29,050
overall platform we have the garden

00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:30,580
windows team talking about the stuff

00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:32,349
that they are working on and then last

00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:33,639
but not least we have dart talking about

00:06:32,349 --> 00:06:37,410
the open service broker API

00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:39,900
specification in tool and with that we

00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:42,270
that we have done a decent job in kind

00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:45,780
of touching all the areas that make up

00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:49,080
the Cloud Foundry core projects and we

00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:51,630
wish you nice two days and hopefully you

00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:55,170
stay in like one or the other talk that

00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:58,470
is happening in in this room so Nicola

00:06:55,170 --> 00:07:01,110
and I we will try to hang out here as

00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:02,760
kind of our schedule allows and also try

00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:04,770
and moderate the session a little bit

00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:06,930
and of carry the microphones to the

00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:10,290
people asking questions as I said like

00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:12,750
as our schedules allow it so with that

00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:14,910
thank you very much and enjoy the two

00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:16,870
days at Cloud Foundry summit thank you

00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:20,420
very much

00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:20,420
