it's hard enough to get up here and talk

00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:18,310
about pushing code doing live demos but

00:00:16,869 --> 00:00:20,950
it's a whole other thing to get up here

00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:23,980
and talk about diversity inclusivity and

00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:26,410
so you have my heartfelt thanks Steve

00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:31,779
and it's a great reminder of what

00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:33,700
community actually means so we're just

00:00:31,779 --> 00:00:35,140
wrap this up really quickly because I

00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:38,829
know there's a ton of sessions and we're

00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:40,840
running just a few minutes over so we

00:00:38,829 --> 00:00:44,440
have a great couple of days planned here

00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:48,640
at Summit there's so many sessions

00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:52,270
packed into the next 48 hours so find a

00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:54,310
track or hop between tracks we've got

00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:57,329
everything from container and server

00:00:54,310 --> 00:01:00,970
lists core projects to ecosystem

00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:04,149
experiments and extensions operations

00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:06,549
and security and finally the use cases

00:01:04,149 --> 00:01:09,520
and wild car tracks there's a ton of

00:01:06,549 --> 00:01:13,499
great talks so try to go to as many as

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:15,999
you can tonight 6:00 p.m.

00:01:13,499 --> 00:01:18,939
there's the Welcome Reception and the

00:01:15,999 --> 00:01:21,670
booth crawl please do stop by there's a

00:01:18,939 --> 00:01:22,990
lot of great booths out there and again

00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:26,100
we're really appreciative of the

00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:28,689
sponsors that come and have booths here

00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:31,840
hands on lab we experimented with this

00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:34,479
earlier this year and it's a fantastic

00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,030
success if you're new to Cloud Foundry

00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:39,369
this is a great place to go and ask

00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:41,829
questions if you've been using it for a

00:01:39,369 --> 00:01:43,420
while and have some next-level questions

00:01:41,829 --> 00:01:47,979
this is a great place to go ask

00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:48,969
questions and get help tomorrow we're

00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:50,979
gonna talk a little bit more about

00:01:48,969 --> 00:01:52,840
diversity at the diversity luncheon

00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:55,810
we're gonna also be showing the

00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:58,359
screening of the chasing Grace project a

00:01:55,810 --> 00:02:00,939
docu-series which we're sponsors and I

00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:06,520
am a big fan so it's highly recommend

00:02:00,939 --> 00:02:07,899
your attending that and then I have to

00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,940
thank the sponsors again and I know

00:02:07,899 --> 00:02:12,760
you're like okay the sponsor time thinks

00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:15,310
but it really is important this does not

00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:18,579
happen without sponsors at all and so we

00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:21,970
really deeply appreciate all of you our

00:02:18,579 --> 00:02:23,620
Platinum and our gold sponsors but also

00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:25,299

our bronze and our start-up sponsors

00:02:25,299 --> 00:02:32,560

00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:34,540
event and make it possible I also want

00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,269
