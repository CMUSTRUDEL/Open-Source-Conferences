Title: Keynote: Customer Value is More than Just Technical Solutions
Publication date: 2018-10-11
Playlist: Cloud Foundry Summit Europe 2018
Description: 
	Keynote: Customer Value is More than Just Technical Solutions – Chisara Nwabara, Staff Technical Program Manager, Pivotal

A customer-facing team was feeling pain around communication with Pivotal R&D and we realized that this may not be a software problem but instead a communication problem. Software usually solves problems, but sometimes solutions could be as simple as changing people’s mindset. This adjustment can impact greatly and result in a significantly positive outcome. You may already have what you need to make a huge impact and cultural transformation is a critical element for digital transformation. Everyone's ultimate goal is to ensure that Pivotal provides recognizable value to customers through a positive customer experience.
In this keynote, Chisa will discuss some of the approaches Pivotal is taking to improve communication and build empathy between their R&D and customer-facing teams in order to deliver a better experience and value.

[Applause]

00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:12,450
cool I have my paper I just want you to

00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:13,590
know I told them I have my paper so

00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:18,300
we're okay why don't I have a Seaver

00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:20,160
quick okay so this is something that's

00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,830
near and dear to your heart I know that

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,410
you're super passionate about this

00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:27,300
particular problem so we're you just

00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:30,990
kind of give us the what's the top line

00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:32,399
here I think for me I just I just hate

00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:35,820
it when they're in efficiencies and when

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:39,059
I don't like wasting time is really what

00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:43,290
it is and I think it's just really

00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:46,079
interesting that often time we try to

00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:48,570
optimize for solutions and in doing so

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:53,940
make make the job even harder than it

00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:55,199
needs to be yeah and I think what a

00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,430
straight line actually looks like in

00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,000
practice is really different from what

00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:03,210
we think it looks like in our minds and

00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,339
oftentimes building something isn't the

00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,500
fastest way to solve something I guess

00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:08,670
that's what I would say gotcha so I

00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,630
guess the problem that you're describing

00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:14,369
is with within the enterprise we tend to

00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:18,000
be pretty inefficient right for all

00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:19,979
kinds of different reasons yeah yes yeah

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,600
yeah so and we shouldn't just build

00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:23,159
software as soon as we see a problem I

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,450
don't think we should just build

00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:26,820
something yeah maybe

00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:28,409
okay I stop and think about it so so

00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,229
what are we what does that mean like how

00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:32,880
does that actually play out how do you

00:01:30,229 --> 00:01:36,299
how do you not jump to the let's go

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:39,329
build something solution well I think

00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:40,530
first it's it's kind of like I think

00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:41,640
it's with the same thing with anything

00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:44,430
right you kind of think through the

00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,450
stages of what actually is the problem

00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:47,549
and first you have to state there is a

00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:49,229
problem yeah it's important to

00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:51,470
acknowledge it and then it's important

00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:53,820
to be aware of what's actually happening

00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:55,799
before you jump into action and I think

00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:57,840
oftentimes what we do is to say well

00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:01,500
there's this problem let's just fix it

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,719
and if you don't take a little bit of

00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,950
time to think about what actually is

00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:07,049
happening and where the dynamics of the

00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:11,400
situation and flip it over from every

00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:13,190
side you end up jumping so whatever is

00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,780
the easiest thing for you

00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:17,330
and the easiest thing for you will be

00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:21,950
whatever you are habitually used to and

00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:23,090
as engineers regardless of whether we're

00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,320
talking about like a computer

00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:27,770
engineering so software engineer or

00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:29,840
otherwise we're literally trained to

00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:34,490
engineer things to build things itself

00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:36,560
and I think that's great but there are a

00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:37,910
lot of other other things that maybe

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,340
aren't necessarily our strengths that

00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:43,130
could actually improve the way that we

00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:47,390
go about reaching the best solutions

00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:50,150
possible so so what do you think the

00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:52,310
biggest challenge yes I mean because

00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:53,720
that sounds obvious right like we of

00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:56,300
course we should think about what we're

00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:57,980
gonna do before we do it and and but it

00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:00,220
but yet we don't so what do you think

00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:05,210
the inhibitor is the inhibitor is that

00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:07,370
you if you you can't you it's hard to

00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:11,260
acknowledge what you can't see and we we

00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:14,090
as humans only see a certain amount and

00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:16,970
within our organizations we're used to

00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:21,230
working in given spaces so for instance

00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:22,790
in the example that we discussed we were

00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:26,540
doing work to try and figure out okay we

00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:30,110
have a customer and they expressed they

00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:31,370
expressed concerns or felt that their

00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:33,020
communication couldn't be better they

00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:34,910
didn't have as much visibility as they

00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:38,530
would have liked into what's happening

00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:40,400
on the R&D side of our of our company

00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:41,450
because they speak directly with our

00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,660
balanced account team which is

00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:48,110
effectively like our customer customer

00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:49,760
like experience team and there was an

00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:52,040
opportunity there for us to effectively

00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,110
think about how interdepartmental ysou

00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,820
between research and development between

00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:57,980
our balanced account team and between

00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:59,930
even our support teams how can we

00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:02,660
improve the things that we're each

00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:05,180
seeing to ensure that the end-to-end

00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:08,570
experience for our customer is more

00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:09,140
seamless and I think that's what can be

00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:11,030
difficult

00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:12,500
R&D sits over here the balance of

00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:13,820
counting sips over their support sits

00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,350
over there and even in terms of the way

00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:17,080
that most organizations are structured

00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:19,070
they're completely separate departments

00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:21,190
with completely different arms of

00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:24,560
leadership and they don't

00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:26,510
by default talk to each other and that's

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,260
something that we realize we have to be

00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:29,600
a little bit more

00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:31,220
about when we think about how that cross

00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,140
communication is happening it's not just

00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:36,410
something that implicitly occurs yeah

00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:38,990
yeah there's an old analogy where I Cass

00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:41,840
story that that people use which is back

00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:43,880
when we had three-tier architecture the

00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,010
way you'd fix a bug or the place that

00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:49,010
you fixed the bug was directly related

00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:50,720
to who got the bug report so if it was

00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:53,480
the UI team they were gonna fix it in

00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,150
the UI the DBAs found the problem there

00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:59,240
were gonna be some stored procedures

00:04:55,150 --> 00:05:00,950
yeah and I mean that was that was the

00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:03,680
reality for you know for the enterprise

00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:07,460
was you know that there was severe lack

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:09,740
of communication so so okay so that's

00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:11,240
the challenge and what what would you

00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:13,370
what do you recommend when you when you

00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,890
run into a situation where either

00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:17,480
internally at pivotal you know or when

00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:18,230
you're working with a customer and what

00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,300
are the things that you actually

00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:21,860
recommend or some concret steps people

00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:24,650
can use to either identify that they

00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:26,060
have this challenge and if you know if

00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:29,210
they already know they have it then what

00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:31,280
can they do to fix it well so as my

00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:33,110
actual role title is Technical Program

00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,460
Manager and one litmus test that I tell

00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:39,950
people is the moment that you're doing

00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:41,780
something that touches another team stop

00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:44,330
and think about what that communication

00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:46,220
might look like oftentimes teams have

00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:49,940
very different communication pipelines

00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:51,920
very different process pipelines and the

00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:53,870
moment that you touch another team their

00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,940
pipeline actually directly affects yours

00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:57,950
even though again because it's a long a

00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:59,630
value stream or a long a chain and so

00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:00,740
it's important to take time to pause and

00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:03,350
say okay well if we're touching this

00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:04,880
pipeline what happens when let's imagine

00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:08,210
that we're in a race what happens when I

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,500
hand off the baton to you is it actually

00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:11,600
going to be caught are we going to drop

00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:13,640
something and it it makes sense to take

00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,990
some time just to think about what does

00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,460
that look like what does that mean and

00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:18,410
how is that going to impact our overall

00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:20,270
for instance cycle time like how long is

00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:22,010
gonna take for this thing to get through

00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:23,840
this part of your pipeline and come out

00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:25,760
the other end back to me

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,730
so I think just having a conversation

00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:31,010
and and keeping in mind that the moment

00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:34,850
that something touches someone else it

00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:37,310
becomes a part of your ecosystem that's

00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:38,660
interesting so that's sort of the

00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,460
initial moment that you realize you have

00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:41,050
another team

00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:43,240
they advise for how do you maintain that

00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:44,710
over time right because it's become part

00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:48,699
of your ecosystem now so so what do you

00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:50,470
what do you do uh and actually someone

00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:52,599
just asked me a sweet question about

00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:55,120
this from the panel earlier but I think

00:06:52,599 --> 00:06:57,009
you it is it is possible to start small

00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,190
and run a small experienced experiment

00:06:57,009 --> 00:07:01,240
so the the reason that I wrote this and

00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:02,740
the reason that this entire topic

00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,199
started was because we started by

00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:06,940
looking at one customer one of our

00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,050
larger customers and said okay what does

00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:10,560
your experience look like and we

00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:13,810
effectively used that as our initial

00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,849
guinea pig so we didn't have we're not

00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:17,380
trying to solve everything across the

00:07:15,849 --> 00:07:19,090
mayor or everything globally or

00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:21,550
everything across the states it's simply

00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:22,690
what are some of the what are some of

00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:24,970
the issues that we're seeing here some

00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:27,310
of the communication and effectively

00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:29,860
take that experiment and then figure out

00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:31,240
okay what what value are we getting from

00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:32,470
these results what's significant and

00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:35,470
what isn't and then how can we leverage

00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:37,330
those learnings across two teams across

00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:38,530
three teams and of course strategically

00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:39,729
pick which teams make the most sense

00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:42,130
because you you want them to be

00:07:39,729 --> 00:07:43,930
representative but you don't have to

00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:46,570
solve everything all at once and

00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:47,889
starting small is just as valuable you

00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:49,990
just have to make sure that you have

00:07:47,889 --> 00:07:53,169
someone from each area that's going to

00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:55,000
be touched okay and and so in this

00:07:53,169 --> 00:07:56,199
particular example I just want to make

00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
sure the audience is clear about this

00:07:56,199 --> 00:08:01,719
kind of the core problem we were solving

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,060
was improving the way that that you your

00:08:01,719 --> 00:08:06,370
company was interacting amongst

00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:08,590
departments but also with the customer

00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:10,690
into the customer so exactly so that

00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:13,840
that challenge sounds pretty relevant to

00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:16,509
almost everybody in the room right with

00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,039
your technology vendor systems

00:08:16,509 --> 00:08:20,229
integrators in particular that seems

00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:22,719
like the type of thing that they'd run

00:08:20,229 --> 00:08:26,380
into quite a bit absolutely and again I

00:08:22,719 --> 00:08:29,139
think sometimes we just forget that even

00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:30,669
setting expectations of okay Rd what are

00:08:29,139 --> 00:08:33,039
what do we think that we're responsible

00:08:30,669 --> 00:08:34,839
for and support what do you think that

00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:37,000
we're responsible for are those things

00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:38,919
aligned are they the same balanced

00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,599
account team do we understand what role

00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:42,190
you play in making sure that this

00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:44,320
happens and do we all understand how we

00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:46,000
can make each other's lives easier and

00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,670
then do we all understand what that

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,740
looks like for the customer if this one

00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:52,150
piece gets missed what's the impact and

00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,220
then for the customer do they also

00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:55,260
understand

00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:56,730
what's actually happening so that they

00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:58,950
they have an idea or have set

00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:00,720
expectations around why something takes

00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:03,990
the amount of time it does why a

00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,610
solution is chosen over another so it's

00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:06,780
all about creating visibility and then

00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:08,700
also just making sure that people

00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,840
understand what's happening because once

00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,340
people understand what's happening it's

00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,170
a lot easier for them to have empathy

00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:16,280
and a lot easier for them to be more

00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:19,080
patient on every single side absolutely

00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:21,510
so so if you were to try to kind of boil

00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:24,750
this down into the simplest form of

00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:25,170
advice but almost a Zen statement I took

00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,480
notes

00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:29,700
she brought her papers I think that's

00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,710
great we bet those boilers boilers nose

00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:33,330
was a bit of advice like the essence of

00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:34,950
the challenge what would that be I think

00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:37,500
there are four things that I would leave

00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:38,850
people with the first one is um get

00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:42,420
comfortable with being uncomfortable

00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:44,160
yeah when you feel safe to do so so it's

00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:45,960
important to create an environment where

00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,480
people can safely take risks

00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,530
yeah the next one we make sure that

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,720
you're not taking things for granted

00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:53,430
because and again I think sometimes when

00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,110
we're we're in our department or and

00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:57,480
we're in our space we don't think about

00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:59,040
that not only the opportunities and then

00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,750
the great things we have but also the

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,540
effects or the impacts that our actions

00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:04,680
have on other people additionally there

00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,780
is something to be gained from every

00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,220
experience so don't leave learnings on

00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:09,690
the table there

00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:12,420
don't leave learnings on the table it's

00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:13,740
it's a waste of money a waste of time so

00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,090
keep in mind that there's always

00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,440
something to be learned and then the

00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:18,630
last one would be know the difference

00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:20,910
between guidelines and rules I think

00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:22,620
sometimes we set up systems it's similar

00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:25,440
to Conway's law we set up systems to

00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:27,600
help us but we don't we don't keep in

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,800
mind that there's nothing wrong with

00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,570
changing them but you also have to

00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,510
create space to allow for change where

00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:35,520
it makes sense yeah I found when we

00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:37,860
talked earlier I found that to be the

00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:40,110
most important I think all of all of

00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:42,030
that which is yeah in our organizations

00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:44,180
we're not talking about law what we're

00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:46,430
doing is we're talking about a bunch of

00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:48,660
ideas about how we should operate

00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:49,920
absolutely let's look learn you know

00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,420
learn together and actually change that

00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,980
yeah that's great

00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:54,420
well thank you very much for taking the

00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:56,370
time and you know sharing some of your

00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:59,720
thoughts and experience on that so thank

00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:59,720
you Jesus Thanks appreciate it

00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:02,479
