Title: Panel: Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes - Did it Blend?
Publication date: 2018-10-10
Playlist: Cloud Foundry Summit Europe 2018
Description: 
	Panel: Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes - Did it Blend? - Bernd Krannich, SAP SE, Simon Moser, IBM, Jeff Hobbs, SUSE, Chris Crall, Google, Ulrich Homann, Microsoft, Cornelia Davis, Pivotal, & Swarna Podila, Cloud Foundry Foundation

The integration of Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes was one of the major topics during Cloud Foundry Summit Boston. One of the sessions there that created quite some interest was the panel discussion “Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes - Will it blend?” (http://sched.co/DdZr, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ow7IumxkOM). In a sequel to this panel discussion, representatives of major companies in the Cloud Foundry ecosystem will reconvene to assess the status of an integration between Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes, the progress that has been made since CF Summit Boston, and updates to the visions these companies have for a future of Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes.

hello I feel like Britney Spears so I

00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:10,769
put up put up this light back in Boston

00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:17,340
because how many of you here were in

00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:21,689
Boston for this panel only a few of you

00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:23,850
not most of you okay so back in Boston

00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:26,130
we did this panel and this is a sequel

00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:27,660
for the panel first a quick show of

00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:31,700
hands how many of you here are familiar

00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:33,030
with the will it blend series on YouTube

00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:35,340
Wow

00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,250
good good one third of the room so

00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,840
Willard lend is like a crazy I guess

00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:42,870
series where they literally put anything

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,270
in a blender and try to blend there's an

00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:46,890
iPhone edition there's an iPad edition

00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:49,170
there's literally anything any type of

00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:51,530
gadget they put it in a blender and do

00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,820
it so burn came up with this idea of

00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:56,129
let's see if cloud foundry and

00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,109
kubernetes can live up to that kind of

00:00:56,129 --> 00:01:01,800
statement of will it blend so we did it

00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:03,870
back in Boston and quick recap of that

00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,189
Boston panel it we kind of came to the

00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,080
conclusion that after the panel

00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:09,330
discussion that it was more often and a

00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,010
discussion not or discussion like cloud

00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:13,260
foundry and kubernetes not cloud foundry

00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:15,060
or kubernetes and we also talked about

00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:17,189
like Cornelia also mentioned about the

00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,770
kind of where we came from where we are

00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:21,750
today and how do we see this evolution

00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:24,990
look gonna it's gonna look like in the

00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:26,250
in the future and I think Gabe pretty

00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:29,189
much everyone

00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:32,310
Cornelia Jeff Simon we all talked about

00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:34,979
the importance of the experience that

00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:38,009
developer experience why it matters and

00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:40,950
how sometimes it really doesn't matter

00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:42,420
what the backend Orchestrator is as long

00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:43,829
as the developer experience matters

00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,479
there are certain cases where it does

00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:47,189
matter but for most part it's the

00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:49,799
experience that makes a huge difference

00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:51,479
and Meghan back when she was here also

00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:54,630
in Boston panel she talked about how the

00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:56,700
community can benefit from without

00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:58,799
having to learn two tools as two

00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,750
separate entities she was talking about

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,570
how the community can probably benefit a

00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:07,079
whole lot by having both the tools both

00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:09,360
kubernetes and Cloud Foundry having a

00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:11,459
shared goal so today we have a slightly

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,650
different panel where I'm gonna change

00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:15,170
the slide

00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:16,940
I don't have a clicker sorry so we have

00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:19,700
a slightly different panel we have two

00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:24,670
folks that are new to this time so we

00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:29,510
have I'll start from here burned Simon

00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:33,620
Chris Cornelia Ulrich Woolley much

00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:36,560
easier oh wait okay and Jeff so we have

00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:39,260
most of them at the same panel so

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,750
because the panel was burns idea I will

00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:44,269
pick on you first and then I will have

00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:46,640
the rest of the panel uh share their

00:02:44,269 --> 00:02:49,129
thoughts so this whole collaboration and

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,530
our focus on interoperability and

00:02:49,129 --> 00:02:53,930
cross-community collaboration it has

00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:55,849
been it had it only has depend since

00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:58,489
Boston like we have increased the

00:02:55,849 --> 00:03:00,560
efforts as a community and even today

00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:02,269
our announcements of project area Rainey

00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,579
and CF containerization I think there

00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:06,859
are proof points that we are doing that

00:03:04,579 --> 00:03:08,930
and then we also have the project pair

00:03:06,859 --> 00:03:11,420
plea that was also in the keynote and

00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:14,390
then kibosh so all of these things what

00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:17,239
do you think did it blend and if so how

00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:20,239
did it blend was that a good thing or or

00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:23,180
not so yes definitely did blunt and it

00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:26,299
did blend quite rapidly but like even

00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:29,930
back in in in Boston I I did not imagine

00:03:26,299 --> 00:03:32,209
things to kick off that quickly like the

00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:33,919
projects that we have started together

00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:36,590
with with IBM and SUSE delivering

00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:40,129
already first results that quickly but

00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:42,230
but then also like other teams and

00:03:40,129 --> 00:03:44,120
individuals kicking in and kind of

00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:45,859
completing the picture that the pieces

00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,930
that were still missing the pieces where

00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:50,449
we pointed out there needs to be some

00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:52,579
work done in the area of you a a there

00:03:50,449 --> 00:03:55,569
needs to be some work done in the area

00:03:52,579 --> 00:03:59,150
of routing and networking etc etc so

00:03:55,569 --> 00:04:01,370
like if if you look back now half a year

00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:03,889
later you essentially see that the whole

00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:05,900
Cloud Foundry ecosystem started working

00:04:03,889 --> 00:04:08,569
on individual aspects of that whole

00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:12,230
blending and like you already can

00:04:08,569 --> 00:04:14,419
imagine what like next steps will be how

00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:16,370
to combine those so far separate

00:04:14,419 --> 00:04:18,530
projects and what value that that will

00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:21,289
create for the Cloud Foundry community

00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:23,270
so yes it blended very rapidly

00:04:21,289 --> 00:04:24,480
I agree with you the pace was something

00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:30,510
that I did not expect even

00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:31,980
good Cornelia so it's interesting I mean

00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:34,530
one of the first things that I'll say is

00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:36,630
that I don't I don't view Cloud Foundry

00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:39,120
as the application platform

00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:43,170
I view Cloud Foundry as this broader

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,610
platform and for those of you don't know

00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:47,340
me I've been working on Cloud Foundry

00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:50,760
for six years now

00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:54,050
so before pivotal before I was formerly

00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:57,030
part of the product product organization

00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:59,310
but one of the things that I was

00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:02,340
reflecting on recently was the fact that

00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:04,110
when we began Cloud Foundry and I say

00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:06,060
that in the Royal we because I wasn't

00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:08,730
part of VMware but when Cloud Foundry

00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:12,300
began it really began with this

00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:14,370
application abstraction and everything

00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:16,920
else was an implementation detail under

00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:21,540
the covers that's really the way that

00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:23,760
the product started and and so they're

00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:25,560
going back to my comment about I don't

00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:27,990
see Cloud Foundry is only the

00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,820
application abstraction I see that even

00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:31,800
though it started there I see that it

00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:34,230
has this opportunity to be much broader

00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,330
than that and when I think about these

00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:38,880
things blending I think about it from

00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:41,390
that perspective so it's a little bit

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:44,520
different now because we have kubernetes

00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:46,350
gives a set of primitives where rather

00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,150
than starting with an abstraction like

00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:50,280
an application abstraction and making

00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:53,820
everything else in implementation detail

00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:55,800
which so two years ago didn't matter

00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:57,840
that it was Diego because that was just

00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:00,030
an implementation detail what we're

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,370
doing now is were broadening the

00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:06,390
applicability of Cloud Foundry to a

00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:09,360
broader set of workloads not just the

00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:11,280
net new cloud native applications and so

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,050
the way that I view it here is that

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,270
kubernetes first of all container

00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:17,100
orchestration is getting commoditized I

00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:20,220
think that's very clear and so

00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:23,880
kubernetes being one of the options for

00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:26,370
for container orchestration in the in

00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:31,940
the application platform and see if a

00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:34,410
are right did I get the acronym right

00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:36,660
makes all the sense in the world and and

00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:37,230
that was something where I agree that

00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,940
happened

00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:41,460
very very quickly and I think that's

00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:42,840
great there but now if we take

00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:44,910
kubernetes and we say what other

00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:47,730
workloads can we build on top of that

00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:49,860
and what are the patterns we're coming

00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:51,690
at it from a building blocks perspective

00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:54,090
instead of everything's an

00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:57,060
implementation detail and so there I

00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:59,250
think that for me the blending of Cloud

00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:01,350
Foundry is an expansion of Cloud Foundry

00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:03,780
and to maybe different abstractions

00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:07,310
layered over the top of a commodity

00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:12,330
container orchestration that's a great

00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:13,920
movie well Ralph and Cornelia really

00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:15,750
said a lot of good things that I would

00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:18,110
agree with the one thing that I would

00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:20,910
add to it is I think the Cloud Foundry

00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:23,040
community has already how do I say this

00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:24,950
shared with the rest of the orchestrator

00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:28,290
community things like service broker

00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:30,420
architectures and now the community

00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:33,150
service catalog effort is very styled

00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:34,680
after some of the constructs already in

00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:37,260
cloud foundry so from my perspective

00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:39,810
it's not just taking the raw Cloud

00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:42,240
Foundry effort let's say the application

00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:44,760
runtime and making it work on kubernetes

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,940
but also making communities and possibly

00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:49,530
other communities to Cornelius Point

00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:51,180
really benefit from the experiences

00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:54,870
because at the end of the day it's all

00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:57,570
about apps so I agree with that and the

00:07:54,870 --> 00:08:00,480
orchestrator is a very very useful part

00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:03,650
of that and again thinking through how

00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:07,470
these emerging efforts around networking

00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:09,210
native efforts and so forth are going to

00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:11,820
help the applications become more

00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:18,390
interesting I think is the trick to the

00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:19,890
whole conversation I would actually

00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:21,510
agree I mean I would what

00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:23,790
committee has been saying is right I

00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:26,640
think we're on a path so going back to

00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:29,460
your question whether did it blend the

00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:30,660
answer is absolutely yes I did that and

00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:33,540
I would even go further than I would say

00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:36,620
cell it continues to blend right because

00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:39,210
at this point in time we have like

00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:41,220
everybody of the previous speakers just

00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:43,320
just lined out we have some of the

00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:44,520
building blocks in the play in in in

00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,690
place and some of them are coming

00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,280
together really nicely and there are

00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:50,280
some others where there still room to

00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,790
improvement and when we're taking or

00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,910
take

00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:56,220
look at what will happen ask me move on

00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:58,020
forward I would actually even go beyond

00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:00,600
the point of saying it's the question

00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:02,940
about kubernetes and Cloud Foundry only

00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,560
I would even go to the point where what

00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:06,060
we're saying at one point of time and

00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,350
this is maybe a year out which is maybe

00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:09,900
just half a year out I don't know what

00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:12,000
the pace right but it's not only just

00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:14,430
about the applications when you look at

00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,080
cloud native programming models when you

00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:18,170
look at functions when you look at

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,550
applications when you look at containers

00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:23,880
why wouldn't we want to have a platform

00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:25,590
at the end of the day that spans from a

00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,900
programming model perspective that

00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:30,660
entire stack on a common set of

00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:32,190
technologies right and of course for us

00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:34,080
as a cloud foundry community that's

00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:35,790
going to be a challenge to some extent

00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,910
because now we have to watch out and we

00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:40,830
have to you know even work more closely

00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:42,900
together with the communities community

00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:44,850
with the functions people that are out

00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:46,500
there in order to build that unified

00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:48,450
platform and other abilities unified

00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:50,400
building blocks such that we can deliver

00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:52,890
that kind of developer experience

00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:55,890
because what we and what card foundry

00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:59,190
does extra extraordinarily well it's not

00:09:55,890 --> 00:10:00,900
that we created the best scheduler

00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:02,820
container schedule in the world right

00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:05,010
that's not what happened but we're still

00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:06,570
creating the best developer experience

00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:09,030
in the world and that's the thing that

00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:10,530
we have to carry forward and we have to

00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:13,440
make sure that we are laying this out

00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:18,180
across these entire programming model

00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:19,920
paradigms well one of the questions I

00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:23,190
have and kind of following up on your

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:27,180
point is what else goes in the blender

00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:31,620
so maybe I'll be the one to to talk

00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:33,150
about K native sto obviously is already

00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:36,060
in the blender and there have been talks

00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:37,860
today on that K native comes along and

00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:41,760
adds a new programming paradigm and

00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:43,770
cloud functions so it's it's going to be

00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,440
an ongoing question as to how these

00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:48,630
things are going to grow together and

00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:50,670
work together and that's that's one of

00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:52,800
things that fascinates me is is what

00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:54,480
we're going to see come together and I

00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,690
think that goes to the point of Simons

00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,889
it continues to blend yes and the

00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:03,819
expansion of the Cloud Foundry platform

00:10:59,889 --> 00:11:05,350
so Jeff saving you for the last well I

00:11:03,819 --> 00:11:08,739
mean I'd like to echo that I was

00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:11,709
pleasantly surprised how quickly things

00:11:08,739 --> 00:11:15,129
moved with bringing the the teams

00:11:11,709 --> 00:11:16,929
together and the ideas presenting them

00:11:15,129 --> 00:11:20,619
inside the foundation getting them

00:11:16,929 --> 00:11:23,169
incubated and so that initial step those

00:11:20,619 --> 00:11:25,419
initial steps for blending worked really

00:11:23,169 --> 00:11:27,480
well and we're seeing some of the the

00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:31,839
fruits of that labor at this conference

00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:35,559
I liked the CFE you know in terms of

00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:39,029
production one dot o and other efforts

00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:42,069
around that it is about what comes next

00:11:39,029 --> 00:11:46,419
yes and ireenie stick around for Irena

00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:49,119
next it is interesting I think a

00:11:46,419 --> 00:11:51,009
nativist is a great point and I think it

00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:54,819
addresses also some of what Simon was

00:11:51,009 --> 00:11:57,639
mentioning that it was interesting so

00:11:54,819 --> 00:12:01,829
pulling off the services piece of Cloud

00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:04,749
Foundry making that a a multi

00:12:01,829 --> 00:12:06,339
distribution multi-platform effort was

00:12:04,749 --> 00:12:09,069
kind of picking maybe some low-hanging

00:12:06,339 --> 00:12:12,220
fruit and making it easy the effort then

00:12:09,069 --> 00:12:15,819
on our side to become more kubernetes

00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:18,309
native is is important I think Kay

00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:22,209
native we don't know what the K stands

00:12:18,309 --> 00:12:23,499
for is a reaction well the efforts from

00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:25,959
the kubernetes side hey we need to

00:12:23,499 --> 00:12:28,689
actually think more about application

00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:29,860
deployment and those of us that have

00:12:28,689 --> 00:12:31,419
been in Cloud Foundry for a while I

00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:33,939
think we actually have a really good

00:12:31,419 --> 00:12:37,029
solution here now if we could blend

00:12:33,939 --> 00:12:39,459
these two well together in a in a native

00:12:37,029 --> 00:12:41,049
sense so those that are are very

00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:43,480
comfortable hey I need to think of

00:12:41,049 --> 00:12:44,829
kubernetes as my base layer but I still

00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:47,079
need to think of application

00:12:44,829 --> 00:12:50,049
abstractions for the long term lifecycle

00:12:47,079 --> 00:12:52,869
management of applications I think kind

00:12:50,049 --> 00:12:54,639
of the next steps for us or it you know

00:12:52,869 --> 00:12:58,569
proves us to get more into the other

00:12:54,639 --> 00:13:01,059
communities to extol the what we've

00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:02,859
known for many years so that we're not

00:13:01,059 --> 00:13:04,539
all reinventing the wheels all in

00:13:02,859 --> 00:13:08,499
different places that we can all bring

00:13:04,539 --> 00:13:09,759
together and play together so there are

00:13:08,499 --> 00:13:12,070
some key words I've been noting down

00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:15,640
here that each of you mentioned

00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:17,230
that have made me feel better about what

00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:20,350
where we are headed but also kind of

00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:22,990
brought me a little heart heartburn

00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:26,700
so you mentioned about the pace that we

00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:29,470
didn't expect and the expansion

00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:31,330
continuing to blend what else to put in

00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:33,610
the blender and that the initial steps

00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:35,110
of blending were really well so kind of

00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:38,770
taking this to a slightly different

00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:40,360
angle is there something that we as a

00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:43,150
community need to keep in mind as a

00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:45,780
challenges what should we we be aware of

00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:48,820
in when as we go down the path of

00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:51,190
blending or expanding this capabilities

00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:55,320
of the platform and at the pace that we

00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:58,780
are headed to headed headed with

00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:02,770
Courtney Lee I'll start with you yes so

00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:06,850
um I feel your heartburn there a little

00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:08,650
bit because if we just take a look at

00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:12,700
all of those things that are going on

00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:16,510
and you mentioned many of them at the

00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:19,110
beginning I was just sketching out the

00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:22,020
other day a number of pictures of what

00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:25,540
forgive me propellerhead here of what

00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:28,360
what the if you will the architecture

00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:30,340
would end up looking like and if you

00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,890
just look at these different projects

00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:34,840
there is the okay so we've got Cloud

00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:36,670
Foundry layered on top of Bosh layered

00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:39,760
on top of is and we've got different

00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:43,090
CPI's that go there oh and one of those

00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:45,670
CPI's could be kubernetes now then who's

00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:49,750
managing the kubernetes infrastructure

00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:52,300
and then oh yeah that's right Cloud

00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:54,610
Foundry could now either have Diego or

00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:57,370
it could have kubernetes as The

00:14:54,610 --> 00:15:00,130
Container Orchestrator and so on and so

00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:01,180
it became there were literally by the

00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:03,010
time you went through all those

00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:06,160
permutations there were so many

00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:07,840
potential ways that cloud foundry if you

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,930
will the cloud broader Cloud Foundry

00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:13,030
platform could be instantiated and so

00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:15,400
that brings with it a tremendous amount

00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:17,950
of complexity what is the right model

00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:20,920
for that and so I'm a little worried

00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:23,470
about that the other thing that really I

00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,800
think we need to stay very very very

00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:28,220
focused on

00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:30,529
is that before we started blending even

00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:34,630
more in it was relatively

00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:37,670
straightforward for us to break out the

00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:39,709
responsibilities of the people who

00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:42,320
interact with Cloud Foundry into two

00:15:39,709 --> 00:15:44,660
categories it was pretty clear that

00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:47,690
there was a team that was managing the

00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:49,610
platform and a team or multiple teams

00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:53,089
that were using the platform's so the

00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:55,610
app team and the platform team and as I

00:15:53,089 --> 00:15:57,740
see us becoming that see the

00:15:55,610 --> 00:16:00,320
architecture evolving in a potential way

00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:03,980
where it's a little bit of self

00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:06,140
referential I want to make sure that we

00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:09,800
as a community stay focused on the

00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:11,690
personas what are the surface areas what

00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,940
are the api's what are the contracts

00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:16,220
that those various personas use because

00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:19,760
a tremendous amount of the value of

00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:23,959
Cloud Foundry was the ability to create

00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:26,570
separate swim lanes for different parts

00:16:23,959 --> 00:16:31,430
of the organization let's not lose that

00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:33,610
as we start to blend this really well I

00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:36,640
was thinking you know when we talk about

00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:39,589
application down and infrastructure up

00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:41,060
and you made a good point there's a lot

00:16:39,589 --> 00:16:43,070
of experience in the confounder

00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:44,990
community to do things right for the

00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:46,250
application community but the

00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:47,720
communities community or other

00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:49,490
infrastructure communities have also

00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:52,100
learned a lot of things and are bringing

00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:54,560
them together so the blending also has

00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,940
to be not just a technical blending also

00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,500
what are the new things we can do

00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:59,089
against several less is just one of the

00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:01,430
paradigms that we have to incorporate

00:16:59,089 --> 00:17:03,320
but what are the other things at the

00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:06,620
infrastructure layer that would improve

00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:07,910
what cloud foundry can do again we all

00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:10,069
know that cloud foundry is not the

00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:11,660
lightest weight environment whereas

00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:14,120
communities and so forth can run on

00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:16,669
smaller environments and so what can we

00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:19,490
do to effectively combine those also for

00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:21,230
the goodness of cloud foundry to improve

00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:23,390
based upon what communities or other

00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:25,699
orchestrators can bring and that's the

00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:27,470
one thing which I don't hear a lot I

00:17:25,699 --> 00:17:29,960
hear a lot of we want to take cloud

00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:32,240
foundry goodness and put it on top of

00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:34,040
the kubernetes thing and I don't think

00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,690
that's the right attitude I think what

00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:38,470
are the elements which can really help

00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:40,779
us bring bring the optimal

00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:43,029
together and Josh knows I've been

00:17:40,779 --> 00:17:44,889
harassing him for a while saying okay

00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:47,649
what's what's my edge model with Todd

00:17:44,889 --> 00:17:49,480
foundry how do I build edge application

00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:51,370
I don't think I'm gonna build them on

00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:54,399
the current incarnation of Cloud Foundry

00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:56,710
a bit too heavy 50 VMs or whatever it

00:17:54,399 --> 00:17:59,200
takes that's not gonna happen on an edge

00:17:56,710 --> 00:18:02,590
so I think there's opportunities for us

00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:04,419
to work with the communities guys and

00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:07,389
bring application thinking to it

00:18:04,419 --> 00:18:09,100
I like the idea or I like the point you

00:18:07,389 --> 00:18:11,379
make around the separation of concerns

00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:14,019
and making sure we don't lose these

00:18:11,379 --> 00:18:17,200
communities but we also should embrace

00:18:14,019 --> 00:18:18,909
some of the lightness and flexibility

00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:22,570
that our friends from kubernetes are

00:18:18,909 --> 00:18:24,220
bringing on many levels again Kay native

00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:25,870
applications or kubernetes native

00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:29,830
applications do not confuse it with Kay

00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:32,019
native will emerge and are emerging and

00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:33,549
so Cloud Foundry apps and communities

00:18:32,019 --> 00:18:35,139
native apps need to communicate with

00:18:33,549 --> 00:18:36,940
each other and not through a very

00:18:35,139 --> 00:18:39,070
complicated slower level it needs to

00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:40,929
happen naturally for example and so

00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:42,730
there's a bunch of those things where I

00:18:40,929 --> 00:18:44,769
think we need to think through a modular

00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:47,769
approach that allows really people to

00:18:44,769 --> 00:18:49,840
dive into the level they want to and not

00:18:47,769 --> 00:18:51,850
being forced to be yep this is just

00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,500
another Orchestrator which is one model

00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:55,269
we could go down to but I don't think

00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:57,190
that's the right model given where we

00:18:55,269 --> 00:18:58,990
are and if I could pile on very quickly

00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:01,179
there I'd love the fact that you brought

00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:03,100
up the edge because one of the things

00:19:01,179 --> 00:19:04,419
that we talked about Cloud Foundry is we

00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:06,879
spend a lot of time talking about

00:19:04,419 --> 00:19:10,000
developer productivity and the developer

00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:11,740
and the developer some of us even in the

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,629
first round of questions talked about

00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:17,440
the developer other people talked about

00:19:13,629 --> 00:19:19,600
the app and I think that if you take the

00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:22,000
edge case that you just mentioned for

00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:25,120
example there's no need for developer

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,200
productivity tools in the Starbucks

00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,779
location

00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:31,179
there's no developers pushing code into

00:19:28,779 --> 00:19:34,620
the Starbucks location but we do need

00:19:31,179 --> 00:19:37,389
yeah let's hope not but we do need

00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:39,429
orchestration we need resilience we need

00:19:37,389 --> 00:19:40,480
all of those things kind of those opera

00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:42,850
operation

00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:46,690
you know operational things so yeah I

00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:49,330
think that's very important I totally

00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:51,549
agree I mean I to one extent it would be

00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:51,970
the total wrong approach just saying hey

00:19:51,549 --> 00:19:53,530
here

00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:55,660
what we have we're just gonna dump it on

00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:57,640
something else and and I don't think the

00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:59,770
card foundry community is actually doing

00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:01,420
that I mean when you look at just a

00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:04,270
discussion around the go router versus

00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:06,730
SEO the stuff that that I really - was

00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:09,160
changing giggle for kubernetes I think

00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:11,680
it is not like a well liked lift and

00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:13,720
shift kind of architecture or thinking

00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:15,160
that we're doing here on the other hand

00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:16,750
what I really want to point out this is

00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:18,030
going back to what Cornelia has been

00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:20,650
saying

00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:22,540
besides how we are building this stack

00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:24,550
and I totally agree there's a room for

00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:26,050
optimization and room for making this

00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:28,300
more lightweight and move for making

00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:31,540
this more slim and and and more

00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:33,610
effective we have - one of the things

00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:35,920
and I just had I just had this

00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:38,020
experience today a few days back when I

00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:40,690
was trying to to set up a container

00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:42,940
container networking stuff on cloud

00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:45,070
foundry verses on kubernetes and the

00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:47,140
developer experience of course and I was

00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:49,480
kind of like having two hats on when I

00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:51,430
was doing that on the kubernetes heads I

00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:53,890
had to go and I had to you know do a

00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:55,540
bunch of llaman files in order to make

00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:56,860
sure like who which container I could

00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:59,200
talk to what container and do these

00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:00,670
kinds of things it was more like I felt

00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,070
more like a network engineer in the

00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:05,260
traditional operational role then a

00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:06,790
developer then I try to do the same

00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:09,610
thing on cloud foundry in it you know I

00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:13,150
got to the CLI and I was doing a CF

00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:15,780
networking allow a command and it was

00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:20,950
doing the same thing which felt way more

00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:24,550
intuitive but again less control so the

00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:26,530
value in their strengths if I do not

00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:28,690
need that level of control down to the

00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:31,450
latest bits and to the you know whatever

00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:34,060
legacy operational teams firewall

00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:36,340
policies we might want to support on the

00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:38,680
down layer of communities if we're doing

00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:40,330
this stack right we allow progression

00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:44,310
for disclosure and I think that's what

00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:48,400
we have to get I agree with that

00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:52,870
another interesting aspect we are

00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:55,300
getting smaller in terms of the work in

00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:58,720
the blending work is making Cloud

00:21:55,300 --> 00:22:00,670
Foundry able to be lighter weight mixed

00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:04,600
with ireenie it can be you know really

00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:05,330
lightweight and very very native feeling

00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,130
in the Coubertin

00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:10,280
it's experience there's still more work

00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:13,640
to do along with that but it's it's

00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:15,890
getting very close and when we're there

00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:17,420
it is the next steps and and figuring

00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:19,370
out how to blend the communities but

00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:24,320
we've actually seen this already worked

00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:27,680
well in between cloud foundry and and CN

00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:29,990
CF with this tio because that was a a

00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:31,730
give and take when sto and the go router

00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:33,650
teams work together

00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:35,840
there was an influencing on both sides

00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:37,900
of the code bases because there was

00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:40,160
stuff to be learned on both sides and

00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:42,740
that's what I'm hoping is that in next

00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:44,990
steps around the apt available a p--

00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:47,510
developer experienced the application

00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:49,160
management experience will be able to

00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:50,960
share the same way there will be things

00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:54,170
that will probably influence Cloud

00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:57,050
Foundry still but we can also then bring

00:22:54,170 --> 00:23:01,190
two to the kubernetes community more of

00:22:57,050 --> 00:23:04,040
that experience maybe that's like a

00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:06,830
slightly different twist on things so on

00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:08,900
the one hand like as a person working

00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:10,700
with technology I'm obviously excited

00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:13,190
and like all the blending and the speed

00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:15,620
etcetera etcetera but then I think on

00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:17,900
this stage here there's people there are

00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:20,510
also operators of those systems at the

00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:21,890
same time and like also for the

00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:24,740
developers sitting on top of the

00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:27,200
platform one thing is is of utmost

00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:30,470
importance which is keep their business

00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:32,810
going I mean like IBM as well as SAV are

00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:34,730
in that business for quite some time and

00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:36,380
so like with all the blending and

00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:38,630
exchange of Technology components

00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:42,350
happening one important question is how

00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:44,150
to keep developers doing their stuff and

00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:46,190
keep applications up and running all the

00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:48,170
time and I think that is definitely a

00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:49,940
stretch that we will also face because

00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:51,830
yes at some point in time we could say

00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:54,590
hey this kubernetes thing is all cool

00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:56,510
and let's just throw away important

00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:58,460
pieces of what we have today and kind of

00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:59,990
spin up something new but that means

00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:02,960
downtime and this is something that

00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:07,820
business applications won't won't be

00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:10,400
able to to allow so going back to your

00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:13,160
discussion of the architecture I'd love

00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:15,050
to see your diagram someday but one of

00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,520
the things that strikes me we've all

00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:18,700
been around the technology space for a

00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:20,710
long time

00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:23,980
when you have all these pieces that can

00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:26,019
be added together and layered one of the

00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:27,759
things that customers frequently ask is

00:24:26,019 --> 00:24:30,129
okay but tell me the right answer I

00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:32,320
don't want to know that I can twiddle

00:24:30,129 --> 00:24:34,299
this knob and flip that just tell me the

00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:37,509
answer so one of the things we should

00:24:34,299 --> 00:24:39,789
look at is what's what's the blueprint

00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:41,799
or maybe there are multiples maybe for

00:24:39,789 --> 00:24:44,049
an edge it's a simple one and maybe for

00:24:41,799 --> 00:24:45,070
a for a large set of applications it's a

00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:48,690
more complex one

00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:51,639
but again customers want a simple answer

00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:53,259
and the people that do want the knobs

00:24:51,639 --> 00:24:56,139
want the knobs and the other people just

00:24:53,259 --> 00:24:58,509
want to know just just tell me yeah I

00:24:56,139 --> 00:25:00,609
mean we've heard Kelsey and Joe Beda say

00:24:58,509 --> 00:25:02,950
kubernetes is a platform for building

00:25:00,609 --> 00:25:04,690
platforms we don't want to just give

00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:06,789
people a whole bunch of Legos and have

00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:09,100
them build their own platforms that's

00:25:06,789 --> 00:25:12,100
part of our challenge is to figure out C

00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:15,429
C F in the traditional sense the pass is

00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:18,009
one of those platforms functions is

00:25:15,429 --> 00:25:19,899
another one of those platforms and so

00:25:18,009 --> 00:25:21,549
what are those additional ones that

00:25:19,899 --> 00:25:26,019
provide value to the industry and our

00:25:21,549 --> 00:25:27,820
customers in this setting I'm not sure

00:25:26,019 --> 00:25:29,649
in Boston we did questions from the

00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:32,350
audience but I'm not sure here I do have

00:25:29,649 --> 00:25:33,909
one last question before we see if we

00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:36,340
have time left and we can maybe ask

00:25:33,909 --> 00:25:39,429
someone to yell a question out between

00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:41,619
now and our next summit in April in

00:25:39,429 --> 00:25:43,269
Philadelphia where do you see things

00:25:41,619 --> 00:25:47,289
going like where do you see this whole

00:25:43,269 --> 00:25:48,820
progress going and what should the

00:25:47,289 --> 00:25:51,999
community I know we already talked about

00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:55,239
what should we be wary of but where the

00:25:51,999 --> 00:25:58,899
each of you see this headed towards as

00:25:55,239 --> 00:26:00,399
we get closer to Philly yes so

00:25:58,899 --> 00:26:01,960
definitely I think we will see the

00:26:00,399 --> 00:26:04,509
projects that have been kicked off

00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:07,090
evolving and that won't slow down that

00:26:04,509 --> 00:26:09,460
will accelerate I think we will also see

00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:12,669
more of like the impact of things like

00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:15,220
sto and K native we'll have to like the

00:26:12,669 --> 00:26:19,450
overall discussion in in terms of like

00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:21,129
how important will those pieces be for a

00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:22,450
future evolution of Cloud Foundry and I

00:26:21,129 --> 00:26:24,909
think they will definitely be very

00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:27,399
important so I think as as time

00:26:24,909 --> 00:26:29,470
progresses all the people that are

00:26:27,399 --> 00:26:31,330
working in the ecosystem will learn many

00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:31,870
things about those systems that we are

00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:33,880
about to

00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:36,850
and those will be good and that and like

00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:39,279
it's about continuously correcting the

00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:41,710
course as we go so I think we will kind

00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:43,240
of end up at the next summit in a

00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:46,720
slightly different place than we would

00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:48,669
project if we kind of forecast today

00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,850
I like the continuous iteration aspect I

00:26:48,669 --> 00:26:54,299
think that's extremely important as we

00:26:50,850 --> 00:27:00,010
figure things out as we go

00:26:54,299 --> 00:27:02,110
also as we head to the next summit not

00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:05,890
just where we are headed but also where

00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:09,100
should we be headed from a technology or

00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:11,549
community perspective or both or both so

00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:14,020
I mean from a technology perspective I

00:27:11,549 --> 00:27:15,760
burned probably covered it at least from

00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:18,309
my point I mean we have we're having

00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:20,470
we're bolting this the rebuilding the

00:27:18,309 --> 00:27:22,270
the platform together and we're now

00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:24,279
about to tighten the screws wherever

00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:26,200
that's needed such it becomes something

00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:28,450
stable at the end of the day I think

00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:30,490
we're what we need to pay attention to

00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:34,149
as we go forward in the upcoming months

00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:38,110
is really from a community perspective

00:27:34,149 --> 00:27:40,960
to make sure that we are I mean not

00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:43,390
saying we're not open but we have to be

00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:46,179
even more open to to watch other

00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:48,460
communities engage in them collaborate

00:27:46,179 --> 00:27:50,710
with them and make sure that we are

00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:52,899
we're also getting a blending not only

00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:54,549
on the technology side like hey there's

00:27:52,899 --> 00:27:56,230
this great technology that community a

00:27:54,549 --> 00:27:59,409
build let's pick this up and put this

00:27:56,230 --> 00:28:02,159
into our platform somehow but make you

00:27:59,409 --> 00:28:06,130
know the community level engagement

00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:08,020
really pay focus to that I think that's

00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:10,960
that's one of the things where I would

00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:13,059
think between now and next April where

00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:15,039
had the focus has to be that's a very

00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:17,409
that's a very important point I think

00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:19,510
it's not the technology it's not just

00:28:17,409 --> 00:28:22,390
the technology the people aspect as well

00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:24,309
that have to be more transparent about

00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:25,600
the initiatives that are within the

00:28:24,309 --> 00:28:29,770
community and across the communities

00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:32,710
Chris actually I was just echo the the

00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:34,960
things that these two gentlemen put out

00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:38,559
the first is on the technology side both

00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:41,080
Kay native and Sto and specifically on

00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:43,270
Sto we're seeing real deployments now

00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:45,730
customers playing with those and seeing

00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:50,020
how they operate Kay native is

00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:51,460
Neuer but then just again looking at

00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:53,140
what the customers are doing how they're

00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:56,130
using these projects that are coming out

00:28:53,140 --> 00:29:01,030
and gaining that knowledge and let it

00:28:56,130 --> 00:29:03,910
help us decide where to go I think that

00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:06,250
one of the things that I will become

00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:09,750
very important to add to the blender

00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:15,160
that is being added to the blender is

00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:18,910
the ISV ecosystem so in the past it has

00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:22,000
been all about providing services to the

00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:24,520
paths user so you know the the service

00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,440
brokers and being able to say oh I'm

00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:29,140
building an app new application and I

00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:32,230
need a database or I need a a message

00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:34,360
queue what's happening now is with

00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:36,970
kubernetes being a platform that is

00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:39,400
going to host many other workloads it

00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:42,760
brings kind of a different angle to that

00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:46,950
marketplace I think more and more ifv's

00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:50,260
are going to start to run their

00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:52,750
applications on top of the platform I

00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:57,120
would like it to be the expanded Cloud

00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:59,140
Foundry platform what does that mean and

00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:03,220
what are the patterns that we're gonna

00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:04,720
are gonna emerge from that yeah I want

00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:07,360
actually pick up something that you said

00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,920
I think it would be really useful to

00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,900
think through what the developer

00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:12,700
experience of the blender is and what

00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:15,070
the operator experience of the blender

00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:17,170
is at these various levels that Simon

00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:19,300
kind of pointed out people will need

00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:21,280
knobs for certain scenarios but you want

00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:23,830
to hide them from the developer so how

00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:25,750
does that really work what can we do to

00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:28,300
preserve some of the elegance that Cloud

00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:31,030
Foundry has brought but still bring the

00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:32,980
power of the kubernetes interface or

00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:35,530
environment into the system and make

00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:37,000
that blend as well while keeping it

00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:39,910
separate which is going to be a

00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:43,420
fascinating little thing but I think

00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:45,640
that's an important one I mean just

00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:47,620
agree with a lot of what was said but

00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:50,260
thinking concretely just six months from

00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:51,640
now it would be nice to see there's a

00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:54,610
lot of stuff that we've seen today

00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:56,770
people with real depth of knowledge are

00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:59,160
able to stand up and create production

00:30:56,770 --> 00:31:01,890
workloads with this

00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:06,390
in six months I'd love to be able to say

00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:08,549
a hobbyist or or you know innovative

00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:10,890
thinker in a large org that only has a

00:31:08,549 --> 00:31:13,380
little bit of resources can set up their

00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:16,049
own production confidently set it up

00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:18,179
with just a few lines and be be

00:31:16,049 --> 00:31:20,460
comfortable that what they have they can

00:31:18,179 --> 00:31:22,890
then advocate it within their

00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:28,200
organization I think is a concrete next

00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:31,380
up I'd like to reach okay the timer is

00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:33,000
flashing that we're out so I'm pretty

00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:34,110
sure all the panels will be around at

00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,520
least for a little bit after the

00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:36,990
sessions if you have any question or

00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:39,360
follow-on thoughts please feel free to

00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:41,549
walk up to them and ask them thank you

00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,510
very much for joining us and thank you

00:31:41,549 --> 00:31:43,840
very much for joining
