Description: 
	Keynote: Internet of Things (IoT) as the Driving Force to Help Stop Climate Change â€“ Philipp Lindner, CIO, Kaiserwetter Energy Asset Management

Kaiserwetter, a company headquartered in Hamburg with further offices in Madrid and New York is using the IoT approach to become the leading Data as a Service provider in the renewables energy space, globally. The aim is to proactively set a mark to achieve the Paris climate goals. This is done by providing capital investors and financing banks with the required information and transparency on their renewable asset portfolios to minimize investment risks and maximize returns, while gaining trust catalyzing investment into that asset segment.

The unique IoT platform Kaiserwetter has put in place is called ARISTOTELES. It is running on Cloud Foundry, leveraging apps and data transformation services to build a high performing Data as a Service platform.

Together with their technology partner SAP, Kaiserwetter has defined a specific IoT architecture for ARISTOTELES, which is scalable and can be run on multi-clouds or private clouds. It has become a truly 5 continents, one solution architecture.

[Music]

00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:06,879
[Applause]

00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:15,170
[Music]

00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:18,640
good morning everybody this is really a

00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:22,160
great audience really excited to be here

00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:25,760
thank you for giving you the chance now

00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:29,360
this week Monday morning probably many

00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:32,900
of us woke up with news popping out of

00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:35,000
the radio headlining that the leading

00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:38,420
climate experts from all over the world

00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,820
were raising their hands and showing

00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:44,360
their fears and how we lag behind in

00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:47,690
taking actions to prevent global warming

00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:51,530
and all the bad things then come along

00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:53,629
with it now so this is great timing for

00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:56,949
me now to talk to you about our business

00:00:53,629 --> 00:01:04,150
case how we use the Internet of Things

00:00:56,949 --> 00:01:07,030
to help stop climate change now are we

00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:09,970
we as Kaiser Vetta our Germany based

00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:14,510
company headquartered in Hamburg and

00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:16,640
we've built analytic hubs all over the

00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:19,009
world or actually started to building

00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:23,000
them up to be closer to our clients and

00:01:19,009 --> 00:01:25,939
closer to our markets originally we're

00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,689
coming from the renewables energy space

00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:33,590
and with credit quite good track record

00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:36,469
on solar farms and wind farms as you can

00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:38,930
see in several winning awards that we

00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:42,950
proudly received on the bottom line of a

00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:47,000
slide however we started to transform

00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:50,079
our complete business model to becoming

00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,909
a fully digitalized company and

00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:55,939
providing a data as a service solution

00:01:52,909 --> 00:01:58,189
and for that solution we this year

00:01:55,939 --> 00:02:00,710
probably received the ACP Innovation

00:01:58,189 --> 00:02:04,850
Award which was handed over to our CEO

00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:12,610
Hanna college this year in Orlando and

00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:17,510
the ACP conference so what is driving us

00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:20,420
now renewable energy and trying to bring

00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:23,060
our share in to how we can stop climate

00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:24,349
change is kind of the DNA of Kaiser

00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:26,689
wetter

00:02:24,349 --> 00:02:29,269
we strongly believe that only a shift

00:02:26,689 --> 00:02:31,879
from the classical energy sector to the

00:02:29,269 --> 00:02:34,519
renewable energy sector can really bring

00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:38,209
a change and can really help us stop

00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:39,829
global warming and this thought is also

00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:41,780
of course other lines by many

00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:45,159
international studies from experts all

00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:51,319
over the world so the question now is

00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:53,569
how do we make this shift happening so

00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:55,909
obviously now looking at the numbers

00:02:53,569 --> 00:02:58,099
behind it you can see that for the

00:02:55,909 --> 00:03:02,629
upcoming years there's a huge amount of

00:02:58,099 --> 00:03:05,359
money needed to be placed on the energy

00:03:02,629 --> 00:03:09,109
space in order to invest into renewable

00:03:05,359 --> 00:03:12,459
energy sector so basically build up wind

00:03:09,109 --> 00:03:19,609
power build up solar power hydropower

00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:22,579
biomass etc so obviously investors all

00:03:19,609 --> 00:03:24,819
over the world are some of them already

00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:27,500
heavily invested into this asset class

00:03:24,819 --> 00:03:29,120
and others are maybe at the starting

00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,729
line and trying to understand what's the

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,769
potential of this asset class and maybe

00:03:31,729 --> 00:03:36,440
shifting their portfolios a little bit

00:03:33,769 --> 00:03:40,430
more into that new asset class of

00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:44,930
renewable energies so this is where we

00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:47,799
as has a better come into play we have

00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:51,620
built a platform called Aris Totalus

00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:53,840
which should provide the investor the

00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:56,180
answers to the three main questions

00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,690
every investor regardless of the asset

00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:03,979
type basically has which is how do I

00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:06,139
minimize the risk of my investment how

00:04:03,979 --> 00:04:08,629
can I make sure that I maximize my

00:04:06,139 --> 00:04:10,879
returns and at the end of the day how

00:04:08,629 --> 00:04:14,239
can I get the most possible transparency

00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:21,769
into the performance of my asset I'm

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:24,860
investing in so how does this work so

00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:26,409
when you think of an investor how does

00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:29,900
it look like so they have a portfolio

00:04:26,409 --> 00:04:31,699
maybe a wind farm up in the northern

00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:34,729
part of Europe somewhere in Denmark

00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:36,590
maybe onshore or even offshore they

00:04:34,729 --> 00:04:37,820
maybe also have invested into solar

00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:42,320
parks in the

00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:43,640
south in Spain or in Africa and maybe

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:49,640
they also have a hydro park somewhere

00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:51,890
around in the Alps so now how does well

00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:55,670
our model kick in so what we're doing is

00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:57,740
we retrieve the data directly from the

00:04:55,670 --> 00:05:01,100
parks with a machine-to-machine

00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:03,470
connectivity now it is important for us

00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:06,530
that we're not able to install any kind

00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:09,050
of device in the park we are not able to

00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:11,960
fly around the world or fly around from

00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:14,720
one spot on the other and implement some

00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:18,230
kind of devices on an offshore windfarm

00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:21,440
for instance so we have to have a direct

00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:23,480
connectivity to retrieve power

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,480
information data so how much power has a

00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:29,860
farm being created plus lots of tons of

00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:33,440
really machine information like

00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:36,560
temperature information from from the

00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:39,620
windmill or blade angle information etc

00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:42,290
etc so it's a real-time information that

00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:44,660
we're taking we then also adding

00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:46,880
third-party data so right now we are

00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:49,310
having added weather forecast

00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,500
information which is really crucial from

00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:53,960
a strategic perspective so we're showing

00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:56,390
our investors what is your farm going to

00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,730
use the next day the next three days in

00:05:56,390 --> 00:06:00,890
the next seven days

00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:03,500
this is for one they have to give this

00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:06,320
information to the electricity grid so

00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:08,630
the grid knows what to expect from the

00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,860
elected from the energy farms and at the

00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:12,680
other hand of course it's the strategic

00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:14,600
question so maybe if I know that the

00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,460
wind speeds are going to be perfect in

00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,560
the next seven months next seven days

00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:21,980
sorry I might not want to do any

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:24,950
maintenance work in that time so it

00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:26,020
becomes an important information and we

00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:28,940
are working here with third-party

00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:33,410
companies and you have to imagine we

00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:37,220
have a precise position of 95% accuracy

00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:40,460
of the next day's performance of a wind

00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:42,200
farm and this is pretty good and then we

00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:43,400
also include we talked about investors

00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,500
we talk about money we talk about

00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:48,650
capital this is why we include financial

00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:51,110
data so we're including information from

00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:54,470
the owners financial systems here

00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:57,500
P systems etc and all of that good

00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:59,720
information is placed on the SAP cloud

00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:02,150
platform which is running on Cloud

00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,620
Foundry so we're using there the

00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:06,740
internet-of-things enablement platform

00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:08,930
and in our architecture when handling

00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:11,120
that with the SAP HANA base where we do

00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:12,800
all kinds of smart analytics do

00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:17,300
predictive modeling and simulations

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:21,700
there to calculate really interesting

00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:24,860
KPIs and at the end of the day the user

00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:30,800
access his data through a web interface

00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:33,590
which we call our RS Totalus platform so

00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:36,650
our total is as such is an executive

00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:39,860
dashboard where we combine technical

00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:43,760
data and financial data into specific

00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:47,660
kpi's to be able to answer the before

00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:50,270
scene three major questions and this is

00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:53,300
something very unique what we're doing

00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:58,250
here and it is in real-time and this is

00:07:53,300 --> 00:08:02,570
also very important now from a technical

00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:05,540
perspective we've chosen ICP is our

00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:08,600
technology partner to create this whole

00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:10,400
architecture and we're proud to say that

00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:14,440
we have a global partnership with sa P

00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:18,380
ongoing our journey and with ACP of

00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:20,770
course we landed on Cloud Foundry and we

00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:23,180
learned to love the Cloud Foundry and

00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:26,360
all the great things happening in there

00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:29,060
so also the decision going into the

00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:31,040
cloud as such was not only that we

00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:33,380
wanted to leverage for instance the

00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:35,390
scalability of cloud but we also wanted

00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:38,120
to make sure that looking forward we

00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:40,670
also can bring our stack as a business

00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:45,230
case to how cloud can really really work

00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:48,860
well now for us it is important that we

00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:50,930
have one clear model that we build on

00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:53,120
our architecture but we need to spread

00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:55,280
this around the globe and now giving all

00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,800
the data security issues and boundaries

00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:00,260
that we see from Asia and America and

00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:03,680
Europe it's clear that we need to think

00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:05,030
about multi cloud solution and also in

00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,400
some instances more

00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:09,530
private cloud solutions so this is why

00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:11,870
all this deployment through cloud

00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:13,940
foundry is really really helping us and

00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:16,670
last but not least it's the community

00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:18,560
but really really leveraging so we need

00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:20,660
to think ahead and think of what's

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,040
what's next we're talking about machine

00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:24,260
learning topics we're talking about

00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:26,150
artificial intelligence obviously of

00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:29,260
course in the energy sector blockchain

00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:31,850
is going to be a topic that's coming up

00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:35,600
so there's many more to come on our

00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:38,630
roadmap on how we further build iris

00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,310
Totalus and of course also lots of more

00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:44,270
third-party data that we want to bring

00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:48,260
in so at the end of the day what we're

00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:51,740
trying to achieve ask as a beta is to

00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:57,590
build an umbrella for investors on their

00:09:51,740 --> 00:10:00,350
portfolios but also for countries we've

00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:04,190
talked about this with the emerging

00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:05,630
banks for Africa America and Asia we

00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:08,690
talked with the World Bank about this

00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:13,550
topic to have a tool set on information
