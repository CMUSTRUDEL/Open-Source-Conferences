	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:07,109
so for our final talk today saving the

00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:10,110
best for last a couple of weeks ago

that they were opening up and launching

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:21,750
Sue's a cloud foundry our newest

00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:27,240
distribution of cloud foundry yes it's

00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:28,980
very exciting so we're going to have

00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,890
Michael Miller the president and

00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,809
strategy alliances and marketing join us

00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:36,149

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,950
lively discussion

00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:47,310
[Music]

00:00:57,219 --> 00:01:01,969
I'm gonna give Thomas the credit for

00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:03,710
that song choice little pincher I've

00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:07,700
never heard anybody like that music a

00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:09,500
bit of an 80s theme going on yeah eat

00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,990
some younger people on stage for home

00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:15,170
eat yeah

00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:17,560
play some Kanye the kids listen to you

00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:17,560
these days

00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:25,160
when I think of Sousa I think of a Linux

00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:26,000
distribution when I install it maybe in

00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:32,119
the 90s

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,289
personally what why are you here so we

00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:35,929
told you this would be a lively

00:01:33,289 --> 00:01:37,399
conversation right so and I'm glad you

00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:39,979
were using Susan than I needs I'm glad

00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:41,869
to hear that so you know at Sousa we

00:01:39,979 --> 00:01:45,319
just celebrated our 25th year

00:01:41,869 --> 00:01:48,890
anniversary just last month actually at

00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:50,509
Sousa Kahn and 25 years is a long time

00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:53,390
you know and back then that was the

00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:55,759
early days of of Linux the early days of

00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:58,580
open source and obviously we started out

00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,410
as a Linux distribution with a focus on

00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:02,720
the enterprise and mission-critical use

00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:05,450
cases but over that 25 year period

00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:07,940
enormous amount has changed in the IT

00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:10,390
industry and open source has really

00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:13,310
become the de-facto

00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:15,890
model for innovation in infrastructure

00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:17,480
software and so as that's happened and

00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:20,180
all of these new software-defined

00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:22,310
technologies have emerged it was really

00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:24,709
a logical thing for Sousa to do to build

00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:27,319
on our Linux roots and then start to

00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:28,849
expand our portfolio and really we think

00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:31,489
of ourselves now not as a Linux

00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:33,099
distribution vendor but as a provider of

00:02:31,489 --> 00:02:36,200
software to find infrastructure and

00:02:33,099 --> 00:02:38,050
application delivery technologies across

00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,280
a whole spectrum of software-defined

00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:42,560
technologies with this announcement of

00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,569
souza cloud application platform our

00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,239
Cloud Foundry distribution just being

00:02:44,569 --> 00:02:49,190
the very latest yeah and we'll develop

00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:50,450
those ourselves as well so we understand

00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:53,390
the challenges that our customers are

00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:55,760
facing with developments and we're also

00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:57,709
here because it's not foundry so we

00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:01,299
checked all the open source solutions

00:02:57,709 --> 00:03:04,519
and by far platform is the most mature

00:03:01,299 --> 00:03:06,439
solution better quality of code

00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:07,849
the best community for providing such

00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:10,310
kind of solutions to develop our so it

00:03:07,849 --> 00:03:12,799
was I mean it no brainer to drain Cloud

00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:14,239
Foundry and we actually did that even

00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:15,620
before having a product so we were

00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,140
involved in the community with the bird

00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:20,329
CPI interfaces a couple of years ago

00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:23,060
yeah and now we are very happy to be

00:03:20,329 --> 00:03:26,000
part of the community other products and

00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:28,700
contributes to different projects we're

00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,220
excited to have you here thank you now

00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:33,409
to get to that point though you acquired

00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:36,709
a lot of the technology and talent as

00:03:33,409 --> 00:03:39,010
well I think from HPE how how did that

00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:41,810
come together as a as an acquisition

00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:43,069
kind of yeah than my acquisition so

00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:45,650
that's a that's a question that that

00:03:43,069 --> 00:03:47,139
I've gotten a lot and so we many of you

00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:51,560
probably know we announced in March

00:03:47,139 --> 00:03:54,500
Sousa acquired OpenStack and cloud app

00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:57,859
and Cloud Foundry technology and talent

00:03:54,500 --> 00:04:00,439
from HPE so we saw that as a great

00:03:57,859 --> 00:04:03,379
opportunity to bring great technology

00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:05,359
and great people into Sousa and helped

00:04:03,379 --> 00:04:07,370
accelerate our existing plans and

00:04:05,359 --> 00:04:08,930
roadmaps so obviously we've been in the

00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:11,989
OpenStack business already for many

00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:13,730
years from the beginning and we were on

00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:16,070
our way towards developing a Cloud

00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:18,260
Foundry distribution and this was an

00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:20,510
ideal way for us to accelerate that

00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:22,699
whole process and some of those folks

00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:25,099
are here and the technology is here and

00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:28,699
we're really excited to have been able

00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:30,590
to enter this market faster and bring a

00:04:28,699 --> 00:04:32,599
certified Cloud Foundry distribution to

00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:33,800
market quicker and in Thomas can

00:04:32,599 --> 00:04:35,840
probably comment a little bit more about

00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,849
some of the uniqueness of the technology

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,760
and what that enables our customers to

00:04:37,849 --> 00:04:42,470
do and it's unique in certain ways and

00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:44,690
we want to bring that to the community

00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:46,909
as well so for instance we are

00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:48,349
delivering Cloud Foundry as containers

00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:52,760
so we are container izing Cloud Foundry

00:04:48,349 --> 00:04:55,159
core and services we also have a UI for

00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:57,169
Cloud Foundry that is that is open

00:04:55,159 --> 00:05:00,889
source and we are submitting that to the

00:04:57,169 --> 00:05:03,110
CF incubation projects and that's the

00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:05,840
way we do we do development we develop

00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:08,150
upstream and and we work with all the

00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,289
community members and then we support

00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:12,039
our customers we've been doing that for

00:05:09,289 --> 00:05:14,510
25 years we'll do that for Cloud Foundry

00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:16,370
together with kubernetes a lot were also

00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:17,689
very involved in given this and one

00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:20,389
thing I wanted to mention so we're

00:05:17,689 --> 00:05:22,909
Switzerland's if you talk circulates you

00:05:20,389 --> 00:05:24,049
have to say swiss chocolates so it's not

00:05:22,909 --> 00:05:28,839
only peanut butter and chocolate

00:05:24,049 --> 00:05:28,839
together it's peanut butter and Swiss

00:05:30,249 --> 00:05:34,339
the whole chocolate thing didn't make

00:05:32,539 --> 00:05:39,289
sense to me because it's jelly but

00:05:34,339 --> 00:05:41,719
that's a whole thing taking one step

00:05:39,289 --> 00:05:43,669
back though HPE wasn't really able to

00:05:41,719 --> 00:05:44,959
make it well they sold it so that they

00:05:43,669 --> 00:05:48,759
weren't really able to make a business

00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:52,849
out of their Cloud Foundry distribution

00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:54,289
why do you think you can so you know I'm

00:05:52,849 --> 00:05:57,139
not gonna and I'm not going to comment

00:05:54,289 --> 00:05:59,329
on clock founder or on HP EES business

00:05:57,139 --> 00:06:02,209
or or what the decisions they've made

00:05:59,329 --> 00:06:03,169
but I can speak for for Sousa and you

00:06:02,209 --> 00:06:04,909
know we're a fundamentally different

00:06:03,169 --> 00:06:07,129
type of company as Thomas just noted

00:06:04,909 --> 00:06:10,189
we're we are an open source business and

00:06:07,129 --> 00:06:12,679
we have been for 25 years and building

00:06:10,189 --> 00:06:15,409
on those Linux roots our understanding

00:06:12,679 --> 00:06:18,649
of how to work upstream productized open

00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:19,789
source innovation for the enterprise and

00:06:18,649 --> 00:06:22,759
bring it to market is completely

00:06:19,789 --> 00:06:24,409
different yeah then then say a well

00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:25,669
established hardware vendor adding

00:06:24,409 --> 00:06:28,249
something like that to their portfolio

00:06:25,669 --> 00:06:30,679
and now what we're going to do with that

00:06:28,249 --> 00:06:32,869
is we're gonna integrate that across our

00:06:30,679 --> 00:06:35,629
other portfolio offerings but at the

00:06:32,869 --> 00:06:37,249
same time we're gonna leave we're gonna

00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:39,349
leave our partners and customers with

00:06:37,249 --> 00:06:41,539
the openness and the freedom of choice

00:06:39,349 --> 00:06:43,639
at all levels in the architecture to mix

00:06:41,539 --> 00:06:45,379
and match our technologies to create

00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:46,879
best-of-breed solutions so that's

00:06:45,379 --> 00:06:49,069
another unique approach that we take

00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:51,199
with whatever we bring to market does

00:06:49,069 --> 00:06:53,329
that create some degree of confusion

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:57,110
though for your customers if you have

00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:59,929
that many solutions for them it creates

00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:01,129
a choice so that they can and sometimes

00:06:59,929 --> 00:07:03,709
I'm feelin so you have to come with it

00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:06,050
with a default stack that can meet their

00:07:03,709 --> 00:07:07,610
needs but their most of the time they

00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:09,319
have existing pieces so they might have

00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:10,729
a container infrastructure already there

00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:13,039
they might have a VMware infrastructure

00:07:10,729 --> 00:07:14,809
they might have hybrid cloud workloads

00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:17,419
so they have something and they need to

00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:18,979
accommodate that and and Cloud Foundry

00:07:17,419 --> 00:07:21,169
is providing that flexibility actually

00:07:18,979 --> 00:07:22,819
to do so we've been doing that at many

00:07:21,169 --> 00:07:25,729
layers of the stack from OpenStack to

00:07:22,819 --> 00:07:27,619
Linux and including with non susers

00:07:25,729 --> 00:07:30,439
solutions actually we're partnering with

00:07:27,619 --> 00:07:33,409
without competitors alerts and it's

00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:36,259
because the the IT world is diverse de

00:07:33,409 --> 00:07:38,689
facto there and nobody is starting from

00:07:36,259 --> 00:07:49,039
scratch or most maybe in San Francisco

00:07:38,689 --> 00:07:52,189
but not in your starter Abbey from your

00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:54,409
perspective with what this user bring to

00:07:52,189 --> 00:07:57,679
the Cloud Foundry Foundation they bring

00:07:54,409 --> 00:07:58,819
a lot so they are our first Linux

00:07:57,679 --> 00:08:01,819
distribution that's part of the

00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:03,979
community and now a core contributor so

00:08:01,819 --> 00:08:06,110
it brings a wealth of knowledge around

00:08:03,979 --> 00:08:09,829
Linux Linux kernels that I'm really

00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:11,449
excited about they're also the only the

00:08:09,829 --> 00:08:13,819
second software distribution of Cloud

00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:15,589
Foundry so that's really exciting as we

00:08:13,819 --> 00:08:16,300
think about choice and flexibility and

00:08:15,589 --> 00:08:18,829
portability

00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:21,079
that's to say can bring to the table and

00:08:18,829 --> 00:08:22,579
then finally one thing that was really

00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:24,769
struck me as I got the chance to go to

00:08:22,579 --> 00:08:26,839
Sue's Akon and Prague a couple of weeks

00:08:24,769 --> 00:08:29,389
ago so thank you for the invite Michael

00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:32,240
thanks for being there one thing that

00:08:29,389 --> 00:08:34,219
really struck me is i sat at lunchtime

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,810
and got a chance to talk to the

00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:38,990
participants and a lot of your customers

00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:42,560
is how much your customers love suza

00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:44,870
they just love everything about Sue's

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:48,500
day and I feel like we love them too

00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:50,180
yeah we do yeah they love you and if you

00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,470
can have that in your own community and

00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:53,329
that's something you can bring to the

00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:55,790
Cloud Foundry community I feel like our

00:08:53,329 --> 00:08:56,930
community can only benefit you know for

00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:59,089
me I think about it how do we make the

00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:01,610
community bigger but also more inclusive

00:08:59,089 --> 00:09:02,810
more open and more welcoming to everyone

00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:04,759
and I feel like that's something that

00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:06,829
Susan can bring to our community as well

00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:09,319
are you saying there's not enough love

00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:11,029
in the Cloud Foundry there's love we

00:09:09,319 --> 00:09:12,709
could use more yeah you can never have

00:09:11,029 --> 00:09:13,819
too much less than two months or

00:09:12,709 --> 00:09:15,319
chocolate yeah it's kind of like

00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:17,689
chocolate that Swiss chocolate is

00:09:15,319 --> 00:09:20,949
chocolate and peanut butter it's yeah

00:09:17,689 --> 00:09:20,949
can never have too much of either

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:28,590
where do you go from there you were

00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:32,280
talking about the customers in the love

00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:34,860
if you cut but comparing your customers

00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:36,690
to the to the Cloud Foundry community

00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:38,610
right now do you feel like you're gonna

00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:40,890
bring in new customers that the Cloud

00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:43,380
Foundry community does not see at this

00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:45,150
point or where do you see yourself there

00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:46,860
well I think it's gonna be it's going to

00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:48,780
be both so we have a lot of our

00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,980
well-established customers you know

00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:52,650
there that have been using Sousa

00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:55,650
technology for years are very interested

00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:58,380
in making cloud application platform

00:09:55,650 --> 00:10:00,300
part of their digital transformation so

00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:02,160
they're entering a new a new era and I

00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:04,530
know we all over use that term digital

00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,480
transformation but the reality is most

00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:08,910
of our enterprise customers have a

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,880
mission or a vision of where they want

00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:14,220
to go and and you know application

00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,540
development both cloud native and

00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:17,760
bringing their their existing

00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:20,220
applications forward it's part of that

00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,780
vision and maybe we'll bring some people

00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:23,070
starting from the infrastructure because

00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:25,860
we have a lot of customers doing that

00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:29,250
from for storage or networking our

00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:30,990
clouds and not only coming from the

00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:32,820
application directly but they want to go

00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:35,220
there and so we might bring that aspect

00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:38,520
as well to learn from the community and

00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:40,800
and I think our our vision bringing

00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:42,110
together in a complementary way as we've

00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,310
been talking about all morning

00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:46,050
Technologies like kubernetes and Cloud

00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,730
Foundry bringing those things together

00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:49,800
in a way that makes sense in the real

00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:52,560
world for customers that are trying to

00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:54,180
get stuff done that's really appreciated

00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,730
by by our customers they want a

00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:59,070
practical usable solution not a

00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:01,170
religious debate about either or

00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:02,490
mutually exclusive approaches to

00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:04,530
technologies they want to see these

00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:07,620
technologies integrated in a useful

00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:09,930
practical way make sense in a way like

00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:10,500
chocolate and peanut but does need

00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:14,340
together

00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:18,210
all right Shockley Swiss chocolate Swiss

00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:20,490
chocolate all right our time is tough

00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:23,040
thank you thank you and I want to thank

00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:26,010

discussion and we're really excited to

00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:34,050
have SUSE Cloud Foundry now part of our

00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,320
Cloud Foundry offerings thank you thanks

00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:41,190
