thank you thank you thank you for making

00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:09,080
a trip out here happy to it's always fun

00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:11,490
to be on stage and talk to end users

00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,740
well we have a lot of exciting

00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:17,010
announcements today with kubernetes and

00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:18,300
Cloud Foundry we thought it would be a

00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,920
good opportunity to have someone that's

00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,810
been part of the kubernetes open source

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,430
community since the beginning is a

00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:25,350
leader in the kubernetes open source

00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:27,900
community and there's an a tremendous

00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,130
amount to make it what it is today you

00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:32,460
know talk a little bit about the open

00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:36,570
the community and the progress I'm happy

00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:39,030
to sow kubernetes began with as a

00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:41,940
partnership with Google and redhead and

00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:45,270
Samsung and core OS and a number of

00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:47,280
other companies who all wanted to take

00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:49,739
the vision of container management that

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,770
Google had internally and make it open

00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:54,860
source make it possible for everyone and

00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:58,079
this was announced in summer of 2015

00:00:54,860 --> 00:01:00,899
with an intent that it was going to be a

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,379
community governed project but any

00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:05,610
project that begins with a heavy

00:01:03,379 --> 00:01:08,460
contribution based from a single company

00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:10,950
has some challenges moving to be

00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,900
completely community led and so we've

00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:15,960
spent the last two years working very

00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:19,049
hard to distribute our decision-making

00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:23,400
down to the developers who are building

00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:26,460
the specific components of kubernetes as

00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:29,460
well as building a cross community

00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:31,680
governance system which just got elected

00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:35,070
last Thursday which is super exciting

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,380
and will begin the the hard work of

00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:41,070
making a broader governance structure

00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:43,170
for the project but a lot of this work

00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:46,950
happens from the grassroots like Kubo I

00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:48,990
found out about this now the container

00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:52,320
runtime system the Cloud Foundry

00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:54,899
container runtime I found out about this

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,280
as a happenstance sort of thing even

00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:59,340
though the work was being done inside

00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,619
Google it was a fair fair way underway

00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,909
before I had heard about it because so

00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:05,640
much of this work comes up from the

00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:07,799
grassroots and it's amazing how it's

00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,690
driven by both people in the community

00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:11,360
as well as the users the end-users are

00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:14,010
driving a lot of this innovation

00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:17,250
there's a lot of momentum in the

00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:18,300
kubernetes open source community how

00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:23,060
many of you have heard of kubernetes

00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:27,570
before here nobody right yeah exactly

00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:29,610
it's a it's all the rage now all the

00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:32,190
kids are doing it but here's the thing

00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:33,780
all the cool could kids may be doing it

00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:35,940
but it doesn't mean that there aren't a

00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:39,240
lot of workloads and tools that are

00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:42,209
still very important your metaphor of

00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:44,010
and talk about railroad what's

00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:47,600
fascinating to me because the early days

00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:50,910
of the railroad had some really crazy

00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:53,160
incompatibilities as in the rail gauges

00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:54,870
were different and so one of the best

00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,489
parts about open source and we've done

00:02:54,870 --> 00:03:00,150
this through for example the open

00:02:56,489 --> 00:03:02,130
service broker API one of the best parts

00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:05,160
about open source is that we can find

00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:07,860
those intersection points those the

00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:10,050
surface connection points where the

00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:12,150
different projects work together and try

00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:14,190
to find ways to make it so that you

00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:16,650
don't have to climb off of one train and

00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:18,239
climb on to the next because my rail

00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:21,000
gauge is different from your rail gauge

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:23,700
so we've done a lot of that work right

00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,620
now and I keep seeing all the great

00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:28,200
opportunities ahead of us to do more so

00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:31,260
I'm super excited about the cloud

00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:34,220
foundry and kubernetes being able to run

00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:36,390
together in a way the benefits end-users

00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:39,390
yeah and you touched on the open service

00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:41,280
broker API which I neglected to mention

00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:43,709
earlier that's okay I got you covered

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,820
thank you that's why I brought you here

00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:48,299
to remind me all the things I'm going to

00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:50,280
forget today but that's actually such an

00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:53,459
exciting project and it really links

00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:56,010
together cloud foundry kubernetes but

00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:57,780
also the services in a new and real way

00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:01,140
and there's a tremendous amount of work

00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:03,690
going on around this now beyond just the

00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:06,900
open service broker API with projects

00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:10,320
like envoy initio which just released v2

00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:13,860
this week yeah there sorry Oh point 20.2

00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:15,690
thank you important distinction but you

00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:17,130
know it's you know the point of all of

00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:18,930
that is there's an amazing amount of

00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:21,930
momentum with each of these small

00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:23,889
projects but the open source and the

00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:26,259
collaborative potential is

00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:28,330
massive and I'm just so thrilled about

00:04:26,259 --> 00:04:30,789
the opportunity to work closer with

00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:32,560
kubernetes community and cloud native

00:04:30,789 --> 00:04:35,310
computing foundation on all of these

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:39,550
projects yeah the open service broker a

00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:42,249
PA service catalog sub group inside not

00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:44,560
turned into we has spawned a service

00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:47,740
catalog subgroup inside kubernetes that

00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:51,189
is working to a space where we can allow

00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:53,560
a nice clean edge area that more and

00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:55,840
more people more and more developers can

00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:58,719
work within our ecosystem without having

00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:01,479
to be completely embedded in all of the

00:04:58,719 --> 00:05:04,210
inside baseball that exists inside the

00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:06,779
kubernetes development or inside cloud

00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:09,939
foundry development exactly and so the

00:05:06,779 --> 00:05:11,919
vision is to make those services

00:05:09,939 --> 00:05:14,229
portable across all of them yes so a

00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:18,490
true platform agnostic capability for

00:05:14,229 --> 00:05:20,409
services which honestly has so much

00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:23,439
potential to drive and accelerate the

00:05:20,409 --> 00:05:25,629
ecosystem around all of these projects

00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:28,330
it's all happening in the open source it

00:05:25,629 --> 00:05:30,580
is although the open service broker API

00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:31,629
came out of cloud foundry so we get to

00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:35,289
say thank you for that

00:05:31,629 --> 00:05:38,500
hi I was gonna bring it up but but you

00:05:35,289 --> 00:05:40,750
should we could say thanks all good well

00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:42,250
you're I'm just so excited you know as

00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:44,949
we think about the future though which

00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:46,509
is you know is really bright as we think

00:05:44,949 --> 00:05:47,710
about these different communities and

00:05:46,509 --> 00:05:49,810
the different open source initiatives

00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:51,669
going on where do you see the future

00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:56,159
going where do you see a lot of the the

00:05:51,669 --> 00:05:58,360
biggest potential areas so I have been a

00:05:56,159 --> 00:06:00,699
maybe not even closeted I was going to

00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:03,729
say closeted evangelist of utility

00:06:00,699 --> 00:06:06,939
computing for five years or more but I'm

00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:11,319
not that closeted anymore I see a space

00:06:06,939 --> 00:06:13,949
where we have developers building what

00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:17,259
they need what their companies need

00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:21,610
using the tools they need and we get

00:06:17,259 --> 00:06:23,500
past the the religious debates of past

00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:26,139
years the you have to use our platform

00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:28,689
locked into our platform and in one way

00:06:26,139 --> 00:06:32,080
or another and instead we find a much

00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:34,820
more composable system so fab foundry

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:38,660
Bosh can run kubernetes and cloud

00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:40,840
boundary application next word

00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:43,010
application runtime Thank You

00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:46,240
application runtimes the container

00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:49,750
runtime and the application runtime or

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:53,510
you can run kubernetes on top of

00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:56,930
OpenStack and Azure and Google cloud

00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:59,090
platform in order to have the resilience

00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:01,670
your your company or your product or

00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:05,360
your application needs but just making

00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:08,090
these making multiple tool sets fit what

00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,910
the developers and and customers need as

00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:14,420
opposed to making the end customers fit

00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:17,630
what the platform's wanted so providing

00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:18,250
the users choice crazy talk who does

00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:21,140
that

00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:22,760
portability user choice it's like

00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:25,790
containers we're on a we're on a theme

00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:27,830
here with containers the portability I

00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:29,960
just there's so much potential and so

00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:31,670
much excitement so as we we think about

00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:35,270
the future we think about the power of

00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:36,560
open source you know I think when I

00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:38,150
think about kubernetes and cloud foundry

00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,100
I think a lot of peanut butter and

00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:43,090
chocolate while they're both great

00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:45,050
separately together they're amazing I

00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:47,030
found that that doesn't always translate

00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:49,370
to Europe because they don't a lot of

00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:51,560
them don't like peanut butter that's a

00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:53,290
good point it's a very American thing

00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:55,730
there was a there was a series of

00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:57,080
commercials and TV where somebody would

00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:58,130
put peanut butter and chocolate and

00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,350
chocolate and peanut butter and there

00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:03,500
was a big drama but they taste great

00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:05,270
together they do taste because if you

00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,860
haven't tried it highly recommend it

00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:11,540
unless you have a nut allergy then maybe

00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:13,660
not one thing that as we wrap this up is

00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:16,940
we think about the future and

00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:18,380
particularly talking to a group of the

00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:20,900
open source community here at Cloud

00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:23,510
Foundry I'd see it we leave it with the

00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:25,610
open call the action get involved be

00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:28,130
part of each of these projects be part

00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:31,640
of that trust pollinate yes you want to

00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:33,440
work with kubernetes come join us okay

00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:36,080
not exclusively but that's fine come

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,150
talk with us at least if you if you are

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,159
working in a different open-source

00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:42,440
community share the ideas that you

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,509
see and meat you know when you go to

00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:46,639
these events and cross pollinate it's a

00:08:44,509 --> 00:08:48,139
huge huge help and there's so many
