next up we have dorm acaba and Swisscom

00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:11,540
we're excited to welcome to the Cloud

00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:14,340
Foundry stage for the first time

00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:17,430
Andres ha burly the CTO of dorm acaba

00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:21,779
alongside Marcel Walker who runs the

00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:24,900
network and cloud it's Swisscom CP I am

00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:29,939
super thrilled to have andreas here

00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:31,560
sorry Marcel but andreas is a he and I

00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:34,200
didn't learn this till recently so this

00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:37,920
says I'm a really bad computer scientist

00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:40,850
but Marcel pioneered flash memory he was

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,290
an early pioneer in the flash memory and

00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:45,120
in the startup world in Silicon Valley

00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:47,910
so we have a little cross-pollination

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,850
here but he started out as an analog

00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:53,820
chip designer and he Co invented and

00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:55,469
patented multi-level flash so we

00:00:53,820 --> 00:01:01,980
actually have a true rock star in our

00:00:55,469 --> 00:01:04,460
presence today he also plays piano of

00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:07,680
every day which I promised to plug that

00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:11,900
but I'm really excited to open andreas

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,900
Haverly and Marcel Walker to the stage

00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:30,159
[Music]

00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:36,060
so good morning everybody as founding

00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,490
member and also board member of Cloud

00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,050
Foundry we are really happy that you

00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:42,150
found the way coming to Switzerland

00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,210
thank you very much for that thank you

00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:53,040
very much for that we are proud that you

00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:55,890
are all here that's great thanks so you

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,590
might know that within our certified

00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:00,960
platform we have customers like tour

00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:02,310
Makabe I'm really very happy that they

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,289
have found trails here and he's of

00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:06,030
course bringing the majority of the

00:02:04,289 --> 00:02:09,239
presentation because this is really the

00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:12,780
interesting stuff we can present what is

00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:15,450
done the day by day based on on this

00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:19,140
platform but we have also Swiss Re and

00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:24,690
post and of course as Swisscom we use it

00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:27,840
also for us to establish our micro

00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:30,000
service based software development so so

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,459
the overall path platform Cloud Foundry

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,989
based is a very very important piece for

00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:39,450
us at welcome and and that is why I am

00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:42,930
really happy that I can pass over now to

00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:45,150
Andreas showing what our customer does

00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:46,680
with this platform please welcome

00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:51,070
Andreas

00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:53,810
[Applause]

00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:56,150
like why Tremont reminds me a bit of the

00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:59,990
early times of flash memory you know

00:02:56,150 --> 00:03:02,660
late 90s mid to late 90s when when flash

00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:04,100
was in its infancy and it's quite a long

00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:07,250
way for me you know for multi-level

00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:11,560
flash invention to access control as a

00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:14,690
service but you will see the story a bit

00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:17,780
let's start when I started don't go back

00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:20,450
to my Silicon Valley adventures I go

00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:22,520
back 14 years only we were at Omaha

00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:26,600
beaver one of the players in Europe in

00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:28,670
access control well-positioned now we

00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,960
are number two or three depending a

00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:32,630
little bit where you set the boundaries

00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:34,810
worldwide in access control

00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:37,790
we started off 14 years ago with some

00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:39,950
700 million Swiss francs revenue now by

00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:42,760
organic and an organic rose we have 2.5

00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:46,570
plus billion Swiss francs in revenue

00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:49,220
16,000 people worldwide subsidiaries in

00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:51,050
50 country plus now and we have a very

00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:52,580
broad offering of products and now it

00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:54,860
gets real boring for you guys you know

00:03:52,580 --> 00:04:00,020
we do panic bars like over there we do

00:03:54,860 --> 00:04:01,400
cylinders locks closers but actually

00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:03,370
it's interesting stuff as we see in a

00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,690
minute

00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:07,580
so that's the product we are doing these

00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:08,960
are part of of the babies I was involved

00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:11,480
heavily you know and there are not

00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:14,120
iPhones you know but I love them as much

00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:16,010
as my iPhone because it's it's you know

00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,989
I mean you put a lot of energy to build

00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:19,850
these products and they are not in Nice

00:04:17,989 --> 00:04:21,680
they are secure most of them has now

00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:23,660
Bluetooth Low Energy that we can open

00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,840
with mobile phones a lot of security

00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:29,030
stuff inside key managing symmetric

00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:32,210
asymmetric really exciting stuff you

00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:35,840
know this is just the surface but as a

00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:38,240
CTO you know it's good plays nice babies

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,040
but what really counts is being

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,580
responsible for innovation strategy of

00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:46,340
global player is how do we differentiate

00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:48,560
now in future and bad news is that our

00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:50,600
people can do as well as we do you know

00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,340
other people can develop these nice

00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:55,160
products as well as we can do they have

00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:57,050
nice designs they are of course not as

00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,700
secure and not as whatever you know but

00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:02,060
you know the differentiation gets very

00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:03,700
hard when it comes to hardware and the

00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:05,400
differentiator

00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:08,170
we start looking at three years ago was

00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:11,080
not the product anymore it was beyond

00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:12,970
the product beyond the scenes beyond

00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:16,000
where we as an engineering company were

00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:18,690
used looking at and to explain you that

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,180
a bit better is that how industry works

00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:24,730
we have on the right part we have an end

00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:27,160
customer this is in this picture is a

00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:28,830
facility manager of a school and he has

00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:32,230
to handle a lot of you know keys

00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:35,530
mechanical keys nowadays batches mobile

00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:38,200
keys will come and he's confused so he

00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:40,000
talks to a dealer because you know it's

00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:42,010
it's still complex stuff and we have

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,750
safety security regulations to fulfill

00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:46,450
so he talks to a dealer to a get advice

00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:47,950
what's best the dealer has to go back to

00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:49,960
the country organization here the

00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:52,180
Italian country organization and finally

00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:55,000
you know the product is deployed or

00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:58,600
developed at a at or Makabe production

00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,150
site and how information flows goes is I

00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,860
mean look at that you know negotiations

00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:07,120
portion back you know finally all this

00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:09,940
placed system is installed firma patches

00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:13,270
have to be done but instead the way to

00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:15,700
make business in future in a way as you

00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:19,530
as data centric people you know this is

00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:23,290
not going to fly so this is the approach

00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:25,180
looking at how we do business now and

00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:27,340
how a business is going to be in future

00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:29,620
is digital transformation even for I

00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:34,920
would call ironmongery compact or Makabe

00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:34,920
and the transformation happens like that

00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:43,090
you will notice still the same

00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:44,830
stakeholders we need security experts at

00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:46,510
the side someone who takes care of your

00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:48,310
installation if somebody fails as

00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:49,660
something fails replacement keys to be

00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:51,880
done so we cannot just virtualize

00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:55,510
everything it's still hard where

00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:58,090
buildings are real so we cannot just you

00:06:55,510 --> 00:07:01,420
know kick out some stakeholders all of

00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:02,560
the stakeholders house still at stake in

00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:05,530
the party but we added two more

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,900
stakeholders doing that we added the

00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:11,170
green ones and these are sophisticated

00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:13,900
tools to plan to order to manage to

00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:17,350
upgrade your insulation planning tools

00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:19,450
and second even the site the building

00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:20,470
is a stakeholder you know has

00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:22,780
requirements

00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:24,940
hey I'm not working my battery's low my

00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:25,810
update has not come yet you know I have

00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:28,300
a security issue

00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:31,630
so even the building becomes part of

00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:34,990
this ecosystem which we call access

00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:38,260
control as a service now these two

00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:41,020
drawings are old you know probably three

00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:42,940
plus year old and when you look at this

00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:44,860
drawing I mean for you guys it's fairly

00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:46,240
straightforward you know it has

00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,560
something to do obviously with a cloud

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,270
you know you see the cloud there and for

00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:52,090
us okay now we have to go to cloud

00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:54,400
really have to go to cloud and then you

00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:57,280
start looking at well that's of course

00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,200
the data path which is different but

00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,580
having these data paths in mind having

00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:04,090
realized that we have to go in the cloud

00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:06,460
a new dimension opens for a company like

00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:08,170
door Makabe you know a lot of passwords

00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:11,950
coming you have engineers talking about

00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:14,650
architecture like CQRS highly scalable

00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:16,330
you talk about security you talk about

00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:18,820
what's different between public

00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:21,070
semi-public whatever you know a private

00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:22,510
virtual private and then you really

00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:26,200
start thinking what is your core

00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:29,560
competence in the end we did that and

00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:32,590
our conclusion is we have to focus on

00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:34,060
our business we have a lot to do to

00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:35,979
change the business model from the

00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:37,840
pipeline business to this platform

00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:39,280
business that's our core we know our

00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:41,640
customers we know how revenue is

00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:43,900
generated and we need partners and

00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:45,730
digital transformation is a lot about

00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:47,830
partners you have to find the right

00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:50,620
partners to do what your business

00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:52,720
demands what your customer needs and the

00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:54,850
set up was really working fine you know

00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,440
having Swisscom building up at the same

00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:59,740
time the application cloud using

00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:02,830
platform as a cloud foundry as a

00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:04,780
platform having the Cloud Foundry

00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:07,690
foundation backing up with technology

00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:09,850
that just worked fine to give you an

00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:11,170
idea now we are rolling out this

00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:12,820
application so this is not a dream

00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:14,110
anymore we are rolling it out in Europe

00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:17,260
I come to that in a second how that

00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:19,270
looks like but now we have our front-end

00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:21,010
apps are on cloud foundry which is

00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:22,540
customers partners these different

00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:26,290
stakeholders the different perspectives

00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:28,600
are running on Cloud Foundry we have the

00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:30,370
front-end at the backend is running on

00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,130
Cloud Foundry a lot of ingredients tough

00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,870
business too

00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:34,360
Identity Management you know it's a

00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:41,780
complex system if you want to manage

00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:43,900
physical security also the IOT stack we

00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:46,340
call it IOT stack connecting the devices

00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:49,010
making sure these are updated we can

00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:50,960
download security patches we can we can

00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:55,190
get information is running on Cloud

00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:56,810
Foundry well conclusion is our business

00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:58,880
model for Access Controller service is

00:09:56,810 --> 00:10:00,590
running on Cloud Foundry we have this

00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,180
ecosystem built up you know that

00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:04,730
everybody has access depending on his

00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:10,460
rights and views to this what we call

00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:13,310
digital twin of our installation to give

00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:15,170
you at least a glimpse an idea I are not

00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:17,750
going to any more technical detail we

00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:19,730
split into a major part two domains the

00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:23,120
business domain which connects all this

00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:25,880
I mean I would say more the the the real

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:28,760
stakeholders like dealers our our

00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:31,520
factory the country organization stuff

00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:33,310
like that and our main the IOT stack

00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:36,770
which has some specific requirements

00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:39,560
they consist each of quite few

00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:42,080
applications and services in the

00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:43,550
instances we had to do because it's

00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:46,550
fairly complex to build we want to

00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:48,590
deploy every four to six weeks we

00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:50,240
deployed a little framework which we

00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:52,010
call push to cloud that was presented

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,900
last year the Cloud Foundry summit in

00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:56,090
Europe that makes it easier to deploy

00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:59,360
regularly in a consistent way you can

00:10:56,090 --> 00:11:00,770
even look it's available on github so

00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,740
that's the application we are running

00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:05,810
and let's realize now you know and this

00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:09,380
is exciting from this idea transform the

00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:11,240
business in a new way this is a medical

00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:13,190
practice it's a magnet of practice

00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:15,680
you're not far away you see the team

00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:16,430
consisting of two physicians the team

00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,610
assistants

00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:21,320
the building is depicted here it has

00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:24,770
several rooms x-ray rooms doctors

00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:27,200
offices a few other rooms and the

00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:29,450
digital twin you know is starting when

00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,600
you import floor plan the floor plan

00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:35,510
here which has different offices

00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:37,970
administration has drugstore x-ray rooms

00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:41,210
and all of them of course need access

00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:43,010
control so we can now plan really plan

00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:44,800
in the cloud this access control

00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:46,269
different security zones

00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,380
they're shown in different colors we can

00:11:46,269 --> 00:11:52,149
drag-and-drop templates from our

00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:55,089
products just drag and drop - I don't

00:11:52,149 --> 00:11:56,529
have wireless wired what time kind of

00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:58,540
dog conformation do they want I can

00:11:56,529 --> 00:12:00,970
configure setting the parameters on the

00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:03,910
cloud before it's even installed making

00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:05,260
sure it's running consistently so this

00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:08,230
is the planning tool we give to our

00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:13,089
dealers as a tool to simplify the life

00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:15,970
of our dealer we have ten of course you

00:12:13,089 --> 00:12:17,380
know everything is this is my my - but

00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:19,079
it's my home now now switching from the

00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:21,220
from from from his doctor is my home

00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:22,120
here that's my dashboard when I look my

00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,740
phone and see everything green

00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:25,500
everything fine battery no problem

00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:28,209
firmware updates no security issue

00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:30,250
everything connected but it may be that

00:12:28,209 --> 00:12:32,709
something goes wrong you know so this

00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:34,959
green colors turned to orange or red and

00:12:32,709 --> 00:12:36,899
then the worst thing the best thing is I

00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:39,430
have no idea who to call who to contact

00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:41,649
here very easy I just have you know get

00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:44,019
support contact space because whoever I

00:12:41,649 --> 00:12:45,790
contact here my dealer knows exactly

00:12:44,019 --> 00:12:48,040
what problem I have he can look from his

00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:51,040
perspective and we can open a dialog to

00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:53,140
fix the problem so this is making life

00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,480
easy it's improving the customer

00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:58,270
experience and lastly you know as knock

00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:01,120
other is a real life example August I

00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:03,730
got a whatsapp message from my dear

00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,649
daughter Sarah she says she went out

00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:07,120
obviously for joking my wife life in the

00:13:05,649 --> 00:13:10,240
meantime she is you know you all know

00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:13,390
that blocked with her phone only and she

00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:17,410
writes me a whatsapp those who know

00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:19,420
Swiss German can translate that she has

00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:20,980
a problem and that's about the customer

00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:22,570
pain which is essential for digital

00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:24,100
transformation which is a problem but no

00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:25,899
problem for me you know and this is real

00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:28,360
you know I can open the door remotely I

00:13:25,899 --> 00:13:31,300
have access to my digital twin and the

00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:37,930
problem solve before it came more severe

00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:39,579
in this case what's next now well next

00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:41,740
we are in a starting point this takes

00:13:39,579 --> 00:13:45,160
time you know to change a business from

00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:47,199
pipeline business to educate dealers

00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:49,149
customers to go to cloud for their

00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:51,790
convenience takes time so we are rolling

00:13:49,149 --> 00:13:53,890
out this product in Europe plan is

00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:56,380
obviously we rolled it out globally as a

00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:58,420
global player we have different requests

00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:00,779
we want to optimize our operating costs

00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:04,300
we have require requires a usage based

00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:06,130
platform as a service offerings and you

00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:08,139
know when demand rises also when it

00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:10,720
comes to processes to security and we

00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:13,260
are slowly moving from DevOps to def

00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:17,680
Secord's which is has its own challenges

00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:20,649
as you probably know conclusion take

00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:22,540
away from this I would say three-year

00:14:20,649 --> 00:14:27,899
journey so far with Swisscom and Cloud

00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:31,029
Foundry it's very simple test three

00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:33,519
components technology is a challenge yes

00:14:31,029 --> 00:14:34,870
to find the way to these passwords in

00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:39,279
the charcoal to find the right partner

00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:41,170
that's one thing but not to stop just

00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:43,660
using new technologies for the old way

00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:45,670
of business but really you know question

00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:48,550
your own business model and to bring it

00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:51,910
sustainably to life I tell you that's a

00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:54,220
larger problem and to do both at the

00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:56,139
same time question your own business

00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:58,750
model adopting the power of new

00:14:56,139 --> 00:15:00,579
technologies there is a lot to do with a

00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:02,920
culture in your company and that still

00:15:00,579 --> 00:15:04,959
remains a challenge for dharmakaya these

00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:07,029
days but we are ready to tackle that and

00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:11,019
bring this forward for the sake and for

00:15:07,029 --> 00:15:14,380
the convenience of our customers we

00:15:11,019 --> 00:15:17,949
depth my short story and with that I

00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:20,860
give it back to Marcel for some

00:15:17,949 --> 00:15:21,760
concluding words about Swisscom thank

00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:29,850
you very much

00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:33,850
[Applause]

00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:35,830
so you heard from Andreas that they are

00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:38,410
a global organization and there of

00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:41,320
course latency is an issue that's why

00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:43,990
the next step we are doing with our past

00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:46,750
platform is that we are really deploying

00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:49,240
it on Amazon so that we have the chance

00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:53,050
to fulfill the customer needs also from

00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:55,510
a latency point so if you're interested

00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:57,670
in that we've done a pilot till now our

00:15:55,510 --> 00:16:00,340
colleagues at the booth are more than

00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:04,560
interested in showing you more details

00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:07,870
what we can offer dear not only

00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:10,720
delivering the platform out of our data

00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:13,990
centers in Switzerland but only if the

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,970
customer requires it having it having it

00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:20,940
in on a global scale

00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:24,460
Amazon based and yeah we already heard

00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:26,500
in the in the speech before we think

00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:28,990
it's a brilliant idea really to bring

00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:31,690
bash on the kubernetes together having

00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:34,360
then the both in runtime environments

00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:37,630
from an application based and container

00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:40,360
base we've used kubernetes for the last

00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:43,510
two years for internal services like

00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:46,330
reddit or a MongoDB and that's why we're

00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:48,970
really happy and keen to contribute to

00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:52,090
the community to know how we've had that

00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:54,880
we can share that also now bringing the

00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:57,340
kubernetes one in that next step Cloud

00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:00,880
Foundry based we think this is really a

00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:03,100
huge achievement because because yeah it

00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,230
is really important to have both the

00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:08,290
container one and application-based one

00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:10,630
we see that with our customers it is not

00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:14,200
that easy to find all the business cases

00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:17,500
to to have the old applications really

00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:20,680
to rewrite the old applications into

00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:23,080
micro service space these use cases or

00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:25,540
these business cases are not always

00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:27,580
running well and that's why having a

00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:30,460
more flexibility in the runtime

00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:36,820
environment we see this as a strategic

00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:40,809
next point for for Cloud Foundry and yes

00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:43,299
we are in we the platform we deliver is

00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:46,269
open as a public platform for more or

00:17:43,299 --> 00:17:49,960
less half of Europe in the western part

00:17:46,269 --> 00:17:52,960
and we are proud now to to to to tell

00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:55,720
you that we beginning in November we can

00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:59,049
open up this for additional 18 countries

00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:02,320
in Europe so we have now really a

00:17:59,049 --> 00:18:05,799
coverage in Europe with our public

00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:08,559
platform a public plan a past platform

00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:11,200
for nearly all the countries in Europe

00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:13,090
so whenever you have colleagues are the

00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,610
developments in other countries please

00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:18,639
tell them that the platform is now

00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:22,539
really open so that you can work with it

00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:24,789
from wherever you are within Europe so

00:18:22,539 --> 00:18:28,869
if you need more information please

00:18:24,789 --> 00:18:31,779
visit our developers swisco.com a page

00:18:28,869 --> 00:18:34,869
you'll find there everything about our

00:18:31,779 --> 00:18:38,139
engagement for the platform for Cloud

00:18:34,869 --> 00:18:40,960
Foundry idea we really believe in that

00:18:38,139 --> 00:18:43,269
and this is a very important piece for

00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:46,769
our strategy in the future thank you

00:18:43,269 --> 00:18:46,769
very much for that Thanks

00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:51,150
