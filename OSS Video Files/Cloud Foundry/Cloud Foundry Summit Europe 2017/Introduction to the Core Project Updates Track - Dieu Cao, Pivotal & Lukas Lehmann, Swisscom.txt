good morning everyone and a very warm

00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:07,410
welcome to the core project update track

00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:09,870
here in Basel

00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:13,620
this is a track where you will get

00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:17,340
updates on all the core project as the

00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:19,590
name says and you and myself we had to

00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:23,820
honor or let's rather say the very hard

00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:28,529
job to pick out of very very good 38

00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:30,779
submissions four tracks just 14 slots to

00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:34,020
make up a very good lineup for you for

00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:37,469
the next two days and for us it was very

00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:39,570
important to check when we did basically

00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:42,090
the rating on the submissions that we

00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:43,649
have a great diversity of the talk so

00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:46,920
that you see about all different

00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:49,500
components certainly updates as well as

00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:52,050
the different companies involved there

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:56,270
so this means now we have talks coming

00:00:52,050 --> 00:01:00,320
up from Dell EMC pivotal through the SP

00:00:56,270 --> 00:01:03,270
Swisscom as well as dark and Wayne and

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,100
if you can't make it to a talk there is

00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:07,409
also the opportunity of the project

00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:10,409
office hours which take place in a third

00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:14,220
floor where it can go and get insight

00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:16,439
into a lot of core projects and if you

00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,509
have not yet signed up on the CF def

00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:21,390

00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:26,130

obtain the service level objectives

00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:49,120
