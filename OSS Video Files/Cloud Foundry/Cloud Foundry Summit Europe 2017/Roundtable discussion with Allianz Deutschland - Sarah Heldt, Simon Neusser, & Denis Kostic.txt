About Sarah Heldt
A product owner who has experienced digitalisation in three different industries: media, telecommunication, and finance. Mega trends as the accelerating technological change and mobile internet demand enterprises to be as fast and flexible as start-ups when developing customer centric products. My purpose is to help companies to leverage a team's potential, build useful and easy to use services and products, and to create fulfilling career paths as part of their digital transformation because I believe it takes passionate employees to master the challenges of the Silicon Age.

thank you for having us our talk is

00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:58,190
about the use of cloud foundry in an

00:00:55,190 --> 00:01:00,640
industry that most but are sometimes has

00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:04,160
the reputation of being a bit boring

00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:06,470
insurance but hopefully at the end of

00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:09,229
our talk all of you will think

00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:13,369
differently about that but first things

guessed we all work for aliens aliens is

00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:33,649
one of the world's largest insurance

00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:36,350
companies in Germany we have 29 sides

00:01:33,649 --> 00:01:40,520
and employees and over 20 million

00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:42,590
customers whoa 20 million customers

00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:45,940
that's quite a lot

00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:49,490
have you ever thought about you know

00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:51,800
what keeps all this the system's powered

00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:54,649
what kind of IT systems does an

00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:57,770
insurance company have we do have quite

00:01:54,649 --> 00:02:02,810
a lot and to serve those 20 million

00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:06,080
customers we do have a mobile app this

00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:10,759
apps name is miner Alliance which

00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:13,430
translates to my aliens in English the

00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:15,920
app targets our existing customers our

00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:17,900
customers can check out their contracts

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:21,140
can get in touch with their personal

00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:25,069
agent and also send messages to their

00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:28,040
agent via a secure Channel some of you

00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:30,500
might think now so yeah a lot of big

00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:33,200
companies do have mobile apps small

00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:36,890
companies do have mobile apps so why is

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,900
this product special for aliens may I

00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:40,610
ask you who works for a company with

00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:45,860
more than a thousand employees in this

00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:48,170
room a lot of hands go up so I think

00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:50,510
some of you have heard about these

00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:51,940
things or experienced them in their

00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:53,950
daily life

00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:55,960
whenever a big company wants to launch a

00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:58,510
new product they're like gazillion

00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:00,460
requirements you have to fill in

00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:02,890
thousands of documents they pile up

00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:05,320
really really high everywhere it takes

00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:07,870
forever to deploy to forever to release

00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:09,970
and then sometimes by the time your

00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:13,990
product goes to market it's already

00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:16,750
outdated for you because all this

00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:18,850
doesn't apply to us anymore

00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:21,310
because aliens is on a journey

00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:27,070
especially our team is on a journey from

00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:29,950
waterfall to lean this is our team our

00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:33,760
team we were the first ones to embrace

00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:36,160
the new way of working at Allianz we

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,080
started when did we start about one and

00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:41,220
a half years ago with the help of

00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:44,140
pivotal we changed to set up in our team

00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:48,300
we've got five developers working on the

00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:50,920
app one designer and one product owner

00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:55,390
from our point of view that's all you

00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:58,300
need and it's not just a team it's also

00:03:55,390 --> 00:04:01,030
the structure how we work with our lean

00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:04,420
setup we embrace the Lean Startup

00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:07,810
methodology which means we work based on

00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:10,360
Minimum Viable products it's our goal to

00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:11,920
achieve act technical excellence and

00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:14,670
true customer centricity

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:18,400
that's why we've stove tailed our

00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:21,340
development process with our user tests

00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:24,130
for example and also before we start

00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:26,890
implementing a user story or think about

00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:30,610
what's the business value behind this

00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:32,620
story I hope you're all excited now and

00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:36,550
I'll hand over to Dennis who will give

00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:39,100
you more details thank you so much Sarah

00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:40,600
good morning everybody again I'm Dennis

00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:43,150
I'm the designer in the team and just

00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:46,419
like Sarah mentioned a transformation

00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:48,490
from waterfall to Lean Startup can be

00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:52,030
quite exhausting so let me show you

00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:54,010
where we actually trial and error and as

00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:57,460
you can see we like to put post-its on

00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:59,830
the wall and even on our windows we also

00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:02,560
literally have to stand up to present

00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:05,020
our ideas and learnings not only in

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,639
front of our teammates but also to arts

00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:08,219
take hold

00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:10,620
from time to time we are also literally

00:05:08,219 --> 00:05:14,159
sitting in front of the same table

00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:21,419
working together but we try to rock the

00:05:14,159 --> 00:05:23,370
house also in this kind of place so we

00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:23,789
really like to compete against each

00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:26,490
other

00:05:23,789 --> 00:05:28,379
from time to time against other teams

00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:30,810
for example and in case you want to

00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:38,099
compete against me feel free to apply

00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:39,629
for a job at Allianz today so as you can

00:05:38,099 --> 00:05:43,699
see we really like to work in tents

00:05:39,629 --> 00:05:46,199
fully but we also know how to enjoy work

00:05:43,699 --> 00:05:51,060
but it's not only about where we work

00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:53,150
it's also about yeah how we work and we

00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:55,620
believe in our approach we really do

00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:58,379
because we think that every team member

00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:01,319
should have their own say we also think

00:05:58,379 --> 00:06:03,930
that we don't need to spend too much

00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:06,449
time in meetings this is why we you know

00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:09,539
plug off plug out our telephones in our

00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:11,189
offices and we want to have short

00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:12,000
stories so that everybody goes home

00:06:11,189 --> 00:06:14,759
happy

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,819
at the end of the day we also think that

00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:21,149
people are allowed or they should be

00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:23,879
allowed to learn and improved ourselves

00:06:21,149 --> 00:06:27,990
continuously in order to deliver

00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:29,759
excellent quality and user experience so

00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:33,180
let me tell you something about user

00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:37,199
experience we listen to our customers we

00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:40,229
really do believe me because our product

00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:42,810
is for our customers obviously we want

00:06:40,229 --> 00:06:45,569
people to enjoy interacting with aliens

00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:49,529
and and this is why we're having a user

00:06:45,569 --> 00:06:52,469
test at least once per month so that we

00:06:49,529 --> 00:06:54,870
can test our features before we put them

00:06:52,469 --> 00:06:57,060
on production so for us the number one

00:06:54,870 --> 00:07:00,810
priority is to provide further well.you

00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:02,909
in the app to do so of course we need

00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:06,120
the most advanced state-of-the-art

00:07:02,909 --> 00:07:09,080
software we can get Simon is going to

00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,080
tell you a little more about it

00:07:09,469 --> 00:07:15,479
Thank You Dennis so let's have a look at

00:07:12,689 --> 00:07:17,490
the tool stack that we are using and as

00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:18,729
you already see although we are a pretty

00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:20,770
small team we

00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:23,229
we have a large variety of tools and

00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:24,610
technologies that we're using but don't

00:07:23,229 --> 00:07:26,020
worry I'm not gonna talk about all of

00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:28,809
those in detail now

00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:30,999
in fact the really important thing here

00:07:28,809 --> 00:07:34,089
is that we are in charge of this tools

00:07:30,999 --> 00:07:36,999
tech so we as a team get to decide which

00:07:34,089 --> 00:07:40,629
tools are fitting best for the way we

00:07:36,999 --> 00:07:43,029
work so for example we chose to build

00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:45,960
our Android app on Kotlin instead of

00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:48,339
Java which the rest of aliens is using

00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:50,080
but it was just like a decision we

00:07:48,339 --> 00:07:52,659
thought okay this is a cool new language

00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:55,899
so let's just go for it we also saw the

00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:57,669
potential that it makes us faster so we

00:07:55,899 --> 00:08:01,240
really have this kind of freedom and

00:07:57,669 --> 00:08:03,610
that is actually a great thing for us so

00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:06,639
in the end it all comes down actually to

00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:09,999
which tool make us as fast as possible

00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:12,939
and was dead in mind we also follow the

00:08:09,999 --> 00:08:15,159
DevOps mindset which means after we

00:08:12,939 --> 00:08:19,240
build it we also have to be able to run

00:08:15,159 --> 00:08:21,069
it so naturally if you follow that

00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,439
mindset it comes to you to be as

00:08:21,069 --> 00:08:26,139
efficient as possible and to automate as

00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:29,800
much of the actually non value-adding

00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:32,940
processes next to your job for which for

00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:36,010
us this for example the build pipeline

00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:39,370
for that we are using tools like Jenkins

00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:41,260
or fast lane so in the end whenever one

00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:44,350
of our developers is finishing a story

00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:46,959
and is pushing it to github the build

00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:49,180
pipeline will automatically run it will

00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:51,100
build a project it will run all the

00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:55,540
tests which are also automated we have

00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:59,019
more than a thousand tests and only if

00:08:55,540 --> 00:09:01,510
those tests are actually passing it will

00:08:59,019 --> 00:09:03,579
then eventually push to Cloud Foundry or

00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:07,269
if you're talking about our app to the

00:09:03,579 --> 00:09:09,579
App Store directly so now let's have a

00:09:07,269 --> 00:09:11,880
closer look on how we actually use Cloud

00:09:09,579 --> 00:09:11,880
Foundry

00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:18,610
so what you see here is a very very very

00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:22,269
abstract model of our architecture and

00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:25,959
as you already know we have two native

00:09:22,269 --> 00:09:28,259
apps iOS and Android so those apps need

00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:30,209
to consume a couple of services in

00:09:28,259 --> 00:09:32,899
to get information for example one

00:09:30,209 --> 00:09:35,519
services providing us with customer

00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:36,959
information about the contracts while

00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,809
another service is providing us with

00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:42,239
information about the agent and so on

00:09:39,809 --> 00:09:43,859
and so forth so those services are not

00:09:42,239 --> 00:09:47,489
on the slide but what you see on the

00:09:43,859 --> 00:09:51,989
slide is our API and this API is running

00:09:47,489 --> 00:09:54,779
on Cloud Foundry so this is actually for

00:09:51,989 --> 00:09:57,989
us working as a service interaction

00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:59,850
layer so that means it's talking to all

00:09:57,989 --> 00:10:02,189
the different services in Allianz world

00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:03,989
and its collecting the data and it's

00:10:02,189 --> 00:10:08,239
preparing the data for our apps to

00:10:03,989 --> 00:10:10,589
consume and present in the end

00:10:08,239 --> 00:10:13,019
technology-wise this is a spring boot

00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:15,749
application which is all always working

00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:17,549
great together with Cloud Foundry and we

00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:22,160
have currently two instances of this

00:10:17,549 --> 00:10:24,869
running on production and as you already

00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:27,269
have seen on that slide this is a

00:10:24,869 --> 00:10:30,539
crucial part of our architecture because

00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:33,539
if this API will fail both of our apps

00:10:30,539 --> 00:10:35,789
will fail as well so this is where for

00:10:33,539 --> 00:10:37,470
us actually the resilience of Cloud

00:10:35,789 --> 00:10:40,139
Foundry comes in very handy because

00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:44,939
whenever this API should ever crash

00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:47,639
which of course never has happened then

00:10:44,939 --> 00:10:49,859
we actually have the lactic Cloud

00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:54,929
Foundry we'll spin up a new application

00:10:49,859 --> 00:10:56,999
instance for us just now so now after

00:10:54,929 --> 00:10:59,609
one year actually on production on Cloud

00:10:56,999 --> 00:11:03,739
Foundry what are our likes and dislikes

00:10:59,609 --> 00:11:06,059
about it what are the experiences and

00:11:03,739 --> 00:11:07,499
because I'm somebody who always wants to

00:11:06,059 --> 00:11:10,009
hear the bad news first let's start with

00:11:07,499 --> 00:11:13,319
the things that we think could be better

00:11:10,009 --> 00:11:15,509
first of all we don't get blue/green

00:11:13,319 --> 00:11:18,659
deployment out of the box the green

00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:22,259
deployment is basically a technology

00:11:18,659 --> 00:11:24,119
that allows you to minimize really the

00:11:22,259 --> 00:11:26,579
downtime which is produced during a

00:11:24,119 --> 00:11:29,159
deployment by not pushing stuff to the

00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:30,809
productive application but by spinning

00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:32,429
up a new application making this

00:11:30,809 --> 00:11:34,259
application completely production ready

00:11:32,429 --> 00:11:36,179
before then in the end just switching

00:11:34,259 --> 00:11:39,419
the productive route to the new

00:11:36,179 --> 00:11:41,270
application so this is a cool thing that

00:11:39,419 --> 00:11:44,150
we obviously want to use

00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:48,170
but unfortunately we had to implement

00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:50,120
this ourselves in the end which to be

00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:53,270
honest was not that big of a deal but

00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:56,510
still it's not coming out of the box

00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:58,580
which would have been just nice so

00:11:56,510 --> 00:12:00,650
secondly the autoscaler does not really

00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:04,250
care about running reakless which means

00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:06,380
whenever this autoscaler is deciding to

00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:08,570
scale down one of your application

00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:10,910
instances or requests which we are

00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:14,030
currently processed on this instance

00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:16,160
will be lost that might result in

00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:18,200
technical errors or stuff like that and

00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:22,790
that's obviously something we don't want

00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:25,400
either the third point is about the log

00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:28,130
format because that has changed in a

00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:30,800
recent update for log format of the

00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:34,820
application logs and I believe it was

00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:37,610
beginning of this year someone but the

00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:40,550
problem that this cost us what was that

00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:43,670
it actually crashed our application

00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:46,940
monitoring because it just wasn't

00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:49,430
prepared for a new format so you could

00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:51,770
argue that this is basically our fault

00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:54,560
because changes like that are normally

00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:57,290
announced but we still put it up on the

00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:01,130
slide because we think as a developer

00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:04,850
you want the maximum like consistency in

00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:09,080
a platform and changes like that always

00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:11,120
have the potential to just crash or do

00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:13,670
something harmful on an consuming

00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:16,640
service so those are the things that we

00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:18,320
think could be maybe better but as you

00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:20,840
immediately see this is a very short

00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:24,290
list and that's because we are actually

00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:27,170
very happy customers so let's talk about

00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:28,690
the things that we think are completely

00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:33,230
awesome

00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:36,860
so first of all it just works and I know

00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:38,570
this is a worn out thing to say but in a

00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:41,240
year now that we've been using this on

00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:42,740
production we never had any real issues

00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,750
with the platform and that's just a

00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:48,140
great thing because it allows us as

00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:50,030
developers to just focus on our real job

00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:52,460
which at the end of the day is just

00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:53,870
building an application and not a

00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:56,370
platform

00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:59,490
the second point is that it's actually

00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:01,470
really easy to use as well so you don't

00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:04,500
have to be an infrastructure specialist

00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:06,720
or anything like that to just use Cloud

00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:10,650
Foundry and also to get up and running

00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:12,810
really fast also it has a very steep

00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:14,640
learning curve so I think anybody just

00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:18,690
can learn how to use it in a very short

00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:21,630
period of time but in my opinion the

00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:23,670
most important thing about cloud for me

00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:27,480
what it gives to us is that it gives us

00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:28,170
freedom and independence and I know this

00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,960
sounds stupid

00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:33,570
but actually if you work for a big

00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:35,640
company you will immediately know what

00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:37,200
I'm talking about because big companies

00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:40,440
they tend to have a process for

00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:43,770
everything and those processes also tend

00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:45,540
to be slowish and to be honest at the

00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:49,050
end of the day those processes kill a

00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:50,550
lot of the productivity but that's what

00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:53,430
you don't want right you don't want to

00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:54,870
wait weeks or days for your productive

00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:57,960
deployment you don't want to wait for

00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:59,370
the operations team to just schedule a

00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:03,090
deployment

00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:05,310
that's what ever date and luckily for

00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:07,500
our team we don't have to deal with

00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:08,880
stuff like that because we are the

00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:11,460
operations team as well

00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:13,260
and that's actually the great thing

00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:16,800
about Cloud Foundry for us that it

00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:18,780
empowers us as a team to just push new

00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,490
stuff to production whenever we want to

00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:23,520
and we don't have to wait for it we can

00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:28,260
do it immediately so it speeds us up by

00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:30,030
a lot so with that I would like to pass

00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,570
back to Sarah who's going to wrap it up

00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:34,580
for you

00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:38,010
Thank You Simon well as you've heard now

00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:42,030
we are really happy with our client 400

00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:45,540
platform because it enables us to move

00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:47,520
to move a lot more faster we can deploy

00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:50,340
faster than we want whatever we think a

00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:54,150
feature is ready we ship it so it gives

00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:56,910
us freedom and flexibility as I said

00:15:54,150 --> 00:16:00,240
before audiences on a journey from

00:15:56,910 --> 00:16:02,310
waterfall to lean our team was the first

00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:06,570
team to walk along that path a lot of

00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:07,110
teams are following so with one and a

00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:10,200
half years

00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:12,720
of experience on that pass one year on

00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:14,820
production with our app we can say we

00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:18,060
can really focus on what matters the

00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:20,700
most for our team to reach our goals our

00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:23,220
goals are cust to true customer

00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:25,050
centricity technical excellence we can

00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:27,269
focus on that with our app because the

00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:32,370
platform gives us the freedom not to

00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:34,290
worry about the platform so if you want

00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:36,089
to learn more about this or if you are

00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:39,120
interested in becoming part of aliens

00:16:36,089 --> 00:16:41,190
just join us later on at our booth our

00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,670
booth is downstairs and on the right and

00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:45,890
we're happy to answer your questions

00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:53,659
thank you very much

00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:53,659
