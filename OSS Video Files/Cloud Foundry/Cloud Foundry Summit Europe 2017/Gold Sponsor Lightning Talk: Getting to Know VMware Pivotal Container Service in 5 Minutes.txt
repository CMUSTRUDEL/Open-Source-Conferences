	Gold Sponsor Lightning Talk: Getting to Know VMware Pivotal Container Service in 5 Minutes - Nathan Ness, VMware

 With VMware Pivotal Container Service (PKS), your enterprise or service provider organization can deploy and consume container services with Kubernetes, built with high availability, security and operational efficiency.

In 5 minutes, we will share an overview of PKS.

	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,100
so I'm gonna get started I've got five

00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:09,300
minutes to tell you about VMware pivotal

00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:11,960
container service or PKS so what this is

00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:14,370
is a purpose-built container service for

00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:16,379
operationalizing kubernetes so what is

00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:18,690
it what does that mean it means that

00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:20,910
we're taking open source kubernetes so

00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:23,820
standard open source bits we're not

00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:28,439
changing the bits at all packaging that

00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:32,340
and deploying it on initially vSphere

00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:34,890
and the VMware cloud on AWS what this

00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,590
does is unify the management of VMs and

00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:38,700
containers in a single platform

00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:42,090
including down to the networking level

00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:45,180
so part of PKS is the option to deploy

00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:48,180
NSX T which gives you networking to the

00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:50,309
to the individual VM but also using a

00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,899
CNI plug-in down to the container level

00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:55,379
or the pods that you're deploying in

00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:57,239
kubernetes so this is hardened and a

00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:59,309
production grade platform that takes

00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:03,030
advantage of the underlying vSphere

00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:05,250
infrastructure to provide a to increase

00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:07,860
security provide multi-tenancy and

00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:13,680
integration with a suite of VMware tools

00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:16,439
to manage the platform so it begins with

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,180
project Kubo which is a was started by

00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:20,640
Google and pivotal and and then donate

00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,740
it to the Cloud Foundry Foundation so

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,960
we're using Bosh to deploy kubernetes

00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,970
clusters and then to give you the

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,860
ability to deliver kubernetes on demand

00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:31,140
and then you get all of those day2

00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:33,689
operations that you associate with Bosh

00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:36,240
so being able to identify service

00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:40,259
outages and restart those services to to

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:42,659
recreate failed VMs to elastically scale

00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:44,939
out the nodes or scale in the nodes of a

00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:46,860
kubernetes cluster you also get the

00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:48,450
ability to do rolling upgrades with

00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,640
little to no downtime so if you want to

00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:52,350
go from one six six to one seven one of

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,229
kubernetes you can do that without

00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:56,850
having application outages I mentioned

00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:58,829
high availability before but also the

00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:00,930
ability to deploy clusters in multiple

00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:04,409
availability zones and isolate physical

00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:07,890
resources for individual clusters so

00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:09,300
this is a view a pictorial view of what

00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,450
we've got a couple of kubernetes

00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,200
clusters deployed with Bosch integrated

00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:16,050
with

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,940
Google cloud platform service broker so

00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:20,490
it allows you to leverage things like

00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:23,160
bigquery in your kubernetes applications

00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:26,160
it comes with an enterprise container

00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:28,950
registry built called project harbor

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,430
that was started by VMware I mentioned

00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:33,870
NSX is included in this you get the

00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:35,780
integration to the V realized suite of

00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:40,350
tools for things like logging and

00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:43,140
network management monitoring etc also

00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:45,690
integration to V Stan and basic storage

00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:47,400
policy in kubernetes so you can have an

00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:49,920
application that can decide they go they

00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,810
should go on a production storage or on

00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,200
development level storage that kind of

00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:55,410
thing

00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:58,230
so what is the difference between Kubo

00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:59,880
and PKS what's in PKS well you know you

00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:02,280
start with several open source products

00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,140
so you got Bosh you have a CPI or a

00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:07,020
cloud provider interface that gets you

00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:09,150
to the underlying vSphere platform we're

00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:11,520
including kubernetes we have a plug-in

00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:14,100
CNI plug-in to the networking so this is

00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:17,910
this is really cool what you get with

00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:21,180
PKS is you get NSX T you get this

00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:24,450
Enterprise register project Harbor you

00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:26,489
get the ability to deploy Kubo and to

00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:28,440
configure it to also configure

00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:31,980
underlying vSphere the networking

00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:34,650
resources and the registry you also get

00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:36,930
a new API that's on top of Bosh so it's

00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:39,840
specific to deploying kubernetes you'll

00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:41,910
get a CLI and API you'll get a UI with

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,640
this as well so now you can do something

00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:46,739
like PKS create cluster for instance and

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,100
and you get a kubernetes cluster to be

00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:49,100
deployed

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,690
there'll be our plants right now are two

00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,459
different packaging formats if you have

00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:58,320
PCF you're familiar with ops manager

00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:00,959
you'll get a tile for ops manager to do

00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:03,870
the deployment of PKS if you're a VMware

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:06,209
admin you'll get an OVA form-factor to

00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:09,180
do that deployment this is available

00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:10,920
through vmware pivotal and Dell EMC and

00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,480
whoever you buy it from you'll call them

00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,700
for support and we'll all work together

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,519
on the backend to support you this is

00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:20,160
available as a ga product at the end of

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,870
December this year so if you want to get

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,880
a deeper dive on this come by our booth

00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:26,939
I'll be there my colleague Nathan Ness

00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:28,919
is doing a 20-minute present

00:04:26,939 --> 00:04:32,450
tomorrow at 3:30 in this room if you'd

00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:35,420
like to see that as well thank you

00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:35,420
