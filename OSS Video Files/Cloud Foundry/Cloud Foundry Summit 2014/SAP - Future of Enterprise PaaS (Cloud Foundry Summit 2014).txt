Title: SAP - Future of Enterprise PaaS (Cloud Foundry Summit 2014)
Publication date: 2014-07-03
Playlist: Cloud Foundry Summit 2014
Description: 
	Keynote presented by Steve Winkler, Open Cloud Strategy at SAP; and Dirk Basenach, VP of Development at SAP.

There are many approaches to running enterprise applications in the cloud, and SAP has made a strategic choice to leverage the Open Source solution Cloud Foundry for this purpose. This presentation will provide details on SAP's approach to Open Source in the cloud, focusing on the PaaS layer and showing how Cloud Foundry can be used to extend existing SAP products and to develop entirely new enterprise applications. Moreover, the presentation will show how the SAP HANA in-memory platform and Cloud Foundry will come together to provide an enterprise-grade, real-time open platform in the cloud.

[Music]

00:00:08,389 --> 00:00:12,540
and I'm responsible for SATs open cloud

00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,910
strategy which means I'm responsible for

00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:17,310
our engagement in Cloud Foundry and an

00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:20,490
open stack so quick show hands who here

00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:23,130
knows si P okay so most everybody it

00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:24,449
kind of for those that don't it's a

00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,160
large enterprise software company that

00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:28,730
provides software to help businesses run

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,730
their business better

00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:32,730
that might sound simple but we have over

00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:35,670
two hundred thousand customers in over

00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:38,809
170 countries across 26 industries so

00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:41,040
it's not as easy as it sounds

00:00:38,809 --> 00:00:42,239
what we're here to do today is talk a

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,649
little bit about how we think the future

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,030
of enterprise pass is going to develop

00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:47,100
and how cloud foundry can help us

00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:51,480
provide those applications across the

00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:53,699
globe so the first thing we have to do

00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,289
as si P with this global outlook is look

00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:57,480
at what's happening across the world and

00:00:55,289 --> 00:01:00,390
one of the things that we see is this

00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:02,910
growing middle class and this middle

00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:04,559
class is going to create great new

00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:05,760
growth opportunities for our customers

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,680
but it's also going to place a

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,150
tremendous strain on resources both

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,810
natural resources like food and water

00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:15,630
but also public services healthcare etc

00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:17,280
as this middle class starts to grow they

00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:20,670
become more connected through social

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,810
networks also devices that are going to

00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:23,369
become more connected on the network

00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:24,890
like your refrigerator your washing

00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:27,479
machine even the clothes you wear

00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:29,880
through all of this interconnected kind

00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:32,610
of world there's going to be just this

00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:35,159
explosion in data and we're gonna need

00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:36,540
to use big data analytics to figure out

00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:39,990
how to unlock the hidden potential in

00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:41,520
that data the third thing is with mobile

00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:43,470
devices everybody is working differently

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,420
and untethered everywhere you can

00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:48,479
improve an expense report from the pool

00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,880
I know I did it on Sunday with my kids

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,000
and it just changes the way that people

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,320
work so we need to figure out how to

00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,570
rethink the future so that you can

00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,119
provide these business applications in

00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:02,490
real time and si P has been doing this

00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:04,649
for a while now we created sa P Hana and

00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:07,020
si P Hana is a way of collapsing the

00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:08,759
stack and creating highly efficient

00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:11,580
real-time data product processing

00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:15,030
business processes that used to take 30

00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:17,100
30 hours now take 30 seconds and enable

00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:18,600
you to really do your business in real

00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:21,330
time

00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:23,790
so to recap briefly we have these

00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:25,290
disruptive trends and technologies that

00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:26,610
are changing the way that business

00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:30,240
applications work for our both our

00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:31,860
customers and for us and what we need to

00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:34,290
do then is work with our partners across

00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,690
the globe to figure out how we can

00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:38,490
manage this change and create

00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:40,800
applications that are actually going to

00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:42,120
benefit our customers with our diverse

00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,860
needs and the way that we do that is

00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,350
with a process called design thinking

00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:48,090
design thinking as a way of creating an

00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:50,850
application that is both desirable

00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:52,410
feasible and viable I could spend a

00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:54,420
whole hour on that but I'm not going to

00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:57,450
the the point here is that we work with

00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:59,010
our partners to figure out how to make a

00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:01,320
product market fit for each of the apps

00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:03,990
and the new roles across all of the

00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:06,959
different the diverse needs of our

00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:09,209
customers finally we also work with our

00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:12,270
partners in a different way

00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:13,920
we work with our partners to actually

00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:16,320
develop the software components that

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:20,040
enable these applications to happen and

00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:21,600
this is why we're here today so when I

00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:24,090
started working on open source at s ap

00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,440
in 2005 it was forbidden

00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:27,269
you know don't drink it don't touch it

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,880
don't smell it certainly don't put it in

00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:32,459
product but we've changed our best

00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:34,890
practices now almost 180 degrees and now

00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:36,660
if there's a mature open-source product

00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:38,850
with a healthy ecosystem it's best

00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:43,230
practice to use it and avoid the not

00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:45,630
invented here mentality so we're now

00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:47,280
ready to take the next step and and

00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:50,400
we're that's why we're here today to

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:54,570
sponsor the Cloud Foundry Foundation as

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,830
a platinum sponsor and we really look

00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:57,750
forward to working with all of the other

00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:59,310
sponsors all of the ecosystem here to

00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:02,250
make Cloud Foundry an even bigger

00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:04,950
success and now I'm going to let Dirk up

00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:07,970
on stage to talk more about Hana and how

00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:12,269
cloud foundry and Hana can work together

00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:13,799
so thanks Steve you can hear me yeah so

00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:16,350
we thought 20 minute keynote

00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:17,820
presentation is pretty long so we wanted

00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:21,510
to split it up and have two presenters

00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:24,300
onstage I'm Dirk Posner I'm running the

00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:24,970
product management for SOPs application

00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,850
platforms

00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:30,820
where our platform as a service product

00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:32,590
as part of it because we are new kids on

00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:35,320
the block I thought it's it's

00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:37,630
interesting for you to give you just a

00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:39,760
short overview about the technologies

00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:42,760
that we are running tell you a little

00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:46,210
bit what we are doing in a cloud and how

00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:48,670
we want to engage with cloud foundry so

00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:50,770
now we come to a nice little software

00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:53,500
piece our Hana platform several years

00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:56,200
ago we saw a significant change in the

00:04:53,500 --> 00:05:00,090
hardware market so memory even on a

00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:02,590
large scale with several terabytes

00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:05,920
became available in an affordable way

00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:08,830
and on the other side lots of cores were

00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:11,800
sitting where on one plate which allowed

00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:13,690
massive parallel processing so that was

00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:17,020
a time where we started implementation

00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:19,060
of an in-memory database where all the

00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:22,290
operational data of a system is always

00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:25,270
kept in memory so we only use

00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:28,600
traditional databases for archiving or

00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:30,040
cold storage other than that the data is

00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,890
always accessible and memory and

00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:35,440
available we implemented a column based

00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:38,140
approach which gives the benefit

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:40,690
compared to row based database that you

00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:43,300
can reduce the data that you need to

00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:45,760
manage significantly taking our

00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:49,300
productive ERP system we were running SP

00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:52,210
as an example we had around seven

00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:54,940
terabyte of data in the system with a

00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:57,550
change to the Hana platform we now have

00:05:54,940 --> 00:06:01,210
less than 300 gigabyte running in a

00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:03,460
system as well with having all the data

00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:05,860
available in memory on the database

00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:08,860
layer we are able to push down the

00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:11,729
application logic near to the database

00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:13,690
layer and by that we achieve the

00:06:11,729 --> 00:06:16,270
significant performance improvement

00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:17,680
Steve mentioned where were buffering on

00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:20,200
the application layer if you have a

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,150
three-tier architecture data duplication

00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:26,050
is not necessary because you always

00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:29,350
operate on original data but Hana is not

00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:32,590
only database we have additional servers

00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:35,340
and engines as part of the platform for

00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:38,380
example geospatial engine routes engine

00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:40,850
text mining functionality is available

00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:43,070
analytical engines for predictive

00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:44,780
planning are really bad there as well so

00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:46,730
from that point of view is fair to say

00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:51,290
it's a complete application platform

00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:54,590
where can you put applications upon now

00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:56,840
looking at the cloud site starting on

00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:59,270
the on the left you see still we have of

00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:01,610
course a lot of customer that running

00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:04,340
our recipe systems in on-premise space

00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:06,410
some customers have our big ones have

00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:08,810
really complex system landscapes with

00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:12,770
several hundreds of systems they are

00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:17,030
managing two years ago we offered our

00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:20,120
customers to migrate their systems in

00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:22,220
our data centers to our data centers we

00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,690
together with the customer upgrade to

00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:26,510
the Hana database to the newest version

00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:28,880
that can benefit from this this platform

00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:30,979
and then we managed these systems for

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:34,729
our customers that's what we call manage

00:07:30,979 --> 00:07:36,740
cloud as a service as well since several

00:07:34,729 --> 00:07:38,320
years we offer a line of business

00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:40,610
applications which are true

00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:45,320
software-as-a-service applications in

00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:47,930
different areas HRR CRM fine and supply

00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:50,300
chain management with our Rheba solution

00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:53,539
but as well more kind of social stuff

00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:55,789
with our gem solution and in the middle

00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:58,669
we have our development platform which

00:07:55,789 --> 00:08:00,770
we call the Hana cloud platform which is

00:07:58,669 --> 00:08:03,050
a platform as a service solution that

00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:05,180
follows open standards so we offer there

00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:07,669
java technology and javascript

00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:10,070
technology to implement applications

00:08:07,669 --> 00:08:12,260
either new from scratch so we see a lot

00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:15,440
of interest from our customers in the

00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:17,960
area of Internet of Things to manage

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,510
device thousands of devices that need to

00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:23,419
connect to a cloud solution but as well

00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:25,370
what we see very often is customers come

00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:27,229
to us and say look we have to innovate

00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:29,900
we have to bring new applications to our

00:08:27,229 --> 00:08:31,900
users but we don't we want to touch our

00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:34,969
system landscape as less as possible

00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:37,640
because those upgrades mean always a lot

00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:40,700
of work and testing so with the cloud

00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:43,580
approach that's a very nice approach to

00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:45,410
solve this this problem the customer

00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:47,180
just open maps the API in your

00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:48,920
on-premise landscape and new

00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:50,690
applications are built on top of our

00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:53,300
Hana cloud platform

00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:56,750
they can innovate much faster on this

00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:59,270
platform bring new versions every

00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:01,070
several weeks or even days just develop

00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:02,930
it test it and activate it and it's

00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:05,180
available for the users so now to Cloud

00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:08,300
Foundry so with all the sponsors and the

00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:10,550
contributors we see we think Cloud

00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:12,290
Foundry has really a good chance to

00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:14,270
become the de facto standard of a

00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:16,460
platform as a service offering and

00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:19,160
that's of course something we want to

00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:22,790
benefit from from the SP as well we

00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:25,040
wanna use Cloud Foundry to not only

00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:26,930
deploy our platform in a public cloud

00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:30,590
environment possible but as well deploy

00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:33,770
via cloud foundry a platform on a

00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:36,200
private private cloud or even the data

00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:39,530
centers of the partners or customers

00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:41,810
going forward and we see of course a lot

00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:43,970
of interest in the community cloud from

00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:45,560
which Tech is growing step by step where

00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:49,040
we want to contribute a benefit of

00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:50,450
course upon as well on the other side as

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,240
Steve mentioned we are working with a

00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:55,910
lot of partners we have a big ecosystem

00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:57,800
for example we have for Hana we have a

00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:59,770
startup program where even very small

00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:02,120
companies start building new

00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:05,210
applications on Hana we have 1500

00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:07,730
partners startups now in this program so

00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:09,290
we think we can attract those partners

00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:14,180
to the Cloud Foundry staggers while

00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:16,520
going forward what do we want to

00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:18,680
contribute as the next steps we are

00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:22,070
running cloud applications since almost

00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:24,170
10 years our customers are running these

00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:27,020
solutions globally in different industry

00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:30,470
different countries with lots of ladies

00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:33,710
Jaidev or regular later requirements

00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:36,230
they have there they have a high demand

00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:38,270
for management of this solution for

00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:41,030
availability of the solution so that's

00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:43,430
something we think we can bring value

00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:46,610
into the community with our experience

00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:49,760
we have in this section we will deploy a

00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:52,850
cloud foundry in our SP datacenter step

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:55,730
by step and as a next step as I said

00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:58,880
provide cloud foundry a cloud foundry

00:10:55,730 --> 00:11:01,790
stack to our partners in other data

00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,740
centers as well and finally of course we

00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:06,200
want to contribute our key technologies

00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:08,830
to the stack but an implicit integration

00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:13,610
of our components that they can be used

00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:15,430
out of the out of CloudFront way one key

00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:18,140
component of course is our Hana platform

00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:20,600
we already have available a service

00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:23,270
prokhor we are version working on

00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,410
version 2 currently to overcome some

00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:29,590
restrictions the current implementation

00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:32,570
has we implemented an OGS driver

00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:34,850
database driver for Hana that we open

00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:36,890
sourced and github and that can be

00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:39,020
freely used and currently working on

00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:42,110
Google rates active record

00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:44,000
implementation for Hana as well so from

00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:46,550
that you see as well we want to open up

00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,610
to new technology stacks like note and

00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:52,810
Ruby and make it available in the SP

00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:55,310
platform as-a-service approach as well

00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:58,040
finally the high-level picture that we

00:11:55,310 --> 00:12:00,500
are targeting it is on the bottom you

00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:02,570
see the cloud infrastructure and we are

00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:05,120
committed to align our cloud

00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:08,540
infrastructure and OpenStack technology

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:10,730
and with that being able to be more open

00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:13,460
to run on any kind of data centers in

00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:15,530
the future we still of course will have

00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:17,960
available our Hana technology in Hana

00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:21,050
platform and the services we implemented

00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:23,060
in our Hana Club that from today and we

00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:25,730
will make available a cloud server Cloud

00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:29,090
Foundry services to our platform

00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:30,650
offering as well one example I want to

00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:32,440
mention and there will be a session

00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:34,760
tomorrow from the hypest felix as well

00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:37,970
hybrids is the e-commerce product we

00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:40,580
have an SI p we have our customers are

00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:42,500
running modern two and a half thousand

00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:44,530
stores currently with the solution in

00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:47,360
over 40 countries

00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:50,420
one of the biggest wholesale distributor

00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:53,450
runs 500,000 orders per day on the

00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:55,370
solution the hyper steam started to

00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:57,290
implement a commerce as a service

00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:59,750
product that natively sits on Cloud

00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:01,880
Foundry this will be one of our first

00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:04,190
proof points that we mean it's serious

00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:07,670
with Cloud Foundry when we deliver the

00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:09,230
solution pretty soon so and there will

00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:12,080
be gained a lot of experience in the

00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:13,820
Cloud Foundry environment as well so

00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,560
with that I want to thank you if you

00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:16,100
have more questions there's a booth on

00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,170
this

00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:21,730
site where we can have a talk later on

00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:21,730
and thank you for attention

00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:26,919
[Applause]
