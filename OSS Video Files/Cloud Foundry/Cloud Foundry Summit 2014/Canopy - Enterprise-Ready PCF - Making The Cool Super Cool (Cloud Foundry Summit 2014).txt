00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,480
says it says on the slide I'm going to

00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:14,670
introduce a product today that we've

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,960
announced called canopy calc fabric

00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:20,609
obviously powered by Cloud Foundry so as

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,619
it says there on part the sales teams

00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:26,269
hopefully it's not a sales pitch but

00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:29,010
hopefully we can get our messages across

00:00:26,269 --> 00:00:29,880
so just in case nobody's ever heard

00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:33,420
about it

00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:35,309
canopy is formed from a couple of the

00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,610
big IT organizations out there from

00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:40,410
VMware EMC them from a tour so really

00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:42,450
the focus is on end-to-end cloud

00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:44,129
services for the enterprise so what I'm

00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,980
going to talk to you about is is that

00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:51,480
play from a pivotal Cloud Foundry

00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:53,280
perspective so as as I was introduced

00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,829
really this is about how excited we are

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,870
now to be part of the community part of

00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:59,520
the foundation we went out for dinner

00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:01,379
last night it was great to start meeting

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,690
and contributing to the discussion

00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:05,700
around Cloud Foundry and the adoption of

00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:06,990
cloud foundry in the enterprise so we're

00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,490
really excited about that we've

00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,619
hopefully tweeted about that and

00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:12,090
everybody's aware and but also we're

00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:14,369
going to talk about the first release of

00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:15,570
our cloud fabric product and as we've

00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:18,689
heard from a number of the other

00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:20,990
presenters how exciting it is as a piece

00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:23,490
of technology but how difficult it is to

00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:26,100
to consume that in the enterprise so

00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:28,170
really that's our our space right we

00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:32,430
want to start to help people with the

00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:35,220
consumption of those things so cloud

00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:37,259
fabric is PCF so it's pivotal Cloud

00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,240
Foundry it's the commercial version of

00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:42,060
cloud foundry but we deliver that and

00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:45,420
own it for you so everything you need is

00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:47,340
provided by us and managed by us and so

00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,340
we've got as it says after the plus it's

00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:52,290
about the value add about you know we

00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,689
deliver it to you in the mode that those

00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:56,850
things are need needed in the locations

00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:58,950
whether it's in your data center or our

00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:00,869
data centers you know do you need the

00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:03,600
app service and the data services that

00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:05,250
exist today natively within PCF or do

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,020
you need more you know we have some

00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:09,060
consultancy professional services where

00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:11,270
we can start to build those things with

00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,270
you

00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:16,510
so just going to a few of those things

00:02:14,049 --> 00:02:18,639
in in a bit more detail so as it says

00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:20,859
this is delivered how you need it right

00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:22,359
whether whether you need it in multi

00:02:20,859 --> 00:02:24,879
tenant based on some shared

00:02:22,359 --> 00:02:26,799
infrastructure with shared PCs whether

00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,750
you need it virtual private so shared

00:02:26,799 --> 00:02:32,379
infrastructure but with dedicated

00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:34,180
ring-fenced instances of PCs and all you

00:02:32,379 --> 00:02:37,959
need it totally dedicated dedicated

00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:40,450
Hardware and dedicated pcs but in your

00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:42,669
data center or our data center thing the

00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:44,709
key thing here is it's all provided by

00:02:42,669 --> 00:02:46,950
us right so you haven't got to go and

00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:49,480
deploy go and buy the licenses or go in

00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:51,129
install that yourself you can come to us

00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,900
and we can do those things for you right

00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:55,930
so we're just trying to make it as easy

00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:58,419
as possible so where do you need those

00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:59,829
things right so you know we're focused

00:02:58,419 --> 00:03:02,250
low belly canopy is a global

00:02:59,829 --> 00:03:05,109
organization right so we created some

00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:08,260
geographic hubs from data centers around

00:03:05,109 --> 00:03:10,239
the world specifically here within the

00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:12,760
European Union in the North America and

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:15,310
within Singapore that's the strange map

00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,079
there is Singapore and so all of our

00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:18,669
shared infrastructure is based in those

00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:20,739
locations but you know we're building

00:03:18,669 --> 00:03:22,329
out from there right so that's just the

00:03:20,739 --> 00:03:25,829
beginning we're going to partner with

00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:28,329
some of the other VMware hybrid cloud

00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:30,009
service providers to build out more data

00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:32,769
centers so we can get more geographic

00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:34,209
reach with those things but also on the

00:03:32,769 --> 00:03:36,159
other side if you need it private then

00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:38,949
obviously we can just deploy it and we

00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:41,349
use some of our parent tools to do that

00:03:38,949 --> 00:03:43,060
put them products so based on the Vblock

00:03:41,349 --> 00:03:45,310
technologies we deploy you a dedicated

00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:47,139
PCF instance within your data center

00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:49,239
have that managed by us or have it

00:03:47,139 --> 00:03:51,810
unmanaged by so that the choices he's

00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:51,810
simply yours

00:03:52,409 --> 00:03:57,370
so we're also talking about the data

00:03:55,329 --> 00:03:59,019
services so you know with peripheral

00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:00,819
Cloud Foundry you get a number of data

00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:02,919
services that are readily available to

00:04:00,819 --> 00:04:04,389
you whether it's brokered through app

00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:06,069
direct or whether it's some data

00:04:04,389 --> 00:04:08,049
services that we've provided we've

00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:09,819
written with you or the app services

00:04:08,049 --> 00:04:11,739
whether there are a color or sequel

00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:14,109
server through the user defined services

00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:15,759
you know some enterprises want to manage

00:04:14,109 --> 00:04:18,219
those things themselves but we want to

00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:20,349
manage them as well so if that's part of

00:04:18,219 --> 00:04:22,180
what you're trying to gain from these

00:04:20,349 --> 00:04:24,270
things you want us to manage those you

00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:26,430
want us to provide the DBA functions you

00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:27,840
asked to provide that against the asset

00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:29,639
service level you know whether that's

00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,770
performance service levels are just

00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:32,970
availability service levels then and

00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:36,930
clearly that's something we can do as

00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:38,639
well right so as a whole what we're

00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:40,770
talking about here is that cloud fabric

00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,569
provides the ecosystem of complimentary

00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:44,940
services that enables the enterprise to

00:04:42,569 --> 00:04:47,039
adopt some of these cool technologies

00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:49,500
right we've talked about the complexity

00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:51,330
so we want to create a means in which

00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,639
the enterprise can start to consume

00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:55,830
those things as simply and as easily as

00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:57,330
possible so we've talked about the

00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:59,550
platform's we talked about having in the

00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:01,229
right place in the right mode in with

00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:04,680
the right number of data services or

00:05:01,229 --> 00:05:07,020
application services provided but also

00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,340
we want to talk about supports right so

00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:11,130
on the left hand side there the fact

00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:12,690
that you know we do want to have people

00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:14,250
at the backend that can provide the

00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:16,740
support for those things not just about

00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:18,210
the PCF product itself but the the way

00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:20,569
that that's been delivered for you as a

00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:23,460
customer so all of that needs to be

00:05:20,569 --> 00:05:25,169
supported by app and maybe you want some

00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,490
applications support right maybe you've

00:05:25,169 --> 00:05:28,229
deployed the application but you'd

00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:29,759
actually like someone else to to now

00:05:28,229 --> 00:05:32,759
manage that for you from an on game

00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,469
support perspective so from professional

00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:37,349
services and I'd like to shout out to

00:05:34,469 --> 00:05:39,840
the cloud credo guys who have been

00:05:37,349 --> 00:05:41,729
helping us to build out some of the al

00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,590
PCF customization and actually the

00:05:41,729 --> 00:05:45,569
deployment and so as part of that

00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:48,120
community you know we're sort of working

00:05:45,569 --> 00:05:51,569
with those guys and continue to work

00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:53,039
with those guys to work on how do we

00:05:51,569 --> 00:05:54,630
customize that how do we make the

00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:58,289
deployment of those things as easy as

00:05:54,630 --> 00:06:00,120
easy as possible but also customers are

00:05:58,289 --> 00:06:02,610
you know our customers are generally

00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:05,430
legacy enterprise businesses who are

00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:07,469
struggling to understand how and in

00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:10,349
which sequence today they start to

00:06:07,469 --> 00:06:12,659
consume PCF so we've got a bunch of

00:06:10,349 --> 00:06:14,610
application modernization services that

00:06:12,659 --> 00:06:16,289
look at the estate today look at the

00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:18,419
low-hanging fruit look at the sequence

00:06:16,289 --> 00:06:20,340
of which we would look to migrate so are

00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:21,449
those applications and then help the

00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:25,050
customers build those to that

00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:26,849
transformation plan or application

00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:29,250
development right if they've got PCF and

00:06:26,849 --> 00:06:31,770
they want to start to can leverage that

00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:33,839
but they simply need some help from with

00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:36,000
specialized PCF base development

00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:37,639
knowledge and then we've got a bunch of

00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,020
guys that can do that as well

00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:41,780
and in moving on to management right

00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:44,300
enterprises expect three four nine five

00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:46,430
nines availability that expects a single

00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:48,500
point of contact that expects a service

00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:50,270
desk that's multi-channel multilingual

00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,229
and they want to know that in the middle

00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:52,610
of the night when something's gone wrong

00:06:51,229 --> 00:06:54,500
that they can ring somebody and

00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:56,090
someone's managing it so that's so

00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:58,159
that's a really key thing that the

00:06:56,090 --> 00:07:01,520
canopy wants to bring to this this

00:06:58,159 --> 00:07:03,379
foundation is community but also looking

00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,210
at the pricing of these things so I

00:07:03,379 --> 00:07:07,310
think pivotal will accept that maybe

00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:08,000
some of the pricing around PCF isn't as

00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:10,279
cloud-like

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,020
as it should be so we're working with

00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:14,090
them now with our experience of doing

00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:16,819
this in a number of other different sort

00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:18,979
of cloud offerings to try and make that

00:07:16,819 --> 00:07:26,840
a more easily consumable pay-as-you-go

00:07:18,979 --> 00:07:28,279
model right so really what I want to

00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,870
focus on this slide this is my last

00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:31,819
slide right so it's not too much pain

00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:33,590
left to go through so really what I

00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:35,900
focus is we're part of the foundation

00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:37,879
we're part of that community now we want

00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:39,830
to make the community start to work so

00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:41,930
with our skin in the game is we've got

00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:44,210
an early adopter program this is a free

00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:46,159
service we'd love you to sign up in the
