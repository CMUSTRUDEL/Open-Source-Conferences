00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:13,080
so I think one of the the great

00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,519
privileges before we get started of this

00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,310
conference to me is that we've got such

00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:19,320
a great ecosystem of other vendors who

00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:21,090
are supporting this we've had an amazing

00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,890
set of technical talks this morning and

00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:24,539
then I think the enterprises that are

00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,880
participating we're really privileged to

00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:29,010
have the leadership of the

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,019
platform-as-a-service sections of B&Y

00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:33,120
here today as well as the infrastructure

00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:35,219
engineering these senior leaders on

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,739
stage to share with our community I

00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:39,300
think that's really special so starting

00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:41,340
off with David I a question for you

00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,570
maybe tell the room a little bit about

00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,670
the history of platform-as-a-service

00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:46,350
that the enterprise that is Bank of New

00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:47,340
York and your involvement in it and

00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:49,230
where it's been

00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,000
yeah so we're actually on our third

00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:53,850
generation of platform-as-a-service

00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,710
technology we started out with utility

00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:57,629
computing in the mid 90s you know some

00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:00,210
of the stuff that talked about in video

00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:03,030
we actually developed a first online

00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:05,519
brokerage systems using utility

00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:07,260
computing models you know believe it or

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,450
not offered on CompuServe Prodigy and

00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:12,869
AOL and then when the internet came out

00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:15,570
we trans we transitioned that DLJ direct

00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:17,970
and CFCs ABI direct we've heard some of

00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:20,549
those brands that that technology was

00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:22,290
all utility computing developers weren't

00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:23,610
provisioning machines they weren't

00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,140
building out infrastructure they were

00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:27,840
deploying applications to a stack and

00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:30,090
building reusable services and around

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,460
2001 we transitioned that to a Java

00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,869
based path and we've been been building

00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,460
that for the last 10 years

00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:37,799
we built a lot of great DevOps

00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:39,600
capabilities into that and you know

00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:41,570
about two years ago we decided to

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,579
convert that to open-source so we

00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:47,729
selected our own stack for paths and

00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:49,470
build out a path infrastructure and you

00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:50,880
know Swami's helped out with the

00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:52,950
infrastructure side of that so he'll be

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,259
talking about his part of that mission

00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:57,390
but I think you know we collectively

00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:59,159
delivered that platform and into

00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:00,689
production in the middle of last year we

00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:02,219
got no that plan was called bxp

00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:04,770
yeah that's called exp we've got about a

00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:06,719
hundred apps running on it maybe ten

00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:09,690
fifteen thousand users a day several

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:11,760
million transaction requests and you

00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,840
know we're aggressively migrating all of

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,620
our Java workloads to

00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:18,540
platform so you know we we started

00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:20,879
talking pivotal a couple months ago and

00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:22,769
you know liked what we saw about Cloud

00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,450
Foundry so we just joined the foundation

00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:26,069
and we're we're looking forward to

00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:28,560
getting to digging in and figuring out

00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:30,480
how it applies into our strategy yeah I

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,860
mean so for folks that may have not have

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,450
already heard hopefully have Bank of New

00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,830
York is a gold member of the coming

00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:37,440
Cloud Foundry foundation I think it's

00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:38,819
hyper critical that we have Enterprise

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,650
is also at the table with their

00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:42,390
requirements Cloud Foundry is an

00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:44,190
enterprise focused platform as-a-service

00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:46,980
Swamy maybe you want to talk a little

00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:48,630
bit about how you met pivotal we kind of

00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:50,069
how we came in and coordinated avis just

00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:52,049
a little bit of the history of how we

00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:53,910
first met and you know your thoughts on

00:02:52,049 --> 00:02:55,950
you know the transition to working with

00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:57,780
us a little bit and how that went right

00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:59,610
you know thank you Jim first of all

00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,680
thanks for having us you know yesterday

00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:05,160
I had I heard a talk which basically

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:08,489
said that infrastructure or OpenStack

00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:11,160
and Cloud Foundry is marriage made in

00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:11,610
heaven and I was thinking about it this

00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,819
morning

00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:16,859
in fact Dave Lewis platform as a service

00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:18,450
and infrastructure engineering is kind

00:03:16,859 --> 00:03:20,400
of like the marriage made in heaven for

00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:22,319
be Andrew Mellon when we started the

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,069
journey three years ago but I'm sure

00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:27,480
both of us have better looking exposes

00:03:25,069 --> 00:03:28,829
so we started this journey about three

00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,579
years ago where we build this platform

00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:31,980
as-a-service

00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:34,139
and yesterday we talked a lot about how

00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:35,819
it's all about developers when we

00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:37,470
started this journey we basically said

00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:39,750
that it's not necessarily about

00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:42,780
developers but it also about you know

00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:45,109
operation staff and about the risk and

00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:48,329
when we did the business case for cloud

00:03:45,109 --> 00:03:51,870
we basically said that giving developers

00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:53,849
a machine is not good enough because the

00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:56,400
reason why we wanted to do the cloud it

00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:58,200
as much as we liked the developers we

00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,590
don't want the developers to call us or

00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:03,359
depend on us so we from get-go built

00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:06,540
platform as a service so that it's kind

00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:08,099
of one stack up and down so much like we

00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:10,410
go to the doctor's every year for

00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:12,900
physicals you know we basically do is do

00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:14,519
an external company come in and check

00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,620
out implementation to make sure that we

00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:18,720
have covered all the bases so when we

00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:21,539
saw the buzz around cloud foundry we

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,130
basically thought you know pivotal would

00:04:21,539 --> 00:04:24,450
be the right company to kind of give an

00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:26,470
assessment of where we're doing

00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:28,240
that's when corneal RDS came in

00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:29,620
and did an assessment and that's when we

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,720
basically said that okay we know what

00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:33,550
we're doing and and we know the roadmap

00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,410
of what cloud foundry is and then we

00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:37,060
wanted to kind of be a gold member yeah

00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,840
and be part of the foundation yeah I

00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,940
think one of the things I've been

00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,350
inspired by working with the Bank of New

00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:42,820
York leadership is that a lot of the

00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:44,140
things we think about from a platforms

00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:46,000
of service perspective they'd already

00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:47,770
thought about so David and I had a I

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,390
think a great whiteboard session one

00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:50,950
morning in New York and it was sort of

00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:52,360
like an immediate mind meld because they

00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:54,340
were thinking about the same platform

00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,110
concerns already so it wasn't like we

00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:58,390
had to go in and you know convince them

00:04:56,110 --> 00:05:00,190
about why paths and I think that's

00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:02,290
what's made this so great and maybe Dave

00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:05,440
you want to share some of the the

00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:07,780
reasons why paths and the challenges

00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,980
that you solve with the XP and kind of

00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:11,260
what you'd already accomplished when we

00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:12,850
got there if you want to detail also so

00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:14,740
one of the things that beamline Mellon

00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:15,940
is in the in the process of doing is

00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:18,180
we've got a strategy called a

00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:20,470
digitization strategy where we're really

00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:21,730
transforming our whole organization and

00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:25,060
I think you know what Swami mentioned

00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:27,130
about the developers and you know when

00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:29,200
we're looking at you know you used to be

00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:31,330
financial services drove the technology

00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:33,600
agenda you know we were putting all the

00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:35,770
money into technology all the vendors

00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,300
you know we're funding a lot of the

00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:39,790
innovation and technology now it's

00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:42,669
consumer businesses that are driving the

00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:44,740
technology agenda and you know we've

00:05:42,669 --> 00:05:49,419
really made a very conscious in the over

00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:52,860
decision to adopt that mission convert

00:05:49,419 --> 00:05:56,710
strong lead open source and you know

00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:58,990
establish an ecosystem that allows us to

00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:01,870
provide consumer great client experience

00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:03,790
and deliver our world-class financial

00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:07,630
services and a really comprehensive way

00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:09,850
to an even larger audience so passes

00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:11,260
critical component of that because you

00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:13,870
know for all the reasons that we've

00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:16,090
heard a lot last couple of days but you

00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:18,070
know I think the thing that we were able

00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:19,840
to leverage is you know we've been doing

00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:21,880
this for about 10 years we've done a lot

00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,710
of you know we've discovered a lot of

00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,810
things about how you can and can't run

00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:28,600
large infrastructure we've got about

00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:31,330
2,000 JVMs running in our so you you

00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:34,030
also have people been talking about 100

00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:35,380
200 you have 2,000 already running in

00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:36,940
your plot that's in our second

00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:38,480
generation pass we just crossed the

00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:41,630
5,000 VM

00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:44,960
on our production cloud in our new

00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:46,850
third-generation environment so we've

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,280
actually got you know across the

00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:51,770
organization probably 3,500 jaebeum's

00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:54,350
running in our production path second

00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:55,550
and third generation and collaborating

00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:58,250
you know we're sharing services between

00:06:55,550 --> 00:07:01,070
the two so you know we've got a you know

00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:03,170
we have very small team we believe team

00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:05,660
were maybe 10 people yep running the

00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:07,670
second generation paths for mm en so

00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:09,710
that's a real testament to a lot of the

00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:11,690
DevOps capabilities we built into that

00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:13,460
infrastructure and I think you know

00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:14,780
we're looking at Cloud Foundry and had

00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:17,210
the conversation with you I think that's

00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:18,500
really where both where we're seeing a

00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:20,150
lot of things we like in the sack and

00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:22,970
also things we can bring to the table

00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:24,410
and be a real contributor to the

00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:26,170
environment yeah I think that's that's

00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:28,610
really important this is this is not a

00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:29,930
just a you know transaction between the

00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:31,580
two of us where somehow they say hey

00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:32,990
whatever you've got and you know Swami

00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:34,520
you've talked about how open-source is

00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:36,350
important both the infrastructure layer

00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,370
and the platform layer maybe you want to

00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:39,200
talk a little bit about how you think

00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:41,540
about open and you're in your cloud

00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:43,760
services right I mean like I said as

00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:46,010
much as we like the developers and

00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:48,410
operations staff we had to generate the

00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:50,540
business case for what we need to do so

00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:52,400
from the get-go our platform as a

00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:54,650
service is built with the OpenStack

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,050
components but some portions of the

00:07:54,650 --> 00:08:00,110
technology was not mature at the time so

00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:03,560
we have a third party you know cloud

00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:04,790
broker that we have and over time you

00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,400
know we'll be replacing that with

00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:09,230
another OpenStack components got it so

00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:12,890
OpenStack is also a big bet absolutely

00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:15,950
and why call services team you know that

00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:18,560
one thing I want to mention is we nobody

00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:20,480
should do cloud for the cloud stake you

00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,150
know you have to think about what is the

00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:24,890
business case for the cloud and where is

00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:26,870
the bottom line what is the impact to

00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:30,170
the bottom line for your organization so

00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:31,880
what we noticed is you know everybody

00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:34,610
has been virtualizing for quite some

00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:36,860
time but virtualization is almost like

00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:39,020
taking your physical machine and doing

00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:40,550
you know what I call a space division

00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:43,760
multiplexing you're cutting that into

00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:45,770
multiple slices with cloud we were able

00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,510
to do time division multiplexing as the

00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:50,000
workload comes in we could elastically

00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:51,410
expand and now with cloud foundry and

00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,680
some of the innovation that we are

00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:54,089
seeing with docker we

00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,890
an active squeeze a lot more in

00:08:54,089 --> 00:08:57,510
infrastructure so that we can get a lot

00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:59,460
more efficiencies from the data center

00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:01,200
and hence reducing the costs and

00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:02,730
improving the efficiency so maybe you

00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,740
want to touch on a little bit like what

00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:06,300
you see in Cloud Foundry today what are

00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:08,250
some of the early wins that maybe you

00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:11,430
think we can collaborate on as a

00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:14,160
community and and kind of the early

00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:16,709
promise of Cloud Foundry be and why yeah

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,380
definitely the reason the primary reason

00:09:16,709 --> 00:09:21,390
why we are part of the Cloud Foundry is

00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:23,940
like many people mentioned enterprises

00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:26,040
don't like the vendor lock-in you know

00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:27,690
you know we want to kind of make sure

00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,899
that you know pivotal and Cloud Foundry

00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:32,310
is harnessed in kind of making sure that

00:09:29,899 --> 00:09:34,740
whatever Cloud Foundry does is

00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:37,080
enterprise friendly that is really the

00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:38,670
our main driver and we hope to

00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,800
participate in the governance of it as

00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:42,480
much as the foundry allows us to do and

00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,300
also drive the standards and the

00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,950
openness of our Cloud Foundry

00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:50,640
so David any any thoughts on that yeah

00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:53,339
you know I think one of the things you

00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,350
know I think we're one of the things

00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:59,160
we're working on is really driving

00:09:55,350 --> 00:10:00,870
automation and you know integration with

00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:03,750
the full stack of infrastructure into

00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:05,010
our into our paths and I think you know

00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:06,720
one of the things that we're looking at

00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:09,570
one things we like about Cloud Foundry

00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:13,020
is the Boche abstraction layer and the

00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:14,580
ability to you know give us a starting

00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,900
point where we can start to pick and

00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,459
choose the things we want to do with

00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:19,320
Cloud Foundry you know I think one of

00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:21,270
the things actually I think is really

00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:23,760
exciting about Cloud Foundry is we just

00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:26,160
saw the Diego yeah presentation you know

00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,810
I think you know given the scale that we

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,720
operate on our environment you know I

00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:32,400
think operating at that scale there's a

00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,230
lot of challenges keeping stuff running

00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,370
and I think you know I think some of the

00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:37,079
stuff that he pointed out in the

00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:38,310
presentation is the same kind of thing

00:10:37,079 --> 00:10:41,370
it's like why isn't that running you

00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:44,670
know yeah and I think having a really

00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:46,890
solid strategy and design around that

00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:48,480
kind of stuff I think that's that really

00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:50,399
goes a step beyond what I think we've

00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,140
been able to accomplish and that's a

00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:56,850
pretty exciting development of something

00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:58,620
that that we want to so basically one of

00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:00,089
the things that we have in our current

00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:03,720
platform as-a-service

00:11:00,089 --> 00:11:05,670
is a notion of a partition so what we

00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,240
are talking to the foundry member says

00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:07,920
how do we

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,720
some of the code that we have developed

00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,550
and you know what does it take for an

00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,529
enterprise and we have not we never

00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:14,820
contributed to open source we want to

00:11:13,529 --> 00:11:16,560
see what does it take to kind of

00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:18,060
contribute to open source and take that

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,950
partition some of our architects have

00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:22,050
develop and see how we can add to the

00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:22,920
foundation as well yeah I mean just just

00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:25,080
sitting here it's a pretty interesting

00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:26,940
moment in history right we've got you

00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:28,680
know David the leader of platform at a

00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:31,410
big Enterprise like B&Y it's talking

00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:33,240
about an algorithm distributing

00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:34,529
application workload across you know

00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,899
hundreds of you know hundreds or

00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:38,790
thousands of virtual machines

00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:40,230
autonomously it's a very big departure

00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:44,100
from kind of some of the older world of

00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:45,959
like very VM centric stamp out etc and

00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:47,250
it's kind of nice to know the ancien

00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:48,450
team are there thinking about that

00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:50,490
distributed algorithm for you

00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:51,660
potentially so I think that's an

00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:53,339
interesting moment and kind of open

00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:55,260
source in the enterprise it just may be

00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:56,670
worth noting maybe you want to talk a

00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:58,709
little bit Ellis about you know being

00:11:56,670 --> 00:12:00,209
wise very dedicated to innovation you've

00:11:58,709 --> 00:12:01,380
been leading this platforms of service

00:12:00,209 --> 00:12:02,850
for years

00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:05,100
you're also opening up a Silicon Valley

00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:06,570
office how is that important - how you

00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,649
know enterprises are innovating today

00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:09,630
with kind of the modern software

00:12:07,649 --> 00:12:11,970
development ethos agile some of these

00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:14,010
trends yeah I think there's a couple of

00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:16,589
aspects to that one is you know I think

00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:18,149
we as an organization you know when we

00:12:16,589 --> 00:12:20,790
look at our next generation pass

00:12:18,149 --> 00:12:22,740
platform you know it's not just the

00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:24,450
technology it's the whole organization

00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:26,640
we want to transform the way developers

00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:28,770
work right we're changing the way we

00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:30,570
configure the floorspace and our offices

00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:33,600
I mean it's really like the pivotal labs

00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:35,339
kind of everyone in collaborate rapidly

00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,810
yeah we've gotten we've got labs already

00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:38,820
in our indie offices and we're building

00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:41,399
out in our US offices as well those

00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:45,200
spaces and I think you know my mission

00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:45,200
when we talk about our platform is

00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:49,890
converting the way developers work the

00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,290
tools they use the way we integrate with

00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:54,959
our infrastructure our carrot edge

00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:56,730
services it's a complete transformation

00:12:54,959 --> 00:13:02,160
of how we're building software and I

00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:05,190
think the the other thing is you know I

00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:08,220
think getting that mindset change so

00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:11,790
that we can be more agile to assemble

00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:13,620
you know capabilities for our clients

00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:15,510
because you know it's really at the end

00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:17,820
of the day you know in addition to some

00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:18,920
of the cost savings it's really

00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,450
transforming how we do

00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:23,510
over business to our clients you know

00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:27,260
that and that's that's really our

00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:29,029
mission is to give world-class consumer

00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:31,010
great experience to our clients using

00:13:29,029 --> 00:13:33,380
latest technologies I think what the lab

00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:36,589
is gonna allow us to do you know given

00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:38,810
the focus of you know with consumer IT

00:13:36,589 --> 00:13:41,570
driving the technology agenda and the

00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:43,880
innovation and really our emphasis on

00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:46,820
leveraging open source technology it's

00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:48,589
critical for us to have a presence where

00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:51,320
that stuff is built you know be where

00:13:48,589 --> 00:13:55,279
the sausage is made and I get a deep

00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:59,170
collaboration going with the with the

00:13:55,279 --> 00:14:01,279
local ecosystem so I think you know both

00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:03,800
influencing our culture as well as

00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:05,209
helping accelerate our strategy and our

00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,920
agenda that's that's really what we're

00:14:05,209 --> 00:14:08,449
looking for and I've seen this as a you

00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,800
know across the enterprise as I speak

00:14:08,449 --> 00:14:11,720
with you know every day is that they're

00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:13,550
looking at agility transformation

00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:15,380
staffing transformations and platform

00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:17,959
transformations kind of us all one big

00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:20,209
net new platform that they're solving

00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:21,949
for how does that affect you on the

00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:23,899
infrastructure side and operations and

00:14:21,949 --> 00:14:27,170
his operations going undergoing a

00:14:23,899 --> 00:14:30,500
Regenesis of how they think about their

00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:34,370
jobs today that's a good question

00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:35,839
you know agility has been there agile

00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:38,240
programming has been there for quite

00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:40,760
some time I'd say a gel programming is

00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:43,459
not new but what work what we are seeing

00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:45,560
is in the past these agile development

00:14:43,459 --> 00:14:48,190
and development methodologies are

00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:52,100
running on the traditional waterfall

00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:54,680
infrastructure pieces so right now with

00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:56,990
the cloud and infrastructure as a

00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:58,870
service and automation you can actually

00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:01,370
have the developers have agile

00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:03,769
development approach and have the

00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:06,079
underlying infrastructure also built in

00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:07,670
an agile manner that's to us is a

00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:10,370
biggest shift so that we can actually

00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:12,350
show our agility on the application side

00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:13,850
on the infrastructure side and give

00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:15,470
better value to the businesses that we

00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:17,540
serve so that we can innovate better

00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:19,639
look at response our client services

00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:21,769
request better yeah so this this

00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:23,630
definitely affects both platform and

00:15:21,769 --> 00:15:24,670
operations and I think a pretty profound

00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:27,040
way right

00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:29,080
right right you know maybe you know

00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,580
we've got a couple minutes left what are

00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,530
the things that you think are hard about

00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:35,140
enterprise paths that the community

00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:38,130
needs to get right to make this work in

00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:42,280
an enterprise context yeah I think for

00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:45,190
for us you know the biggest struggle is

00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:46,930
you know when you look in you know and I

00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:49,390
think it's across the entire

00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:51,100
organization it's a completely different

00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:52,900
way of thinking about software and that

00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:55,270
includes you know the big one for us is

00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:57,460
information security yep you know as you

00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:58,810
can imagine with 27 trillion dollars

00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:00,460
under management we need to think about

00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:03,490
that a little bit a fifth of the world's

00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:06,310
assets is a video exactly right so so

00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:09,280
you know we're fairly obsessive about

00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:11,920
that stuff and I think the way that we

00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:14,110
managed in the past you know it's it's a

00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:17,050
lot of 1990s technology in some ways you

00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:18,910
know TMZ's and firewalls and you know a

00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:21,790
lot of the infrastructure around that

00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:24,520
and you know and it yeah all levels of

00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:26,560
the infrastructure so even once you put

00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:28,630
your paths up there getting it so you

00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,370
can get it in front of clients there's a

00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:33,040
lot of Hoops to jump through and I think

00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:36,100
you know Swami and I've been working on

00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:38,950
ways to automate all the infrastructure

00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:41,380
in a way that's not only way more secure

00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:42,010
than I think infrastructure has been in

00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:46,060
the past

00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:48,280
yeah but also is a lot more flexible and

00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:50,110
and agreeable when it comes to talking

00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:51,700
to compliance and information security

00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:53,650
and all the other folks that need to be

00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:55,690
in that that's a fascinating angle for

00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:57,790
me because when I look at Cisco this

00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:59,380
morning opening up with their new Cloud

00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:00,940
Foundry integrated into their rules

00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:02,140
engines for network deployment and

00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:03,910
automation I know that's one of the

00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:05,380
areas where the boundary between a

00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:06,940
platform service the network has been a

00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:08,380
focus for you yeah because you just

00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:09,850
can't you can't just make it easier you

00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:11,230
know if you make it easier make it

00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:13,270
easier for us and you make it easier for

00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:16,209
the bad guys it's got to be better yeah

00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:18,310
so and it's also got to be automated and

00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:19,720
you know we just haven't seen anything

00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:21,670
yet that really solves up our the

00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,930
equation a lot of the past I mean it's

00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:24,490
like one you know we even had that

00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:25,930
discussion when we first talked about

00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:27,430
Cloud Foundry it's like we already have

00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:29,410
all that sure what do you got that we

00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:31,090
don't have and nothing you know I think

00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:32,200
that's where you know particularly when

00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:34,120
you see some of these other things

00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:36,310
coming out yeah I think that that new

00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,960
concept of hey my application is

00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:39,789
surrounded by as you deploy

00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,860
application everything around it changes

00:17:39,789 --> 00:17:43,720
yes so some of the policy around it

00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,980
changes the network configurations

00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,110
around it change yep

00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:48,610
so that really the system is responsive

00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:50,260
to both the compliance needs as well as

00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:51,700
the agility needs oh yeah and it's got

00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:56,080
to work that way because you know you

00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:57,370
can't have elasticity elasticity you

00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,960
have to have you have to be able to have

00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:01,539
the compliance and security to them it's

00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,250
just can't do it the old way so what can

00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:04,600
we do as a community to make cloud found

00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:06,100
you're gonna OpenStack great for you

00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,840
Swami how would you how would you think

00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:10,330
about where we should go with that

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:12,700
together you know I think we've been

00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:15,309
watching this platform as a service and

00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:17,169
OpenStack for quite some time we've been

00:18:15,309 --> 00:18:19,059
looking at the journey of some of the

00:18:17,169 --> 00:18:21,640
other platform as a service like engine

00:18:19,059 --> 00:18:25,000
engine engine yard and other other

00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:28,480
offerings so what we thought is very

00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,700
important for us is we can't write the

00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,080
code BNY Mellon can't write the code for

00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:34,450
all the applications that we need to

00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,549
serve our business so we were looking

00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:39,309
for which one of the platform as a

00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:42,039
service offerings would have the ability

00:18:39,309 --> 00:18:44,350
to get the other application or others

00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:46,270
right available so that we can just pop

00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:48,039
that in you know so the biggest thing

00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:50,289
that we look for and the biggest barrier

00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:52,570
or success would be the ecosystem that

00:18:50,289 --> 00:18:56,140
you have and would like the software

00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:58,090
that IBM has to be available as you know

00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:59,649
the bill packs that we could just pop

00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:01,480
that in in our environment and it's

00:18:59,649 --> 00:19:03,130
available so this is a this is the first

00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,630
time that really platforms of services

00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:07,149
come from just hosted only which was a

00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:08,559
non-starter for you as I mentioned in my

00:19:07,149 --> 00:19:10,120
quick talk the other morning like hey

00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:12,730
you can have this in your data center on

00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:14,080
demand immediately that's a big

00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:16,210
watershed event for an enterprise

00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:18,460
platform yep absolutely

00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:21,399
you know the our our strategy has always

00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:23,529
been let's do what we need to do from a

00:19:21,399 --> 00:19:27,490
private cloud perspective from a cloud

00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:29,320
perspective on premises and build it in

00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:31,480
such a way that you have the ability to

00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:32,770
go out as opposed to build outside and

00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,840
something happens you cannot bring that

00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:36,340
back in right so we're building and

00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,860
architecting everything in such a way

00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:40,600
that we can always turn the knob and you

00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:42,340
know go go outside to a public cloud

00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:44,620
yeah so you know that you can deploy it

00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:47,049
on OpenStack today and maybe a public

00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:48,039
cloud in the future one of the other

00:19:47,049 --> 00:19:48,790
things which I think is worth mentioning

00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:51,750
and

00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:54,610
we talked about some of this as well as

00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:56,800
we've got a lot of stuff yeah you know

00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:58,270
and and there's some pretty great stuff

00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,470
that we have that's never gonna be on

00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:02,470
the cloud we got a lot of mainframe

00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:04,630
based services and core technology

00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:07,900
capabilities it's frankly pretty great

00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:11,200
stuff and it needs to be a first-class

00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:13,870
citizen in our cloud-based ecosystem and

00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,700
so we spent a lot of time on our v2

00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:17,650
architecture getting all that well

00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:20,770
integrated across multiple data centers

00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:23,320
and working pretty darn well you it

00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:24,490
needs to work you know it needs to be a

00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,470
first-class citizen when you're

00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:28,030
operating with a cloud you need there's

00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:29,530
a layer and you got some cloud-based

00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:31,150
components and you've got some of these

00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:33,550
non cloud infrastructure fragments

00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:34,900
having that stuff integrated and we

00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:36,580
talked about some ways to do that with

00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:38,080
Cloud Foundry is that's a pretty

00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:39,610
critical piece as well and I don't think

00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,930
that's fully solved yeah I think those

00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:42,370
are two highlights I've learned from

00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:44,020
dealing that Bank of New York folks is

00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:45,100
that legacy integration of course we've

00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:46,570
known about that for a long time but

00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:48,310
making that a first-class citizen and

00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:49,690
how easily that plugs in we have user

00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:51,730
provided services today we're going to

00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:53,830
do much more as well as compliance

00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:55,480
automation as part of the workflow yep I

00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:58,030
think those are two things we just got a

00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:00,010
knock out to take cloud foundry deep

00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:02,050
into the enterprise at a storied company

00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:03,760
like Bank of New York so hey we're out

00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:05,800
of time and this conversation is gonna

00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,910
continue for you know years to come

00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,440
hopefully in a great collaboration

00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:10,840
between these two groups and Cloud

00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:13,240
Foundry and thanks very much for coming

00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:15,310
up today we've got about six people if

00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:17,110
you can stand up the be mmmmmm guys okay

00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:18,400
very much yeah the architecture team

00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:21,580
from being why do you want to stand up a

00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:26,180
little bit they're all gonna be a wife

00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:29,469
you guys laying me off thank you

00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:29,469
