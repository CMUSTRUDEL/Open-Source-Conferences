00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:14,719
Jared Rey CTO of CenturyLink he's going

00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:18,539
to talk about some dotnet I believe yep

00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:20,160
so I'm just I know we have a couple more

00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:23,220
lightning talks coming up so I have

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,900
about 300 slides and I know you guys

00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,880
have lunch so we're gonna go through all

00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,619
of them cute now I'm just kidding

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,000
we won't do that I'm actually just gonna

00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:33,180
give an update to really get everybody

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,340
in the same ballpark on what what dotnet

00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,680
is we did it actually at the first CF

00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,660
summit where we are what we're doing and

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:43,020
this is really just given give an update

00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:45,570
of where where we are so this is

00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:48,629
literally kind of how our team looks at

00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:52,160
this it's the water is Cloud Foundry and

00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:55,399
were oil kind of slowly leaking into it

00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,629
but this is really what we're doing over

00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:59,430
basically our entire journey with iron

00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:01,949
foundry we're basically slowly leaking

00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:04,470
in putting in all of our good stuff

00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:07,770
around dotnet and enabling it in a good

00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:11,640
way and a little bit about iron foundry

00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:13,619
it started out in 2011 and you know we

00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,600
really are focused on a couple big

00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:17,729
things one is we want to extend cloud

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,759
foundry with dotnet we want to make sure

00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:22,470
that language is extremely portable easy

00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:24,030
to use there's a ton of dotnet

00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:26,430
developers especially in the enterprise

00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:28,350
that are using that today they want to

00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:30,090
use a newer technology and you know

00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:32,670
quite honestly we hear them constantly

00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:35,250
say hey we want to be able to take net

00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:39,030
and use open services behind that so

00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:40,740
elastic link Cassandra rabbit all

00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,119
those things underneath and normally

00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,549
they're kind of stuck in an ecosystem

00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:46,770
that's all Microsoft um the other thing

00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:48,780
that we do with the iron foundry project

00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:51,659
is we really focus on enabling the

00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:54,780
dotnet with developer tools so visuals

00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:56,130
do studio integration and clients those

00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,560
are the big things that really get

00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:02,189
missed as we go through the cloud

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:05,969
foundry ecosystem so a little bit update

00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:07,890
we believe right now that we're gonna be

00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:10,289
through incubation hopefully through the

00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,500
summer that means that literally will be

00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:14,540
a first-class citizen at that point

00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:16,340
you guys will be able to install it we

00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:19,750
went into incubation literally I think a

00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:21,709
week after the foundation was formed and

00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:23,690
this is something that we're gonna

00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:26,330
really start pushing forward on we've

00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:28,640
done a ton of things to basically

00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:32,599
include iron foundry v2 in the cloud

00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:34,489
foundry v2 system first of course we

00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:37,610
really updated the dotnet container and

00:02:34,489 --> 00:02:39,410
this of course is all online this is not

00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:41,840
a sales pitch I'm selling anything

00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:44,000
CenturyLink is a service provider this

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,250
is all glory for you guys anybody who

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,840
wants to use net or enable it this is

00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,370
something that CenturyLink highly backs

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,140
and we want to basically make that

00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:53,120
happen so we updated the dotnet

00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:54,170
container basically rolled out all the

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,540
way through I'm not going to go through

00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:59,840
all the highlights but some of the big

00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:01,549
ones is memory and CPU limits CPU limits

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,390
are coming but memory is already there

00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:06,769
we also got it all built and working

00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:11,480
through the standard containers that we

00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:13,069
have today also sequel server this is

00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,959
the number one request that we've heard

00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:18,139
from everybody and this is actually

00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,489
already done encode it's now live on the

00:03:18,139 --> 00:03:21,530
repo anybody can use it

00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:23,780
it basically is a full sequel server

00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:25,579
connector for anybody who's using

00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:27,349
Microsoft technology they can basically

00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:31,730
connect to a sequel server using that

00:03:27,349 --> 00:03:34,040
what iron foundry is up on its repo the

00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:37,459
next thing we did which was most recent

00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:38,780
we actually added sequel server the.net

00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:41,480
container we've been basically

00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:43,280
publishing if we moved it into

00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:45,310
incubation so that iron foundry projects

00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,560
actually under the cloud foundry repos

00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:50,150
and one of the things that we like to do

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,849
is really dog food and start giving

00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:54,980
access to people as fast as possible and

00:03:52,849 --> 00:03:57,650
get get them understanding the revs and

00:03:54,980 --> 00:04:00,049
so there's actually a iron foundry dot

00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:02,900
mean this is a free environment has all

00:04:00,049 --> 00:04:05,989
the cloud foundry v2 bits in it plus

00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:08,090
iron foundry and sequel server so you're

00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:09,199
able to get dotnet extensions be able to

00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:11,030
do whatever you want you can do a

00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:14,449
polyglot so I actually run you know a

00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:15,829
different language with net and also be

00:04:14,449 --> 00:04:17,510
able to do multiple services on the

00:04:15,829 --> 00:04:19,340
backend this is a free environment for

00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:20,930
anybody who wants to trial it we

00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:23,540
actually do this for a couple reasons

00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:25,190
one is one a dog food it second one is

00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:27,590
we are constantly updating this thing

00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:30,050
this launched I believe about a month

00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:31,910
ago it's had some good traction anybody

00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:33,560
who wants to sign up just go online to

00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:35,420
iron foundry org and you can get up and

00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,610
running if you want to download the bits

00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:39,140
they're all online so you can download

00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:42,110
all the bits and get up and running

00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:44,870
really easily you know where we're going

00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:47,870
with this and I know we already had a

00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:50,360
good talk about Diego but I want to just

00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:52,420
emphasize you know we want to make sure

00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:55,850
that Dante is a first-class citizen

00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:57,980
Diego really enables that this is a big

00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:59,480
change for the way Cloud Foundry first

00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:02,240
started and I'll give you a nice little

00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:04,550
story about how when we first went to

00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,350
the pivotal pivotal group and we started

00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:08,990
talking about Windows or even at Cloud

00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:10,640
Foundry when I first met them and we

00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:12,410
were like literally before even Cloud

00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:14,000
Foundry launched they were they were

00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:16,760
really excited because we knew what

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,620
Windows was and they're like man can you

00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:21,440
can you guys write iron foundry

00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:22,970
you can add dotnet to our our cloud

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,850
foundry stuff and this was even before

00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:27,320
it came out and then you know after they

00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:30,440
start a really gained momentum we went

00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:34,010
to pivotal and realistically we realized

00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:35,660
a lot of the guys haven't played with

00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:38,300
Windows for a long time they don't

00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:41,120
understand how it works how it's enabled

00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:42,500
and so we've had to spend a significant

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,360
amount of time and it's been great to

00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:46,160
work with the pivotal guys to actually

00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:49,250
understand how are we going to put

00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,990
Windows and and make it extremely

00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:52,340
compatible and this is one of the big

00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:54,710
pushes that we have is we've been

00:05:52,340 --> 00:06:00,260
working with the Diego team to actually

00:05:54,710 --> 00:06:02,090
put you know it into Windows and so this

00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:04,160
is kind of the architecture I know this

00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:06,020
is high-level but one of the things that

00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,270
we kind of see here is that we'll be

00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:10,700
able to run side by side with the same

00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:12,710
code same everything but basically on a

00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:15,950
Windows platform and this will make it

00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:18,170
extremely easy to use great to get up

00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:19,640
and running and our goal out of this is

00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:21,200
to really make it so you guys aren't

00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:23,960
having to fork anything change anything

00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:27,710
it's really just right in line easy to

00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:29,180
use and once this is done we're pretty

00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:31,340
much finished with the core of iron

00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:33,780
foundry this will make it so that we're

00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:38,910
completely compatible all up and running

00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:40,440
and this language is now awesome you

00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:42,210
know where we're going since this is now

00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:44,730
you know we're merging everything into

00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:47,040
the main of Cloud Foundry and especially

00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:48,660
with Diego we're able to focus on a lot

00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:51,120
a lot of different under different

00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:52,680
things on our platform one of them of

00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,050
course is we're going to be launching a

00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,790
CF v2 client for net we've done some

00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:58,590
work on that actually ultros has also

00:06:56,790 --> 00:07:01,050
done some work for it and so we're

00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:06,390
pushing that all together Bosch for

00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:08,460
Windows yeah we have to work on that so

00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:09,630
we have actually a significant amount of

00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:12,150
work in the second half of this year

00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:14,070
around enabling Bosch for Windows and

00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:16,680
getting that up and running Bosch really

00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:18,870
hasn't fully embraced what Windows is

00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,460
and we're gonna start working on that we

00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:22,530
also have a Cloud Foundry client which

00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:25,380
we call low key we also have another one

00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:26,580
called Thor which is an OS X visual

00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:29,390
studio extensions are going to be

00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:31,950
updated to be - very shortly powershell

00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:33,810
nougat and of course windows

00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:35,820
authentication these are the core things

00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:39,330
that we're really focused on to get

00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:41,010
dotnet fully into the Cloud Foundry

00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:43,100
project and this is what's great about

00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:46,140
it we're making really good progress

00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:48,090
we're adding a lot of code we're getting

00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:50,100
things up and running and one of the

00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:52,729
things that I want to say is you know I

00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:56,130
know everybody says yes we're hiring

00:07:52,729 --> 00:07:58,470
instead of hiring like we would like you

00:07:56,130 --> 00:08:00,539
just to contribute contributed Cloud

00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:01,919
Foundry checking your code work with

00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:03,750
your companies to actually do open

00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:06,270
source the other thing is of course

00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:07,140
contribute to iron foundry we're more
