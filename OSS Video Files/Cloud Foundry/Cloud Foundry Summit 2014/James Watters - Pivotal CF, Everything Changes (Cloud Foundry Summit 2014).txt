00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:15,210
great to see everybody this is amazing

00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:17,220
to me is watching the panel last night

00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:19,320
and they talked about Cloud Foundry

00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:23,490
ecosystem which was my first job working

00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,810
on Cloud Foundry in 2010 and it occurred

00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:27,630
to me that I didn't know the Cloud

00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:29,369
Foundry ecosystem anymore and there was

00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,859
a time where I could probably write on

00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:33,420
one little piece of paper the the Cloud

00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:35,640
Foundry ecosystem out and I knew all

00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,170
their phone numbers and their

00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,829
girlfriends names and what they like to

00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:42,840
eat and I don't anymore in fact it's

00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:45,570
much bigger than anything I could have

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,579
imagined and to stand up here and have a

00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:50,640
thousand people looking back at me is uh

00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:52,559
it's pretty amazing so big thanks to

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,899
Andrew before I get started oh and being

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:57,000
a special ingredient the first time we

00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:58,859
tried to pull together the platform

00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,539
conference last fall he told the story I

00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:03,329
said hey maybe we'll get 150 people out

00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:05,790
and we really rallied about 500 and

00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:08,159
today we've grown even bigger and the

00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:10,439
work of you know andrew with platform

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,090
and his background in devops is amazing

00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:14,189
and what Leo Spiegel and the foundation

00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:16,680
team has done to rally the ecosystem

00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:20,580
been amazing as well so just a big THANK

00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:22,950
YOU since that last conference though

00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:26,640
something kept on happening and the last

00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:29,729
time I got up at in September I you know

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,670
use this familiar trend and I'm here to

00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:34,799
tell you that it got even stronger so

00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:36,570
software did not ask our permission and

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,890
it just kept on doing its thing and it

00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,829
kept on changing the economic

00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,759
organization of our world at a

00:01:39,829 --> 00:01:45,450
ever-increasing and accelerating pace

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:47,630
and this slide here is funny because I

00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:50,460
have to keep changing the valuations

00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:54,270
they keep going up so fast

00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:57,149
uber started on this slide at 13 at 3

00:01:54,270 --> 00:02:00,600
billion and this morning before this

00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:04,500
talk I had to add a whopping 16 billion

00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:06,509
dollars to that number so these trends

00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,700
that are changing our world and making

00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:10,530
software based economic competition that

00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:12,300
I talked about last September have

00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,450
gotten even stronger and even more

00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,190
pressing so

00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:16,930
the Cloud Foundry ecosystem has grown

00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:20,349
that challenge that we're all facing

00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:21,849
together has gotten even stronger and

00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:23,770
we've seen this become so ubiquitous

00:02:21,849 --> 00:02:25,569
that you know I spent my last six months

00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:27,099
on the road talking to the leading

00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:29,950
enterprises that make up the global

00:02:27,099 --> 00:02:32,110
economy and they all share this both

00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:34,020
urgency and trepidation around how they

00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:37,090
have to change in the future to compete

00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:38,770
and not to pick on traditional IT

00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:41,319
vendors but I'd like to show this in

00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:44,620
contrast this was a keynote slide from

00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:47,080
John Chambers at his summit that he

00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:48,489
hosted and you know a lot of these

00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:51,459
vendors are here today and I even say

00:02:48,489 --> 00:02:53,080
you know pivotal parent company EMC you

00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:54,790
know their core business is not growing

00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,860
at tremendously fast rates either just

00:02:54,790 --> 00:03:00,370
to be fair but I show this slide because

00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:02,860
traditional IT is not participating in

00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:04,540
some sense with this massive and radical

00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:06,459
change that's creating billions and

00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,870
billions of dollars worth of value out

00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:09,850
there and the software is eating the

00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:12,340
world based economy and I think that

00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:14,590
should get all of us pause and reflect a

00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:16,269
moment on how is it that these companies

00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:19,120
that have been such a mainstay for the

00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:20,650
last 20 years in tech are not

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,079
participating in the most tremendous

00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:26,530
growth we've seen and I think that comes

00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:28,480
back to this idea of a software centric

00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:29,799
versus infrastructure centric world and

00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,420
that's why platform as-a-service has

00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:33,970
become so important and I'll talk a bit

00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:37,060
more about that and when you drill into

00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:39,549
how this new world organizes itself and

00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:41,440
how it thinks and reasons at the center

00:03:39,549 --> 00:03:43,750
of that is developer productivity and

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:47,500
agility and the ability to write

00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:49,239
applications that change applications

00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,910
that consume ever-increasing amounts of

00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:54,660
data applications that are natively

00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:57,489
mobile not native to a data center and

00:03:54,660 --> 00:04:01,390
applications that are driven in their

00:03:57,489 --> 00:04:03,430
life cycle by analytics and data by data

00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:05,590
that profoundly changes how the consumer

00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:06,760
experiences things and at a predictive

00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:07,390
experience about what they should be

00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,190
doing next

00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:10,840
as well as how suppliers organize

00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:13,660
themselves to fulfill that consumer

00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:16,000
demand that sense of agility meaning

00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:18,760
analytics is really what's caused this

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,410
vortex whirlwind of software based

00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:24,159
competition that a lot of traditional

00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:25,870
vendors have not participated in and we

00:04:24,159 --> 00:04:27,610
all know about Netflix

00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:29,169
but sometimes it's good to go back and

00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:32,110
look exactly what happened with Netflix

00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:34,660
and they started off as a traditional IT

00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:37,360
company actually in a sense they had IBM

00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:39,160
P series they had Oracle they had VMware

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,500
and a traditional data center and they

00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,270
shipped you DVDs and that was a very one

00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,550
dot o kind of innovation that they had

00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:47,530
but they realized along their journey

00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:49,600
that they needed to pivot and so they

00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:52,060
turned to infrastructures of service and

00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,940
they reorganized their entire team to

00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:56,470
deliver services with Amazon but what

00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,979
they found was that still had too many

00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,750
steps

00:04:56,979 --> 00:05:01,660
there's too many handoffs and that

00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:03,580
iteration and that analytics process was

00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:05,620
not fast enough for them and so where

00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:07,690
they ended up on is actually platform as

00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:09,639
a service and platform as a service

00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:12,130
changed the way they did business it

00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:13,930
allowed them to drive commitment from

00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:16,600
the entire organization to shipping new

00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:17,949
features and to focusing on analytics

00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,440
about what those new features should be

00:05:17,949 --> 00:05:21,550
as the primary thing that everyone did

00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:24,490
every day at the office

00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:27,250
and so they presented this deck agent Co

00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:29,789
Croft kind of as a you know victory lap

00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:32,560
after his great success at at Netflix

00:05:29,789 --> 00:05:34,320
and how he changed the organization I

00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,030
think that's why pass is so important

00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,830
IDC who's here today has come out and

00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:40,300
said the infrastructures of service

00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:42,580
without platform of service is really a

00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:43,870
dying breed that the focus should not

00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:46,690
just be on data centers and

00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:48,849
infrastructure has to be on applications

00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:51,880
and analytics and data driven

00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:53,200
applications and InfoWorld said about

00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,639
cloud foundry that it's one of the most

00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,710
single most important things you can do

00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,930
is to give your development team access

00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:01,330
to a platform as a service so this trend

00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:05,349
has really grown in a profound way and

00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:08,020
cloud foundry since 2011 as a hosted web

00:06:05,349 --> 00:06:09,639
service has provided this so we've

00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:11,650
continued to iterate and make it even

00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:13,630
more powerful and this is pivotal Web

00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:15,820
Services today which now is generally

00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:17,320
available can take credit cards you can

00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:19,870
go out and use that hosted web service

00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:22,120
and it really focuses in a different way

00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:24,099
than Amazon on applications and services

00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:26,440
you've ever logged into an Amazon

00:06:24,099 --> 00:06:28,360
console you've seen you know fifty to

00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:30,370
hundred thousands of virtual machines

00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:33,010
and they're not grouped in any kind of

00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:35,469
you know application centric fashion and

00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:37,240
that leaves you feeling like hey where

00:06:35,469 --> 00:06:38,380
are my apps in here where does that one

00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,940
app begin and the other

00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:41,680
been and how do I reason about this

00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:43,180
system and platforms the service really

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,450
changes that it makes everything that

00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:49,300
you see about applications domains scale

00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:52,090
services but it wasn't enough just to

00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:53,050
have a hosted platform as a service come

00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:55,150
one come all

00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:56,800
in November fifteenth after the last

00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:59,050
platform conference we shipped a

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,360
world-changing product called pivotal CF

00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:02,980
and pivotal CF for the first time

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,300
allowed you to take that platform as a

00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:06,220
service that we offered as a hosted

00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:08,140
edition and bring it to a private data

00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:10,500
center or to stand your own version of

00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:12,940
up on a cloud of your choice and we

00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:14,620
revolutionized not just that developer

00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:16,150
experience but also for the first time

00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:17,950
that operators experience

00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:19,990
and we gave the data center operators

00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:22,000
choice about standing up their own

00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:24,310
Amazon like services behind the firewall

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,260
that was really a game-changing moment

00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:28,360
here and we already have several

00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:30,700
customers who come along the journey

00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:33,460
with us here to speak today what it's

00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:35,560
really about as step back is not just

00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:37,630
you know software for its own sake it's

00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:39,760
about third third platform applications

00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:42,640
things that are centered around the

00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:45,250
world of mobile big data cloud etc these

00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:47,050
new kinds of competition and you can see

00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:49,120
here in this IDC chart again that's

00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:50,760
where the growth is it's very kind of

00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,020
stares you in the face and simplicity

00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:54,190
traditional applications are not growing

00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:56,470
traditional spending of this application

00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:58,060
is not growing these new competitive

00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:59,890
differentiation generating applications

00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:01,510
are growing the fastest you need to

00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:04,240
align your strategy around how do you

00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:05,440
fulfill that kind of demand and I like

00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,910
to look at one of the largest

00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,010
acquisitions where the largest

00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:10,660
acquisition Google has ever made a lot

00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:12,430
of people think about these little 100

00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:14,710
200 million dollar acquisitions it makes

00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:16,120
kind of in the talent space but the

00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:17,620
biggest bet Google's ever made from a

00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:20,620
corporate development perspective is

00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:22,240
nest and there's something really

00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:24,010
particular about the nest disruptive

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,780
application pattern that I think is

00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:26,830
applicable to next-generation

00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:29,200
applications

00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:31,210
what nests really did is it not only

00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:34,090
revolutionized the consumer experience

00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:35,500
of how they had a predictive predictive

00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:37,719
interface both on their mobile phone and

00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:39,820
in the appliance itself around what

00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:41,590
temperature the user should expect to

00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:43,240
set their house to and their history but

00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:44,770
they also started to use deep analytics

00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,870
in the backend to tell suppliers and

00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:49,570
power generators what to expect and that

00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:51,460
was a really profound reorganization of

00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:52,060
you know the power generation economy

00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,590
that's coming

00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:55,870
that's why Google made such a big bet

00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:58,330
and these are the kind of applications I

00:08:55,870 --> 00:09:00,460
think that combined user experiences

00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:03,190
mobile analytics that are changing the

00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:05,500
world Netflix is an example of that and

00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:07,810
again the recommendations are speed in

00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:09,660
the marketplace wins they champion the

00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:12,580
idea that you should use my croissant

00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:14,380
lists to assemble your team to back that

00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:16,120
with agility and also that you should

00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:18,370
use simple patterns automated by paths

00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,720
these are all quotes from Netflix after

00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:20,950
Adrian left they're giving

00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:23,440
recommendations for how others can

00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:25,570
compete like he did this core

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,700
application change is really important

00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:29,500
because it starts to allow you know I

00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,970
talked to a lot of customers about how

00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,440
can we iterate and change our

00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:34,390
applications when they're all monoliths

00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,430
when you have to change it all at once

00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:38,410
every six or eight months or every year

00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:39,790
and the idea that moving to a micro

00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:40,930
services architecture is really

00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:42,010
important and there'll be two talks

00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:45,130
about it here today at the conference

00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:46,450
that I hope you'll tend by moving to a

00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:48,550
micro services architecture you can

00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:50,500
start to have an agile team with one

00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:52,600
domain focus behind each micro service

00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:54,310
and I won't go in depth but a platform

00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,190
as a service is an ideal place to run

00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:59,080
that kind of application architecture

00:09:56,190 --> 00:10:00,730
when you bring it all together what you

00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:03,070
really need to do in the future for

00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:05,740
Cloud Foundry our ambition is to give

00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:07,540
you this third-generation platform so

00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:09,370
pivotal CF is becoming that

00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:11,680
third-generation platform as a service

00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:13,540
not just with an elastic runtime that

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,640
speeds developer efficiency and

00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:17,740
increases agility but also with these

00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:21,370
scale out data services like elastic and

00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:23,350
OOP a key value store Redis and mobile

00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:25,420
backend services to allow you to build

00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:27,400
those nest pattern style applications

00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:29,200
that allow you to innovate this is a

00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:31,540
pressing issue for almost every company

00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,010
that's out there today and we want to

00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:36,040
address that by allowing them to deliver

00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:37,540
that on any cloud with pivotal CF sort

00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:39,580
of delivering on the fundamental promise

00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:41,770
of Cloud Foundry to be an alternative to

00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:43,089
Amazon when you think back of you know

00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:45,250
some of those vendors you see that line

00:10:43,089 --> 00:10:46,810
in 2011 when their growth stopped that's

00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:48,940
really when Amazon started taking off

00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:50,620
and up until now traditional companies

00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,940
haven't had an alternative to an Amazon

00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:54,490
style architecture for these new

00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:56,529
applications pibil CF backed by Cloud

00:10:54,490 --> 00:11:01,360
Foundry we believe will be that

00:10:56,529 --> 00:11:04,000
alternative to Amazon backing us is GES

00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,750
investment in pivotal they are very much

00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,970
faced with how to build those nest style

00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:09,770
applications that are both rich and user

00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:12,980
experiences and predictive to supplier

00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:14,840
organization and they've vested 105

00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:16,310
million dollars in two pivotal and are

00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:19,100
working with Cloud Foundry and our

00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:21,020
pivotal data suite to deliver those kind

00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:24,440
of applications that's an early proof

00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:26,150
point of where we're headed and my you

00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,530
know kind of final call to action is

00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:29,060
think about the people in your

00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:30,980
organization and what they want how do

00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:32,600
you make them all successful what we

00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:34,580
recommend with pivotal CF is that it

00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,350
starts with developers make them

00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:38,090
successful by allowing them to just push

00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:40,640
applications to a platforms of service

00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:42,890
to iterate rapidly to use new

00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,270
technologies such as docker to import

00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:46,880
their applications into the platform as

00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:48,590
a service but don't forget the

00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,360
operations people when you're moving

00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:51,710
your platform as a service to a private

00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:54,110
data center you really have to keep

00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:54,620
their operational demands and needs in

00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:57,320
check

00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:59,180
and so with pivotal CF we've really

00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,890
focused long and hard on how do you make

00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:02,090
those operators successful because

00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:03,800
that's what's different from just that

00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:04,670
pivotal web service experience you have

00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,650
where you don't know about the

00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:08,270
operations that's done by three people

00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:09,590
on our team when you're coming into a

00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:10,760
private data center you really need to

00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:12,410
think about how do you empower those

00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:14,150
operations people behind the scenes to

00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:16,910
be successful there's one particular

00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:18,290
feature that is native now to cloud

00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:20,839
found you that I'm very proud of that we

00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:23,120
worked on together with IBM which is

00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:25,670
availability zones so it's the only

00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,500
platforms of service available today you

00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:29,150
can deploy applications into multiple

00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:31,370
availability zones with no developer

00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:33,380
configuration so you can do a CF push

00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:36,080
and get four layers of high availability

00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:37,580
baked into your application there's four

00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:40,010
ways that Cloud Foundry will continually

00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:42,020
try to revive every process application

00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:45,080
and zone in its system that really

00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:46,400
changes the second part of rapid

00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:48,320
iteration in software which is making

00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,820
the operations teams comfortable with

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:54,020
taking the risk of new deployments and

00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:55,760
new applications you also want to keep

00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:57,560
your architects and your CTO happy

00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,700
because they're under pressure of how do

00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,710
we work with all these next-generation

00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:02,870
data services how do we incorporate

00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:05,150
scale out key value store how do we

00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:07,640
incorporate Hadoop as a service rapidly

00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:09,530
and cloud foundry and pebble CF will

00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:11,450
deliver these natively allowing these

00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:14,209
next-generation architectures to be an

00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:16,040
and not an or use cloud foundry or this

00:13:14,209 --> 00:13:18,410
and I think that's very important this

00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,520
next generation of design for apps that

00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:21,890
they can come to the plot

00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:23,270
Foreman natively consume everything from

00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:24,470
Jenkins as a service we have partnered

00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:26,690
with cloudBees they'll be here to talk

00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:28,070
about the today Redis is a service we're

00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:29,150
partnered with Redis labs they'll be

00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:31,460
here talking about their Redis service

00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:34,280
native to pivotal CF working with

00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:36,800
elasticsearch and many more to deliver

00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:38,960
all these services out of the box not

00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,140
only deployed but update managed and

00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:44,000
scaled natively on cloud foundry and

00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:45,920
finally an an era of great uncertainty

00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,760
it's really important to keep your CFO

00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,620
happy as well

00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:50,870
because you need to be able to pick the

00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:53,060
cloud of your choice to deploy on so

00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:54,710
today it might be vSphere on private

00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:56,750
data center and tomorrow you might want

00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:59,090
to take advantage of Google's amazing

00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:00,920
new Google cloud platform to do scale

00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:02,570
out applications and analytics by

00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:04,610
betting on pivotal CF you're able to

00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:07,550
pick one architecture that you can take

00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:10,130
then to any cloud so that's really our

00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:11,900
call to action is that platform as a

00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:13,340
service is really changing the way the

00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:15,530
modern economy is organized in the

00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:17,690
enterprise and pivotal CF is one of the

00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:19,610
first and the only enterprise

00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:22,150
distribution that's available on private

00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:25,360
and public clouds for Cloud Foundry

00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:28,649
thank you very much

00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,649
