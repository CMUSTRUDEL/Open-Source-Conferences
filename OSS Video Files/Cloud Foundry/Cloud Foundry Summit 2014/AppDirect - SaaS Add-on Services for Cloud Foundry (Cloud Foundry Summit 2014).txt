Title: AppDirect - SaaS Add-on Services for Cloud Foundry (Cloud Foundry Summit 2014)
Publication date: 2014-07-04
Playlist: Cloud Foundry Summit 2014
Description: 
	Paul Arnautoff, Director of Business Development, AppDirect

Two years ago, Pivotal Cloud Foundry partnered with AppDirect to launch a Services Marketplace to make it easier for Developers to find, buy and use the tools they need to build cloud software. With the recent development of Pivotal's V2 Service Broker, the AppDirect services catalog is now available through not only Pivotal Web Services, but also any private or public deployment of Cloud Foundry anywhere. In this discussion, Paul Arnautoff will highlight how AppDirect integrated with the CF Service Broker and is extending the consumption of 3rd party services across a growing network of PaaS marketplaces as well as how ISVs can integrate once with the services catalog to distribute through any Cloud Foundry deployment.

[Music]

00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:13,980
great good afternoon thanks for grabbing

00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:15,450
your seats after the break and we're

00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,550
going to kick it back off my name is

00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:20,630
Paul Arnott's off today I'm going to be

00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:22,800
talking about how we are bringing SAS

00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:25,500
software as a service application

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,660
add-ons to cloud foundry environments

00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:32,610
via distribution partnership with their

00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:33,870
marketplace a little bit about myself

00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:36,059
Paul Erna top director of business

00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:38,520
development at apt direct was the first

00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:40,860
hire on the business team and joined the

00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,020
company to lead our is V partnerships

00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:45,660
which is overseeing the integration of

00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,489
over a hundred and sixty software as a

00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:50,340
service applications into the network

00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:53,190
for distribution purposes today I lead

00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:55,620
partnerships with OEMs with platform as

00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:57,480
a service with infrastructure as a

00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:00,859
service that have resulted in

00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:05,189
partnerships with pivotal with Samsung

00:01:00,859 --> 00:01:07,350
Rackspace red Hatton and many others a

00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:08,970
little bit about our company app direct

00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:11,580
we're actually located just a few blocks

00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:13,799
from here in downtown San Francisco we

00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:16,290
have around 160 employees worldwide with

00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:20,159
presences in Argentina and Switzerland

00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:22,020
in Germany and Canada we recently raised

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,360
a Series C round of funding through

00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:28,710
mythril which is Peter teals a venture

00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:30,840
arm of 35 million and we've grown our

00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:35,009
technology via acquisition a couple of

00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,600
note back in 2012 we bought a billing

00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:38,610
company called J billing which is one of

00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,530
the world's largest open source billing

00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:42,899
as a service platforms and that's what

00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:44,399
enables us to handle subscriptions for

00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:47,850
all the applications that are offered in

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:49,170
our catalog we also acquired a packaging

00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:51,930
and orchestration company called

00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:53,460
standing cloud back in 2013 and that

00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:57,030
enables us to handle private cloud

00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:58,619
deployments so today I'm going to be

00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:01,799
talking to you about a couple of things

00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:04,049
one our big idea that we call cloud

00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:05,820
service brokerage I'll be talking about

00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:07,740
how we use that in the context of

00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:10,920
pivotal Cloud Foundry with their

00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:13,140
marketplace I'll talk about the service

00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,980
broker integration that we performed to

00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:17,090
get after ech

00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:19,650
connected into their their their model

00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:22,260
we'll talk a little bit about last mile

00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:25,200
application delivery which handles how

00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:26,519
do we optimize drop-off to get customers

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,069
on boarded with software-as-a-service

00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:31,049
applications and the lastly partnership

00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:32,370
opportunities so ways that we can

00:02:31,049 --> 00:02:35,250
utilize all this technology to work

00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:37,489
together so I'm going to kick off the

00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:39,959
presentation with a reference to a

00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:42,180
report that was published by IDC earlier

00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:46,470
this year that that cites the the rise

00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:47,879
of IDC s third platform so this isn't

00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:49,890
news to everybody here at this

00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:51,569
conference today but you know it covers

00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:52,980
the progression that we've made from

00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:55,950
deploying enterprise software on

00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:59,370
mainframes and terminals to virtualize

00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:01,730
network and networking ultimately to

00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:04,799
where we are today which is this massive

00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:07,019
proliferation of applications that are

00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:09,329
deployed on to almost any device that

00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:11,549
you could imagine and get your hands on

00:03:09,329 --> 00:03:13,109
so today you know televisions are

00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:15,090
shipping with smart applications that

00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:18,239
are enabling you to consume media

00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:19,650
content on demand even refrigerators are

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:23,250
coming with applications that'll let you

00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:24,959
set the temperature and cars for example

00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:26,870
it's not very safe but they're coming

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,190
with a set of applications that can

00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:31,319
maybe make you crash and burn but

00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:33,620
nonetheless they're there and software

00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:36,060
is becoming a daily part of our lives

00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:38,609
but this instant gratification that

00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:41,459
we're seeing as individual users and

00:03:38,609 --> 00:03:43,560
consumers of software it's changing the

00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:45,450
way in the behavior through which that

00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,829
we expect to consume and purchase

00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:49,049
software in the context of our

00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:52,049
businesses of our enterprises and our

00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:55,500
organizations so you know in the next

00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:58,019
three years IT spending from groups

00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:00,750
outside of IT groups that will bypass IT

00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:03,750
are expected to increase by over six

00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:05,370
percent year-over-year cloud spending is

00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:08,430
expected to grow twenty five percent

00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:10,829
overall reaching a hundred billion by

00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:12,959
2017 seventy five percent of which is

00:04:10,829 --> 00:04:14,549
expected to be public cloud spending so

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,310
rest assured we're all in the right

00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:19,410
place to contribute to this expanding

00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:22,590
phenomenon of cloud software development

00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:24,150
but of course it's not only the third

00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:26,760
platform is not only changing the way

00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:27,570
that we are consuming and using software

00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,830
the

00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:30,900
reason we're all here today's to talk

00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:32,370
about platform-as-a-service and that of

00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:35,040
course is changing the way that we're

00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:36,900
building and bringing software to the

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,070
mainstream so if you think about the way

00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:41,250
that software was built in the past

00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:43,230
you'd have to purchase bare metal and

00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:45,480
make that those machines that are

00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:47,480
virtualized deploy a solution stack on

00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:50,940
top of that and ultimately build a

00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:53,040
purpose-built application on top today

00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:55,560
the vast majority of ISPs are choosing

00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,720
infrastructure as a service to host and

00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,610
scale their applications deploying a

00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,070
solution stack on top and then running

00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:05,100
their applications but of course the

00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:07,980
future and with tools like pivotal Cloud

00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:10,890
Foundry we're now able to not worry

00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:12,570
about the VMS not we don't need to worry

00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:13,950
about the the machines that our

00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:16,230
applications are running on and we've

00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:18,420
shifted the paradigm of ownership onto

00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:21,450
the application in the code so that we

00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:22,980
can address this expanding demand for

00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:27,780
the consumption of software very very

00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:30,690
quickly now even if you drill down into

00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:32,970
specific business functionalities of the

00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:34,500
applications that we're building the way

00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:36,240
that you build applications is

00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:39,120
incredibly different today than it was

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,920
even five years ago today there's no

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,870
need to think about building your own

00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:45,240
billing engine there's no need to think

00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:46,950
about building a database there's no

00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,710
reason to think about sending emails

00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:50,760
from your app yourself there's no reason

00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:52,680
to think about how are you going to

00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:55,350
manage and monitor your code performance

00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:58,050
we now have tools and software that have

00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:59,670
become available as a service to plug

00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:02,790
into the applications that you're

00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:04,110
building to expedite the process of a

00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:06,810
building software and getting it to

00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:08,910
market so you know you can send emails

00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:11,250
with with folks like SendGrid now you

00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:13,460
can monitor your code and and and app

00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:15,930
performance with things like New Relic

00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:18,780
and what's that's what that is creating

00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:22,710
today is the average modern application

00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:25,200
is really this customized collaboration

00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:29,190
of different technologies that are

00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:31,110
pieced together via API so what is it

00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:33,180
what does all this mean for us as the

00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:35,580
third platform lowers the cost of

00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:38,610
delivery and integration focused

00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:41,830
single-use services will proliferate so

00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:43,990
as more and more tools are becoming of

00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:46,210
available to us and as the cost of

00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:48,460
building software are diminishing and

00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:52,390
the ease of integration of multiple

00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:56,890
services to create this broader business

00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:58,930
functioning tool increases that the

00:06:56,890 --> 00:07:00,910
entire landscape of software is is

00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:03,850
changing and of course what this is

00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:06,460
resulting in is this massive massive

00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:07,810
explosion of the amounts of applications

00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:10,300
that we're seeing in circulation today

00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:11,890
today there's over 5,000 cloud

00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,670
applications available to the general

00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:16,060
public

00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:17,980
IDC expects that to increase by 10x over

00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:20,200
the next four years which means that

00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:22,690
there will be 50,000 single-use

00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:25,330
purpose-built applications to function

00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:27,300
for literally any purpose that that you

00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:32,140
could possibly imagine

00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:34,930
but the behavior of businesses today has

00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:37,180
not changed in that 56 percent of

00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:41,920
businesses prefer to purchase software

00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:44,470
from a trusted single vendor so this is

00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:46,360
causing this massive massive rush to the

00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:48,460
cloud you're seeing huge announcements

00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:51,730
from companies like IBM launching cloud

00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:53,290
marketplaces large software companies

00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:56,170
that are either thinking about how they

00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:58,870
can migrate their proprietary assets to

00:07:56,170 --> 00:08:01,360
the cloud to offer them on-demand to

00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:02,680
customers via a subscription model or

00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,080
they're thinking about maybe how they

00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:06,490
can aggregate different sets of tools

00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:09,520
together and become that trusted

00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:12,430
provider to offer these solutions to end

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:16,480
users via marketplace or via a different

00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:18,460
channel now just out of curiosity how

00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:23,290
many Aya's V's are in the room today

00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:27,070
how many software vendors many looks

00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:28,720
like around half so it for the IV's in

00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:29,920
the room you're very familiar with with

00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,390
the pain points associated with

00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:34,000
distributing your application through

00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:36,070
this this changing model so you

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,370
essentially have two routes to market

00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:42,600
you have one you can sell direct to the

00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:45,460
end-user either through SEO SEM

00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,690
word-of-mouth coming to conferences like

00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:50,110
this and it's actually looking for

00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:51,640
customers to offer your product too if

00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:53,260
you want to take the channel route if

00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:55,000
you want to sell through some of these

00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:56,980
aggregators that are packaged

00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,810
and offering these tools to their end

00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:01,630
users then you have to think about

00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:03,190
performing custom one-off integrations

00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:04,630
with every single channel that you would

00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:07,150
like to distribute through whether

00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:09,280
that's a Microsoft or maybe you know a

00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:10,720
Heroku or a pivotal cloud founder

00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:13,390
whoever it is that's offering these

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,160
these tools and services it requires an

00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:18,310
additional integration for every single

00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:21,250
point of distribution so that leads us

00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:24,460
to this concept of cloud service

00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:25,050
brokerage or CSV so what exactly does

00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:27,430
that mean

00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:29,170
cloud service brokerage was a it was

00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:31,360
actually coined by Gartner and the

00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:33,930
definition is it's a single point of

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:38,440
aggregation through which consumers can

00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:41,380
purchase discover consume and manage

00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:43,540
cloud services all through a single

00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:46,350
plane of glass and the way that we've

00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:49,540
addressed that is by providing a

00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:52,690
developer portal where services can be

00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:54,910
on-boarded and integrated and then once

00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:57,970
they're published into a catalogue they

00:09:54,910 --> 00:10:01,210
can be syndicated across a network of

00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:02,800
marketplaces that we are powering for a

00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:04,780
variety of different brands around the

00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,210
world and that of course is sending

00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:10,390
these applications to the device to the

00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:12,070
operating system to whatever location

00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:15,520
the end user actually wants to use to

00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:17,350
consume these services so a little bit

00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:19,870
about the history of cloud service

00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:22,900
brokerage so app Direct did not invent

00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:25,660
the model the cloud service brokerages

00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:27,040
is is an old concept but it has never

00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:29,020
been performed the way that it's

00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:32,680
performed today so before app Direct

00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:34,510
existed CSP was likely bringing their

00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:36,370
own catalogue of services to the table

00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:38,560
either proprietary applications that

00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:41,740
they owned or they were asking vendors

00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:45,010
to perform a custom integration into

00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:47,530
their platform they would have to build

00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:49,630
basic search so that you can search and

00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:52,060
browse through this catalog you need to

00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:55,120
build Identity and Access Management to

00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:56,860
allow users to consume and control who

00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,990
has the consumption rights of the tools

00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:00,910
that they're procuring and then you have

00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:02,620
to think about billing how do you charge

00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:05,830
subscriptions for these applications

00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:08,080
that you're offering so in the past the

00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:08,529
model was very bring your own licenses

00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,980
very

00:11:08,529 --> 00:11:13,870
common there was very very lightweight

00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:16,269
upfront fees associated with the

00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:19,060
distribution of software and the target

00:11:16,269 --> 00:11:20,399
customers for these marketplaces or or

00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:22,589
these tools was of course the

00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:25,029
administrators of the applications so

00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:28,329
the provisioning that occurred would go

00:11:25,029 --> 00:11:30,959
to the first admin company and then that

00:11:28,329 --> 00:11:33,610
the admin of that company was forced to

00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:36,939
distribute licenses to their end-users

00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:38,980
to the consumers of that software if you

00:11:36,939 --> 00:11:42,730
look at when app direct launched back in

00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:45,639
2011 we changed the model very much we

00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:47,860
introduced an integrated catalog of

00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:51,209
software as-a-service solutions with

00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:53,709
tools like office 365 box Symantec

00:11:51,209 --> 00:11:56,709
DocuSign applications that were relevant

00:11:53,709 --> 00:11:58,329
for business consumption and we built a

00:11:56,709 --> 00:12:00,790
platform that includes search

00:11:58,329 --> 00:12:02,649
provisioning Identity and Access

00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:03,730
Management single sign-on into all the

00:12:02,649 --> 00:12:06,189
applications that are offered through

00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:07,839
the catalog and then of course robust

00:12:06,189 --> 00:12:09,670
subscription and billing management via

00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,259
our acquisition of je billing the the

00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:13,660
billing company and we targeted

00:12:11,259 --> 00:12:17,230
primarily large Internet service

00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:20,079
providers online retailers even cable

00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:22,120
companies that had strong business

00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,920
relationships with with small medium

00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:25,779
businesses Identity and Access

00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,399
Management relationships and and most

00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:29,410
importantly a billing relationship with

00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:31,600
with these customers and for the first

00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:33,459
time we were enabling businesses to

00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,160
purchase software in the context of a

00:12:33,459 --> 00:12:38,100
team from an end-user as opposed to

00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:41,889
maybe the administrator divvying out

00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:43,269
licenses and then of course today why

00:12:41,889 --> 00:12:45,129
are we here today and why are we talking

00:12:43,269 --> 00:12:47,050
about platform as a service we've

00:12:45,129 --> 00:12:50,680
extended this functionality in this

00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:52,509
technology to onboard a catalog of

00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:55,240
applications that also address

00:12:52,509 --> 00:12:57,699
Enterprise developer markets and small

00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:00,910
developer teams so things like database

00:12:57,699 --> 00:13:03,339
as a service with database is a

00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:06,249
service with the Redis New Relic send

00:13:03,339 --> 00:13:08,529
grid for email delivery and by targeting

00:13:06,249 --> 00:13:11,079
these types of is fees to onboard and

00:13:08,529 --> 00:13:13,209
distribute through the our network we've

00:13:11,079 --> 00:13:15,699
targeted infrastructure as a service

00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:18,870
players deeper in the stack platform as

00:13:15,699 --> 00:13:21,550
a service and software as a service

00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:22,240
companies as well to become that single

00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:24,370
point of aggregate

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,649
to distribute this content to their end

00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:31,170
users and in a context that makes sense

00:13:26,649 --> 00:13:33,399
so why platform is service why partner

00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:36,940
why partnership between cloud foundry

00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:38,320
and app direct so I'm sure many of you

00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:40,480
were here for the keynote yesterday that

00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:43,390
was delivered by by Paul Maritz who

00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,430
talked about the importance of the Cloud

00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:48,370
Foundry foundation and ultimately that

00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:51,850
the goal is to provide an open ecosystem

00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:53,890
for the cloud and in order for us to

00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:58,230
accomplish an open ecosystem for the

00:13:53,890 --> 00:14:00,940
cloud services are a critical element of

00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:02,350
deriving the best use and functionality

00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:07,420
out of platform as a service

00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:09,690
specifically Cloud Foundry so we started

00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:12,250
talking with pivotal actually back in

00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:13,959
2011 when they were a part of VMware and

00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:16,990
they came to us with this this concept

00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:19,540
of of app services and providers and

00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:21,820
expressed an interest to bring in a

00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:25,180
leading catalog of third-party services

00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:27,700
that are delivered over the web consumed

00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:29,649
on demand and can be plugged in to

00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,540
applications that have been pushed and

00:14:29,649 --> 00:14:34,899
are running and scaling with Cloud

00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:36,520
Foundry so how did we how did we

00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:38,560
actually perform this integration what

00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:41,589
does this this partnership look like and

00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:43,329
how to work so app direct of course

00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:45,910
brings a software as a Service Catalog

00:14:43,329 --> 00:14:47,770
to the table and we performed an

00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:50,380
integration with the Cloud Foundry

00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:52,959
service broker most recently that the v2

00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:55,660
service broker that essentially injects

00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:58,029
the app direct product catalog into any

00:14:55,660 --> 00:15:00,220
Cloud Foundry environment that has

00:14:58,029 --> 00:15:03,579
access to the cloud controller into it

00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:05,680
to the service broker calling this API

00:15:03,579 --> 00:15:08,470
will enable the end user or the

00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:10,540
developer using Cloud Foundry to fetch a

00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:13,720
catalog and a list of all the services

00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:15,720
that are available via app direct it

00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:18,370
will enable that end user to

00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:20,230
automatically provision an account with

00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:22,870
the third-party software as a service

00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:26,279
provider and then lastly they can even

00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:28,959
perform an automatic automated binding

00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:31,240
action that would tie the environmental

00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:33,370
variables or whatever manual piece of

00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,840
configuration that's required to use

00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:36,490
that third-party tool

00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:38,140
and inject that into the application

00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:41,560
that they're running within cloud

00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:44,650
foundry and all of this is command line

00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:46,750
addressable or via the GUI that's

00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:50,140
running at run dot pivotal i/o right now

00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:52,810
pivotal Web Services this is a diagram

00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:55,570
of the service broker integration here

00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:57,130
on the right hand side on the left hand

00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:58,480
you'll see a list of the actions at the

00:15:57,130 --> 00:16:00,550
end user might perform whether it's

00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:04,300
creating an account with SendGrid or

00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:06,550
it's deleting a service or it's a

00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:09,220
binding a service into an app that

00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:11,260
they're running and as all that passes

00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:13,870
through the cloud controller it's sent

00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:16,150
via the v2 service broker to app direct

00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:18,460
where we serve as that adapter to then

00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:20,560
send a unified event to the ISP to

00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:24,940
actually respond to that action and

00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:27,640
deliver by the end user so app Direct

00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:30,130
serves as that catalog for provisioning

00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:32,920
of these services but provisioning an

00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:35,230
account with the third party is v is not

00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:37,180
enough it's very simple to go and create

00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:40,000
an account with with send greater with

00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:43,420
New Relic or one of the applications in

00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,460
the catalog but the ultimate value that

00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:48,250
we are bringing to the to the table for

00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:50,830
these IVs is enabling them to sell their

00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:51,940
products through a trusted provider like

00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:54,130
pivotal Cloud Foundry

00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:57,220
so not just provisioning but also

00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:59,290
billing for these applications and so we

00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:01,830
took the service broker integration a

00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:04,780
step further with pivotal Cloud Foundry

00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:07,120
and what we did was since app Direct is

00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:10,150
handling all the metering and rating and

00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:13,209
subscription logic remittance payout

00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:15,820
processing all of that information that

00:17:13,209 --> 00:17:18,420
is extremely complex for you know

00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:20,650
provider to recognize themselves we're

00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:22,870
translating all of that information and

00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:26,380
sending it to an API endpoint at pivotal

00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:28,300
that enables them to add not only you

00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:29,920
know the runtimes that an end user is

00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:32,320
procuring the apps that they're pushing

00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:34,030
into Cloud Foundry but also the

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:37,210
third-party services that they're buying

00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:38,770
all as single line items on to the one

00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:40,720
build that they pay with their

00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:43,470
subscription for pivotal Web Services on

00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,470
a monthly basis

00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:51,350
so that led us to this concept of last

00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:53,450
application delivery so as we were

00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:55,010
building out this integration many of

00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:58,540
the ISPs that that we talked to

00:17:55,010 --> 00:18:02,830
expressed that they experienced a

00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:05,900
drop-off with this final point of manual

00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:06,530
configuration that's needed to run many

00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:09,320
of the software-as-a-service

00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:12,080
applications that are delivered so a

00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:13,670
good example is with app performance

00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,280
monitoring and management with with

00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:19,700
tools like New Relic or app dynamics

00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:22,070
they require the end user to essentially

00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:24,800
drop in an agent whether it's a yam will

00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:27,440
file or whatever it might be into the VM

00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:28,640
or into the application instance that

00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,830
they're running in order to actually

00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:33,140
start tracking information from their

00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:34,430
application with email delivery with

00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:36,830
with folks like send grade or mail

00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:38,720
ground and postmark they all require the

00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:41,000
configuration the manual configuration

00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,320
of SMTP email credentials with the

00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,940
application that you're running so that

00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,080
you can start sending emails from from

00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:46,880
your instance

00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:48,440
and then lastly with with database as a

00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,470
service with folks like and Redis

00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:52,820
and elephant sequel they require hooking

00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:54,560
up the environmental variables of the

00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:56,630
app of the database that you've

00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,950
purchased and configured tying it to the

00:18:56,630 --> 00:19:01,700
application that you actually want to

00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:04,910
cache data from so ultimately what this

00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:06,740
represents is one additional last mile

00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:08,720
action that's required from the

00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:10,670
developer or the end user to get the

00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,200
full utility out of this service that

00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:16,340
they've procured from the marketplace

00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:19,790
and so what we did was we built what we

00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:22,010
call you know our service binding api's

00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:24,860
in conjunction with pivotal that

00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:27,650
essentially adapts one action that's

00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:30,440
provided from the end user in pivotal

00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:33,590
they can simply issue a command line

00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:35,660
reference to you know CF bind service or

00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:38,630
they can go into the GUI and say that

00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:41,090
they'd like to bind the the application

00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:42,560
to the the service to the application

00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:44,420
that they're running in Cloud Foundry an

00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:47,210
app track will receive that event

00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:49,130
translate it and send it to the ISP in a

00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:52,160
manner that enables them to perform that

00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:54,440
op that action in an automated manner so

00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,970
that you can more quickly buy a database

00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,770
attach it to the app that you're running

00:19:55,970 --> 00:20:01,930
than you would if you would go to

00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:01,930
the database provider directly yourself

00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:07,280
so how do we package all this

00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:09,520
information into an end-user experience

00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:14,060
that that makes sense we've talked about

00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:16,820
discovery purchasing binding billing at

00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:19,910
our core app Direct is a marketplace as

00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:22,850
a service platform that means that we

00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:24,680
power software as a service oriented

00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:27,080
marketplace and we extend that

00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:30,710
functionality out to providers like like

00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:32,480
Cloud Foundry some providers choose to

00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:35,270
have app direct a white label our

00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:37,370
marketplace template and skinned it to

00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:39,290
fit their brands and integrate it into

00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:42,020
their website a good example would be

00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:44,060
Samsung Knox's marketplace their mobile

00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:46,130
marketplace they were happy with app

00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:48,500
direct to provide a skin template that

00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:50,510
fit their branding needs alternatively

00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:52,880
pivotal Cloud Foundry really pushed us

00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:55,070
as a platform and said hey you know we

00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:57,530
we acquired pivotal labs where we're a

00:20:55,070 --> 00:21:00,230
heavy dev shop we have the talent and

00:20:57,530 --> 00:21:02,030
the resources to build out phenomenal

00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:04,520
user experience in front end ourselves

00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:06,590
but we want app direct to provide that

00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,940
back end heavy lifting for billing and

00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:10,550
provisioning and binding of these

00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:12,800
third-party services so can we use your

00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:15,320
marketplace but bring that to our end

00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:18,800
users within run dot pivotal IO within

00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:21,560
our console itself so we extended a set

00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:23,960
of API is actually first in the context

00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:26,750
of a pivotal that enable them to consume

00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:28,370
all of the the catalogue services all of

00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:31,430
the marketplace functionality from app

00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:33,650
direct and ingest that into run dot

00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:35,120
pivotal IO into their dashboard so that

00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:38,120
the end user never has to leave

00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,680
Rhonda vallejo they never have to leave

00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:41,570
the command line that's where they want

00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:44,650
to perform these actions all of that is

00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:48,280
pulled into the context of the

00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:48,280
experience that they want to achieve

00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:54,020
so to summarize a couple of the

00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:57,110
opportunities that we have here today

00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:58,490
via this this this integration and how

00:21:57,110 --> 00:22:02,500
it provides relevance to everybody in

00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:04,550
the room so for the cloud is v's the

00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:07,190
catalog that app direct brings to the

00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:09,470
table represents one single point of

00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:11,690
integration that you can perform for

00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:13,850
provisioning for billing for

00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:15,980
identity and access management one

00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:17,750
integration to maintain that will enable

00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:22,009
your application to be distributed

00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:23,570
across a network of marketplaces we

00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:25,519
provide automated provisioning and

00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:27,350
account creation for users that buy your

00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:28,669
application through pivotal Cloud

00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:31,779
Foundry and every cloud foundry

00:22:28,669 --> 00:22:34,460
deployment we provide that last mile

00:22:31,779 --> 00:22:37,309
manual configuration by providing our

00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:39,590
binding api's to enable whatever manual

00:22:37,309 --> 00:22:41,360
configuration your app requires to be

00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:43,879
injected into the application that is

00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,769
running within Cloud Foundry and then

00:22:43,879 --> 00:22:48,320
lastly from a billing standpoint we

00:22:45,769 --> 00:22:50,690
handle monthly payouts reconciliation

00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:53,960
remittance so that you receive one bill

00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:55,519
from one vendor that represents the

00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:57,169
revenue that you're generating from the

00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:58,820
sale of your product across every

00:22:57,169 --> 00:23:01,220
marketplace that is powered by app

00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:04,000
direct and then for any of the Cloud

00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:07,370
Foundry operators that are in the room

00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:10,429
the integration that we built with Cloud

00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:12,409
Foundry and via the service broker is an

00:23:10,429 --> 00:23:14,389
out-of-the-box integration that comes

00:23:12,409 --> 00:23:17,690
with open source Cloud Foundry code and

00:23:14,389 --> 00:23:20,960
can immediately be used to call the app

00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:23,870
direct product catalog offer a set of

00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,370
services that are delivered on demand to

00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:27,049
your customers and to your developers

00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:30,740
that are using your Cloud Foundry

00:23:27,049 --> 00:23:32,779
instance we provide consolidated billing

00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:34,730
for all of the applications that are

00:23:32,779 --> 00:23:37,009
purchased by your end-users in the

00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:38,899
context of your Cloud Foundry deployment

00:23:37,009 --> 00:23:40,940
and that can be integrated into the bill

00:23:38,899 --> 00:23:43,669
that you have with your end-user on a

00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:45,559
monthly basis all of this of course is

00:23:43,669 --> 00:23:48,379
command line a Dressel from your

00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:50,539
end-users and lastly this is going to

00:23:48,379 --> 00:23:52,789
help you may notice your Cloud Foundry

00:23:50,539 --> 00:23:55,370
investment your Cloud Foundry project

00:23:52,789 --> 00:23:57,279
from day one so offering a set of

00:23:55,370 --> 00:24:00,500
services which is a critical component

00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:03,740
to to accomplishing an open ecosystem

00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:05,870
for cloud if something is something that

00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:08,120
we can help bring value to your

00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:09,620
developers to your customers right away

00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:13,070
from the from the minute that they start

00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:14,389
using your Cloud Foundry instance so

00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:16,759
with that I like to thank you for your

00:24:14,389 --> 00:24:18,139
