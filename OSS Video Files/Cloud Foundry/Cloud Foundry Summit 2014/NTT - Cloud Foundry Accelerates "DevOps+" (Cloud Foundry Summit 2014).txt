Title: NTT - Cloud Foundry Accelerates "DevOps+" (Cloud Foundry Summit 2014)
Publication date: 2014-07-18
Playlist: Cloud Foundry Summit 2014
Description: 
	Yas Naoi
NTT Innovation Institue, Inc.

We will introduce our Cloud Foundry Integration project to accelerate DevOps. We all know that the DevOps approach brings developers and operators into closer collaboration, but the requirements of each team member are different. In order to tie these various requirements together, we package the entire agile development process as "DevOps+" including issue management, software design, code implementation, quality testing, systems deployment, security check, release management and its operation in the cloud. This session will provide a demo of "DevOps+" with the integration of Cloud Foundry.

00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:14,230
[Music]

00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:18,260
I'm actually part of the engineering

00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:20,840
innovation Institute so if your

00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:23,210
activities are an R&D center and

00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:26,690
consumer body of entity groups

00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:30,110
so I'm country and Katrina evolves plus

00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:33,110
the government population which we call

00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:36,380
the boss plus today I'm going to talk

00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:40,840
about our DevOps and calendaring

00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:45,370
integration how fondly Liberace's DevOps

00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:48,470
so let me start with your tables today

00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:51,440
so when we think about the agile

00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:54,680
software development project we have a

00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:57,640
different stakeholders those different

00:00:54,680 --> 00:01:02,210
state portal such as here product owner

00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:05,209
developers QA t for an operator those

00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:07,549
people have a different door and

00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:12,799
different interest and there are

00:01:07,549 --> 00:01:14,990
actually unliving the trilogy in Sdn

00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:17,810
project which is a commercial

00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:19,750
development and we are actually using

00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:23,920
Vegeta

00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:26,860
and develop is mechanical and according

00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:30,790
to here are deep pan and we ultimately

00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:35,310
ended test and then QA people are also

00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:38,380
automate the testing by using objective

00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:41,170
we are Christians in our application

00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:43,510
into the cloud by using the share that

00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:46,150
the operator is a leader in dia soccer

00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:48,580
that is happening in our agile

00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:52,320
development project and the product

00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:55,450
owner is i interrupting to the adults

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:58,180
cheating neighbors like a developer to a

00:01:55,450 --> 00:02:00,850
team operators in the deliberative

00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:04,180
Eugenia doors kind of choose like the

00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:08,160
share to Jenkins and I need a like NASA

00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:11,830
Eclipse also interacting to their people

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:14,500
and abetters also walk interact India

00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:17,860
you know team members what is happening

00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:21,970
mania complicated interactions even

00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:25,090
though we are using the automation trail

00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:28,470
but is happening a project in you know

00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:31,380
this kind of New York interaction so we

00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:35,200
want to introduce your different stuff

00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:37,890
so that's simple we want to arrange the

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,420
start this kind of process like I know a

00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:44,769
project management development

00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:48,040
deployment testing operation in the

00:02:44,769 --> 00:02:50,920
center of year of this cycle we want to

00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:54,580
put here some demos transpiration this

00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:59,500
is how appear to have the methodology of

00:02:54,580 --> 00:03:03,700
the other development process so we want

00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:07,450
to seek visibility software quality and

00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:11,140
productivity time to market and then we

00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:16,590
want to reduce the cost by practicing

00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:21,230
via de box so maybe we want

00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:25,140
crowd murmuring tradition so let me

00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:29,160
think about gr starting application so

00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:31,319
we deployed a PF startup OS installed

00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:34,700
everywhere compiled called

00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:37,590
intercom creation and start application

00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:42,060
you need to write the objective of zip

00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:44,910
code but as you know what we all know

00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:48,360
nothing to write just be call with your

00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:53,100
one just comment yes first we use me

00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:57,750
acknowledge we're happy just basically

00:03:53,100 --> 00:04:00,330
so we integrated our DevOps trust

00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:03,230
asphalt like this so you can see the

00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:08,400
winter rain and drinking job like this

00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:12,049
so again we are we focused on the this

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:15,000
the box press cycle and automation and

00:04:12,049 --> 00:04:18,150
testing automation and deployment and

00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,180
the more strength for using the cross

00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:24,840
country we can accelerate this kind of

00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:27,960
process so again go back to the

00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:30,990
dashboard we can put the motor in widget

00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:33,930
by giving information from the public

00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:36,110
platform and the mood of the application

00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:36,110
is

00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:42,850
automate our jobs like this so we want

00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:47,380
to achieve by using the uttermost brass

00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:50,710
dashboard by the way yes this is kinda

00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:52,720
of productive way yes the truth this is

00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:55,240
a compound to share the common

00:04:52,720 --> 00:05:00,880
information and common plug-in display

00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:03,070
the dev of our our practice so we want

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,710
to achieve here we find interface

00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:07,420
end-to-end visibility

00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:11,530
concrete transparency through this

00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:14,250
dashboard in answer to that by using the

00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:16,750
territory we can get the agility

00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:20,290
accelerate continuous integration and

00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:30,070
continuous different ok so let me go

00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:33,640
through the demonstration so so this is

00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:35,880
a dashboard loading screen of your dev

00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:40,540
of trust

00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:42,820
so let me go beyond the manager first so

00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:46,210
when we go in the money road of the

00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:48,169
manager we can see the task list by

00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:51,289
giving information from

00:05:48,169 --> 00:05:54,889
Tina so we are integrating the JIRA

00:05:51,289 --> 00:05:57,800
information with the objectives testing

00:05:54,889 --> 00:06:02,029
result like this an email me Ksenia

00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:03,770
hydration bound on Life Church and if

00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:06,889
Malaysia what's this thing here what is

00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:09,139
going on in the product we can list up

00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:11,479
here these kind of their job-based from

00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:13,879
the genius and the manager just sleep

00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:18,080
well as long as we can see the economy

00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:22,250
icon and activity screen is the average

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:33,889
going off if I close the manager

00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:41,589
realized so India a little different

00:06:33,889 --> 00:06:47,589
screen like this so we see the test but

00:06:41,589 --> 00:06:47,589
just like I know I go home I - poor and

00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:56,640
to check them when they were performing

00:06:51,970 --> 00:07:00,550
appalling the grocery listing by Jenkins

00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:03,010
and then so in this demonstration let's

00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:07,380
pretend of yeah we're a develop tickler

00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:11,890
this kind of the 3d JavaScript based

00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:15,820
application so so here we only have be a

00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:18,940
table so we want to ask something really

00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:20,820
about PR here so this is a source code

00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:29,770
up here

00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:33,250
and when I add the real I'm here we only

00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:36,540
have the table but I'm adding the severe

00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:36,540
headaches and bleep

00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:49,310
and then call me the court and then the

00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:53,360
what row should happen the location goes

00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:57,500
to the to the person and then today I am

00:07:53,360 --> 00:08:08,180
looking up here party leaders to

00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:11,110
ultimately yes so this video of the end

00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:14,630
of this is a few whale or population

00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:19,130
people scream so these are the boundary

00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:30,560
deployment application like this

00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:35,930
and so if I prepare production deploy

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:41,080
and prickly atomic and then what is

00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:43,909
happening is that you know if I see here

00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:47,390
the screen here India walk Rome from

00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:50,660
start for cheaper staging deploy and

00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:52,270
finish these are all information coming

00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:55,400
from the

00:08:52,270 --> 00:09:05,600
problem being intubation so now this is

00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:09,200
designed demo so uploading the and then

00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:12,730
the back row is talking containers when

00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:17,660
the application is deployed to the

00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:22,600
platform then yes so they're growing a

00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:27,140
finish and then this is well output

00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:29,210
console is coming from the Argentine's

00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:33,550
in a way I clicked in your products from

00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:38,620
here then you can see video cable and

00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:38,620
here enjoy

00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:42,139
well actually

00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:56,120
I think this is my transport to UT

00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:59,720
apparently by integrating the attention

00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:02,540
well by using the dashboard - sorry

00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:04,880
well by using the dashboard we can share

00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:06,470
this kind of information and cooperation

00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,380
with the authorities

00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:11,370
thank you very much for listening

00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:14,659
[Applause]
