Title: Intel & Pivotal - Hack for Good (and Profit) (Cloud Foundry Summit 2014)
Publication date: 2014-07-29
Playlist: Cloud Foundry Summit 2014
Description: 
	Business track breakout session presented by Cornelia Davis, Platform Engineer, Cloud Foundry, Pivotal; and Catherine Spence, Principal Engineer and Architect, Intel.

Hackathons are fun events where developers innovate, learn and build development communities. Whether conducted in an academic setting or a corporate one, the aim is to rapidly produce functional code implementations focused around one or more designated themes. Cloud Foundry is a perfect target platform for hackathons, since it supports fast application deployment for continuous integration, abstracted infrastructure, and ample technology choices in terms of buildpacks and services. For those less familiar with cloud computing, Cloud Foundry provides an ideal opportunity for participants to be introduced to new application hosting techniques (Platform as a Service) and learn keys concepts of building applications for the cloud.

In this session we will share our experiences in leveraging Cloud Foundry in support of numerous hackathons. We'll discuss what worked well, and less so, and we will share with you why and how you can deliver your own hackathon event.

00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:13,710
okay so first we're going to talk about

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:15,529
just a little overview of you know so

00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:17,369
you know why we run a hackathon and

00:00:15,529 --> 00:00:18,960
personally I think there are really two

00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:20,939
main reasons why you might run a

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,529
hackathon one is you're trying to bring

00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:25,529
people together in more of a training

00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:27,359
type of a scenario and the the other

00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:29,420
reason is that you want them to get

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,560
together in order to do some work so

00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:33,899
generally in terms of the hackathon

00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,130
there is some type of a theme yep

00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:39,390
absolutely

00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:41,070
and so we the theme isn't always it's

00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:43,050
something like and we'll share with you

00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:44,850
some of those things but sometimes the

00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,620
theme might be as broad as hey we want

00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,710
to do something with Cloud Foundry and

00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:52,260
so those are will give you some very

00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:54,510
anecdotal very concrete examples of

00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,670
those things as we move through some of

00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:58,170
the next following slides yeah I think

00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,579
the key though is that you know it's

00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:01,260
really structured like a competition

00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:03,059
it's a friendly competition although

00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,640
there may be some trash talking going on

00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:07,530
right that is very true so there is some

00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,200
competition element to it and there's

00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:12,659
always like some some judging and some

00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,250
prizes so the idea is you come together

00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:16,890
and you try to make it a really fun

00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:24,180
event and really make the most of the

00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:25,890
the entire you know hackathon okay so

00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,710
why don't we go into a couple of

00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:31,140
examples of hackathons that we've been

00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:32,520
involved with and what I'm gonna do is

00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,140
uh first I'm going to talk a little bit

00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,180
about some of the types of hackathons

00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,560
that we're doing at Intel and then I'll

00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,630
turn it over to Cornelia to talk about

00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,210
some of the things that she's been

00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:44,399
working with the pivotal community on so

00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:46,110
so first of all you know Intel has this

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,970
program that's called code for good and

00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:50,369
if you go on the Intel comm website you

00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:53,189
can you know you can you can see this

00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:55,829
lots of examples of different types of

00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:58,079
hackathons and events around coding in

00:01:55,829 --> 00:02:00,600
in you know in general actually not just

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,490
hackathons and there's a lot of great

00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,439
information there on what's happening in

00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:08,340
different areas a lot of it has to do

00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:10,410
with engaging with students and and

00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,360
having them really you know again it's

00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:13,030
kind of more on the learning side of

00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,990
things having

00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:18,730
learn about new tools and and innovation

00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:21,040
and introduce them more from an academic

00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:23,709
setting into you know more of a

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,959
real-world type of scenario so they

00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:29,290
generally you know the code for good

00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:32,470
team runs you know one in two day

00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:34,989
hackathons and they've had just really

00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:37,060
great results not only does it engage

00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:39,340
with the student community but also it

00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:42,030
tends to be a theme that has to do with

00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:44,830
some type of social responsibility so

00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:47,320
you know so again kind of combining

00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:49,019
those different purposes together and in

00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,830
fact Cornelia and I actually

00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:52,840
participated in a code for good

00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:55,989
hackathon at the Intel Developer Forum

00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:57,819
last year yeah and it was quite cool the

00:02:55,989 --> 00:02:59,260
theme there I don't know if it was

00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:01,930
something that you chose or somebody in

00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:03,580
the program so I'm guilty so Cathy's

00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:06,489
guilty so the theme there was really

00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:08,890
fantastic it was about teaching math

00:03:06,489 --> 00:03:11,500
skills to junior high students and so

00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:14,319
the the individuals that were coding

00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,590
there were actually mostly students from

00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:20,320
a junior college here in the local area

00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:22,660
from cuesta college contra contrary

00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:25,239
quested contra Costa College or

00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:27,370
something like that I'm not from the

00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:30,329
local bay area so I apologize if I've

00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:32,620
butchered your alma mater x' name but

00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:35,590
it's a tongue twister it's a tongue

00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:38,170
twister so that experience was really

00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:41,829
great and that was done actually on the

00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:44,049
idea show floor so the students were and

00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:46,000
in one of the things that I thought was

00:03:44,049 --> 00:03:49,000
really cool was that Intel had rolled

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,760
out some of their own new hardware at

00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,070
the show and had Cloud Foundry deployed

00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,320
on that behind the walls on the show

00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:58,630
floor booth so the students were sitting

00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:00,040
out in the beanbag chairs and people

00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:01,450
were milling around on what are these

00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,160
kids doing here and they're in the

00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:05,320
beanbag chairs and they're all coding

00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:07,660
and the server was right behind one of

00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:10,329
those temporary walls and Cloud Foundry

00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:15,040
was running on that of that new server

00:04:10,329 --> 00:04:17,229
smell absolutely right yep so and and

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:20,229
actually they loved Cornelia so much

00:04:17,229 --> 00:04:22,210
they invited her to Georgia Tech to do

00:04:20,229 --> 00:04:23,409
another hackathon with some students at

00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:25,570
Georgia Tech which was pretty cool

00:04:23,409 --> 00:04:26,590
yeah the Georgia Tech experience I want

00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:28,960
to share with you

00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:33,100
the theme there was battling childhood

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:35,169
obesity so the the some of the teens

00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,669
that engaged in things they did all

00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:38,860
sorts of different different things but

00:04:36,669 --> 00:04:41,410
one of the teams did kind of a

00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:43,750
geocaching type of a thing we're using a

00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:45,130
mobile phone they would be given points

00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,870
where they needed to go to a particular

00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:49,570
point to pick up a clue for the next

00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:51,250
point and so on and one of the cool

00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:52,990
things was that we actually got outside

00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:56,770
I think it was in February but we had a

00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:58,570
fairly warm day and in Georgia and we

00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:00,520
got to run around and that we have some

00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:02,830
video of the teams actually sprinting

00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:06,160
around the campus and it really really

00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:08,800
is a very fun environment a really fun

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,110
way of getting people hands-on not just

00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:16,180
to dry things so hopefully it's not too

00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:17,590
dry tonight but okay so you know so

00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,880
that's an example of doing something

00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:21,340
where you know you're kind of training

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,810
the next generation and you know people

00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:24,729
are building new skills and you're doing

00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:27,070
something that's also got that social

00:05:24,729 --> 00:05:28,389
responsibility aspect to it but you know

00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:32,140
next I'm going to talk about a different

00:05:28,389 --> 00:05:35,320
type of hackathon that my team has been

00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:38,890
sponsoring an Intel IT in order to

00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:39,760
replace instructor-led training so what

00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:41,260
we're trying to do is we're trying to

00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,870
get people to write applications that

00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:45,190
run well in a cloud and it doesn't

00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:47,650
actually matter if you're writing for

00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:49,690
platform as a service or infrastructure

00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:52,030
as a service the how you structure your

00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:53,979
application a lot of those principles

00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:56,919
are the same and so we wanted to teach

00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:58,780
them about those principles so so we

00:05:56,919 --> 00:06:00,580
sponsored a series of hackathons we did

00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:02,530
about eight of them trained over a

00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:05,560
hundred developers we did it globally

00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:07,330
and it was highly successful but I have

00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,870
to tell you that I had an ulterior

00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:11,020
motive

00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:13,870
my evil plan was to introduce them to

00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:15,820
cloud foundry platform is a service the

00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:19,570
concept around platform as a service and

00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:22,180
so not only did we train them on cloud

00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:24,340
aware apps but they had to deploy their

00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:26,789
apps on cloud foundry using platform as

00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:30,280
a service and it actually served as

00:06:26,789 --> 00:06:33,960
really some demand generation for us an

00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:36,660
IT of showing them how to use

00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:40,050
you know these modern techniques and and

00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:42,030
tools like Cloud Foundry so you can see

00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:43,380
here there were you know but you know I

00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:45,210
like I said we had eight of them

00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:47,520
globally we trained over a hundred

00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:49,170
developers you can see the structure of

00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,060
it where you know we made sure that we

00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:52,500
fed everybody and we did have fun tools

00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:54,090
and we had a team that was available

00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,950
that wandered around I called them the

00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:57,930
roadside assistance team and they walked

00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:59,880
around they helped people actually get

00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:02,910
their applications deployed and were

00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:05,280
there to answer any coding questions so

00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:07,320
that's an example of an enterprise and

00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:11,760
it was a one-day format just a one-day

00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:13,590
hackathon super and so I wanted to share

00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,660
a couple of other experiences with you

00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:17,280
kind of more along the enterprise front

00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:20,100
like Kathy was just talking about on the

00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:22,670
previous slide so I wanted to share with

00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:26,190
you that within the Cloud Foundry team

00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:30,080
itself at pivotal we do hack hackathons

00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:33,450
as well so they're really less about

00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:36,420
education or less about getting some

00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:38,070
work done and we're not doing anything

00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:40,920
like we're doing with the Intel hack for

00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:42,390
good but it's really much more of a hey

00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,760
let's just let off some steam

00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:46,530
let's we've been doing we've been

00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:48,450
working really hard and we just want to

00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:51,270
have a little bit of fun so it's really

00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:54,150
more around morale building creativity

00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:55,380
inspiration and so on that's not to say

00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:59,100
that you don't get something valuable

00:07:55,380 --> 00:08:00,420
something some value beyond those things

00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:02,400
those things are valuing it of

00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:04,290
themselves but it's not to say that you

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,600
don't end up with code that might even

00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:09,450
make it back into the codebase at some

00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:11,520
point but that isn't the goal now the

00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:13,200
format's of those things are and I hate

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,350
to tell you this but sometimes we take a

00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:18,540
day off so if you're watching the news

00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:20,880
groups and all of a sudden you see a day

00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:23,370
where things are kind of down low and

00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:25,440
there's not a lot of issues pull

00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:28,830
requests being done it might be a hack

00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,510
day for us and so we take the whole day

00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:33,660
off there's nothing else that's done

00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:36,090
people work outside of the repositories

00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:38,610
so there you're not working off of your

00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:40,919
code branches we encourage people to

00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:43,140
take if they want to fork a repository

00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:45,060
and work on something that's fine but

00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:47,100
there isn't any work done direct

00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:48,480
on the master branches because that's

00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:50,730
really not the point

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:54,000
we step away from the back logs for the

00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:57,000
day it's a one-day event and people are

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,520
encouraged to either form groups or work

00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,410
individually the big kicker and we

00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:04,230
talked about prizes now there's no

00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:05,730
particular you get to take home an iPad

00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:08,640
or anything like that at the end of the

00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:10,080
day but we all know that geeks get a

00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,510
certain amount of pleasure out of just

00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,220
showing what they've done so there's a

00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:16,050
little bit of that that that pride

00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:18,600
factor of at the end of the day

00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:20,250
everybody has a chance to show what they

00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,500
did over the course of the day and

00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:25,470
everybody gets to earn some bragging

00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,820
rights on that so we we we do those

00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:28,260
we've done a couple of them over the

00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:30,780
course of the last I don't know maybe

00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:32,250
six months or so and that's something

00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:35,190
that we've had some really positive

00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:37,950
results on and we'll continue to move

00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:39,660
forward but well you know that the

00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:42,120
bragging is really important Cornelia

00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:43,980
yeah but you know so it Intel's a big

00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,570
company and we actually have a formal

00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:47,460
recognition system where we can

00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:49,920
recognize people so we actually utilize

00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:51,180
that but I did something interesting at

00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,890
the beginning when we started doing some

00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:56,160
of the hackathons I negotiated a deal

00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:58,800
with well we the team negotiated a deal

00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:01,050
with the manager that was responsible

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,490
for PC client services and what we did

00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:04,410
was the winner of the hackathon got to

00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:05,280
go to the top of the PC refresh list and

00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:08,100
they got the latest and greatest

00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:10,680
Ultrabook oh wow that's very cool very

00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:13,080
very cool so the other example that's on

00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,550
this particular slide it comes from our

00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,410
from our customer base so you heard

00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:17,550
Monsanto talking this morning and

00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:19,680
they've done a couple of hackathons

00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:22,470
themselves now they had a slightly

00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:24,960
different focus so they have a backlog

00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:28,020
of things that they want to get to that

00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:29,640
they somehow never get the chance to so

00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:31,530
what they did with their two different

00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:33,210
hackathons that they've run so far as

00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:35,310
they've looked at that backlog it's not

00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:38,610
the backlog of stuff that we need to

00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:39,240
keep the lights on and keep keep the the

00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:41,310
boat afloat

00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,110
it's the backlog of things that they

00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:44,550
want to innovate on and they somehow

00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:46,770
never had the chance

00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:49,560
so they set aside a day and said that

00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:51,500
this day is going to be the day where

00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:54,240
we're going to work on those innovative

00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:56,040
projects now they didn't choose those

00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,970
they actually took a little bit of time

00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,579
ahead

00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:02,730
to choose those topics so they did a

00:10:59,579 --> 00:11:04,649
formal call for papers where people

00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:07,410
within the organization within the

00:11:04,649 --> 00:11:09,149
company could present their ideas for

00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:11,100
those things that they wanted to do

00:11:09,149 --> 00:11:14,370
innovation on and then there was a

00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:16,589
selection process for those handful of

00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:18,980
projects that they're going to work on

00:11:16,589 --> 00:11:23,279
during the hackfest during the hackathon

00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:25,350
now in particular they spanned a broad

00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:27,389
range of things Cloud Foundry was only

00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:29,759
one of the things that they did but they

00:11:27,389 --> 00:11:32,180
used that for example they chose some of

00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:35,459
those things in the call for papers to

00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:39,360
specifically work on their Cloud Foundry

00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:41,009
strategy so they chose things like oh we

00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,110
need a service broker in a particular

00:11:41,009 --> 00:11:46,110
area so we're going to encourage people

00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:48,779
to do a hackathon on building a service

00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:51,480
broker for a specific piece of

00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:53,639
technology or they for example built a

00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:55,500
Bosch release they really wanted to get

00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:57,569
some experience with building a brand

00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,370
new Bosch release so that was one of the

00:11:57,569 --> 00:12:01,589
topics that they selected from the call

00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:04,709
for papers so it's a slightly different

00:12:01,589 --> 00:12:07,079
theme but really Nets some very very

00:12:04,709 --> 00:12:09,569
pragmatic results for them as well and

00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:11,370
very very positive very fun environment

00:12:09,569 --> 00:12:12,899
and they taught people along the way

00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:16,110
kind of along the lines of what you were

00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:18,300
saying right mm-hmm so and then I just

00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:21,829
wanted to share with you earlier if you

00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:24,589
saw the ignite talks way men spoke from

00:12:21,829 --> 00:12:27,149
opaz they did a very interesting

00:12:24,589 --> 00:12:29,279
hackathon that didn't span a single day

00:12:27,149 --> 00:12:32,730
it was actually a six-week five or six

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:34,980
week long process they engaged with an

00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:37,470
open source developer community in China

00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:40,439
and they received hundreds of different

00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:42,689
teams that built applications now they

00:12:40,439 --> 00:12:44,699
did offer cash and prizes so there were

00:12:42,689 --> 00:12:47,370
people that were very motivated to do

00:12:44,699 --> 00:12:49,439
that and they have they had a number of

00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:52,110
they had I think three hundred and fifty

00:12:49,439 --> 00:12:55,019
or so submissions to that they did some

00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:57,600
voting in the public which voted them

00:12:55,019 --> 00:13:01,350
down to the top 100 and then they had

00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:03,600
eight experts that took that top 100

00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:05,819
based on the popular vote and down

00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,490
selected those down to finalists and

00:13:05,819 --> 00:13:10,700
then selected the final winners there

00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:12,870
were some cool prizes like electron

00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:15,180
devices and so on and so there's a

00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:17,160
couple of screenshots from those and I

00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:21,120
pulled those screenshots and these

00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:23,820
results from a paper that that way men

00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,680
shared with us with with his permission

00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:27,660
of course and we're working on a blog

00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,339
post so we'll get some of the details of

00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:32,550
these but there's some interesting

00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:33,900
charts in here you can see that they one

00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:35,160
of the things that I won't go over the

00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:37,080
details here the slides will be

00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:39,690
available you can look at the details on

00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:41,370
what build packs people chose what

00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:42,720
services they chose there's some

00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:45,000
interesting data in there

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,740
but the thing that's I think most

00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,920
interesting that you need to think about

00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:52,230
here is they gathered this data so at

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,570
the end of the hackathon they had a very

00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:57,000
explicit thing that they wanted to

00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:58,770
accomplish which was a survey and they

00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,710
had constructed a survey where they

00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:03,540
asked those questions what's your what

00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:05,279
what background are you coming from are

00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:07,589
you a student are you an industry are

00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:11,550
you a hobbyist and so on what build

00:14:07,589 --> 00:14:14,820
packs did you use what languages did you

00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:16,770
program in what services did you consume

00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:18,839
and these are some of the results that

00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:20,520
they gathered on that so very very

00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:21,780
interesting yeah very interesting so

00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:24,089
there's just all different kinds of

00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:27,120
hackathons that you can sponsor just a

00:14:24,089 --> 00:14:29,370
whole range of things you know and I

00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,890
guess you know using Cloud Foundry is

00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:33,360
really a great tool for for doing these

00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:35,580
hackathons don't you think yeah

00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:39,210
absolutely absolutely and so this is a

00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:40,890
this is a similar slide that you've seen

00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:43,589
earlier I think that James Waters

00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:45,000
presented this morning and for those of

00:14:43,589 --> 00:14:47,400
you who are familiar with Cloud Foundry

00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:51,150
this is going to ring very familiar to

00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:53,250
you really these are the these are some

00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:54,959
of the the main pillars that we consider

00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:57,750
strengths in Cloud Foundry and you can

00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:59,220
see how they shine in hackathons so the

00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:02,040
ones that are highlighted here in yellow

00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:04,530
with the yellow box around it easy to

00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,790
get started so the last thing that you

00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:08,640
want to do if you have a one day

00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:10,970
hackathon is spend that entire day

00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:12,950
standing up your development environment

00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:15,150
standing up the infrastructure

00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:16,470
downloading the right version of TC

00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:19,020
server or whatever your application

00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:21,300
container is installing the right

00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:23,280
language runtime dealing with dependency

00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,970
health all of that stuff that's the last

00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,829
thing you want to

00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:28,230
do you want people to hit the ground

00:15:25,829 --> 00:15:29,100
running and if you saw earlier when I

00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:31,500
talked about

00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:33,240
yeah passes all for the developer well

00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,829
and I and I said it's not all for the

00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:37,829
developer I'll get back to that theme in

00:15:34,829 --> 00:15:39,720
just a moment it is great for the

00:15:37,829 --> 00:15:41,399
developer when I say it's not just for

00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,839
the developer I don't mean it isn't

00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:45,870
great for the developer it is it's

00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:48,089
fantastic for the developer and so Cloud

00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:51,060
Foundry is a great way to get started

00:15:48,089 --> 00:15:52,980
you've got the platform immediately then

00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:54,660
you've got the set of services as well

00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:56,220
so you've got the application running

00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:58,350
environment but then you have the set of

00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,920
services that you could leverage on top

00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:02,129
of that

00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:03,750
so actually anecdotally one of the

00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:06,180
things the first time that I showed up

00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:08,850
at the IDF forum when Kathy invited me

00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:10,740
to participate in that first hackathon I

00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:12,930
thought wow this is gonna be really cool

00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:15,149
I'm gonna be walking around I'm gonna be

00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:17,879
helping people and helping people and

00:16:15,149 --> 00:16:20,069
teaching is what I love to do and I got

00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:22,019
there and I chatted with Kathy gave me

00:16:20,069 --> 00:16:24,300
an opportunity to chat with the with the

00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:27,120
students she had done some training with

00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:29,339
them ahead of time on the platform

00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:32,009
itself and I said hey I'm here from

00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:34,829
pivitol I'm here for you if you have any

00:16:32,009 --> 00:16:36,329
problems of the Cloud Foundry and when I

00:16:34,829 --> 00:16:38,639
was at Georgia Tech I did a similar

00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:40,829
thing did a 45-minute presentation said

00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,870
if you have any trouble I'm over here in

00:16:40,829 --> 00:16:45,209
the corner let me know roadside

00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:47,579
assistance roadside assistance mmm-hmm

00:16:45,209 --> 00:16:49,649
you know what I did i sat there and I

00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:51,990
fiddled I worked on my spring trader

00:16:49,649 --> 00:16:53,129
application nobody ever came to me for

00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:55,050
anything

00:16:53,129 --> 00:16:57,629
you gotta get out getting out get out

00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:59,759
there and yep yep yep so it is it's

00:16:57,629 --> 00:17:01,949
really great for you spinning up but you

00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:06,089
can see now that I've actually expanded

00:17:01,949 --> 00:17:08,189
it so I cannot not mention that when

00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:11,159
you're done with that application with

00:17:08,189 --> 00:17:13,919
that that proof of concept being able to

00:17:11,159 --> 00:17:15,510
operate it then without having to throw

00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:20,159
it over the wall and go through some

00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:22,470
major rework just to be able to deploy

00:17:20,159 --> 00:17:24,449
this into production that's really where

00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:26,250
that box expands to the right and now

00:17:24,449 --> 00:17:29,100
you have the ability to operate it as

00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:30,630
well right okay so why don't we shift

00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:33,059
gears a little bit now we've that we've

00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:35,610
talked about Cloud Foundry for our

00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:36,860
hackathons and just to just touch on

00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:38,420
briefly

00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:40,429
acknowledging the fact that you know you

00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:42,770
do want people to use good cloud aware

00:17:40,429 --> 00:17:44,210
application programming techniques and

00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,740
we have a lot of information that's

00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:47,059
available on that I'm not gonna go

00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,929
through this list but just you know

00:17:47,059 --> 00:17:49,790
because we're running out of time

00:17:47,929 --> 00:17:51,230
actually but there are you know there

00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:53,510
are a number of things that as they're

00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:54,799
doing work on the cloud and deploying

00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:56,600
applications there if you're going to

00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:57,950
use a tool like Cloud Foundry I want to

00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,900
make sure that you're also promoting

00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:01,340
these techniques as well right and I

00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:03,200
want to interject here that actually

00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:04,610
Kathy's being a bit too modest here

00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,260
she's written a couple of really

00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:08,030
fantastic white papers that quite

00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:10,669
frankly we point our customers to all

00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:12,440
the time about building applications

00:18:10,669 --> 00:18:15,440
architecting applications for the cloud

00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:17,330
so I encourage you to google Kathy

00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,890
Spence and in all and you will find

00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:20,600
those white papers that are very very

00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:23,660
Mountain thank you for yeah

00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,950
thank you not planned but okay so why

00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:26,030
don't we just spend some time to you

00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:27,710
talking a little bit about best

00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:30,020
practices for the cloud and we've got

00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:33,080
we've got a couple of slides here one on

00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:34,520
how you organize the event one on you

00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:36,320
know how do you run Cloud Foundry to

00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:38,240
support the event and then another one

00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,070
that is more on when you're actually

00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,780
running the event itself so we'll start

00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:43,280
with this first one around what do you

00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:44,809
need to do in terms of organising the

00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,040
event and again since we don't have a

00:18:44,809 --> 00:18:47,090
lot of time today and these slides will

00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,070
be available we're just going to hit a

00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:50,510
few of these highlights around you know

00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:53,179
really thinking through what's your

00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:55,040
location for your hackathon and do you

00:18:53,179 --> 00:18:57,860
have the right facilities in place to

00:18:55,040 --> 00:19:00,200
actually run the event one of the things

00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:02,360
that I really like here to provide the

00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,770
four basic ingredients food power

00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:06,260
Internet and caffeine and not

00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:07,730
necessarily in that order right so again

00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:08,929
kind of thinking through that you know

00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:10,280
when you're when you're working with a

00:19:08,929 --> 00:19:12,590
group and developers that they love to

00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:14,419
be fed it's funny too they just love

00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:15,470
pizza I don't know I've asked even in

00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:17,540
Asia I asked them what do you want to

00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:18,860
have to eat they told me pizza so it's

00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:20,630
just you know really get you know

00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:22,370
catering to that audience of making it

00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:25,429
fun for them is there anything that

00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:27,669
jumps out to you here Cornelia no I the

00:19:25,429 --> 00:19:30,230
one thing that I would say is that you

00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:32,780
you absolutely have to think these

00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:35,630
things through ahead of time but don't

00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:38,809
feel like you're constrained - oh I need

00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:41,059
rooms with chairs or I need it doesn't

00:19:38,809 --> 00:19:43,730
need to be a traditional environment you

00:19:41,059 --> 00:19:45,860
do need some seriously actually you do

00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:47,300
and it's funny you should say that

00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:49,160
because we didn't have a lot of chairs

00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:50,210
on the IDF floor and then we had to pull

00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:52,460
tables Oh

00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:54,230
so we did have to do that so you do have

00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:56,870
to think about some of those pragmatics

00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:59,090
but really the IDF is is the case in

00:19:56,870 --> 00:20:02,120
point is don't feel like you have to

00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:04,909
have a classroom setting for example so

00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:06,440
going back to that example it was on the

00:20:04,909 --> 00:20:08,000
show floor it was really quite cool

00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:10,159
because people were walking around and

00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,019
going gee what's going on over there

00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,889
well if you people sat down and they

00:20:12,019 --> 00:20:13,970
didn't know they were in the middle of

00:20:12,889 --> 00:20:16,460
the hackathon that's a whole nother

00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:18,110
story yep yep so don't go near it make

00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:20,179
it fun it doesn't have to be a classroom

00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:21,529
setting right the other thing I just

00:20:20,179 --> 00:20:23,960
want to point out on this one before we

00:20:21,529 --> 00:20:25,759
flip over to the next is this grading

00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,990
criteria and setting the rules so that

00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:28,820
when people come into the hackathon that

00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:30,379
they know what the how they're competing

00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:33,289
against other people and one of the

00:20:30,379 --> 00:20:35,480
techniques that we use is we actually

00:20:33,289 --> 00:20:36,559
create a rubric that we hand out so we

00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,750
really understand like I have a point

00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:40,460
structure have a rubric we hand it out

00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:42,590
in advance and the way that we've been

00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:44,360
running those hackathons is that we have

00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:46,190
each team actually pre grade themselves

00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:48,019
and then when we when we come around and

00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:49,730
do the judging we start with their grade

00:20:48,019 --> 00:20:51,740
and then we tweak it from there and it

00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:53,360
saves a lot of time and believe me not

00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:55,759
everybody gives themselves ten sometimes

00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,649
we're our own worst critics but it's

00:20:55,759 --> 00:21:01,399
really been very very successful for the

00:20:57,649 --> 00:21:03,879
grading part of it yep okay so why don't

00:21:01,399 --> 00:21:06,470
we talk about Cloud Foundry sure and so

00:21:03,879 --> 00:21:08,409
the first thing that you need to worry

00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:13,159
about of course is having Cloud Foundry

00:21:08,409 --> 00:21:14,870
availability so oftentimes using so at

00:21:13,159 --> 00:21:17,360
Georgia Tech for example we used run

00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:20,330
pivotal dos so we used the public web

00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:21,590
service that was available at the IDF's

00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:24,169
show floor I already mentioned that

00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:26,029
there was a brand new Intel hardware

00:21:24,169 --> 00:21:28,669
that was running that and Kathy brought

00:21:26,029 --> 00:21:32,090
along some of her incredible staff to

00:21:28,669 --> 00:21:34,370
support that and so those are a couple

00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:36,559
of options now there's another option

00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:39,710
which I point out on there as well as

00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:42,470
sometimes your goal of that the hack

00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:44,360
night or the hackathon and tonight one

00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:46,159
of the topics you might be interested in

00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:48,919
is hey I want to get this thing running

00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:51,379
on my laptop so it might be that your

00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:53,750
clot that is the goal is to get cloud

00:21:51,379 --> 00:21:56,269
from Cloud Foundry running locally on a

00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:58,940
local machine so you might wash light

00:21:56,269 --> 00:22:01,009
might be exactly what you need and I

00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:02,299
have done some workshops with clients

00:22:01,009 --> 00:22:03,590
where the first thing that we do is

00:22:02,299 --> 00:22:05,990
Bosch light and then we

00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:09,500
building Bosch releases for example so

00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:10,640
that's that's an option as well now you

00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:14,150
do want to make sure that you have

00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:16,400
sufficient capacity the nice thing is

00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:18,409
that that's easy to adjust so I remember

00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,809
when we were at the IDF show floor and

00:22:18,409 --> 00:22:23,120
some students we had student teams and

00:22:20,809 --> 00:22:25,159
they had these these sample accounts

00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:27,020
that were originally set up and they

00:22:25,159 --> 00:22:29,570
started saying oh we'll have to delete a

00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:31,340
few apps and I didn't want that we had

00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:33,890
large teams the teams were about a dozen

00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:36,110
students per team and they were kind of

00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:37,429
competing for resources and so I walked

00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:39,110
over to one of your colleagues and I

00:22:37,429 --> 00:22:41,059
said hey we're having some quota

00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:42,649
problems and he came back in about ten

00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:43,880
minutes and said okay we're all set well

00:22:42,649 --> 00:22:47,679
that's the value of the cloud right

00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:50,090
there yep yep exactly exactly

00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:51,679
all right so let's let's talk about so

00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:53,149
you know you so you've organized your

00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:54,470
event you got Cloud Foundry all set up

00:22:53,149 --> 00:22:56,450
now you're actually ready to run the

00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:59,330
event so what are some good tips here

00:22:56,450 --> 00:23:02,240
right so really try to make it as fun as

00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:03,710
possible right and and especially if

00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,299
you're in an enterprise setting you want

00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:07,610
to make sure that they really have time

00:23:05,299 --> 00:23:10,130
to actually participate and they're not

00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:13,039
being pulled away by other commitments

00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:14,840
right also we found that it's really

00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:16,970
helpful to start with some type of an

00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:18,200
overview presentation get people all on

00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:20,450
the same page but you want to keep it

00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:22,789
super short because you want them to

00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:25,159
spend as much time coding as possible

00:23:22,789 --> 00:23:27,529
but you know normally for our cloud

00:23:25,159 --> 00:23:28,700
aware hackathons what we do is we do an

00:23:27,529 --> 00:23:30,260
overview of what does it mean to be

00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,880
cloud aware and then they spend the

00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:34,159
whole day working on those applications

00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:35,990
for example yep what are the other

00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:37,820
things that I'll highlight off of the

00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:42,130
slide here is to consider periodic

00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:44,809
readouts so we are all guilty all

00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:47,960
technologists are guilty of saying I can

00:23:44,809 --> 00:23:50,600
figure this out I can do this I'm all

00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:52,399
right and so particularly in some of

00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:54,770
this the settings where we were working

00:23:52,399 --> 00:23:56,270
with students they they're afraid

00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:57,649
sometimes to admit that they don't know

00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:59,679
how to do something to admit that

00:23:57,649 --> 00:24:02,320
they're stuck oh they never do that but

00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:04,909
but even in an industry setting

00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:07,789
especially if one of your goals is for

00:24:04,909 --> 00:24:09,980
education is don't allow people to get

00:24:07,789 --> 00:24:12,649
stuck and not make the most use of their

00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:15,380
time so at Georgia Tech for example I

00:24:12,649 --> 00:24:16,310
was working with a matthew wolfe

00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:18,320
professor

00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:20,960
there and that was a tip really that I

00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:22,850
picked up from him was I tended to trust

00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,680
that they were okay and doing on their

00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:26,990
own like I said I was pretty bored they

00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:28,700
weren't calling on me but he really made

00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:30,950
the point of every hour and a half and

00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:32,900
we did a 24-hour thing where we stayed

00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:35,660
up all night I say we the Royal we I

00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:38,660
went and slept for four hours too old

00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:41,390
for that and but he every hour and a

00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:44,990
half he would say okay pencils down

00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:47,810
well the metaphorically speaking pencils

00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:49,670
down everybody look up stand up let's

00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:51,560
walk over here and let's do a check-in

00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:52,490
what's your progress report what have

00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:55,160
you done so far

00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:56,900
and that is really where we teased out

00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,910
some times that they were headed down a

00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:00,350
wrong path maybe they were starting to

00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:01,940
build a monolith maybe they were

00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:03,410
starting to hard-code something and

00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:06,110
weren't following this cloud aware

00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:07,730
practices right you know and you know

00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:10,100
the show-and-tell thing is really

00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:11,570
important and at the end you know you

00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:14,390
want people to be proud of what they're

00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:15,770
doing you want to you know you want them

00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:17,810
to build the community and get to know

00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:20,600
one another too so them by them getting

00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:23,600
up and sharing you know and periodically

00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:27,260
and also at the end you know it provides

00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:29,600
that opportunity to do that yep okay so

00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:32,030
those are some best practices for

00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:34,160
running the event oh you know and I

00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:36,410
guess the other thing too is you know at

00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:37,970
the end you know of that hackathon that

00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:39,410
we worked on together I thought that was

00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:41,660
really cool we did our own little award

00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:44,600
ceremony that was there and we didn't do

00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:47,690
big prizes you know we we gave the

00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:51,650
students some Target gift cards because

00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:53,450
they stayed on target get it and we

00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:55,010
handed out Hershey's kisses to everyone

00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:56,900
because after all that hard work we

00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:58,610
thought everyone needed a kiss and we

00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:00,770
did like a lot of really fun silly

00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:04,310
things that don't cost a lot of money

00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:07,790
but really amp up the fun factor yep so

00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:08,960
that was fun alright so here we are look

00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:12,860
at this like we're right on time right

00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:14,780
on time yep perfect right so just you

00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:16,550
know to sum things up you know that you

00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:18,170
know hackathons really are very popular

00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:19,730
right now they're totally hot you can't

00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:21,950
go you know anywhere without talking

00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:24,320
about hackathons you know you you can

00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:25,850
host them yourself but you do need to

00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:28,910
think through some of these details that

00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:29,880
we talked about today right and we you

00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:31,950
know Cloud Foundry has

00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:33,210
been very successful you know in all of

00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:35,640
the hackathons that we that we have

00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:37,410
delivered so I don't want to say

00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:39,780
anything else Cornelia yep I I think

00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:41,880
that I think that about sums it up

00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:44,160
you can certainly reach out to people

00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:45,990
who have experienced Cathy myself and

00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:47,250
various other people if you want to chat

00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:49,260
about hackathons and we're more than

00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:51,750
happy to support you in any way with

00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:53,040
that we can we love hackathons yes we do

00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:54,990
absolutely all right

00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,400
okay thank you very much thank you
