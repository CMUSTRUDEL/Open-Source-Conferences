Title: Simplicity Itself - The Business Benefits of Microservices (Cloud Foundry Summit 2014)
Publication date: 2014-07-07
Playlist: Cloud Foundry Summit 2014
Description: 
	Russ Miles, Chief Scientist, Simplicity Itself

On the Origin of Services by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favored Features in the Struggle for Life: The Business Benefits of Microservices with Cloud Foundry

In this talk Russ Miles, Chief Scientist at Simplicity Itself, will share his experiences of the business benefits of building software that can evolve as fast as your business needs it to on top of the Cloud Foundry PaaS.

Taking advantage of Cloud Foundry's simple usage and underlying robustness, Russ will explore the different design and implementation approaches that a microservice-based approach brings to the table and how the features of Cloud Foundry support what is important to the usage of microservices, including taking a practical tour from a monolithic application to a microservice-based application.

In conclusion Russ will share the big benefits that microservices enable and how Cloud Foundry currently and in the future might evolve to provide even better support for this approach.

[Music]

00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:14,370
okay so I had enough prepared for two

00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:16,369
hours got reduced to about 45 minutes

00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:18,630
down to 20 minutes and now we have ten

00:00:16,369 --> 00:00:21,260
so that's good by me

00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:24,330
I like up a class on planes it's fine

00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:25,800
okay so yeah I won't even introduce the

00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:28,710
title of the talk because that'll take

00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,640
up a minute of my allocation so instead

00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:31,619
basically I'm gonna talk about

00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,050
micro-services why you should bother

00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:36,390
with them what you can tell the business

00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:38,309
people if they're not here about how to

00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,840
use these things away you what you might

00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:42,180
consider if you are a business person

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,250
why you might consider using this

00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:49,410
strange is a steric term for micro

00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:52,469
services okay so who am i I am a chief

00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:54,930
scientist I gave myself this role I'm

00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:58,320
very proud of it basically is an excuse

00:00:54,930 --> 00:01:00,800
not to be a CEO or a CTO means I don't

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,789
have to fill out any spreadsheets ever

00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:06,150
okay that means I get to do other

00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:07,770
important things like code and deliver

00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:10,080
systems and work with clients and have

00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:11,840
fun so I've got the best job on the

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,920
planet

00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,750
so just to give you an idea of the

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,250
popularity of micro services in clearly

00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,450
because I have so much time to speak I'm

00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,729
going to take you on a quick tour of my

00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,229
next day the to give you an indication

00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:25,080
of just how many people are interested

00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:28,409
in this subject I'm gonna fly to London

00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:30,450
in about three hours time I mean when I

00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:31,890
hit London I'm going to be then moving

00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:33,240
to the Olympic Park where I'm giving a

00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:36,299
talk to a slightly larger audience than

00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:39,720
this on the same subject the jet lag is

00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:41,790
going to be awesome I'm then going to

00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:44,189
North London again to do another talk

00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:46,020
like this and then finally I get to get

00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:48,750
back to Heathrow grab my car and drive

00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:50,159
two hours to my house so you know this

00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:55,470
is good and that's at least two minutes

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:56,909
of my talk done so okay so what this is

00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:01,079
all about what's the next 10 years look

00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:02,159
like for you okay so in the next 10

00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,570
years I can tell you what it's not going

00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:08,550
to be about that's usually the easier

00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:10,680
approach it's not going to be about it's

00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:12,999
not going to be about agility

00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,680
okay I searched agility this is what I

00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:15,340
found

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,900
you're not going to be worrying about

00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:19,420
guilty guilty is not gonna be your

00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:20,769
competitive advantage on its own so I

00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:22,799
don't think that's the problem anymore

00:02:20,769 --> 00:02:25,629
it's not even going to be about clouds

00:02:22,799 --> 00:02:26,980
so much I hopefully these terms will

00:02:25,629 --> 00:02:29,920
start to move into the background and be

00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:32,400
the commodity they should be and it's

00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:35,230
probably not going to be about paths

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,349
your color tablets apparently who knew a

00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:39,669
whole conference for a color tablet so

00:02:38,349 --> 00:02:40,930
you know it's not going to be about that

00:02:39,669 --> 00:02:41,919
it's going to be about what we can do

00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:45,340
and it's going to be of something

00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:46,450
something much more important to what

00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:48,430
we're doing today and we're going to be

00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:50,889
doing very soon it's going to be

00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:53,169
innovation which is a horrible term an

00:02:50,889 --> 00:02:54,760
awful lot of people misunderstand what

00:02:53,169 --> 00:02:55,719
it's supposed to be but I think a lot of

00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,090
businesses are getting their heads

00:02:55,719 --> 00:03:00,159
around that in order to succeed in to

00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:02,019
move forward quickly enough and to beat

00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:06,219
the competition they're going to need to

00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:08,169
innovate rapidly and successfully to put

00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:11,379
them outside the clap the crowd a little

00:03:08,169 --> 00:03:14,889
bit and to turn their shareholders from

00:03:11,379 --> 00:03:15,519
this into happy people ok so what's the

00:03:14,889 --> 00:03:17,560
problem then

00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,689
hey innovation we do it for years why

00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:22,329
are we even considering new approaches

00:03:19,689 --> 00:03:23,939
to doing this the problem is you're dead

00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:28,150
already

00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:32,169
every company here might be dead already

00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:35,199
that's a negative start is now that's

00:03:32,169 --> 00:03:39,150
not winning you I can tell not dead yet

00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:42,159
good good I should have put yet on it

00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:45,250
I'm not saying you have to be dead I'm

00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:47,019
just saying you're probably dead and the

00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:49,479
reason you're probably dead is because

00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:52,090
you may not think if you're a large

00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:54,250
beast you're not able to innovate

00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:56,139
quickly enough for the smaller beasts

00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:58,689
that are snapping at your heels it's an

00:03:56,139 --> 00:04:00,639
old story and it's still as relevant

00:03:58,689 --> 00:04:02,290
today as it has been for years but

00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:05,889
interestingly enough it's getting worse

00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:08,379
you see things things are evolving

00:04:05,889 --> 00:04:12,579
constantly and things are changing and

00:04:08,379 --> 00:04:14,590
our software isn't keeping up the

00:04:12,579 --> 00:04:17,380
systems we build a built on a very

00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:19,090
strange philosophy from over 2,000 years

00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:21,459
ago which is that there is a perfect

00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:24,100
ideal and if we ever hit that we will

00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:26,530
never need to change the system I

00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:28,450
haven't met one of those systems yet but

00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:29,860
I'm assured they exist because when I

00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:31,240
used to do waterfall development that

00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:33,910
was what we spent a lot of lives doing

00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,230
was trying to build perfection so the

00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:36,820
problem is these days we're not doing

00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:39,090
waterfall development Oh II we're doing

00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:42,600
agile we're all angel' software people

00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:45,580
but unfortunately our software isn't a

00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:48,610
software is still being primarily built

00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:50,620
with this assumption this architectural

00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:52,450
philosophy that perfection is achievable

00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:56,500
and it's now that we need to fight

00:04:52,450 --> 00:05:03,910
against okay because the ship may be

00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:06,850
large but it's sinking sorry you can be

00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:08,850
the biggest baddest even the best but

00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:11,470
you may well be sinking and not know it

00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:12,760
you may even have your eyes closed and

00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:14,110
being enjoying the prow

00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,550
so you're just really sliding because I

00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:18,190
need you do eat just eaten lunch this

00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:19,330
will keep you awake yeah you may be may

00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:20,710
be feeling really good about things

00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:23,560
right now but tomorrow is looking a

00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:24,490
little more bleak because if the heat

00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:28,000
sorts of things

00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:30,130
no not icebergs I mean monoliths I mean

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,650
the software that you have a huge

00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:35,260
monolith beasts that you have to shove

00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:38,080
forward in horrible escapades of

00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:41,890
hundreds of DevOps people forcing these

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:45,160
fad things forward okay so this is what

00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:48,280
we want to watch out for and this is the

00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:50,560
quote that I found that scared me let

00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:52,930
alone anyone else which is that

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,090
essentially this is why you're dead even

00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:58,450
if you're really good at things you're

00:05:55,090 --> 00:06:01,480
probably dead but you don't have to be

00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:03,580
okay the thing is when you think about

00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:08,710
it that's someone thinking not anything

00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:11,920
else when you think about it we don't

00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:14,020
need a bigger boat okay we don't need a

00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:15,400
bigger monolith that isn't the answer

00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,840
because I'm fortunate a lot of people

00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,880
think that what I think is we've bigger

00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:22,360
systems the natural condition for the

00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:25,450
future is bigger badder better horrible

00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:29,020
to work with that's not the case we

00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:32,910
don't we don't need bigger teams with

00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:36,040
only bigger with any bigger governance

00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:37,750
all of these things organizations are

00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:39,240
already reducing to the point

00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:42,970
where they're competing with you and

00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:45,700
you're in danger so we definitely don't

00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:47,500
need the ultimate in governance which is

00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:51,940
I know you want to move things forward

00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:53,920
but not today we don't want that we

00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:57,310
can't have that others haven't got it

00:06:53,920 --> 00:07:00,400
and they're going to beat us we we

00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:01,630
definitely don't need SOE I get in

00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,950
trouble for this one because a lot of

00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:04,690
people are still debating our micro

00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:06,370
services service-oriented architectures

00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:09,970
I'd like to put the whole thing to bed

00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:11,169
no one cares okay I don't think it's

00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:14,140
important what's important is what we

00:07:11,169 --> 00:07:16,750
can do with these things so yeah we

00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:18,040
don't reinvent our SDI and although all

00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:19,540
the other amazing things that can go

00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:22,720
into building up greater and larger

00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:26,110
monolith what we want to do is enable

00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,880
innovation and for the first time I

00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:30,010
think the industry we've actually got an

00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:32,530
architectural style that supports it

00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:34,270
which is this idea of micro services not

00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:34,870
a great term but it's it's there it's

00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:37,330
ready to use

00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:39,220
where innovation happens it kind of

00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:41,740
happens about there once you've got

00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:43,390
chaos and stuff happening eventually it

00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:45,880
starts to narrow out before it gets

00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:48,820
obvious and clear what we're doing ok

00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:50,560
this is what I call the stoic bridge in

00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:52,720
software development our philosophy

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,030
should not be platonic and going for

00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,100
perfection we need to become Stoics and

00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:59,530
assuming that we don't know what's going

00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:01,720
to happen the famous phrase from Seneca

00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:03,310
was that the next hour is not promised

00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:07,690
you think about that on an

00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:11,260
organizational level ok so what do we

00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:12,729
need this we need that we need Darwinian

00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:17,110
selection of which this is a good

00:08:12,729 --> 00:08:18,490
example then though in in selection but

00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:20,740
this is the short short version is talk

00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:23,260
it gets worse than this in the long run

00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:25,540
so the idea is that we need some

00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:27,280
mechanism whereby we can try we need to

00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:29,380
be able to try and involve systems

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,750
quickly and allow the system to almost

00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:36,909
evolve and emerge to it on its own under

00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:38,650
its own forces so kind of more like

00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:39,969
natural selection and this is what I've

00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:42,099
seen the systems I'm working with

00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:43,900
they're using micro services which I'll

00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:46,300
define in detail in a moment just before

00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:47,530
I flee the stage but what they the

00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:49,420
important thing that we get from these

00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:50,940
systems is not the fact that we cut

00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:53,700
labeling things as micro service

00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:55,680
we get the ability for individual parts

00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,870
of our system to compete with one

00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,640
another yes project management that

00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:02,520
means we sometimes do the same thing

00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:05,400
twice but that sometimes means we do it

00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:08,550
better the first time but that's a

00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:10,260
that's okay but least we tried

00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:12,090
okay so natural selection is an

00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:13,860
incredibly important part of innovation

00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:15,900
because you want to be trying you want

00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:18,660
to be encompassing things and actually

00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:23,850
finding out actually that was better hmm

00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:26,760
who knew okay what it doesn't need is a

00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:30,720
lot of effort bizarrely enough Micra

00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:32,460
services are so simple the annoying

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,490
thing about labeling them as slower as

00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:37,320
it turns something simple into something

00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:40,680
blurry and complex which is why I resist

00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:42,210
the idea so we don't have to try hard to

00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,710
do this but you have to think slightly

00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:45,750
differently but we don't have to put a

00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:47,390
lot of effort in and the best thing is

00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:49,170
you guys are at a Cloud Foundry

00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:51,510
conference you may not have realized

00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:54,060
this but on Cloud Foundry conference

00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:55,680
with app as a micro server you need a

00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,300
pass for micro services because it takes

00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,880
a lot of a headache away from you if you

00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:01,770
saw the talk yesterday by Matt he was

00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:04,200
talking about those inhibitors through

00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:06,000
adopting micro services well innovation

00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,440
is the reason we want to do it Micra

00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,500
services on a mechanism the

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,330
architectural style and in fact without

00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,280
they come with their baggage they come

00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:16,260
with their problems you need a past to

00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,760
take those problems away so there's a

00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:22,250
lovely message here of if you want to

00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:26,100
sell our foundry use micro services okay

00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:27,270
right why do we do all this because then

00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:29,370
great things happen

00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:32,580
okay I'm not suggesting for a moment

00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:34,980
that the amoun program was a micro

00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:37,140
service based architecture an evolving

00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:41,100
system but it was certainly a degree of

00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:42,180
reaction to events the idea is that if

00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,770
we do these things great things do

00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:46,470
happen and we do have plenty of examples

00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:48,930
in our industry right now of these

00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:53,030
things happening and these companies are

00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:57,030
scaring the life out of other companies

00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:58,880
it's a stock example I know with very

00:10:57,030 --> 00:11:02,900
good authority that there are several

00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:04,740
very large companies in Europe who are

00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:07,740
terrified of

00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:10,740
these guys and that's crazy because

00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:12,839
these guys are tiny compared to them but

00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:15,330
these guys can innovate in ways that

00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,320
these other incumbents can't the

00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:19,440
interesting thing is I work the

00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,459
incumbents to try and help them but so

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,110
at least they're realizing there's a

00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:24,209
challenge so what do we need to do what

00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:26,520
I suggest you take away and do first of

00:11:24,209 --> 00:11:28,770
all stop thinking in terms of boulders

00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:32,070
you're not building bigger pieces of

00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:33,120
software please don't instead don't even

00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:35,640
think of rocks

00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,110
that's your SOA that's okay but the

00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,700
problem with rocks is once again you're

00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:40,170
building things that don't embrace the

00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:43,709
key thing you need to embrace in your

00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:46,140
architecture which is change agile

00:11:43,709 --> 00:11:48,690
software adaptable software needs to be

00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:51,420
able to change the bigger the rock the

00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:53,850
more it will resist change so what we

00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:56,250
want our pebbles this is your

00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:57,930
microservices metaphor lots of little

00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:00,810
pebbles that can be shoved along at

00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:02,910
their own pace --is and allowed to do

00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:04,980
their pebble things all right yeah the

00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:07,860
metaphor is not brilliant but that's

00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:10,079
what I'd like to think of okay so this

00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,890
is microservices in a nutshell I don't

00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,290
know much time I've got but I've got

00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:16,410
almost nothing they are small well yeah

00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:18,750
it's micro that's obvious they are

00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:21,630
single purpose that's quite helpful

00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:23,970
that's where the simplicity comes in one

00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:26,279
service does one very small thing could

00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:27,810
be a function people get upset about

00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:29,820
this they can't start saying we don't

00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:33,630
want to build nano services because we

00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:37,470
need another term not important what is

00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:40,829
important is how how fast the areas of

00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:42,990
your system need to change make the

00:12:40,829 --> 00:12:45,810
pieces small enough to support the

00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:47,520
change fred brooks is still influencing

00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:49,020
this industry he's pointing out every

00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:52,050
time you do a ripple for your software

00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:54,089
bad things happen everyone got an idea

00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:55,440
here whenever you do a refactoring and

00:12:54,089 --> 00:12:57,600
then you have to check how you do one

00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,810
small change and you have to check in 40

00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:03,360
files fred books we'd have a moment with

00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:06,300
you that's not refactoring that's a

00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:09,149
ripple okay we had the same thing at the

00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:11,520
architectural level so single purpose is

00:13:09,149 --> 00:13:13,800
useful size less so for goodness sake

00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:15,660
let's not talk about SLOC a lot of

00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:18,130
people industry talk about shlock as a

00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:21,820
defining size for micro services I don't

00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:23,110
care really it's single purpose and the

00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,580
interesting thing is you can as long as

00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:28,210
you have the right level granularity

00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:30,970
your system can involve okay they are

00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:32,560
simple they I'll plug polyglot this is

00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:34,270
an interesting one you can build using

00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:37,090
any framework you like any language you

00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:41,050
like choose for simplicity make it

00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:42,790
objective pick whatever you like the

00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:46,420
smart guys on the Cloud Foundry team

00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:49,810
will support it eventually you know it's

00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:51,760
this it's there to be done and think in

00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:53,080
terms of pipelines this is a fundamental

00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,790
difference between solar and micro

00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:56,820
services in a micro services

00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:59,110
architecture you're not building

00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:00,460
hierarchies of abstraction you're

00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:04,380
building lots of little peer services

00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:06,520
that manifest pipelines and data flows

00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:08,650
believe it or not I don't have time to

00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:10,810
tell you why this is so powerful now but

00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:13,090
it's really the thing that enables the

00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:15,130
innovation I'm talking about because

00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:17,140
each now we have options right micro

00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:19,720
services give us options each micro

00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:22,510
service can evolve at its own rate and

00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:25,210
it also can scale its own rate if you

00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:27,130
ever attempted to scale a monolith or to

00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:31,620
put it back to its metaphor scale a

00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:34,840
boulder it's pretty hard usually painful

00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:37,780
scaling micro services can almost be a

00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:40,000
system condition and something not even

00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:41,200
handled by you and that's a good thing

00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,870
is if you've got hundreds of them you'd

00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:45,130
only be thinking about it you get

00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:46,900
options and so you can have multiple

00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:48,640
options of the same functionality

00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:50,620
available at runtime we talk about

00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,610
failover a lot between micro services

00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,420
because there are a lot of potential

00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:54,970
points of failure

00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:56,470
well you reason you offset this is you

00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:58,630
have the ability to failover between

00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:00,640
them and the last thing I'll leave with

00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:02,500
you is a lovely easy enteric term that I

00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:05,140
think is brilliant for describing the

00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:07,450
system we want when you build a system

00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:10,660
out of micro services you want anti

00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:12,400
fragile systems ok anyone heard of the

00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:16,120
term anti fragile and you went out there

00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:17,770
in the dark ok so that those who've

00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:21,070
never heard of it read the book anti

00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:22,870
fragile just go and do it the main point

00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:25,570
of it is there's a triad involved

00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:28,450
you've got fragile you've got robust and

00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:30,550
you've got anti fragile ok we all know

00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:32,020
what fragile systems look like if

00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:35,680
anyone's ever tried the boot window

00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:37,720
no oh I know I'm stuck I'm sorry

00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:41,050
serious it's been a long time since I've

00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:42,700
had to even do it the we all know what

00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:44,320
robust systems look like resilient

00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:46,180
systems this is what we sold a lot buy a

00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,670
lot of framework make it robust to make

00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:51,610
it resilient at best a robust and

00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:54,760
resilient system will ignore change at

00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:56,320
worst it will resist it so the danger

00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:58,420
with robust and resilient systems is

00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,550
you're wrapping a fragile system with

00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:02,770
many many layers that will need to be

00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:05,830
somewhat removed in order to change it

00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:07,870
so I tend to push people towards anti

00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:10,480
fragile systems the best way of

00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:14,920
characterizing this is a system that

00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:17,830
benefits and thrives on stress the

00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:20,529
stress of change the stress of runtime

00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:22,990
the stress of success the stress of

00:16:20,529 --> 00:16:24,160
failure all of these things if you build

00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:26,980
an anti fragile system from

00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:29,500
microservices you start to thrive upon

00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:31,899
you don't avoid these dresses you get

00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:34,330
better with them look at Netflix's

00:16:31,899 --> 00:16:37,720
simian army it's an implementation of

00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:41,020
stresses on their system it forces the

00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:43,180
system to improve that's the thinking

00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:44,260
let's build anti fragile software

00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:47,079
because not only will be able to change

00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:48,760
faster innovate faster but will also be

00:16:47,079 --> 00:16:52,450
out there handle runtime conditions

00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:54,220
better and maybe even improve on them ok

00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:55,480
and lastly it's a deployment and

00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:57,550
management challenge too fair to say

00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:59,980
with micro services and that is where

00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:02,050
the beauty of cloud foundry comes in the

00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:03,820
beauty of pads to be fair there's an

00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:05,890
awful lot of non-functional conditions

00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:07,630
that you want to consider including

00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:09,880
those anti fragile concerns I was

00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:12,220
mentioning well it becomes a platform

00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:14,230
concern and I I'm hoping that the

00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:15,429
roadmap for many of the platforms of

00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:17,410
services that are being built at the

00:17:15,429 --> 00:17:19,540
moment cluding this particular one are

00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:21,550
all going to begin to think about anti

00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:23,650
fragility in micro services in this way

00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:25,360
because if the platform can handle it

00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:27,370
all you've got to do is build very very

00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,620
simple micro services to do one single

00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:32,860
thing and your productivity goes through

00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:35,290
the roof ok because you can experiment

00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:37,059
and change and you can beat the

00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:39,340
competition so just to finish on a

00:17:37,059 --> 00:17:42,790
negative message your competitor is

00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:44,080
probably doing this and if they aren't

00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:45,190
doing it they're probably gonna foam you

00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,670
up at some point and ask me

00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:49,540
helped them do it so I I advise you to

00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:52,330
think about it

00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:55,180
okay microservices is a buzz term but

00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:57,340
antifragility and him thriving on change

00:17:55,180 --> 00:18:00,190
and innovating because you can do those

00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:02,080
things is real and that's the thing we

00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:05,230
enable we get it with micro services and

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:07,300
plow Foundry as a platform takes away on

00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:10,420
many of the non-functional problems with

00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:10,960
taking the approach on ok so where to

00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,850
next

00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,040
it's a flashcard session there's a

00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:17,380
conference in London if anyone happens

00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:18,970
to get over there in November what's the

00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:21,010
first conference in the world I think on

00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:23,260
micro services and anti fragile software

00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:25,990
systems if you can make it you'd be very

00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:29,650
very welcome I promise to buy everyone

00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:32,110
beer no in this room it's quite a few

00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:34,210
here and too fragile and I've got to go

00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:36,220
to the airport I'm sorry auntie fragile

00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:38,050
software the book there's 50% off there

00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:40,030
I think I've got you at 50% off it which

00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:43,060
is $13.99 that's not that wouldn't even

00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:47,340
buy you a glass of wine in the pub I

00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:51,430
know because I bought 2 and it was $36

00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:53,890
good wine but my goodness ok so it's a

00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:55,510
cheap option is $13.99 to grab it it's a

00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:57,370
work in progress but everything I'm

00:18:55,510 --> 00:19:00,910
talking about it becomes very concrete

00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:03,460
in this book as I rattle it in ok and

00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:05,290
finally this is this is us we're

00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:07,030
probably one of the few companies in the

00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:09,130
world that has advised many different

00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:10,930
clients and taking them through the full

00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:12,610
lifecycle of building micro service

00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:13,930
based systems I've only given you a

00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:16,360
snippet today I'm sorry I only have so

00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:18,580
much time to have vastly gone over but

00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:20,620
there's there's amazing things that we

00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:22,120
can talk about and help you do and maybe

00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:25,750
stop you being one of those dinosaurs

00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:27,400
that gets killed by the meteor ok so

00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,750
thank you very much for your time I hope

00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,580
it's been at least a little bit more

00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:32,380
upbeat straight after lunch gonna pass

00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:34,060
over to the people who've been very very

00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:37,330
kind to give me some time to actually do

00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:39,310
this now before I fly and please stay in

00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:41,010
touch thank you very much

00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:43,010
[Music]

00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:46,299
[Applause]
