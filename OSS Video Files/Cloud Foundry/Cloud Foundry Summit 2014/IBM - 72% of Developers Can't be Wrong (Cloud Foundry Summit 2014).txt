Title: IBM - 72% of Developers Can't be Wrong (Cloud Foundry Summit 2014)
Publication date: 2014-07-03
Playlist: Cloud Foundry Summit 2014
Description: 
	Keynote presented by Bala Rajaraman, IBM Distinguished Engineer and CTO for Cloud Platform Services and Angel Diaz, IBM VP Open Technologies & Cloud Performance.

Cloud is here - but are your developers? 72% of developers report already using cloud-based services or APIs as part of the applications that they are building, 85% of new software is being built for cloud and by 2016, 25% of all the world's applications will be in the cloud. These are some really big shifts that are relevant to nearly any organization whether your team started day 1 with cloud-based applications and services or if they're brand new to the game.

In this keynote, Bala Rajaraman, IBM Distinguished Engineer and CTO for Cloud Platform Services and Angel Diaz, IBM VP Open Technologies & Cloud Performance discuss how Cloud Foundry Summit has a lot to offer for developers of all stripes, making it THE open source PaaS project for the industry. They will discuss the role of Cloud Foundry in an open cloud architecture and let's face it, if your business is not building on open technologies, you're building a dead end Cloud.

I like to spend a little bit of time

00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:17,369
talking about the moment the moment that

00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:21,480
we are all in together and specifically

00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:24,810
what we as a community need to do

00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:27,359
together and where I think we're going

00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:30,119
ahead is that all right we can change we

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,940
talk sports if you like I'm fine with

00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:34,050
that all right you guys at e3 the the

00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,130
video game conference I've been

00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:40,440
following that as well

00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:44,030
it's quite exciting so a platform for

00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:47,039
the people that is what we are building

00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:50,129
think about that a platform for the

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:52,199
people a platform that allows developers

00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:55,110
to be who they are

00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:57,270
write develop in any language that they

00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:02,340
like and work with other people other

00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:04,080
developers but also a platform that you

00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,030
can stand on I asked them to bring a

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,250
platform so I can stand but I guess they

00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:11,850
didn't a platform that you can stand on

00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:15,060
as a developer and tell the world right

00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:18,450
to get on board let's create a

00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:21,930
ubiquitous open-source platform

00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:25,140
as-a-service technology that the people

00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:27,060
the world can gravitate to okay and you

00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,530
all at the end of this presentation at

00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,659
the end of this conference as you hear

00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:33,450
all of the speakers we have need to be

00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:37,079
evangelists you need to get the religion

00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:39,000
and help us create this platform not

00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:42,119
just the platform did you get it do the

00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,439
plan we're that platform all right so

00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:50,880
first of all let's just take a moment to

00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:52,560
feel good survey after survey interview

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,850
after interview you asked

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:59,430
CEOs CIOs managers technologists rule

00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:01,439
the world James what do you say software

00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:03,450
is eating the world or something like

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,950
that I just thought it's a big hamburger

00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,960
coming at me or something right

00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:09,869
you all should feel great you should be

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,340
walking with a sense of pride you should

00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:15,430
be walking with swag

00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:17,800
because you know what we are doing is

00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:19,959
enabling the business folks to change

00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:23,709
the world that we live in in very

00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:31,000
fundamental ways but you know with great

00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:34,360
power comes what come on you guys don't

00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,560
tell me you don't watch sci-fi you got

00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:38,170
you're probably watching the sci-fi

00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:40,980
channel right now on the little interweb

00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:44,380
right yeah I got it but with with with

00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:45,519
great power comes responsibility because

00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,360
let's take a moment to think about

00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,459
what's going on

00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:50,080
number one you all are not paying

00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:53,440
attention to me you're freaking looking

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:58,599
at your phones put it down

00:02:53,440 --> 00:03:01,360
Alex put the phone down right 90% of you

00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:04,060
90 percent of mobile users have their

00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,580
phones at arm's reach at all times okay

00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:09,040
I like to know who that other 10% is

00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:10,750
because I freaking sleep with my phone I

00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,450
had to leave my phone off for feedback

00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:15,010
I'm not feeling anxious right but what

00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:19,120
does that mean that means we're

00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:20,709
increasing the transactions right this

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,720
throughput in our systems are

00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:24,579
dramatically increasing the ability to

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:28,660
reach our customers is increasing in

00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:31,660
fact most of our clients ibm's clients

00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:34,090
enterprise clients are working with

00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:36,450
cloud moving to clout understanding how

00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:40,120
they can use cloud to meet that demand

00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:43,269
here's another interesting stat 60% of

00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:46,630
all devices that are connected will be

00:03:43,269 --> 00:03:49,239
sensors actuators autonomic nodes all

00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:50,650
that kind of stuff right if you're in

00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:51,940
the railroad industry or the

00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:53,680
transportation industry I'll talk about

00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:55,359
that later now this is pretty obvious

00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:59,319
but but this is going to fundamentally

00:03:55,359 --> 00:04:03,010
change not just our infrastructure but

00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:06,370
also how we deliver technology and how

00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:08,470
we scale technology and 80% of the data

00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:09,790
out there is unstructured and what does

00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:12,280
that mean if you want to get and you

00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:14,170
know inside out of information this is

00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:16,120
not magic guys it's computer science

00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:18,130
Knuth anyone know what Knuth vol.2 is I

00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,840
hope so if not you should just all leave

00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:21,970
right right

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,289
you have to write algorithms to mind the

00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:25,360
data to understand that takes compute

00:04:23,289 --> 00:04:25,840
power and you need to expose that in a

00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,870
rational

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:31,180
way and most of us are actually using

00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:33,820
cloud api's today so you can take a

00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:35,229
glass half-empty approach and feel

00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:39,130
really scared and if you run a data

00:04:35,229 --> 00:04:41,880
center just leave right or you could

00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:45,280
take a glass half full approach and say

00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:49,840
look let's take advantage of this but to

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,800
do this we need to embrace change we

00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,100
have to change they'll go through a

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:57,130
metamorphosis okay because you know you

00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:59,050
all are experts in different areas you

00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:01,660
might be a database person a network

00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:04,060
person in an Operations person an app

00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:05,470
dev person you know and and you wake up

00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:07,450
in the morning and it's like going into

00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:09,190
Mad Max and you're going into

00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:10,630
Thunderdome you guys know what

00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:11,560
Thunderdome is had dinner with someone

00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:14,710
last night and they tell me about

00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:16,720
Thunderdome right two people enter one

00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:20,050
people leave and it's usually the

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:22,539
network person wins right two weeks I'm

00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:25,210
sorry I can't have your app up right you

00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:26,710
need to be appreciative of what everyone

00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:28,750
else is going through you need to learn

00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:30,940
about what other folks are doing your

00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:33,880
organization not just the technologists

00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:36,850
to be deep in your skill but also you

00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:40,510
need to understand the business contact

00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:44,590
context you're in t-shaped skills the

00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:46,450
true vien man right that's what you need

00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:49,510
to Vinci had it right that's what you

00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:56,500
all need to be doing okay but guess what

00:05:49,510 --> 00:06:00,160
there are forces of evil armies of folks

00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:04,030
who are trying to to change who we are

00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:06,610
okay trying to lock you in in a

00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:09,849
particular infrastructure lock you in on

00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:12,310
a particular platform technology lock

00:06:09,849 --> 00:06:15,010
you in on a particular API for getting

00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:18,090
access to data a messaging workflow lock

00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:22,780
you in at how you build applications

00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:27,340
right and how users interact those are

00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:29,950
the forces of evil and you all are the

00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:31,840
army that's going to combat that those

00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:34,300
forces of evil because the journey that

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,820
we have been on is creating an open

00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:39,460
cloud architecture for over the past

00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:44,310
four years or so think about it

00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:46,440
open hardware okay open Software Defined

00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:49,870
environment Software Defined Networking

00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:54,400
open infrastructure OpenStack open

00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:59,040
platform Cloud Foundry open how you

00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:03,040
create your app with html5 Cordova

00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:05,110
jQuery right giving you cross device

00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:07,990
portability so you don't have to you

00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:10,480
know deal with the differences as much

00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:12,760
as you can across devices right open

00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:16,540
from top to bottom that is what we're

00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:18,190
trying to accomplish so I'd like you to

00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:22,180
do a little exercise since you have your

00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:24,820
phone in your hand anyway okay I'd like

00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:26,860
you to pick up your phone bring up the

00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:28,210
camera come on guys just pick up the

00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:31,810
phone you have it in your hand bring up

00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:35,340
the camera okay you know no music just

00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:37,450
bring up the camera okay flip it around

00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:38,770
flip it around so you look at yourself

00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:40,480
hopefully you have a phone like not from

00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:42,070
the 80s you know like this big regular

00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:45,460
phone in modern phone and look in the

00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:48,220
mirror what do you see you obviously see

00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:51,520
a handsome person right a handsome man

00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:52,210
or woman I'm sure you look stunning over

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,840
there right

00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:59,440
but you also see an individual right

00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:03,060
with a diverse set of skills motivations

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:05,830
a history a background you could be a

00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:09,420
system of record back in developer where

00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:12,970
you know everything about Java PHP Perl

00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:15,400
sequel XML whatever right that could be

00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:17,050
you right this will get your LinkedIn

00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:19,270
profile how do you identify yourself

00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:21,250
what are your badges what makes you more

00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:23,590
marketable right

00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:25,240
are you a core contributor to how

00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:28,650
foundry that makes it pretty marketable

00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:31,180
right you want to be a millionaire right

00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:32,950
we all do I guess all right to a certain

00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:34,510
degree we all want to find that Unicorn

00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:36,840
you don't know what it is it's that

00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:38,920
killer app but when you see the little

00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:40,210
horsey with the Unicorn

00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:44,500
you know it's a unicorn right we all

00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:46,720
want that right maybe you're a different

00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:51,070
type of developer maybe you're a mobile

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:52,840
developer Python objective-c no

00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:53,320
sequel JSON you guys go into the

00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:57,010
conference

00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:59,620
June 23rd New York City I'll be there go

00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:01,690
should be exciting right is that is that

00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:03,760
what you are a mobile developer are you

00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:05,890
a data scientist and I love that term

00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,540
data scientists you know because Peter

00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:08,740
there's such a religious debate some

00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:11,110
people hate that term

00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:13,630
some people revel in that term but if

00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:14,890
you are you know about pigs right and

00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:17,710
you know about hi then you're about to

00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:20,770
do maybe user urbancode I don't know

00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:23,050
right or maybe and I'm sure this is I'm

00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:25,480
sure all of you all claim to be this I'm

00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:28,090
a full stack developer I know everything

00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:31,030
right from top to bottom I'm a pro

00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:34,270
that's great well more power to you the

00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:38,080
point is is that what we're doing here

00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:43,150
and what we have ok with Cloud Foundry

00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:47,260
is the ability for you to be who you are

00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:49,690
a platform for the people ok

00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:53,500
we're the forces of evil can't change

00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:57,340
you but where you can collaborate with

00:09:53,500 --> 00:10:01,090
your friends right t-shaped skills to do

00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:05,320
something fundamentally special and back

00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:09,190
in 2011 Bala was it right 2011-2012 or

00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:11,710
so the people at IBM spoke and trust me

00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:13,180
that's a lot of people it's like 400,000

00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:16,210
people right that's a lot of people

00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:18,190
spoke and said you know this cloud found

00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:20,890
use great technology and started

00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:22,720
building inside of the company right

00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:25,750
even before we kind of came out and say

00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,520
what we were doing building applications

00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:31,720
and proving playing with the code

00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:34,180
working with Rob and Paul and James

00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:39,310
talking about Cloud Foundry right and

00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:42,850
was very excited and from then to now we

00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:46,930
together have been on a journey IBM has

00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:48,640
been on a journey right but we all have

00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:50,650
all of us who are kind of here in the

00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,390
room on the journey to learn more about

00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:54,220
how to better leverage the technology

00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:57,160
but also contribute to it and I think

00:10:54,220 --> 00:11:00,430
one healthy measurement of a technology

00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:03,340
is its ecosystem and the ecosystem of

00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:05,760
Cloud Foundry is strong in fact if you

00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:08,900
got to go a get and you look at

00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:11,130
tribution there's an 88% increase in

00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:14,630
contributions to Cloud Foundry

00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:18,330
year-to-year that is a healthy ecosystem

00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:20,300
so what are we doing in IBM with Cloud

00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:23,070
Foundry what specifically have we done

00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:23,550
what are we trying to do where we're

00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:27,840
headed

00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:29,910
well look we spent a lot of time as

00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:31,740
conference talking about the foundation

00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:34,410
and how this is going to work just

00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:37,470
because you're a founding member of

00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:40,620
silver or gold doesn't mean you have any

00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:42,270
influence in the community sorry I don't

00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:44,940
care how much money you give or what

00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:47,150
your name is zero influence you know how

00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:49,530
you get influence you earn your stripes

00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:52,650
right I've got to pass the mustard you

00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:54,360
got to learn right at the coat and we've

00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:55,890
been doing that we've been earning our

00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,650
stripes we've sent a ton of folks

00:11:55,890 --> 00:12:00,420
through the dojo program all right I've

00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:03,540
got a great development team that has

00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:06,300
been contributing significant parts of

00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:08,910
code into Cloud Foundry over the past

00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:10,980
year whether it's integrating with

00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:13,520
OpenStack through Keystone working on

00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:15,750
the Eclipse tooling the

00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:17,460
internationalization work the admin UI

00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:19,290
Dan where are you Dan raise your hand

00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:21,450
thank you for that admin UI cuz we use

00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:23,400
it in bluemix oh there you are it get

00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:27,270
off the computer man I'm talking please

00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:30,330
come on the we we've been you know over

00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:32,340
over a period of time taking our cert

00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:34,970
our own technology and exposing them as

00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:38,370
build packs but we've also been doing

00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:40,650
something else which is I think very

00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:43,320
important that you all have been doing

00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:46,620
but we need to do more of and that's

00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:47,520
evangelizing starting meetups I don't

00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,920
know if the you know if you've probably

00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:52,260
looked over the past couple of months

00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:54,480
the Cloud Foundry meetup is kind of you

00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:55,800
know map has been increasing

00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,840
dramatically who've been holding meetups

00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,320
everywhere you all live all over the

00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:01,590
place

00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,030
meetups start meetups start increasing

00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:04,920
I don't care ever the United States

00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:06,810
China Europe I don't care

00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:10,380
start these meetups start spreading the

00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:11,580
word right folks here at pivotal again

00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:13,800
can help you get started the foundation

00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:15,270
will help you but we all need to start

00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:18,209
spreading the word around this because

00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:20,999
that's how we will help create true

00:13:18,209 --> 00:13:23,339
a platform for people now Rachel are you

00:13:20,999 --> 00:13:25,319
are you here is Rachel work Rachel hey

00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:26,670
hey Rachel are you doing your good I

00:13:25,319 --> 00:13:28,589
didn't know where you were looking for

00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:31,410
so you know Rachel I like to introduce

00:13:28,589 --> 00:13:33,360
you all to Rachel and to Bala Bala is

00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:36,350
gonna come speak but but those are two

00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:39,300
leaders in IBM who've been working on

00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:41,490
the perfect ization of what we're trying

00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:43,980
to do with Cloud Foundry but also the

00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:46,259
evangelism and helping clients succeed

00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:47,670
and Rachel's been doing that symbolic

00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:50,670
you just take a couple of minutes here

00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:52,709
he's our CTO of bluemix and kind of tell

00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:56,009
to the gang here what is bluemix and

00:13:52,709 --> 00:13:58,980
what is the garage yeah thanks angels

00:13:56,009 --> 00:14:00,629
that are the great presentation so we're

00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:02,819
taking a lot of the principles that

00:14:00,629 --> 00:14:03,869
angel has been espousing about how to

00:14:02,819 --> 00:14:05,639
build communities how to build

00:14:03,869 --> 00:14:07,649
excitement because I think what's really

00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:09,300
happening is a fundamental change and

00:14:07,649 --> 00:14:12,089
how people are building application and

00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:14,279
it's it's a privilege to be in this

00:14:12,089 --> 00:14:16,759
ecosystem I saw a video on YouTube about

00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:18,660
some folks using bluemix which is our

00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:21,059
environment where we are looking at the

00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:22,980
end to end creation of applications from

00:14:21,059 --> 00:14:24,389
how you develop applications how do you

00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:26,309
push it into Cloud Foundry how do you

00:14:24,389 --> 00:14:28,110
monitor it and from a provider

00:14:26,309 --> 00:14:30,240
perspective how do you scale it up the

00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:31,470
admin UI that you talked about where are

00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,600
all the challenges how do we support

00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:35,579
multi region how do we support security

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,929
all of those are becoming very critical

00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:38,670
in terms of making this platform a

00:14:36,929 --> 00:14:40,679
success and there's this really cool

00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:43,709
YouTube video I think if you look at

00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:45,839
bluemix and india it's actually very

00:14:43,709 --> 00:14:47,639
cool it's how some of the kids from IBM

00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,829
went down to a mall where developers

00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:52,589
hang out and try to really create

00:14:49,829 --> 00:14:54,299
awareness about Cloud Foundry in bluemix

00:14:52,589 --> 00:14:57,449
so what we're really doing from a

00:14:54,299 --> 00:14:59,339
bluemix perspective is twofold one we

00:14:57,449 --> 00:15:00,749
want to create a very rich collection of

00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:02,509
services services are going to be

00:15:00,749 --> 00:15:04,529
important because that's what helps

00:15:02,509 --> 00:15:06,660
applications and more valuable

00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:08,699
applications come into being we are

00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:12,089
looking at services that are not only

00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:14,339
IBM but across the ecosystem that's very

00:15:12,089 --> 00:15:17,279
critical it's across a middleware it's

00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:18,899
across SAS services it's across big data

00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:20,759
we're even putting some of our stuff

00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:22,639
like Watson into the mix in terms of

00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:24,959
services that are available to everybody

00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:27,809
so the services and the services

00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:30,389
ecosystem is very key the second part is

00:15:27,809 --> 00:15:31,440
this is a new model a lot of us are

00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:33,360
learning enterprises

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,850
challenged in terms of transforming

00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,220
their internal structures their internal

00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:39,810
processes to be able to support a model

00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:42,810
like this so we have this bluemix garage

00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:44,460
and I think Rachel is leading this I

00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:45,390
think she's a very critical element of

00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:47,070
making it happen

00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:51,410
which is how do we start bringing

00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:54,210
together our partners our developers

00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:56,040
together into a garage so that we can

00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:57,990
start building and prototyping a lot of

00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:59,040
these concepts and applications so I'm

00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:01,020
actually very excited I think

00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,510
translating a lot of the stuff that we

00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:04,860
learn from the community into things

00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:06,720
that we can actually create real

00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:08,550
applications with and deliver back to

00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,450
the community in terms of enhancements

00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:11,460
around some of the topics that I

00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:13,320
mentioned like security and scalability

00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:16,470
and so on and so forth are gonna be very

00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:19,560
I'm looking forward to the next 2017

00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:20,910
it's gonna be wild Thanksgiving round of

00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:27,300
applause please thank thank you

00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:29,370
thanks guys so I encourage you if you

00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:31,890
want to play with Cloud Foundry you want

00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:34,340
to play with bluemix go to bluemix.net

00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:38,100
go to Bala right there get an account

00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:39,810
experiment if you need help okay if you

00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:41,610
want to engage the community you want to

00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:43,830
learn about found you go to Rachel and

00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:47,010
she'll help you she'll help you get

00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:50,580
involved you know when you look at how

00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:53,670
the web was born the early days of the

00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:56,850
internet does anyone know why HTML was

00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:59,040
created what was the first use case for

00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:01,560
XML Chris no and can't tell Chris

00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,690
Merrett first quiet right the use case

00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,699
for XML was the mathematical markup

00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:07,949
language which I co-chaired by the way I

00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:12,060
also was on CSS Dom a whole bunch of

00:17:07,949 --> 00:17:14,699
really exciting use case I love it

00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:16,439
right guess what not the best use case

00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:19,829
for how we use XML today in enterprise

00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:21,870
systems okay so what has changed you all

00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:25,050
end-users are much more involved in this

00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:27,260
process and as we go down our Cloud

00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:30,120
Foundry journey our bluemix journey

00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:31,770
end-users clients are very very

00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:33,690
important and there's two in particular

00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:35,430
I just want to talk about that we kind

00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:36,630
of been talking about the past month or

00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:39,270
so one was square anyone know what

00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:40,380
Square is way of doing payments well you

00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:43,260
know they built using Cloud Foundry

00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:44,809
using bluemix a set of SDKs and an

00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:47,570
application where developer

00:17:44,809 --> 00:17:49,190
now very quickly use the square api's to

00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:51,830
actually perform their transactions

00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:54,350
that's great for the hipster born on the

00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:56,840
on the web guys right well what about

00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:58,399
what about the folks who trying to kind

00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:00,259
of bring together the systems of record

00:17:58,399 --> 00:18:03,049
the transaction systems that we all live

00:18:00,259 --> 00:18:04,999
with with perhaps a more agile process

00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:06,320
and deal with DevOps Danberg you're

00:18:04,999 --> 00:18:09,200
coming up later right then talk about

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:11,389
DevOps alright and deal with DevOps well

00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,460
we're all familiar with the BART the bay

00:18:11,389 --> 00:18:16,159
area rapid transport system right

00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:18,799
they've got tons of sensor and actuator

00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:20,869
information on their mainframe systems

00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:24,139
and using bluemix they were able to

00:18:20,869 --> 00:18:27,080
integrate that with the mobile

00:18:24,139 --> 00:18:28,999
application to allow their workforce to

00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,919
better optimize scheduling and that

00:18:28,999 --> 00:18:33,440
helps us all right and they did it in a

00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:36,080
matter of weeks it's a testament to

00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:39,950
Cloud Foundry it's a testament to where

00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:44,090
the world is heading so I like to leave

00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:45,259
you with three thoughts okay anybody

00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:49,399
played video games

00:18:45,259 --> 00:18:51,230
oh come on you guys are looking at e3

00:18:49,399 --> 00:18:53,059
right now did you see there's a new Tomb

00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:55,220
Raider and use SAS ins Creed there's a

00:18:53,059 --> 00:18:57,799
lot of good a new battlefield this is

00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:59,269
just exciting I am I am at the

00:18:57,799 --> 00:19:01,549
conference but I'm also watching what's

00:18:59,269 --> 00:19:02,929
happening at e3 well look there's three

00:19:01,549 --> 00:19:04,999
things I think you need to kind of

00:19:02,929 --> 00:19:07,369
remember whether you're a cloud foundry

00:19:04,999 --> 00:19:09,590
Pro or whether you're kind of getting

00:19:07,369 --> 00:19:13,669
started whether you're kind of debating

00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:16,519
which technology to use first of all you

00:19:13,669 --> 00:19:18,049
need to learn to play l2p right ever

00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:19,369
play a video game and there's this

00:19:18,049 --> 00:19:21,320
little section of the game that teaches

00:19:19,369 --> 00:19:22,879
you how to play right you need to

00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:24,919
understand the technology so if you're

00:19:22,879 --> 00:19:26,480
looking to contribute learn so you can

00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:28,279
rise up the ranks if you're trying to

00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:31,090
use there's a community that can help

00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:34,820
you to learn to play you are not alone

00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:35,690
but also know that lag kills and when I

00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:38,509
play games

00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:40,249
I run a gaming community by the way so

00:19:38,509 --> 00:19:40,850
if you want to join you can submit an

00:19:40,249 --> 00:19:43,580
application

00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:46,759
I love playing against someone who has

00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:49,460
leg I guess I just squash them right

00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:50,899
they're running in place you play World

00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:52,309
of Warcraft and you're doing an arena

00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:53,600
and they're running in place you just

00:19:52,309 --> 00:19:55,909
know they're lagging out there in

00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,200
battlefield and you you know react and

00:19:55,909 --> 00:19:58,080
they're still standing there you know

00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,760
that you've got

00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,580
second response time monitor and they

00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:05,450
don't write that's awesome lag kills our

00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:09,899
business folks need us to be quicker

00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:13,080
right so with a Cloud Foundry with a

00:20:09,899 --> 00:20:14,789
platform for the people right we can be

00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:17,700
quicker in developing these applications

00:20:14,789 --> 00:20:21,210
and then the the last thing is avoid the

00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:23,760
grind you might enjoy killing 500

00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:26,370
sheepies in order to get one level in

00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,720
your game that might be fun for you it

00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:28,620
may be fun for the first hour after

00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:32,549
that's no fun

00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:35,909
pound no es bueno right or hashtag no es

00:20:32,549 --> 00:20:38,070
bueno you want to avoid the grind reuse

00:20:35,909 --> 00:20:39,690
the services that build packs the open

00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,909
technologies that are out there to then

00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:44,610
focus on your on your development if you

00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:48,480
remember those those three things you

00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:52,019
evangelize and become a preacher for

00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,519
Cloud Foundry we all in the next

00:20:52,019 --> 00:20:56,610
conference that will happen in six

00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:57,899
months from now I don't know where but

00:20:56,610 --> 00:21:00,899
I'm sure it will happen in six months

00:20:57,899 --> 00:21:02,669
I'm hoping for Hawaii right we will

00:21:00,899 --> 00:21:05,389
double triple the size of this room and

00:21:02,669 --> 00:21:08,710
we will have truly created a platform

00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:10,770
for the people so thank you

00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:12,050
[Applause]

00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,630
[Music]
