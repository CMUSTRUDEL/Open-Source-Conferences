Title: Anchora - Building a University Community PaaS Using Cloud Foundry (Cloud Foundry Summit 2014)
Publication date: 2014-07-03
Playlist: Cloud Foundry Summit 2014
Description: 
	Dr. Wei-Min Lu, Founder and CEO, Anchora

The Shanghai Jiao Tong University PaaS is a community cloud PaaS based on Cloud Foundry jointly built and operated by the Network and Information Center at Shanghai Jiao Tong University and MoPaaS/Anchora. It serves more than 10,000 professors, instructors, and researchers, and more than 50,000 undergraduate and graduate students. In particular, it provides an agile cloud application platform for R&D and teaching. In this talk, I will share our experience building and operating such a community PaaS using Cloud Foundry.

[Music]

00:00:08,179 --> 00:00:13,559

00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:14,400
my name is Wei min though I'm the CEO of

00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:16,260
a kora

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,400
and this work is that you're in the work

00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:22,109
with Professor Yahweh in who is a deputy

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,050
director of that were deformation

00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:26,730
centers sang-hyeon University and today

00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,160
I would like to share some experience

00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:32,820
with you regarding building a university

00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:35,730
community past using Cola foundry first

00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:38,250
some background material about Shanghai

00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:40,530
Jiaotong University and it's located in

00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:44,059
Shanghai and is one of the top five

00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:47,160
universities in China there are four

00:00:44,059 --> 00:00:50,460
40,000 vacuum and staff members and

00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:53,489
students the center for their work and

00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:56,129
information provide IT service to the

00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:58,530
university community in particularly in

00:00:56,129 --> 00:01:03,329
the area for educational research and

00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:06,450
there are about 40 employees and most of

00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:12,080
them are technical staff there is a data

00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:14,880
center which has over 250 servers and

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,250
about ancora which is my company and

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,860
there is a leading cloud platform and

00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:23,159
service provider in China based on cloud

00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:28,229
foundry and we offer three type of

00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:30,150
products and the services most important

00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:32,460
in the public path and worship right

00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:37,829
path and also the mochas Enterprise

00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:41,939
Edition jointly we build university pass

00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:46,530
at sahaja University which is the first

00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:49,590
University community pass in China so

00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:53,220
the basic requirements for this path is

00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:54,570
in these following three areas first we

00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:57,000
need to address some needs in the

00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:59,640
research and there so we need some

00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,579
platform to provide research individuals

00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:05,369
and groups with unified IT environment

00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:09,209
for research projects and the second one

00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:11,220
in the kitchen so we need that unified

00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:13,800
development testing environment for the

00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:17,070
class projects for example students

00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:20,040
code developed their coat and that

00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:23,430
deploy and the test they are called on

00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:25,410
the pass and the teachers can monitor

00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:28,230
the progress of the students and around

00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:31,470
and evaluate their project in the past

00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:34,020
and also the university encouraged the

00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:39,020
intrapreneurship and this is the Danida

00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:42,150
platform to provide online incubator so

00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:43,200
this pass is built on top of the oven

00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:46,590
stack based

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:50,100
s which is built inside network and

00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:53,990
information center and the there there

00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:57,240
are different type of controller node

00:02:53,990 --> 00:03:01,010
compute nodes and s30 nodes the others

00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:04,920
who support the deep pass and also the

00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:09,480
the community path based on mo path

00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:12,480
which is our solution for the public

00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:14,790
pass our course is based on the Cloud

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,820
Foundry addition to some station and

00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:20,430
that and also the husband to the Cloud

00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:22,440
Foundry there are multiple third-party

00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:25,230
in services are integrated into this

00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:27,870
solution in particular in the identity

00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:30,959
management and also education after

00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:35,880
other as HD service for from the

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:40,650
University and also the pass community

00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:43,610
pass is included with more pass into

00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:46,890
other features one purpose for that is

00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:49,140
the order for the user of the community

00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:52,650
the pass to migrate their service to the

00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:57,840
mo pass if they there the resource is

00:03:52,650 --> 00:04:00,300
animated I will have to share three case

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,450
studies the first one is the university

00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:06,600
use this platform the pass as an

00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:08,459
innovation and the infirmary platform so

00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:11,489
they host their first mobile app

00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:14,340
innovation challenge last year at the

00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:18,270
university there are about fifty seven

00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:22,169
teams to participate and also all the

00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:22,590
apps are deployed on the on the on the

00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:24,870
pass

00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:26,430
community pass and the second one is the

00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:28,250
unique they never had an Information

00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:31,290
Center built they are

00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:34,500
Wi-Fi network monitoring platform and

00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:37,530
also is hosted on the cloud on these on

00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:39,740
its past and the third way is universe

00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:43,020
your research team at the university

00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:44,850
environment linear and department to

00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:47,840
provide air pollution monitoring and

00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:53,490
analyzing system also deployed on the

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:55,500
university community past so so the Sun

00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:58,260
hi gelatin University pass is based on

00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:01,680
Coventry which is the first community

00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:04,620
pass in China and is built on the open

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:07,800
stack based s and also is based on more

00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:11,880
path which is based on Coventry and so

00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:13,830
the path is addressing three knee Denise

00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:16,230
in the three areas the research teaching

00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:18,590
and innovation and introvert leadership

00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:22,720
thank you very much

00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:26,009
[Applause]
