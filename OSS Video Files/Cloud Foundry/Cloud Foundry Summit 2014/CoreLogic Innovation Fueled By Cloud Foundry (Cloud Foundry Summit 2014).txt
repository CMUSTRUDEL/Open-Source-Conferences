00:00:08,269 --> 00:00:14,610
good morning everyone very interesting

00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,650
from Casey in the in the sass story

00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:18,660
because I think that's really pertinent

00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:21,090
for us as an enterprise as CoreLogic

00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,859
we're a big sass customer and I think

00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:25,680
part of our story that we're gonna tell

00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:27,930
you is about how we're moving from a

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,960
world of many many technologies and

00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:33,600
really no enforcer to a world where we

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,070
want enforcement we want standards and

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,770
we really believe platform-as-a-service

00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:40,350
is a way to get us from where we are to

00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:42,360
where we need to go and we believe Cloud

00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:46,649
Foundry is really the way to get there

00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:48,260
so what is core logic most of you

00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:52,230
probably have never heard of core logic

00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:55,320
core logic provides data analytics and

00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:57,120
data enabled services to a number of

00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,239
cross industries our roots are in real

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,879
estate mortgage and the financial

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:05,400
services segment recently we've been

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,950
diversifying into insurance into spatial

00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,830
solutions we spun out of a company

00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:13,860
called first American four years ago so

00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:17,100
we're really a relatively new company on

00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,840
this and in the scheme of things one of

00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,640
the things that's a big driver behind

00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,250
our whole innovation development center

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,310
exercise is looking at how we can grow

00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:28,320
core logic how we can move the top-line

00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:30,210
numbers the revenue numbers through a

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,220
different way of deploying technology a

00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:34,049
different way of looking at our data I

00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:35,850
think most of you have probably come in

00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:38,340
contact with core logic but you just

00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:40,470
don't know it if you bought a house your

00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:43,409
Realtor is likely used multiple listing

00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:44,899
services provided by core logic if you

00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:48,149
went to a lender to get your mortgage

00:01:44,899 --> 00:01:50,909
you've likely the lender has used core

00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:52,829
logic origination services to help

00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:54,960
supply the supply chain for the mortgage

00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:57,210
that you got and if you're paying your

00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,619
real estate taxes this year we're on

00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:01,320
track to pay about eighty billion

00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:04,590
dollars in property real estate taxes

00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:06,990
across the United States to 23,000

00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:09,690
taxing jurisdictions so we kind of are

00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:11,120
in the life of everyone we're just one

00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:14,010
of those companies you've never heard of

00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,560
so over the last 20 years

00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:18,210
the interesting thing about core logic

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,790
is we grew up out of a number of

00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:22,230
acquisitions and during those

00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:24,300
acquisitions and those subsequent

00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:27,000
integration of those acquisitions no

00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:28,650
technology was consolidated so every

00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,900
business unit was left to stand alone

00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:34,200
and you can see the resulting metrics

00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:37,200
that come from that it's a mishmash of

00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:39,270
technologies this is just a sample here

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,080
of some of the technologies on the lower

00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:42,810
part of this slide

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,700
it really doesn't provide a good robust

00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:47,220
environment for us to build new products

00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:49,140
and new services especially as we try to

00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,940
look and interrogate our data and come

00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:52,410
up with new analytics and new

00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,650
information products to serve our

00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:58,410
customers and serve our emerging markets

00:02:54,650 --> 00:03:00,930
in fact one of the things that we have

00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:02,550
to look at is how do we combine all of

00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:04,980
these things and what we did after we

00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:07,920
spun out four years ago is we combined

00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:11,040
all of our technology organizations down

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,330
into one technology Solutions Group and

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,390
that took about two years of

00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:18,090
consolidating operations looking at our

00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:21,090
different inventory of applications

00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:22,410
inventory of technologies and we finally

00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:25,350
come to the point where we can take a

00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:26,940
look at that about a year ago and start

00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:28,890
determining what we wanted the future to

00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:31,560
look like so what we did is we formed

00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:33,690
again about a year ago the Innovation

00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,830
Development Center which I run and we

00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:36,840
brought in a number of the key

00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:38,250
technology leaders of core logic and

00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,800
really pulled them out of their current

00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:42,209
jobs as the nucleus for what we believed

00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,040
would be the future of product

00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:47,130
development for core logic as an

00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:50,400
enterprise and the future of our

00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:52,170
architecture we looked at the existing

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,510
inventory that I just showed you and we

00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:57,150
realized we really have a multitude of

00:03:54,510 --> 00:04:00,590
technology platforms really a lot of

00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:03,570
hard wired duct-taped band-aide together

00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:06,450
systems that don't really provide the

00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:07,680
basis of a platform of the future and

00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:10,140
really we were trying to build an

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,340
application platform of the future so

00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,750
what we did is the innovation

00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,519
Development Center when we first formed

00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:16,850
looked at what were the emerging trends

00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:19,080
in the industry what were the new norms

00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:21,810
how could we take advantage of these

00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:24,750
norms as we moved into the future and we

00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:27,450
believed that core logic was kind of

00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:28,740
standing on at a point where we could

00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:33,510
take advantage of these things to really

00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:36,570
change the industries that we play in so

00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:40,020
we created the my boss actually created

00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:42,030
this market extra version of our of our

00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,950
future which is really a good depiction

00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:45,900
of what we were trying to do when you

00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:48,690
look at individual business units that

00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:50,940
have siloed technology stacks each

00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:52,530
delivering products sometimes to the

00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:55,080
same customers of CoreLogic

00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:57,360
it creates a lot of confusion it creates

00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,890
a lot of developer overhead it really

00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:03,120
isn't the best way to leverage the core

00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:05,280
logic data repository we needed a way to

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,160
deliver using the the emerging

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:11,940
technologies voice I phones are phones

00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:14,010
smartphones iPads we needed to integrate

00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:16,020
still with our legacy customer

00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:19,080
environments on the b2b basis whether

00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:20,790
they had a hosted solution but we needed

00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,730
something that had an underlying common

00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:25,770
component common services architecture

00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:27,210
that we could work from and lastly and

00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:28,800
very important I think everyone else has

00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:30,750
touched upon this infrastructure as a

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,060
service was important to us as we looked

00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:35,910
at emerging cloud trends we were already

00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:38,220
running some applications out in Amazon

00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:40,670
we were running applications and Azure

00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:43,350
but again different technology stacks

00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:46,320
really nothing we could leverage and the

00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:48,870
problem we have as a very regulated

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:51,300
company under the scrutiny of the CFPB

00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:53,220
and financial institutions is that some

00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:55,740
applications we have just simply can't

00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:57,180
run in a public cloud environment but we

00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:00,930
didn't want to build a version of

00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:03,300
on-prem data privacy applications that

00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:05,280
work in our vSphere environment and then

00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:09,000
have a whole nother set of applications

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:10,620
that work out in Amazon or CHS or

00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,030
whatever the public cloud Rackspace

00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,500
whatever a public cloud offering we

00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:17,010
wanted to have but we wanted that

00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:18,720
flexibility to move as the industries as

00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:20,880
information security and compliance

00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:25,290
trends shifted we didn't want to have to

00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:27,360
go back and rewrite our applications we

00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:30,630
also looked at data as a very important

00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,980
part of our future especially as our new

00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:34,160
platform that we were going to develop

00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:36,330
was going to leverage different

00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,910
information delivery technology

00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:40,500
architectures so from a from the

00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:41,280
standpoint of core logic you know we

00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,620
have

00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,330
a lot of data that we we consume and we

00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:47,340
ingest as a company we consume

00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:51,090
information about every property in the

00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:53,220
United States a lot of consumer data a

00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:55,050
lot of different information so what we

00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:57,389
needed to do is a better way to deliver

00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:58,919
that today we deliver it through a

00:06:57,389 --> 00:07:01,950
series of relational database

00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:03,930
technologies through enterprise data

00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:05,910
warehousing technologies and as I said

00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:09,930
before we have every data technology so

00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:12,480
we have Terra data Anna Tizi Vertica

00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:14,850
Oracle sequel server my sequel I mean

00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:16,800
the list goes on and on and on we wanted

00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:18,210
to really we had the opportunity and

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,669
we're given the opportunity to start

00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:22,650
from scratch and look at big data and

00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:24,390
fast data technologies and leverage

00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:27,060
those to build new analytics and new

00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:29,130
data for the future we also had some key

00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:31,950
design principles now I think everyone's

00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:33,680
heard of fail fast and no big bets those

00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:37,650
were kind of our over overarching

00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:39,600
tenants we didn't want to as I've often

00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:41,400
said to my team we weren't getting 50

00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,200
million dollars and taking five years

00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,630
and building something we needed to

00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:47,160
deliver in short increments and when we

00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:49,919
saw something not working we needed to

00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:52,020
adjust quickly we also needed to build

00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:54,120
out in a world where we were going to be

00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:57,419
hybrid and interoperating with our

00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:59,039
legacy environments the other thing in

00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:01,229
easy bullet point number one there are

00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:03,930
developers because we had all of these

00:08:01,229 --> 00:08:06,150
technology stacks were often involved in

00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:08,789
the minut details of every technology

00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:10,919
stack we supported our goal was to

00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:12,360
abstract developers away we didn't know

00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:14,490
it was going to be Cloud Foundry when we

00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,039
came up with this we just knew that our

00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:18,510
developers were spending too much time

00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:20,460
the intellectual property in the secret

00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:22,770
sauce of core logic is developers

00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:25,169
focused on building business value for

00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:27,870
core logic not in understanding how web

00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:31,289
logic works not in understanding how Red

00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:33,060
Hat Linux works or a nice Series RPG

00:08:31,289 --> 00:08:35,460
program or anything else that we may

00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:37,460
have had on the other thing is we wanted

00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:41,610
resource flexibility so that we could

00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:43,860
move resources in a common sdlc in a

00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:45,720
common technology environment from

00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:47,850
application to application from project

00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:50,040
to project and product to product in a

00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:52,230
much more fungible way than we do today

00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:54,660
so we kind of settled in on this notion

00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:56,220
of really what we want if

00:08:54,660 --> 00:09:00,240
we're abstracting away everything is we

00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:01,740
want everything as a service and we came

00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,529
up with a detailed reference

00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:06,600
architecture and unlike everyone else

00:09:04,529 --> 00:09:07,949
that showed nice legal slides my legal

00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:12,000
team just told me I couldn't talk about

00:09:07,949 --> 00:09:13,620
it but so that kind of you know if you

00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,350
want to talk to us afterwards we have

00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:18,149
some of our team here but but anyway so

00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:19,889
so we came up with a nice detailed

00:09:18,149 --> 00:09:21,920
reference architecture and the notion

00:09:19,889 --> 00:09:23,970
was everything as a service again

00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,769
developers focused on developing

00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:29,189
products and services for CoreLogic

00:09:25,769 --> 00:09:31,500
and us running in a hybrid cloud

00:09:29,189 --> 00:09:33,870
environment with some type of platform

00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:37,230
as-a-service architecture and we took

00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:39,750
this conceptual model to a number of

00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:41,509
different technology experts and we were

00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:44,939
looking for some key fundamental things

00:09:41,509 --> 00:09:46,680
market adoption is the community going

00:09:44,939 --> 00:09:49,470
to expand we know we were on the leading

00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:51,569
edge of some of these things is it going

00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:53,459
to lock us into the specific vendor or

00:09:51,569 --> 00:09:55,529
give us opportunities and options in the

00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:57,829
future to move to different technologies

00:09:55,529 --> 00:10:00,720
different services as they come about

00:09:57,829 --> 00:10:03,649
you know from an ecosystem perspective

00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:07,259
we wanted a broad and robust ecosystem

00:10:03,649 --> 00:10:10,259
we did for actually in the fall we did

00:10:07,259 --> 00:10:13,800
for many proofs of concept we looked at

00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:15,029
the results of that and to be honest you

00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,110
know there were a lot of things that

00:10:15,029 --> 00:10:17,579
were similar in some of these things

00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:19,079
that we looked at a lot of things that

00:10:17,579 --> 00:10:20,699
were different from an enterprise

00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:22,740
perspective and a lot of benefits and

00:10:20,699 --> 00:10:25,920
pros and cons at the end of the day

00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:28,350
though what we really liked about Cloud

00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:31,079
Foundry was pivotal and why we liked

00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:33,269
pivotal is I call it the 360 degree view

00:10:31,079 --> 00:10:35,970
CoreLogic is an information data

00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:38,490
analytics company pivotal has a strong

00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:41,069
background in information and data

00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:42,300
products pivotal Cloud Foundry the

00:10:41,069 --> 00:10:43,920
commercial version of Cloud Foundry

00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:46,589
allows us to be on an open source

00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,319
standard of Cloud Foundry but yet with

00:10:46,589 --> 00:10:50,819
pivotal behind it supporting it and the

00:10:48,319 --> 00:10:53,339
pivotal labs environment led us to

00:10:50,819 --> 00:10:55,589
basically we took our scrum agile

00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:58,500
engineers that we had and we're able to

00:10:55,589 --> 00:11:00,420
move them into a more extreme agile

00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,699
environment working side-by-side which

00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:05,459
I'll get to in a minute with the the

00:11:02,699 --> 00:11:07,210
pivotal team here in San Francisco what

00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:11,140
we were able to do then

00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:13,390
with pivotal is after the mini pocs is

00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:15,070
in February we landed a team on the

00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:17,380
ground here in San Francisco we started

00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:19,420
building our first product so this was a

00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:22,030
from scratch product so remember our

00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:23,800
idea is to build a complete core logic

00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:26,710
platform we were given the opportunity

00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:29,290
to go greenfield we were given the

00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:32,440
opportunity to forget the legacy but

00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:33,850
interoperate with the legacy so unlike

00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,680
some of the other case studies it gives

00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:37,990
us the opportunity to sit down and start

00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:40,210
building new products on an entire new

00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:42,400
technology stack and then integrate

00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:45,970
other products over a road map and over

00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:47,860
a basically over time so we were able to

00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:51,040
hit the ground on in February with

00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:54,640
pivotal building our first product which

00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:56,590
is on track for delivery on July 1st

00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:59,170
it's actually an internal facing

00:11:56,590 --> 00:12:01,030
application that supports the data

00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:03,490
operation function but also an external

00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:05,830
facing client application that will be

00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:08,410
used by financial institutions to help

00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:10,990
in the underwriting process for mortgage

00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:13,030
originations so it's a very critical

00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:15,520
application in the life cycle and supply

00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:18,730
chain we realized that the Cloud Foundry

00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:20,710
platform is still relatively new but

00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:23,530
we've we put kind of our eggs in the in

00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:25,720
the Cloud Foundry basket because we feel

00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:28,870
like the community the people here today

00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:31,210
in this in the summit the companies that

00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:32,890
we've been talking to who are developing

00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:34,300
products and services on Cloud Foundry

00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:37,570
are going to give us that robust

00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:39,220
platform that we need in fact we had

00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:41,110
such great success in the first couple

00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:43,510
of months of our project February March

00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:46,810
that we launched a second product

00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:48,640
development effort in April which will

00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:51,160
actually go live sometime in September

00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:53,490
with the first release so both of those

00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:56,080
products are on track and on budget

00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:58,180
we're working jointly CoreLogic

00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,650
engineers core logic designers core

00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:01,660
logic product management working jointly

00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:04,300
with pivotal using the Cloud Foundry

00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:07,210
platform but again I just want to be

00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:08,710
clear these are really intended to be

00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:11,320
pilots for us

00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:12,910
we have an entire roadmap of platform

00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:16,660
services and things that we need to

00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:18,670
build out to fill in the ecosystem for

00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:20,080
core logic that was quite of a quick

00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:20,769
journey because I don't have all of the

00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,939
detailed arc

00:13:20,769 --> 00:13:25,059
picture slides that I wanted to show you

00:13:21,939 --> 00:13:26,980
but our journey has just begun and when

00:13:25,059 --> 00:13:29,769
we looked out at the technology industry

00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:32,670
a year ago and have started down this

00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:34,989
path with cloud foundry we realized that

00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:36,970
enterprises today companies such as

00:13:34,989 --> 00:13:38,459
CoreLogic we're building applications

00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:40,389
that are internal facing and

00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:42,939
applications that are external facing

00:13:40,389 --> 00:13:44,949
products of ours can take advantage of

00:13:42,939 --> 00:13:46,869
the same technologies that startups that

00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:49,749
Silicon Valley companies take advantage

00:13:46,869 --> 00:13:51,459
of that SAS can take advantage of we can

00:13:49,749 --> 00:13:54,279
also take advantage of those type of

00:13:51,459 --> 00:13:58,779
products in building our applications

00:13:54,279 --> 00:14:01,629
and I think what you find is that the

00:13:58,779 --> 00:14:04,329
new norm can be taken advantage of by

00:14:01,629 --> 00:14:05,649
any enterprise those new norms including

00:14:04,329 --> 00:14:08,739
platform-as-a-service

00:14:05,649 --> 00:14:11,889
we are going to rely upon of open and

00:14:08,739 --> 00:14:15,160
rich and robust set of services going

00:14:11,889 --> 00:14:16,689
from end to end from devops to all of

00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:19,899
the common services and components we

00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:22,119
need to build out that's going to be you

00:14:19,899 --> 00:14:24,249
know leveraging really the community

00:14:22,119 --> 00:14:26,920
that's in this room and we're very

00:14:24,249 --> 00:14:29,920
excited about you know our journey again

00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:32,790
it's it's very early on but very so far

00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:37,920
great success from what we've seen and

00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:37,920
that's the CoreLogic story thank you

00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:43,799
