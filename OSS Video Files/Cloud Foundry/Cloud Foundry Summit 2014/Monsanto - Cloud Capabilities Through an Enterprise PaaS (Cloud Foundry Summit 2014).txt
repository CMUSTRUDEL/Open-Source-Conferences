Title: Monsanto - Cloud Capabilities Through an Enterprise PaaS (Cloud Foundry Summit 2014)
Publication date: 2014-07-03
Playlist: Cloud Foundry Summit 2014
Description: 
	Keynote presented by Mark Seidenstricker, Infrastructure Architect, Monsanto.

The benefits of cloud computing are undisputed, but successful large-scale adoption remains a challenge for many enterprises due to the required shift in technology, culture, and operational models. This presentation will explore how we envision PaaS as the catalyst for a successful cloud strategy by enabling many of the benefits of cloud while simultaneously mitigating some common cloud adoption concerns.

a lot of what I'm going to speak to you

00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:15,960
today about is more of what we will do

00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:18,510
and where we're going and not so much of

00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:21,630
what we've done already but also how

00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:24,529
Monsanto sees cloud foundry and paths as

00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:27,920
really an enabler to our cloud strategy

00:00:24,529 --> 00:00:30,420
so I'll throw up the lawyer's slide

00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:33,420
probably not a whole lot there that you

00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:35,850
haven't seen before but really what I

00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,200
wanted to summarize and say is you know

00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:39,840
don't use the contents of my

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,899
presentation as the the sole basis to go

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,100
out and buy a bunch of Monsanto stock

00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:49,590
although our stock is doing pretty good

00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:51,559
right now so who is Monsanto for those

00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:53,730
who don't know Monsanto is a

00:00:51,559 --> 00:00:56,190
20-something thousand employee company

00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:58,940
and we're headquartered in Saint Louis

00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:01,199
Missouri where I happen to be from and

00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:04,290
our vision is really all about

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:08,220
sustainable agriculture and we plan to

00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:10,520
drive that vision by producing more so

00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:14,010
increasing the yield of our core crops

00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:15,720
while conserving more so reducing the

00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:18,150
amount of the natural resources that we

00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,670
have to put into those crops and in the

00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:24,000
process will improve the lives of

00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:26,310
farmers and people around the world and

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,750
I'll in the sales pitch there but I've

00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:29,850
included a link at the bottom of the

00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,890
slide if you want to check it out it

00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:34,110
goes into a short video a little bit

00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:36,689
more about what about what our pledge is

00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:39,689
and I think it's a really meaningful

00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:44,220
commitment and one too that I'm proud to

00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:46,829
play a part in so I just told you that

00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:48,930
Monsanto's in agriculture company right

00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:50,189
and how interesting is that to a bunch

00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:53,520
of people sitting around at a tech

00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:54,750
conference well I can tell you from

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,460
someone who actually grew up in a

00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:59,430
farming community even though I wasn't

00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:01,560
directly involved in farming that

00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:04,290
farming today is actually deception

00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:07,640
deceptively technologically advanced and

00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:09,989
it's increasingly information driven and

00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:13,580
that's important because if you want to

00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:16,100
use that information to drive innovation

00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:18,620
to drive competitive advantage you need

00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:20,420
lots of software and software is

00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:23,530
something that probably everyone here is

00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:26,870
interested in and you need a platform

00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:29,540
that can drive that software at a

00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:32,300
disruptive pace so I told you we need

00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:34,160
lots of software we need agility to

00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:36,380
drive it at a fast pace

00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,740
we need massive scale we want

00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:43,040
self-service so cloud computing seemed

00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:44,360
like the rational path to go down but

00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,850
the problem is for an enterprise you

00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:49,160
can't just enable and open the

00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:51,560
floodgates to Amazon right because

00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:53,360
there's a lot of real concerns that you

00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:56,030
have to tackle first and those are

00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,160
concerns around security data

00:02:56,030 --> 00:03:00,260
classification you know how do you shift

00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:04,520
your operational and your financial

00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:06,740
models and almost as important you can't

00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:08,930
just take your internal development team

00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:12,920
and say hey start developing cloud

00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:16,370
applications because if you do that you

00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:17,840
start to hit some common barriers first

00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:20,480
of all you'll find out that most

00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:24,320
enterprise software stacks are not cloud

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:26,810
friendly if you're like most enterprises

00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:29,600
like Monsanto you probably have a

00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:31,070
standard internal technology stack based

00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,430
on one of the big enterprise software

00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:36,140
providers like the IBM's or the Oracles

00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:38,209
and those technology stacks are great

00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:40,370
you know they're scalable you can deploy

00:03:38,209 --> 00:03:42,530
them quickly but the fact of the matter

00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:46,420
is they probably just won't be available

00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:50,060
at an external cloud and that's an issue

00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:52,250
secondly agile development doesn't work

00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:55,310
without an agile infrastructure to work

00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:58,040
with so at Monsanto we've taken great

00:03:55,310 --> 00:04:03,880
strides recently to move our development

00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:06,830
organizations into agile methodology and

00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:08,630
that's great but if you don't give that

00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:11,959
development organization an agile

00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:14,000
infrastructure top would operate on then

00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:16,370
you know it might still take that

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,900
developer weeks worth of time thousands

00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:20,209
of dollars to get a server to deploy

00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:23,419
their code to and if that's the case

00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:25,370
then they're really not being agile and

00:04:23,419 --> 00:04:27,200
finally you'll find out that emerging

00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:29,420
technologies are hard for an

00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:32,540
price to try out and they're even harder

00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:34,490
to adopt you know if you have one of

00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:37,040
these enterprise software stacks that I

00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:38,690
mentioned earlier you probably also put

00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,510
a large amount of investment in those

00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:43,760
you have a large support organization

00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:47,090
that is focused on supporting those

00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:49,130
technologies and so those organizations

00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:51,050
are focused more on standardization

00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:53,870
right and they're not really focused on

00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:56,360
how do I enable innovation and how do I

00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:59,450
let my developers quickly try out new

00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:02,990
technologies so if you look at all these

00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:04,910
barriers what we decided was that really

00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:07,070
if we wanted to enable an external cloud

00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:09,560
we almost first had to enable an

00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:10,880
internal cloud and that's really what we

00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:15,110
started looking at cloud foundry and

00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:17,480
pass to facilitate so by looking at

00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:19,670
cloud foundry we wanted to enable and

00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:22,070
accelerate Monsanto's adoption of agile

00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:26,090
devops and continuous deployment

00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:27,920
continuous release we wanted to find

00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:29,600
this technology stack that is open and

00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:31,970
that's really important for us to avoid

00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,280
vendor lock-in right and we wanted to

00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:36,320
start decoupling applications from the

00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:38,570
infrastructure that they run on so that

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,760
we can start to get application

00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:43,040
portability so we can move those

00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:44,930
applications between a variety of

00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:48,260
infrastructure providers including

00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:51,200
internal and external we wanted to

00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:53,620
increase that developer agility by

00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:56,420
enabling automated self-service and

00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:59,390
finally we wanted to keep the cost of

00:05:56,420 --> 00:06:01,160
entry low and buy versus build and what

00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:03,740
I mean by this is we wanted to find a

00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:05,180
turnkey path solution right because we

00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:08,600
didn't want to invest a large amount of

00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:10,730
time and resources into building a cloud

00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:13,400
infrastructure internally from scratch

00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:15,320
on our own so where are we so far back

00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,490
in December we start an assessment of

00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,770
pivotal Cloud Foundry

00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:21,470
and what we found is that Cloud Foundry

00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:23,740
and Bosch are both stable open platforms

00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:27,440
and they have a lot of large adopters

00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:29,330
you know starting back in December we

00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,950
were investigating the beta product of

00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:34,610
pivotal so I guess you could call that a

00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:36,470
0.9 version and we had a lot of concerns

00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:38,720
internally of you know this is a this is

00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:40,430
a beta product how much faith can you

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,280
put in in a product at zero point

00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:45,530
9 and the reality is Cloud Foundry as a

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:49,040
platform has been around since 2009

00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:51,980
alright so really what the 0.9 or the

00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:54,350
1.2 version today is all about is it's

00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:56,240
the pivotal package supported version

00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:58,940
that can run internally in your

00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:01,250
environment and there are lots of large

00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:04,370
adopters already who have actually built

00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:05,750
platforms on the technology and a lot of

00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:07,970
those vendors are represented in the

00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:10,480
audience today but just to name a few of

00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:14,330
the the more notable Enterprise ones IBM

00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:15,620
Verizon CenturyLink HP and GE have all

00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:17,660
taken this platform and started to

00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:19,430
actually build real products on top of

00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:23,510
it so there's a lot of momentum behind

00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:25,520
it already we found that the platform is

00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:27,860
very developer focused in its current

00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,930
iteration but I think that's ok because

00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:33,650
that was probably really the intent

00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:35,270
right but a downfall of that is from

00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:36,920
someone who comes from a more of a

00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:39,710
sysadmin background is some of the

00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:41,590
administrative and support capabilities

00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:44,300
are still maturing through the product

00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:46,250
and I'll give a couple of examples so

00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,960
monitoring and alerting there's very

00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:52,070
little of that that just comes out of

00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:54,410
the box the there's 80 integration but

00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:56,120
really it's not the way that an

00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:59,330
enterprise would probably want to see it

00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:01,850
yet and that there's some infrastructure

00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:03,650
layer specific features that still need

00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:05,540
to mature a little bit more before we

00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:07,760
would really say there how we want them

00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:09,860
right out of the box so there are a few

00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:11,420
gaps but I think that's ok right because

00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:13,790
the beauty of Cloud Foundry

00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:16,280
is that it is that open platform and

00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:18,800
it's very extensible right so you can

00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:20,480
extend the platform to fill any one of

00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,250
these gaps or any gaps that might exist

00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:25,310
for your technology for your

00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:26,720
organization and that's exactly what

00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:30,380
some of these large vendors who have

00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:32,120
already adopted it have done we think

00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:34,400
that pivotal can provide a turnkey

00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:36,680
solution for PA's right so they take

00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,720
Cloud Foundry they wrap it with some goo

00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:41,630
ease some installers some 24 by 7

00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:43,310
support and then very important for

00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:45,740
Monsanto and probably other enterprises

00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:48,970
is that they support that turnkey pass

00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:51,260
internally on your vSphere environment

00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:53,630
vSphere is our enterprise hypervisor

00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:54,110
we've put a large investment in that

00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:56,360
layer

00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:58,850
we have support teams who know how to

00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,529
support that layer so having a vendor

00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:02,300
that can give us a platform layer that

00:09:00,529 --> 00:09:03,740
sits on top of an infrastructure layer

00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:05,810
that we're very comfortable with and

00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:09,230
already know how to support is really

00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:11,300
beneficial we think that based on what

00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:12,829
we've seen in the assessment various

00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,810
activities of the application

00:09:12,829 --> 00:09:19,190
development lifecycle can be increased

00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:21,800
are improved by 50% or more and this is

00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:23,810
kind of a rough number but really

00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:27,860
another key thing here is we don't think

00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:31,130
that 50% efficiency gain is just limited

00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:33,140
to a subset of people right if you're

00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:35,810
like Monsanto you probably have multiple

00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:38,029
delivery teams multiple operations teams

00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:39,769
lots of people involved in release

00:09:38,029 --> 00:09:44,060
management and then of course lots of

00:09:39,769 --> 00:09:46,100
developers so this 50% improvement can

00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:48,079
really be spread across all those groups

00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:49,579
and if you can spread it across all

00:09:48,079 --> 00:09:51,620
those people that really makes the

00:09:49,579 --> 00:09:54,950
benefit and the value of Cloud Foundry

00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:57,230
all that all that much more so I'll

00:09:54,950 --> 00:10:00,050
share with you just a quick early

00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:02,720
success story we had for a developer who

00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:08,300
was able to go from a week to just a few

00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:10,130
minutes so we hired a developer and his

00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:11,510
first task was to come up with an

00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:14,390
application that would do some

00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:18,440
integration between JIRA and our CMDB

00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:20,209
and internally our our application

00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:22,160
server layer is WebLogic that's kind of

00:10:20,209 --> 00:10:25,579
our standard so that was the platform

00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:28,459
that he was told to code to so he wrote

00:10:25,579 --> 00:10:31,130
his code tried to deploy it and it

00:10:28,459 --> 00:10:33,050
didn't work so I started doing some

00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,430
troubleshooting and he did the little

00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:36,440
troubleshooting he was able to do just

00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:38,829
because of the permissions that he has

00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:41,449
on that WebLogic platform as a developer

00:10:38,829 --> 00:10:44,870
all right so he didn't get very far he

00:10:41,449 --> 00:10:46,070
had to open some support tickets so he

00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:48,589
worked with the support team for a while

00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:50,570
and finally they agreed that he was

00:10:48,589 --> 00:10:52,760
trying to use a version of a library or

00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:54,589
a function that just wasn't compatible

00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:57,920
with the version of web logic that were

00:10:54,589 --> 00:11:00,199
running internally so he's kind of at a

00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:03,170
standstill now right a week of time has

00:11:00,199 --> 00:11:05,810
passed his deadline for his projects

00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:07,130
coming up what is he going to do so he

00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:07,970
reached out to one of the developers

00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:09,939
that was working

00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:12,649
with us on our Cloud Foundry assessment

00:11:09,939 --> 00:11:14,180
told him what was going on they made him

00:11:12,649 --> 00:11:16,040
an account and within a matter of

00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:18,850
minutes he had his code deployed on

00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:22,370
Cloud Foundry and everything was running

00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:24,139
and I really like that story because it

00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:26,660
sort of illustrates a few things that

00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:28,519
Cloud Foundry can enable for you first

00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:30,639
that developer would have been able to

00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:33,500
do a lot more troubleshooting on his own

00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:34,910
in an environment where clinic like

00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,949
Cloud Foundry where he has more

00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:39,470
permissions right it's sort of it puts

00:11:36,949 --> 00:11:41,120
the tools to solve the problem in the

00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:44,449
hands of the person who actually has the

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:46,639
problem and if you can do that then you

00:11:44,449 --> 00:11:48,290
avoid a lot of the finger-pointing and

00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:50,870
back-and-forth that can sort of occur

00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:53,420
between your support organizations and

00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:55,100
your developers of you know the issue is

00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:58,250
your code or no the issue is your

00:11:55,100 --> 00:12:01,339
platform and finally it really

00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:03,649
illustrates the flexibility of Cloud

00:12:01,339 --> 00:12:07,040
Foundry right the the big issue he had

00:12:03,649 --> 00:12:09,230
here was you know we only have one

00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:12,079
application server environment WebLogic

00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:14,089
and we only run one version of that so

00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:16,670
something like Cloud Foundry allows you

00:12:14,089 --> 00:12:18,500
to run any number of runtimes with any

00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:22,519
number of versions simultaneously

00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:25,459
without issue so that flexibility gives

00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:27,379
the developer a lot of benefit so I

00:12:25,459 --> 00:12:30,379
started putting this slide together back

00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:34,459
in the pivotal Cloud Foundry say 100

00:12:30,379 --> 00:12:36,470
days and part of our assessment was okay

00:12:34,459 --> 00:12:38,180
let's look at what we would really

00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:40,910
consider required out-of-the-box

00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:44,089
functionality for an enterprise pass and

00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:47,149
see how close does that product get to

00:12:44,089 --> 00:12:48,980
delivering what what we came up with so

00:12:47,149 --> 00:12:52,519
I put this slide together with input

00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:55,819
from pivotal roadmap and I won't go over

00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:57,290
every item in here because you know

00:12:55,819 --> 00:12:59,779
these items actually might be different

00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:04,000
for your organization but what I would

00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:06,889
like to showcase is where are we today

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,639
so Cloud Foundry pivotal Cloud Foundry

00:13:06,889 --> 00:13:13,100
1.2 is out today and as you can see

00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:15,199
pivotal and the team have deployed

00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:17,929
basically where they said they were

00:13:15,199 --> 00:13:19,939
going to be and I think this is really

00:13:17,929 --> 00:13:21,830
important because it shows you sort of

00:13:19,939 --> 00:13:23,720
the focus

00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:25,610
the velocity that pivotal in the entire

00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:28,280
community are sort of taking this

00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:33,710
platform and turning it into a true

00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:36,620
enterprise solution so where are we

00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:38,360
going from here we want to proceed with

00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:41,030
an internal Cloud Foundry environment

00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:43,670
and by doing that we'll be able to

00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:45,770
provide an internal proving grounds for

00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:48,590
cloud applications cloud application

00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:51,800
architectures and processes including

00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:54,070
DevOps and if we can give that internal

00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:56,900
proving grounds to our development teams

00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:58,970
we can mitigate some of the challenges

00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:01,580
that we have with our cost models our

00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:03,500
security our data classification that we

00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:06,530
would have if we went directly to an

00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:08,510
external cloud offering it also allows

00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:11,660
us to start shifting from proprietary

00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:13,640
non cloud friendly software stacks to

00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:15,380
those open source technologies that

00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:17,450
actually would be available for use at

00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:19,880
an external cloud to do this we want to

00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:21,890
target non-business critical apps and we

00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:23,870
want to run all the environments all the

00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:25,910
way through fraud on cloud foundry and

00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:27,740
we see this kind of as key because you

00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:29,120
really don't learn a lot if the only

00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:30,560
thing you put on Cloud Foundry when

00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,200
you're trying it out is just development

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:35,540
apps right or just apps that only one or

00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:37,430
two people use to get the real value out

00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:38,960
of it and tend to learn what you need to

00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:40,700
know you need to have real-life business

00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:42,830
applications that actually serve

00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:44,990
meaningful business processes so that's

00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:46,820
what we want to do and if we can do that

00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:48,710
then we can start to gather some real

00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:50,810
life metrics on what are the

00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:52,580
improvements to the various aspects of

00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:55,220
our development lifecycle you know how

00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:57,470
close to that 50 percent efficiency gain

00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:59,480
can we really get and if you do that

00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:01,310
then you can start to really build the

00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,680
value what's the TCO of cloud foundry to

00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:06,140
your organization it'll also allow us to

00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,940
start to assess what's the actual impact

00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:09,890
of some of those gaps that I called out

00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:11,660
in the roadmap slide you know maybe some

00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:12,250
of them aren't really as important as we

00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:15,170
thought they were

00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:18,500
maybe there's gaps that we didn't see

00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:20,450
that we'll find and then based on our

00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:23,680
completed assessment we want to proceed

00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:25,970
with the full-scale deployment in 2015

00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:28,370
and I really think this is possible

00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:30,590
and we're at where we are today because

00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:33,590
our senior management has a commitment

00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:35,690
for cloud that it's really not an if but

00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:38,000
a how and my organizations role

00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:40,340
as part of Monsanto IT is to partner

00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,590
with the business and to drive revenue

00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:44,800
through disruptive innovation and we

00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:47,360
really see Cloud Foundry and Paz as

00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,860
foundational to that vision so hopefully

00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,360
this was informational to other

00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,980
enterprises who are sort of at the same

00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:54,970
leg of their journey with Cloud Foundry

00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:58,570
as I am thank you all for listening and

00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:58,570
yes we are hiring

00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:06,479
