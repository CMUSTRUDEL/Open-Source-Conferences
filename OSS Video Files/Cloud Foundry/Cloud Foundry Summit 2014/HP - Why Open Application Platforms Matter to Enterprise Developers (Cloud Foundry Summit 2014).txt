Title: HP - Why Open Application Platforms Matter to Enterprise Developers (Cloud Foundry Summit 2014)
Publication date: 2014-07-03
Playlist: Cloud Foundry Summit 2014
Description: 
	Keynote presented by Manav Mishra, Director of Product, HP Helion.

Today, enterprise developers need the ability to easily develop and deploy applications across different types of cloud deployments, in a framework of their choice. Sounds simple. However, in today's world developers need to understand the entire cloud underpinning, and enterprise applications require open and flexible architectures that deliver consistent access to infrastructure and highly available services. Join Manav Mishra, Director, Product, HP Cloud, for an engaging discussion on HP's strategy and innovation around HP Helion, the role of Cloud Foundry and OpenStackÂ® and why it matters to today's enterprise developers.

00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:15,289
so I'm here to talk talk about a few

00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:18,060
things I'm here to talk to you about

00:00:15,289 --> 00:00:20,010
enterprises and the enterprise needs I'm

00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:23,449
here to talk to you about developers and

00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:25,380
what developers are looking for and why

00:00:23,449 --> 00:00:29,220
open platforms matter

00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:31,619
I'm mamonov I work for the HP Helion

00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:34,620
team those of you who don't know what HP

00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:37,710
Helion is simple definition Helion is

00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:42,450
everything cloud at HP so before I start

00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:44,760
talking about Helion and developers and

00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,840
enterprises and open platform so a quick

00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,850
background on me

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,420
so when when I was in college I was

00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:52,710
learning about the OSI stack and you

00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,590
know I specialized in computer

00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:58,469
networking and I decided to model my

00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:00,539
career and career choices on the on the

00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:03,329
OSI layer so I say no I'm just kidding

00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:06,390
but I started working at Intel I worked

00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:09,420
at Microsoft at Google now I'm at HP

00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:10,799
where it all comes together so during

00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,020
the course of the last like decade

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,240
decade in half that I've been talking to

00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:18,479
you know a lot of enterprises talking to

00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:20,520
a lot of CIOs a lot of CEOs a few things

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:23,640
have come out very loud and clear and

00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:25,590
interestingly the enterprise challenges

00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:29,939
or the needs you know as you may call it

00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:31,890
have remained mostly unchanged and that

00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:33,720
is because these needs and these

00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:35,939
challenges are very characteristic of

00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,610
how enterprises are set up our

00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:41,430
enterprise IDs work today so first and

00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:44,430
foremost is enterprises run one of

00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:47,670
everything right there's no no notion of

00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:49,170
homogeneity in an enterprise depending

00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:52,560
on the solution depending on the

00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:55,500
scenario depending on the needs of the

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,399
customer the enterprise customer there's

00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,869
one of everything

00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:04,280
so what CIO CEOs are always seeking is a

00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:06,630
unifying layer a layer which normalizes

00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:10,860
everything that's disparate and

00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:13,540
disconnected in the in the network you

00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:16,209
know they want it all come together

00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:18,340
the second thing which will resonate

00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:19,349
with all of you I you know I used to as

00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:23,290
I said I used to work at Microsoft

00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:26,110
before and enterprises do not like the

00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:28,930
notion of vendor lock-in for a variety

00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:31,060
of reasons the primary one being vendor

00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:34,269
lock-in is seen as a way as an

00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:35,980
inhibiting factor to innovation because

00:02:34,269 --> 00:02:37,900
if you buy you know you get invested

00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:39,489
into one particular vendor and all you

00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,620
can do is continue to invest more and

00:02:39,489 --> 00:02:43,690
more into that vendors solutions and

00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:45,760
products you are kind of being

00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:47,049
restricted from leveraging the belt in

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,700
the latest and the greatest that the

00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:54,790
industry has to offer and finally I

00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:56,079
think any enterprise IT organization the

00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:58,120
CTO the leader of the organization

00:02:56,079 --> 00:03:00,879
probably has the toughest job in the

00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:03,579
industry that I know of today because

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:05,890
they've given to two goals they are

00:03:03,579 --> 00:03:07,629
given to success metrics and these

00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:10,180
success metrics are in direct

00:03:07,629 --> 00:03:13,299
contradiction of each other the first

00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:14,890
one is hey you know you need to move the

00:03:13,299 --> 00:03:16,780
organization forward you need to foster

00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:19,959
innovation in the organization you need

00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:22,599
to be forward-looking and the second

00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:24,790
goal is hey you need to have low total

00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:27,099
cost of ownership you are a cost center

00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:30,669
you are not an are in the organization

00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:33,669
so these two goals usually create a lot

00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:38,349
of pressure a lot of inbound pressure

00:03:33,669 --> 00:03:40,180
into an enterprise IT organization so in

00:03:38,349 --> 00:03:42,370
my experience working with the

00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:46,030
enterprise is one thing that's been very

00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:49,329
obvious is that enterprises see open

00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:52,120
platforms and open source platforms as a

00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:54,599
solution to some of the challenges that

00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:57,910
they that they face on a regular basis

00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:59,019
however there are concerns around open

00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:01,269
source and these are concerns that

00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:02,590
everybody in this room must be familiar

00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:04,510
with which is you know the lack of

00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:07,329
support or security that or the notion

00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:11,919
of an ecosystem or maturity of the

00:04:07,329 --> 00:04:13,870
product and you know several of us you

00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:15,430
know and at this conference I've been

00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:18,910
working have spent a lot of time

00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:21,130
ensuring that enterprises learn to see

00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:24,280
open source and open platforms as a very

00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:26,260
compelling solution for the needs but

00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:29,530
why do open platforms matter

00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:31,720
open platforms matter because they

00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:34,020
enable the foster they enable and foster

00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:37,540
the development of applications and

00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:39,660
applications are great because hey

00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:41,620
that's where the true innovation happens

00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:43,870
applications are great because that's

00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:46,300
where the touch point with the broader

00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:50,110
organization happens applications are

00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:54,400
great because they they are easy to

00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:57,400
develop and cheap to run so the value

00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:01,720
for an enterprise is always in the

00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:04,150
application layer and since we're

00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:08,760
talking about applications you can't

00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:12,010
have applications without developers

00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:13,780
having been a developer in my previous

00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:16,000
life having run engineering teams in my

00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:17,530
previous lives or what I'm up and in the

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,390
talking to an audience which is

00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:21,010
primarily developers so whatever I'm

00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:23,310
saying over here should be motherhood

00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:27,040
and apple pie to the room first

00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:29,110
developers love to do only one thing the

00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:34,810
thing that they are best at which is

00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:36,730
code second they don't they do not want

00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:37,840
to be like provisioning databases they

00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:38,770
don't want to be professional Ike

00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,570
runtimes they don't want to be

00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:42,010
provisioning messaging services they

00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:43,150
want to write applications they want to

00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:46,690
like create true value through

00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:50,020
innovation at the layer you know in the

00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:53,350
domain of expertise next they like

00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:55,360
abstraction they love api's having a

00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:58,180
true abstraction as true scalable

00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:02,170
abstraction to extensively abstraction

00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:06,280
is something that that every developer

00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:07,870
fancies and then finally they'd like to

00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:10,600
have the right tool for the right job

00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:12,880
so for example a developer working on a

00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:16,150
content management system would prefer

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:18,970
to use a PHP as the development language

00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:20,980
and framework for for they need and

00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:23,470
someone billing building a highly

00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:28,060
performant application for the cloud may

00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:30,070
choose to use node.js now having forcing

00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:32,550
a particular framework choice forcing a

00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:36,940
particular database technology choice

00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:39,070
often tantamount to trying to fix a fit

00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,599
a you know square pole to a round hole

00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:41,610
and

00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:43,080
yes you get an application which does a

00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,749
few things but the applications not

00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,830
performing the applications not

00:06:44,749 --> 00:06:48,509
compelling the application is not

00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:51,569
innovative and the developer is not

00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:54,360
happy so from our perspective from the

00:06:51,569 --> 00:06:58,669
perspective of HP Enterprise needs

00:06:54,360 --> 00:07:01,439
developer needs an open platform in the

00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:04,459
platform as a service layer comes to

00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:08,099
fruition in cloud foundry

00:07:04,459 --> 00:07:11,009
why because cloud foundry we believe is

00:07:08,099 --> 00:07:13,349
a truly open platform cloud foundry we

00:07:11,009 --> 00:07:16,020
believe is has got the industry momentum

00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:18,209
behind it law quandary we believe has

00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:20,339
the right right kind of participants in

00:07:18,209 --> 00:07:22,669
that community and we are very excited

00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:28,069
about what cloud foundry has to offer

00:07:22,669 --> 00:07:33,360
however any platform as a service layer

00:07:28,069 --> 00:07:35,550
still needs infrastructure so when we

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,349
think of a cloud solution when we think

00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:39,569
of our cloud stack we think of an

00:07:37,349 --> 00:07:43,649
end-to-end experience but we're in like

00:07:39,569 --> 00:07:44,999
you know you have infrastructure and at

00:07:43,649 --> 00:07:48,659
the application layer and the platform

00:07:44,999 --> 00:07:51,959
layer working really well together so a

00:07:48,659 --> 00:07:54,869
few years ago we made a big bet and this

00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:56,550
open another open platform in another

00:07:54,869 --> 00:08:02,749
open source effort called

00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:02,749
OpenStack and you know we are today

00:08:07,749 --> 00:08:11,990
so I'm not gonna read through the slide

00:08:10,069 --> 00:08:15,530
but the point do note about OpenStack is

00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:17,870
three years ago at the inaugural opens

00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:20,330
OpenStack summit there were 600

00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:23,210
attendees I just came back from Atlanta

00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:26,419
a couple weeks back and they were about

00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:28,610
5,000 attendees at the last recently

00:08:26,419 --> 00:08:30,229
concluded open stacks on it I'm not

00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:32,089
trying to draw parallels here but I

00:08:30,229 --> 00:08:34,430
think we have about 600 people in this

00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:36,380
audience today so I'm looking forward to

00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:38,949
what like this summit three years from

00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:41,659
now is going to look like if we can

00:08:38,949 --> 00:08:43,490
mimic these success in the momentum that

00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:46,370
OpenStack has had in the infrastructure

00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:49,190
layer at the platform platform level I

00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:52,089
think that'll be a big win for us from

00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:54,829
from an HP point of view we are

00:08:52,089 --> 00:08:57,829
completely 100% invested in OpenStack

00:08:54,829 --> 00:08:58,940
OpenStack is you know of your building

00:08:57,829 --> 00:09:03,529
and shipping products that have been

00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:05,300
built around OpenStack we are the you

00:09:03,529 --> 00:09:06,860
know the number one contributor to Juno

00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:08,600
which is the release of OpenStack that's

00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:10,160
being worked on have the product

00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,680
technical leads in the OpenStack

00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:15,110
community are you know on the

00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:18,620
engineering team which works on our

00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:20,720
OpenStack product and we run one of the

00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:24,560
largest deployments of OpenStack at

00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:26,779
scale in a public cloud so we take a lot

00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,519
of learnings from running OpenStack at

00:09:26,779 --> 00:09:30,949
scale and deliver it back to the

00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:33,230
community because that is the premise of

00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:35,360
our vision that is what we want to do

00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:39,880
that is how we believe true open

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:42,500
platforms evolve we recently announced

00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:45,620
two products as far as the Hylian

00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:48,380
product line one was the HP Helion

00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:51,199
OpenStack which is a product which

00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:53,209
packages OpenStack in a very consumable

00:09:51,199 --> 00:09:55,250
form which makes OpenStack

00:09:53,209 --> 00:09:58,279
enterprise-grade which makes OpenStack

00:09:55,250 --> 00:10:01,730
run at run at scale and the other one is

00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:02,899
the HP Helion development platform I'm

00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:04,640
going to talk a little bit about the

00:10:02,899 --> 00:10:07,190
development platform today because it's

00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,720
very right for this audience I think

00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:12,500
that you know it's very relevant to this

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:14,800
audience HP Helion development platform

00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:17,240
is where cloud foundry meets OpenStack

00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:20,510
so when we started thinking about the

00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:21,470
development platform we said we said two

00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:23,810
goals for the team

00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:26,480
and these are two goals that we said we

00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:28,670
are not willing to compromise on because

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,800
the product needs to have a point of

00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:32,449
view any successful product needs to

00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,240
have a point of view we can't be

00:10:32,449 --> 00:10:36,730
building a Swiss Army knife right so the

00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:40,129
two goals that we set for the product

00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:41,720
were build the best-in-class developer

00:10:40,129 --> 00:10:44,060
experience because at the end of the day

00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:45,860
you can't have a platform if no one's

00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:47,449
building an application to it if you

00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:49,459
don't have an ecosystem you do not have

00:10:47,449 --> 00:10:52,160
a platform and the only way one gets a

00:10:49,459 --> 00:10:54,170
platform is by building a great

00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,060
developer experience which has very

00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:58,730
little barrier to entry which has no

00:10:56,060 --> 00:11:00,829
friction for for developers to start

00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:03,560
using and building applications for the

00:11:00,829 --> 00:11:05,899
platform web and the second goal which

00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:09,889
is equally important is to optimize the

00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:14,149
binding between Cloud Foundry and

00:11:09,889 --> 00:11:16,310
OpenStack very important because we have

00:11:14,149 --> 00:11:19,730
made these two bets and which is

00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:21,560
OpenStack and Cloud Foundry and we don't

00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:26,329
want these to be agnostic of each other

00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:28,209
because then what's the point so some

00:11:26,329 --> 00:11:31,459
some of the optimization that you know

00:11:28,209 --> 00:11:33,319
that potentially we will work with the

00:11:31,459 --> 00:11:34,970
community will work with the with the

00:11:33,319 --> 00:11:38,899
you know with this room on

00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:41,630
oh thanks such as you know identity and

00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:43,550
Keystone integrations or the management

00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:45,709
integration OpenStack has its own

00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:48,470
management experience and so does Cloud

00:11:45,709 --> 00:11:49,790
Foundry but at the end of the day from

00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:52,699
an enterprise admin point of view

00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:54,410
they're running the two together so why

00:11:52,699 --> 00:11:56,779
have two different experiences or why do

00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:59,660
I have two experiences which are totally

00:11:56,779 --> 00:12:01,069
agnostic of each other similarly the

00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:03,980
database as a service in Cloud Foundry

00:12:01,069 --> 00:12:06,470
if it what if it were to talk to trove

00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:08,899
it were to integrate with trove it could

00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:10,639
actually make the highly available and

00:12:08,899 --> 00:12:13,279
viewable aspect of the OpenStack

00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:15,380
platform available to the application

00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:17,569
developer so applications built to Cloud

00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:19,610
Foundry would be highly available would

00:12:17,569 --> 00:12:21,529
be durable same thing applies to

00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:22,550
messaging as a service and Marconi and

00:12:21,529 --> 00:12:24,350
the list goes on

00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:25,790
and again these no this is not the one

00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:28,300
to endless these are just a few examples

00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:32,750
of what we want to do with the community

00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:34,940
food for thought for you and so if I was

00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:36,800
to lead this room and I'm standing

00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:39,259
you know promise to keep it short short

00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:43,399
and sweet so what was to leave you with

00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:46,670
one thought that would be that we see

00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:49,130
Cloud Foundry and OpenStack as two truly

00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:52,100
great open platforms as two platforms

00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:55,130
that are that are the future of the of

00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:58,880
the cloud computing industry we see

00:12:55,130 --> 00:13:01,250
Cloud Foundry and OpenStack as two two

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,509
platforms which can complement each

00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:06,709
other which can work really well

00:13:02,509 --> 00:13:11,060
together we see that the two to two

00:13:06,709 --> 00:13:13,310
layers join together in such a way so

00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:15,769
that the sum of the two is greater than

00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:18,470
the individual parts put together that

00:13:15,769 --> 00:13:21,290
said thank you for your time today I had

00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:25,579
I appreciate the opportunity to come

00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:27,680
talk to you and this is my twitter

00:13:25,579 --> 00:13:30,529
handle and the the threader handle for

00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,910
the helium cloud team you can follow us

00:13:30,529 --> 00:13:35,380
there to learn the latest and greatest

00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:37,639
of what we have to offer and I think

00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:38,990
with that I'm done I'll be out by the

00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:41,520
booth if you have any questions please

00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:45,180
come find me thank you

00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:48,470
[Applause]
