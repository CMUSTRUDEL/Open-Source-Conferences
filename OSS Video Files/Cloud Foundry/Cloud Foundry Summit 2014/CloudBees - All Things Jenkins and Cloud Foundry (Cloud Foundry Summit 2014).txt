Title: CloudBees - All Things Jenkins and Cloud Foundry (Cloud Foundry Summit 2014)
Publication date: 2014-07-25
Playlist: Cloud Foundry Summit 2014
Description: 
	Technical track breakout session presented by Harpreet Singh, Senior Director Product Management, CloudBees.

Jenkins is the engine that drives continuous integration and delivery of software. This talk will cover all things Cloud Foundry and Jenkins - from using BOSH to layout, Jenkins Enterprise by CloudBees to setting up Jenkins easily, delivering continuously from CloudBees DEV@cloud (Jenkins as a service) to Pivotal Cloud Foundry. Future plans for using BOSH with Jenkins Operations Center by CloudBees to help manage multiple Jenkins masters will also be touched upon.

I work from flower bees senior director

00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:16,260
product management there I have set up

00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:19,740
the Jenkins business there the talk is

00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:22,859
fairly simple we're going to talk about

00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:25,230
Jenkins why Jenkins is important I'm

00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:26,820
gonna talk about why cloudBees why

00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:29,070
cloudBees is important and I'll just

00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:33,170
talk about what cloudBees has done with

00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:37,530
the folks at cloud foundry for Jenkins

00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:40,710
so before I actually get into my talk I

00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:42,540
wanted to bring up this slide and I'm

00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:48,329
blatantly stealing it from the keynote

00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:52,949
of the Jenkins founder a Jenkins was

00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:55,350
fairly popular and it got so pop it is

00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:57,960
so popular that the the founder got

00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:01,920
started whirring what is his impact on

00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:06,020
global warming if any has he contributed

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:08,670
to global warming and he found out that

00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:11,670
so Jenkins also smashed her slave

00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:13,770
architecture so you have a master it

00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,479
coordinates with a set of slaves which

00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:18,450
tells them where to get the source from

00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:20,189
builds them blah blah blah and he found

00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,920
that there are about hundred eighty-two

00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:26,490
thousand slaves running at any moment

00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,920
doing a build or doing a deployment

00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:30,930
he started sort of this is the picture

00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,220
from the Google Data Center so this is

00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:34,770
the new Google Data Center and he

00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:36,960
figured that he could actually put all

00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:39,180
these machines in that data center it

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,939
turns out that you actually need maybe

00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,770
two or three data centers like these to

00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:47,040
hold the number of slaves or running

00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:48,600
jobs on Jenkins today so kind of going

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,610
back to the original question which was

00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:54,810
like did I have an impact on global

00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:57,090
warming to support those many machines

00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:58,710
you know the wind farm up at North Way

00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:00,509
if you're you know East Bay if you're

00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:03,270
driving over the hills you seen those

00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:07,500
you need one of that to actually power

00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:10,530
all these machines so I don't think he

00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,360
walked away fairly happy about what he

00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,780
did for global warming but he is fairly

00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:17,650
happy on how you know

00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:20,590
Jenkins adoption has played out right so

00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:22,720
as I said each of these Jenkins is set

00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:24,790
up as masters and number of slaves that

00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,680
slaves are doing you know any number of

00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:29,590
jobs on any number of platforms and

00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,660
these are actual life pings coming in

00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:33,670
from masters running all around the

00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:35,650
world right so every dot here is a

00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:37,630
master running somewhere I'm actually

00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:41,739
waiting for the day something comes up

00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:43,840
on Antarctica but but that's sort of you

00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:46,300
know all that's coming in and the key

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,530
the main interesting part to me if I

00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:52,989
look at this slide and the previous is

00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:55,600
all of these dots are coming from you

00:02:52,989 --> 00:02:57,820
know machines if they are behind a

00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:00,760
firewall or we count them in the

00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:03,160
community as one thing and we know that

00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:05,890
behind a firewall there's usually a ton

00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:09,100
of Jenkins running right so that's

00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:11,920
interesting when I look at the $182,000

00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:13,930
number III think of it and say think

00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,390
well you know if all of them are running

00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:18,310
commodity Hardware that's about thousand

00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:19,959
dollars each yes

00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:22,510
you know people have spent about close

00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:25,630
to 180 million dollars

00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:27,390
setting up slaves to run Jenkins that's

00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:30,640
that's phenomenal

00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:35,170
and who here is actually not familiar

00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:37,690
with Jenkins pretty good so you know as

00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:40,690
as the numbers indicate it's right up at

00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:44,890
the top of the most you know UCI server

00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:49,510
so this is something coming in from the

00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:51,310
the Jeroboam guys I have seen equally

00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:52,900
interesting numbers coming in from

00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:56,680
eclipse reports where they've actually

00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:59,500
asked people on you know what

00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:01,870
development tools they used and Jenkins

00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:05,410
is the only CI server that actually

00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:06,130
shows up on the list sort of at the same

00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:08,170
for us

00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:10,739
you know maven or ant kind of surprised

00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:15,040
that there's no ant here actually

00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:16,570
now all those dead red dots actually you

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,160
know there are about 78,000

00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:20,260
installations of Jenkins running

00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,880
everywhere one of my main problems with

00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,710
this slide is every few weeks that I

00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:26,289
present the slide I need to kind of go

00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:27,570
in and update the numbers so there are

00:04:26,289 --> 00:04:30,180
78,000 instantly

00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:33,300
Asians everywhere and we ran a survey a

00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:36,030
few two years back at the user

00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:39,030
conference and at the Jenkins user

00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:41,100
conference and we asked people if they

00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:43,380
were happy with Jenkins so close to 90%

00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:45,660
people responded that they're satisfied

00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:48,030
or very satisfied right that as a

00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:52,890
product is just you know just is a lot

00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:55,890
of things and you know I happen to work

00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:57,510
at Sun before cloudBees and I helped run

00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:59,610
GlassFish which is an open source

00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:01,080
project so one of the things when you

00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:04,560
are running an open source project is

00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:06,420
trying to get you know a user community

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,850
which is what Cloud Foundry is trying to

00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:12,510
do here and a community of developers

00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:14,220
who contribute back and you know Jenkins

00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:17,520
has this really flexible architecture

00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:20,370
where you can pretty much build any

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,620
plugin to plug in to any system so there

00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:24,750
are about 12% or 11 and a half percent

00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:28,020
people who have contributed a plugin

00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:30,300
back to Jenkins we've got to that point

00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:32,750
where when I used to do something

00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:35,970
similar back at Sun I would say like

00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:37,380
Jenkins has about hundred plugins today

00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:39,840
we have like one plug-in being

00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:41,880
contributed every two days and this does

00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,630
not count people who are using or

00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:47,190
building plug-ins behind firewalls right

00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:50,520
so no surprise when you you know it's

00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:52,800
it's the number one CI tool when you

00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,900
talk to people on why they are using in

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:58,080
how they are using it this is how it

00:05:54,900 --> 00:06:01,770
breaks down right so people primarily

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:04,440
start looking at CI they build stuff

00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:06,300
once they build it you know they plug in

00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:09,390
their testing part and they plug in the

00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:11,610
sonar part and and and they start sort

00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:14,160
of release automation and all that stuff

00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:16,800
happens with Jenkins right and again

00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,000
this is data two years back but this

00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,670
year you know if you look around

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,350
continuous delivery and deployment seems

00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:24,600
to be the hot topic of the day right

00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:26,670
everybody seems to be doing that if you

00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,500
look at the statistics about 50% of

00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:31,260
people who are using Jenkins for

00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:34,280
continuous deployment before I guess the

00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:36,120
topic became hot so I'm actually kind of

00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:39,120
interested in seeing what that number

00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:41,279
translates to this year

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:47,039
enough of Jenkins you know this about

00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:48,839
cloudBees we are sort of we closely

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:51,449
associated with the community I

00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:54,449
personally have set up a couple of

00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:57,930
product lines at cloudBees for Jenkins

00:06:54,449 --> 00:07:01,199
the enterprise Jenkins and operation

00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:04,740
center my claim to fame is I launched

00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:08,189
Hudson buckets son I've launched the you

00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:10,469
know the I helped set up the Jenkins

00:07:08,189 --> 00:07:12,210
user conference so we do all of this in

00:07:10,469 --> 00:07:15,059
conjunction with the community and

00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:16,589
working with the community their

00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:19,259
training and consulting that's set up

00:07:16,589 --> 00:07:22,469
around us to give training around

00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:26,460
Jenkins one of the key things for us is

00:07:22,469 --> 00:07:29,849
the the founder and creator of Jenkins

00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:32,999
kohsuke is the CTO at cloud B's so he

00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:35,189
looks at us are sort of you know he

00:07:32,999 --> 00:07:37,110
wears the community hat either the

00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:38,729
product hard and we are looking at sort

00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:46,649
of believing both in the community and

00:07:38,729 --> 00:07:50,159
both on the product so that said we have

00:07:46,649 --> 00:07:53,279
a few products that sort of build with

00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:55,469
Jenkins or on top of Jenkins so we have

00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:58,499
like two products product lines one is

00:07:55,469 --> 00:08:00,839
for the cloud and one is on premise so

00:07:58,499 --> 00:08:03,479
on the cloud what we do is we have what

00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:06,270
we call debit cloud which is Jenkins

00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:08,520
running as a service so what you need to

00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:11,249
do is you just go in sign up get

00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:13,469
yourself an account and a master is

00:08:11,249 --> 00:08:15,149
provision from for you slaves are

00:08:13,469 --> 00:08:17,580
automatically provisioned for you and

00:08:15,149 --> 00:08:20,569
you can deploy from there do any paths

00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:23,849
right it could be the cloudBees paths

00:08:20,569 --> 00:08:26,969
there is there is a blog that Peter

00:08:23,849 --> 00:08:29,759
wrote about how to use Jenkins and

00:08:26,969 --> 00:08:32,069
deploy two pivotal web services so you

00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:36,349
can just deploy for whatever artifacts

00:08:32,069 --> 00:08:38,669
are built from there onto that and then

00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:40,349
in this talk I will talk about the

00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:42,779
on-premise solutions because that's

00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:45,089
where sort of the Cloud Foundry world

00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:46,829
actually intersects so we have two

00:08:45,089 --> 00:08:50,240
products here one called the enterprise

00:08:46,829 --> 00:08:52,590
and one called the Operations Center and

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:56,940
what the enterprise

00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:59,790
a product actually does is given our

00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:01,950
sort of role in the community we sort of

00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:04,110
have delivered the product as plugins

00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:07,260
starts it on top of open source Jenkins

00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:09,120
so we come in and there are a few

00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:11,730
categories of plugins that we've sort of

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:15,240
built for and then we come in and

00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:18,540
provide support for Jenkins so if you

00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:21,150
took Jenkins to production in your you

00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:22,680
know environment it's likely that you're

00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:25,290
gonna need some of the plugins that

00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:28,320
we've built or you need support on some

00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:30,060
of the plug plugins in open source so

00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,160
where we come in is if you have a

00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:33,750
Jenkins we will come in and if there is

00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,940
a issue we'll come in and fix that issue

00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:39,330
that's classic I guess you know

00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:42,110
enterprise software we you know not only

00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:44,640
sort of fix our plugins but we'll fix

00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:47,070
issues with any of the community plugins

00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:51,480
out there right so that's what we

00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:53,340
provide more interestingly these plugins

00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:56,340
fall in these categories so if you're

00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:58,710
thinking of using Jenkins we've looked

00:09:56,340 --> 00:10:00,810
at Jenkins open source and we talked to

00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:02,610
a lot of people who run you know large

00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:05,280
installations of Jenkins to see what

00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:07,950
they need and we've divided these into

00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:11,430
multiple categories so there's high

00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:13,800
availability where a Jenkins master is

00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:16,080
waited upon by a backup master and if

00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,630
the primary goes down the backup comes

00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:20,160
in and starts taking over so they're

00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:23,630
essentially you know focused on

00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:26,430
eliminating downtime there there's

00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:28,490
something like backup scheduling there's

00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:31,710
folders and roles based access control

00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:34,770
which tends to be used a lot in big

00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:37,050
organizations where you want to separate

00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:39,810
teams by their own folders so you have a

00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:41,970
dev team your QA team they have their

00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:44,070
own folders and and you can set up

00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:45,480
security permissions on that instead of

00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:47,820
roles based access control permissions

00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:50,970
on that right you can host your own

00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:53,190
update center what these plugins

00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:58,020
actually end up sort of leading you

00:10:53,190 --> 00:11:01,140
towards is this world where you know

00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:02,670
you're picking up sort of this becomes

00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:05,340
your Swiss Army knife you're picking up

00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:06,300
a few plugins start you know address the

00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:09,870
problems that are

00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:13,200
Suffolk to your installations right so

00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:14,880
going sort of back into you know what

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,840
Jenkins does right so we've delivered

00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:21,630
these as plugins and as I mentioned the

00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:23,460
key beauty of Jenkins is this extensible

00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:26,460
plug-in architecture right we chose to

00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:29,400
deliver the product as plugins and if

00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:33,300
you kind of take that in in your sort of

00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:35,430
you know delivering your software or

00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:37,680
continuously delivering your software

00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:40,440
this plug-in architecture really works

00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:42,150
well right so at the center you have you

00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,470
know Jenkins running you could be

00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:46,170
running this one cloud wheeze or you

00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:47,700
could be running this by yourself you

00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:50,010
could be running up on the public cloud

00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:54,570
or your on-premise on private cloud

00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:57,600
there is a plug-in that actually talks

00:11:54,570 --> 00:12:00,840
to a specific tool that addresses that

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,520
part of the software factory right so on

00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:05,820
the left hand side you have you know

00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:07,760
simple CO and access git repositories or

00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:10,770
source you know subversion repositories

00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,780
push your changes in your binaries into

00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:14,610
Jey frog and this could be J frog

00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:17,040
running on premise or you know the

00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:19,920
artifactory that's sitting on line then

00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,660
you can sort of hand that off to the

00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,240
next stage in the pipeline where you're

00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:26,730
doing sort of you know performance test

00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:29,160
which is what red line 13 or blaze meter

00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:32,040
or so uh star do for you once you're

00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:33,870
done with that you can use any of the

00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:37,710
deployment tools like you know puppet

00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:40,470
chef or you know Bosh perhaps and you

00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:42,180
know to deploy or artifacts and you can

00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:46,260
deploy them to the public cloud as I

00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:48,090
mentioned or on-premise right so this

00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:50,550
plug-in architecture actually ends up

00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:53,310
making Jenkins the the sort of the the

00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:55,860
central hub around which your software

00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:57,960
development lifecycle operates right and

00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:02,790
that's why Jenkins is sort of so

00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:05,040
powerful I wanted to actually take take

00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:07,650
this concept and you know drill down

00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:11,100
into a more specific use case that we

00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:13,230
actually built with in the last few

00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:16,620
weeks and we delivered that into open

00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:18,240
source so I was in this talk of an hour

00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,500
earlier where they were talking about

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,720
cloud foundry

00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:24,570
DevOps and how this makes lives of

00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:26,390
DevOps easier so here's the specific use

00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:29,250
case start you know we did with Jenkins

00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:31,290
so whenever you do any build with

00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:33,950
Jenkins right you checked out source

00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:36,690
code and you generated certain artifacts

00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:39,630
Jenkins has the option of sort of

00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:41,400
fingerprinting not for you so what that

00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:43,230
translates to so let's say you're

00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:45,900
building a Java maven job

00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:48,630
it automatically fingerprint start for

00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:52,140
you and it fingerprinting means you know

00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:54,750
you're taking an md5 hash sum and if

00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:58,020
that artifact is used anywhere else

00:13:54,750 --> 00:14:00,270
within Jenkins right you can look at the

00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:02,130
artifact signature and say like well

00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:04,860
this artifact was produced by build

00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:06,480
so-and-so and so-and-so and it's got

00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:08,760
passed through these you know jobs

00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,980
pipeline and you can kind of come down

00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:14,250
and drill into things if things are

00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:16,500
going bad but what was missing was if

00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:18,900
you took the same artifacts and here's

00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,970
the ops team takes the artifacts pulls

00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:23,940
it out uses puppet or chef and deploys

00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:27,240
to a web server or an app server and

00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:30,330
something goes wrong when that something

00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:32,490
goes wrong there was you know usually

00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:35,150
there's a manual sort of you know dig

00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:37,830
down and find out what's happening so

00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:39,900
what we've done with the plug-in

00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:43,590
architecture here is we work with the

00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:47,670
Pub puppet and chef guys to sort of give

00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:49,440
a notification back to Jenkins and you

00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:51,240
know tell us the files that they have

00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,000
you know pushed on and we will

00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,950
automatically create an md5 checksum so

00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,250
what that ends up doing is if the ops

00:14:55,950 --> 00:15:02,010
person now deploys this a plugin kicks

00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:05,340
in tells you tells Jenkins that it

00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:07,320
deployed these these binaries and now on

00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:10,980
your you know on your Jenkins screen you

00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:12,770
can actually see where did you know the

00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:16,080
artifacts that were produced by this

00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:18,210
actually land out right so that's sort

00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:20,340
of the so when you're trying to debug

00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:22,530
stuff you can actually kind of say like

00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:24,930
these warr actually made it to

00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:28,470
deployment server production server X

00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:30,750
and staging server Y so that's the sort

00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:32,100
of stuff that you can start doing with

00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:35,470
Jenkins

00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:37,630
now obviously when when this happens I'm

00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:39,970
getting into the specifics of what we've

00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:43,810
done here with Cloud Foundry is when

00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:46,360
this happens right what we see is one

00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:48,880
team brings it in they find that hey

00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:50,710
this was pretty useful I could detect

00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,840
everything here let's take the previous

00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:54,220
example right I could completely if

00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:57,520
determine what's happening in my

00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:59,260
deployment pipeline other teams who are

00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:02,200
trying to go agile or trying to deliver

00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:05,770
continuously start picking on this and

00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:07,480
it's sort of when I get called into

00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:10,540
customer conversations this is the world

00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:11,980
that they are living in every team found

00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:14,200
that they could do something fantastic

00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:15,700
they could deliver stuff and they have

00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:19,390
their own masters they have their own

00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:22,420
slaves set up and you know the IT

00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:25,000
organization and the CIO comes in and

00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:27,430
says like well why can't we consolidate

00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,650
here so what typically happens in this

00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:31,690
environment is we come in and we have a

00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:34,480
product called the Operations Center by

00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:36,700
cloudBees and what this does is it looks

00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,230
at all these Jenkins masters and it

00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:40,120
consolidates all of them so you can

00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:43,180
connect these masters to an operation

00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:45,940
center and you can consolidate all the

00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:47,890
slaves to a shared cloud that you will

00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:49,960
end up using right and you can

00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:52,990
optionally give some of the clouds and

00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:54,520
some of these slaves to the masters and

00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:56,860
say like these are your dedicated

00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:59,080
masters but the whole idea is you get

00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:01,450
this sort of architecture where you can

00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:04,180
now start scaling Jenkins horizontally

00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:06,220
right so you're no longer sort of taking

00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:10,440
one Jenkins instance and trying to grow

00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:13,830
it and scale it now what that means in

00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:16,390
four organizations trying to go agile is

00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:19,180
when you're trying to onboard new teams

00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:21,640
you get into these patterns and the

00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:24,010
pattern is like hey I I need this team

00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:26,650
to go you know to deliver continuously

00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:28,330
well sure enough pick a master connect

00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:30,430
that to the operation center the

00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:32,290
Operations Center takes care of security

00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:34,300
and it takes care of plug-in version

00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:37,420
compliance it takes care of you know

00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:39,490
sharing slaves etc etc all you need to

00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:41,710
do is connect the master user templates

00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:44,680
that were created as part of your job

00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:46,900
and soon enough you're down

00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:49,840
dream teams can start getting you know

00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:51,910
rapidly on border right so that's the

00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:55,750
sort of the world where we kind of

00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:58,840
brings sort of some sort of I would like

00:17:55,750 --> 00:18:01,690
to say order to the chaos but that's

00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:04,780
that's what ends up happening so these

00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:08,440
are sort of the tools that we build on

00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:10,180
top of Jenkins right and when then we

00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:12,760
started talking to the cloud foundry

00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:16,570
guys here they were obviously interested

00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:21,370
in what we are doing and we ended up

00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:24,730
being sort of the the first partners to

00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:30,130
deliver into the you know pivotal ops

00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:33,970
manager and what you get here is is is

00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:37,030
Jenkins Enterprise so the idea is that

00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:40,210
if you are sort of using you know Bosch

00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:42,520
to lay out services on your you know

00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:44,860
path internally you obviously need

00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:47,320
something that's you know built for

00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:49,120
production use and and hence sort of

00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,770
using Jenkins Enterprise so you get all

00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,710
the plugins that are installed for you

00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:55,630
this is installed by the you know you

00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:57,850
know the cloud foundry Bosh pivotal one

00:18:55,630 --> 00:19:01,270
manager and it includes support from

00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:04,510
cloudBees right now what that ends up

00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:06,810
doing and um this this solution is I

00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:09,460
think right now we are beta testing it

00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:12,490
we should be releasing this in the next

00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:14,380
four weeks or so if I'm right but what

00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:16,780
ends up happening in this environment is

00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:20,280
you push sort of you know on Cloud

00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:23,830
Foundry you say I need a a Jenkins

00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:25,690
installed for me the configuration

00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:28,840
screen asks you information like what's

00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:32,740
the disk size for the for the Jenkins

00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:34,810
what's the Java heap memory allocation

00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:38,080
that it needs to do and it kind of goes

00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:40,180
in and lays out their Jenkins for you at

00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,160
that point you can sort of register for

00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:44,260
club at flour B's get your keys and

00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:47,770
start using Jenkins as you would

00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:50,020
normally do and from here on you can you

00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:54,370
know use any of the standard Jenkins

00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:56,669
plugins to to deliver software you know

00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:58,529
that's provisioned on on cloud

00:19:56,669 --> 00:20:00,659
boundary right you could use the cloud

00:19:58,529 --> 00:20:02,999
cloudBees you know deploy your plugin or

00:20:00,659 --> 00:20:07,529
you're just doing a straight-up deploy

00:20:02,999 --> 00:20:11,249
using CF push so that's that's where we

00:20:07,529 --> 00:20:13,350
are today I think this is step one in a

00:20:11,249 --> 00:20:16,859
many step process but you can clearly

00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:18,720
see this is just you know getting you

00:20:16,859 --> 00:20:21,269
part of the way they are right you laid

00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,710
out Jenkins Enterprise but you the whole

00:20:21,269 --> 00:20:24,539
idea with Jenkins says you need a

00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:27,029
multiple number of slaves that need to

00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:30,480
be connected so today we don't address

00:20:27,029 --> 00:20:33,450
that so the next obvious step for us is

00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,399
to ask you the number of slaves that you

00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:37,710
want to lay out what kind of slaves are

00:20:35,399 --> 00:20:40,049
these and then lay them out and connect

00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:41,909
them back to your Jenkins instance so

00:20:40,049 --> 00:20:44,669
that's something that would be upcoming

00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:48,509
in your in our roadmap and then you know

00:20:44,669 --> 00:20:50,940
you're taking this this world much

00:20:48,509 --> 00:20:55,139
farther ahead what we would like to do

00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:58,350
is get to this world where if you are

00:20:55,139 --> 00:21:01,289
running our foundry you're likely to be

00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:03,059
a user who's going back to that use case

00:21:01,289 --> 00:21:05,009
that's why I spend out that much time on

00:21:03,059 --> 00:21:06,659
the use case where you're onboarding

00:21:05,009 --> 00:21:09,570
teams and those teams need their own

00:21:06,659 --> 00:21:13,019
jenkins and you want those teams to be

00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:14,970
set up but there is an IT admins ID

00:21:13,019 --> 00:21:17,850
admin team that's managing all of this

00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:19,710
and that means access to j OC so we

00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:23,429
would we would like to sort of get to

00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:25,950
the point where you're taking abortion

00:21:23,429 --> 00:21:27,960
deploying operation center and deploying

00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:30,149
individual jenkins instances and

00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:33,840
connecting that back to the operation

00:21:30,149 --> 00:21:34,409
center and you're you know sort of good

00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:40,499
to go

00:21:34,409 --> 00:21:42,659
from that point on so that sort of

00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:45,720
brings me to sort of where we are where

00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:48,720
we want to head towards and brings me to

00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:50,820
sort of the end of my presentation if

00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,859
you want to try out what jenkins

00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:57,200
enterprise or operation center does for

00:21:52,859 --> 00:22:00,119
you you can download a free trial today

00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,409
and hopefully in in a few weeks you

00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:04,919
should be able to just drive this

00:22:01,409 --> 00:22:05,940
through the pivotal one manager that

00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:08,350
comes with your Cloud Foundry

00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:11,289
installation

00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:13,650
all right thank you very much any

00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:18,600
questions I can take them

00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:21,890
[Applause]

00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,890
