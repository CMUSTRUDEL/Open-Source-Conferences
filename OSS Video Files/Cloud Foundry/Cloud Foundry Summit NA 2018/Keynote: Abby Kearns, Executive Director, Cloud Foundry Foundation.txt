00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:21,150
so excited to be here with each and

couple of days planned for you but first

00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:35,130
I want to start off with a little bit

00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:39,899
about what we're doing

many of you had to go through great

00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:50,969
logistical challenges to get here with

00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:54,420
Airport closures a small fire on

00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:55,860
Southwest Airlines but I appreciate it

00:00:54,420 --> 00:01:01,530

00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,040
the Boston Marathon for those of you

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:13,080
that came and ran it on Monday awesome

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:16,619
job lon came and ran it but we also

00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:19,650
decided that we would make our theme of

00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:22,350
this running at scale a lot has changed

00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:22,860
in the last several years for Cloud

00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:25,740
Foundry

00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,900
we've been an open source project for a

00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:31,170
little over three years and we've seen

00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:33,659
our users half of which you hear our

00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,070
users really grow and scale and we

00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:35,670
thought okay well we got a running thing

00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,950
going

00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:40,920
we've got scale going our themes gonna

00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:42,720
be running at scale and so we're gonna

00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,159
talk a lot about that this morning and

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,130
throughout the week about what that

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:55,140
looks like to run Cloud Foundry but run

00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:58,320
software at scale but first I want to

00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:00,479
take you on a little journey have you

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:05,290
ever made a choice that changed your

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:13,120
life went on a trip

00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:17,220
that opened your mind maybe he took a

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,220
new job that launched your career

00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:26,500
recently I made a life-changing choice

00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:29,650
I changed banks okay maybe that wasn't

00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:31,420
life changing but I really hate to go to

00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,830
the bank I hate it

00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:38,760
I hate to deal with it I hate the

00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:41,320
process so I switched to a new bank I

00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,670
moved to a new bank that was digitally

00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:47,920
native day one

00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:51,820
and for me it was easy simple it's a

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:54,310
clean experience but for traditional

00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:56,850
banks banks that have brick-and-mortar

00:02:54,310 --> 00:03:00,550
and that have been around a while

00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:01,870
customers like me scare you because I'm

00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:06,100
indicative of an industry that is

00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:08,709
changing and changing quickly and this

00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:11,910
isn't just happening to financial

00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:16,540
services it's happening across the board

00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:21,580
automotive retail health care every

00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:24,580
single industry is being upended in fact

00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:26,860
we're hearing a lot about cloud we've

00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:29,110
got retail in the cloud banks are in the

00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:33,820
cloud hell even pizza delivery is now in

00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:38,950
the cloud and that's changing the way we

00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:42,100
think about everything so for many of

00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:44,010
you your colleague a there a lot of

00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:47,920
solutions different vendors different

00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:49,690
technologies and you're trying to figure

00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,780
out how does this all fit together and

00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:54,519
it's madness where do you start where do

00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:58,260
you end how do you keep control and how

00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:58,260
do you get keep from getting locked in

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:06,760
the technologists world has gotten

00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:10,540
really big the job each and every one of

00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:14,019
you has has gotten really big if you're

00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:17,169
a CIO you're having to focus on shaping

00:04:14,019 --> 00:04:17,489
the future of your company but also how

00:04:17,169 --> 00:04:19,620
do

00:04:17,489 --> 00:04:24,599
turn what I'm doing into a revenue

00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:27,150
generator no longer a cost center if I'm

00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:29,400
an operator you're worried about

00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:31,319
architecting the future of your company

00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,800
what's the platform this runs on how do

00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:37,979
I do that how do I make that scale and

00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,360
if you're a developer you're creating

00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:41,270
the future of your company you're

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,949
developing the apps that are changing

00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:45,900
how your company works how you engage

00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:52,710
with your customers you were the

00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:54,690
frontline of where it's going on but

00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:58,110
imagine what we could do if we all work

00:04:54,690 --> 00:05:00,389
together I've talked a lot about open

00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:02,520
source in the power last year I spent a

00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:03,990
lot of time talking about the power open

00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:08,789
source said by bringing together diverse

00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:11,039
minds and diverse organizations and

00:05:08,789 --> 00:05:13,440
that's what Cloud Foundry does is it

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:16,740
brings together a lot of different

00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:21,389
perspectives unites that technology and

00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:23,940
makes it easier for you with over half

00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:26,909
the Fortune 500 already running on Cloud

00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:31,409
Foundry it's the choice many of you are

00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:35,240
making particularly many of you here to

00:05:31,409 --> 00:05:35,240
shape the future of your company

00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:44,460
so what does the foundation do I know

00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:46,500
many of you you're not really familiar

00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:50,520
with open source foundations what do we

00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:52,020
do what is our responsibility our vision

00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:57,090
is to make sure that each and every one

00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:59,190
of you their members our users are able

00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:02,330
to successfully shape the future of your

00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:04,830
company whether you're a provider or

00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:07,110
leveraging Cloud Foundry to change your

00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:12,690
company how do we make each and every

00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:17,280
one of you successful so a Cloud Foundry

00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:19,110
summit last year in Santa Clara I asked

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,020
each and every one of you to imagine the

00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:24,620
possibilities imagine what you could do

00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,620
with Cloud Foundry

00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:35,370
but you don't have to imagine anymore

00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:38,760
it's here and it's at scale we recently

00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:42,300
completed a user survey our second which

00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:44,430
is now a biannual event thank each and

00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:46,080
every one of you for responding and for

00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:52,230
those of you that didn't there's always

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:58,710
next time what we found over 60% of the

00:06:52,230 --> 00:07:00,150
users are large enterprises but was also

00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:03,260
great is that if you were a cloud

00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:06,000
foundry user you loved it

00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:08,960
although 18% of you we're gonna have to

00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,960
have a conversation later

00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:18,030
but you love using cloud foundry what we

00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:20,100
also found is that if you're using cloud

00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:27,590
foundry you're also saving time and

00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:32,400
money it's making you more effective and

00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:34,710
you're also doing more with it more of

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:38,040
you now have over 50 developers running

00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:39,510
working on the platform and your number

00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,580
of apps and workloads that you're

00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:44,460
running on the platform are continuing

00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:47,130
to grow and so that really speaks at the

00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:49,320
scale many of you are starting to run to

00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:51,120
and that's what makes this particular

00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,550
cloud foundry summit a great opportunity

00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:58,930
to learn

00:07:52,550 --> 00:08:01,730
about that what was also great is to see

00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:06,350
but nearly everyone that responded to

00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:09,380
this survey care about flexibility every

00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:13,300
single one and nearly half of you are

00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:13,300
already running across multiple clouds

00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:19,430
so what we've learned from this survey

00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:21,170
is that you care about flexibility you

00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:25,000
care about portability of your workloads

00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:27,350
and you're able to save time and money

00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
and so as we think about that and we

00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:31,130
think about where we're going to go

00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:36,140
those continue will be focused for us

00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:37,430
for the rest of this year and so I'm

00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:39,980
going to highlight a couple of user

00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:41,630
stories that really resonated with me as

00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:43,460
we looked at the data from this user

00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:48,410
survey and what it really meant for the

00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:51,530
future of Cloud Foundry for a company

00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:55,940
like Volkswagen the automotive industry

00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:58,010
is changing and changing quickly a car

00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:02,060
is no longer something that gets you

00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:07,760
from point A to point B it's now a

00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:10,100
mobile device it's it's more than it's

00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,350
pulling all of this data together it's

00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,880
giving you a different experience but

00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:16,460
it's changing the way you engage and

00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:19,100
think about your car and if you're a

00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:20,450
company like Volkswagen you have to

00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:24,020
become a software company now they

00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:25,730
compete and if you're gonna become a

00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:30,320
software company you have to do that

00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:32,840
across 12 different brands so how do you

00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,540
do that how do you build out a software

00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:37,460
development team and make that scalable

00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:40,510
and make that consistent across every

00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:40,510
single one of your brand

00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:46,940
well they look to cloud foundry

00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:50,450
they look to cloud foundry to give them

00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:54,110
that flexibility in the last two years

00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:56,150
they've scaled up to 150 developers they

00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:58,130
were able to start iterating and doing

00:09:56,150 --> 00:10:02,000
rapid application development and

00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:05,390
deployment and most importantly they can

00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,840
do that across multiple clouds because

00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:08,060
they need

00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:10,310
flexibility and they needed that ability

00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:17,180
to run it across multiple public clouds

00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:20,210
in multiple regions you may have noticed

00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:21,590
this week we have a new truck for the

00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:24,380
first time ever we have a government

00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:26,030
track because we have so many

00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:28,280
governments around the world that are

00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:32,960
using Cloud Foundry that change their

00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:35,060
business in their organization and for

00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:37,570
the militaries particularly the United

00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:40,580
States Air Force

00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:42,380
they were aggregating a lot of data they

00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:46,490
were pulling that data together and

00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:49,610
trying to build a coherent solution yeah

00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:51,980
they have a massive budget but 70% of

00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:54,860
that budget was going towards just

00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:57,100
keeping the lights on maintaining the

00:10:54,860 --> 00:11:01,700
existing infrastructure they had today

00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:03,500
only 30% was going to new development so

00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:06,230
application development process was slow

00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:10,520
and by the time applications got out the

00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:15,860
door they were often obsolete so how do

00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:18,380
you compete with that the Air Force

00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:21,530
leveraged Cloud Foundry and started

00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:24,790
building in agile processes and taken

00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:27,320
advantage of that transformation journey

00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:32,120
for them they started moving more of

00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:34,100
their workloads to the cloud and they

00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:38,150
were able to flip that allocation of

00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:41,690
their funding so that now 70% goes to

00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:44,800
new application development oh and it

00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:44,800
saved him six hundred million dollars

00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:55,030
[Applause]

00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,710
other for those of you that hung around

00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:59,560
me along I like to talk about Home Depot

00:11:56,710 --> 00:12:02,530
a lot so I wanted to talk a little about

00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:04,960
over here cuz everybody knows who Home

00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:09,190
Depot is how many people have shopped at

00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:10,270
a Home Depot right and how many of you

00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:12,730
the first thing you think about when you

00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:17,680
think about Home Depot is wow they got

00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:19,300
an amazing cloud native experience Home

00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:26,410
Depot is literally a brick and mortar

00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:29,680
selling brick and mortar and but their

00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:32,230
retail too and so now they're having to

00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:35,320
compete against the likes of Amazon to

00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:37,540
sell hammers and if you're a company

00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:39,550
like Home Depot how do you compete with

00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:41,260
that you're competing with a growing

00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,910
cloud company you're completing in an

00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:45,910
industry that is being completely

00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:47,290
upended and oh by the way you need to

00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:50,740
build out a software development team

00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:55,150
and you know you also competing against

00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:58,320
talent how do you do that for a company

00:12:55,150 --> 00:13:00,460
like Home Depot they use cloud foundry

00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,820
in the last couple of years they've

00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:04,750
actually scaled out their team actually

00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:07,690
closer to three years at this point

00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:11,590
they're at 2,500 developers that are

00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:13,740
writing code on the platform 3,000

00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:16,000
applications in production and growing

00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:19,720
billions of transactions across that

00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,180
platform every single month and they

00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:26,670
were able to shave their deployment time

00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:28,630
from every six weeks to every 15 minutes

00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:30,880
yeah that's right Home Depot is

00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:36,280
deploying code into production every

00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:38,020
single day and for them it's changing

00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:39,760
the way they engage with their customers

00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:45,970
and bringing that experience to where

00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:49,240
they are so we've looked at the

00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:52,360
automotive industry we've looked at the

00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:54,310
retail industry and the military just a

00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:57,610
few of the industries that are being

00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:59,950
transformed now but we're also looking

00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:01,870
at the choices they've made and how

00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:03,230
they've really enabled them to compete

00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:08,030
in a quickly

00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:10,850
changing market so as we think about

00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:12,950
Cloud Foundry and we think about what it

00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:14,960
actually does in fact we actually had

00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:15,440
this conversation yesterday at the board

00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:18,290
meeting

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:21,710
what is Cloud Foundry in a nutshell it's

00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:24,620
the best platform for developers the

00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:28,430
best how do you keep that up

00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:32,740
what are you focused on you're focusing

00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:38,450
on what if platform can provide velocity

00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:40,280
interoperability and innovation velocity

00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:45,530
speed to market how fast can you get

00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:46,970
that idea out the door innovation the

00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:48,920
ability to iterate on those ideas

00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:50,570
continuous delivery pipe lines taking

00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:52,790
that feedback and getting it back and

00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:56,500
iterating those applications getting

00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:59,480
that back out the door an

00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:02,390
interoperability the connective tissue

00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:04,340
to other technologies other communities

00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:06,590
other projects and how that makes Cloud

00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:09,260
Foundry not only be the best platform

00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:17,510
today but also be the best platform in

00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:19,400
the future so this year in 2018 at the

00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:24,260
foundation we're really focusing on two

00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:29,510
things strengthening our ecosystem and

00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:33,260
cultivating our community and we have an

00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:36,230
amazing community all of you here today

00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:38,360
you're our community we've had an

00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:41,750
amazing amount of velocity in the

00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:47,930
project over the last year but there's

00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:52,730
room to grow we've seen a tremendous

00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:54,590
growth in membership in fact forty

00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:56,890
percent of our members though which

00:15:54,590 --> 00:16:00,530
makes us so different our end users and

00:15:56,890 --> 00:16:02,210
users like yourself are members of the

00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:04,550
foundation you're not only using open

00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:06,110
source to change your company but you're

00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:08,260
participating in the open source

00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:08,260
community

00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:17,540
so what's next as we think about

00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,009
community we've we've you know we've

00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:20,570
been growing this community and building

00:16:19,009 --> 00:16:22,759
and each and every one of you been part

00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:24,910
of that but for us how do we give more

00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:28,610
focus to that and how do we do better

00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:30,800
well last year we hired sworn a paddy at

00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:33,100
a lead community for us and if you see

00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:38,720
her you should say hi

00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:41,209
she's around and she's gonna really help

00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,560
us focus on curating the interaction and

00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:44,240
engagement with each and every one of

00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,980
you bringing me that's to where you are

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:50,720
and bringing those conversations

00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:52,279
together we're also expanding globally

00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,589
you're gonna hear me talk a lot this

00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:57,980
year about China the Korea and Europe

00:16:54,589 --> 00:16:59,149
because Cloud Foundry is growing we're

00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:02,180
going to make sure that we continue to

00:16:59,149 --> 00:17:04,250
build the communities around that and

00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:06,890
then finally we're gonna continue to

00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:09,020
encourage contributions I'm going to ask

00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:11,929
more of each and every one of you to

00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:18,919
participate give back and bring your

00:17:11,929 --> 00:17:22,970
ideas to the table an ecosystem is a big

00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:26,329
focus for me as well this year on the

00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:30,020
stage its summit in Basel we launched

00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:32,659
the foundry an online marketplace of

00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:36,110
services for our end users to find and

00:17:32,659 --> 00:17:39,260
get help last year we launched it with

00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:41,450
600 services in October today I'm

00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:45,520
thrilled to say that we're at 4900

00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:45,520
services in the cloud foundry ecosystem

00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:55,679
and it's growing this represents the

00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:57,120
breath of Cloud Foundry so we talk about

00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,799
what do we want with cloud founder we

00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,420
want it to be around for a long time I

00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:03,059
wanted to continue to grow and thrive

00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:09,390
and so how do we do that we reflect that

00:18:03,059 --> 00:18:10,860
through community and the ecosystem and

00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:15,900
we're gonna continue to grow those

00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:18,480
capabilities through new CP is new

00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:24,299
service brokers on different

00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:25,740
integrations and so I'm going to spend a

00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:28,530
lot of time this year also talking about

00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:31,500
interoperability and what does

00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:33,450
interoperability mean it means making

00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:35,669
sure that we are building bridges to

00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:38,549
other projects other technologies and

00:18:35,669 --> 00:18:42,360
other communities so that as these

00:18:38,549 --> 00:18:43,950
technologies grow and mature we're going

00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,900
to bring those up and expose those to

00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:49,559
you the enterprise users and you the

00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:53,070
enterprise providers last year that took

00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:56,010
the form of C and I and OCI the open

00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:59,460
container initiative this year it's

00:18:56,010 --> 00:19:03,510
kubernetes it's geo envoy and many

00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:04,890
others we're going to continue to do

00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:07,140
that because it's important that Cloud

00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:09,990
Foundry as a technology continues to

00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:11,490
grow but I'm also going to ask that each

00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:13,169
and every one of you continue to bring

00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:15,240
those ideas to the table and say what

00:19:13,169 --> 00:19:17,220
else should we be doing what else does

00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:23,130
this need to look like to meet your

00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:26,490
needs and we have a little few

00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:28,740
announcements today first when I'd like

00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:31,799
to bring up on stage to announce the

00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:35,809
first is that Alibaba cloud is now a

00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:35,809
gold member of Cloud Foundry foundation

00:19:39,099 --> 00:19:43,099
and I'd like to bring up Hong choying

00:19:41,419 --> 00:19:48,830
director of business of development to

00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:50,899
talk about that thank you hey Abby nice

00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:52,070

like we're so thrilled to have Alibaba

00:19:53,929 --> 00:19:57,799
cloud is a member of the foundation I

00:19:56,389 --> 00:20:00,440
can tell you a little bit what that

00:19:57,799 --> 00:20:04,909
means for Alibaba cloud happy to and

00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:07,190
hello Boston how many of you heard of

00:20:04,909 --> 00:20:08,869
Alibaba cloud based on your clap all

00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:11,779
right that's awesome

00:20:08,869 --> 00:20:14,570
well we're super excited to be part of

00:20:11,779 --> 00:20:17,690
the family the answer you question me at

00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:19,940
Alibaba cloud we're proud of providing

00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:22,369
the best technology platform solutions

00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:27,169
to our customers in which for them to

00:20:22,369 --> 00:20:29,479
run their business and know today we are

00:20:27,169 --> 00:20:31,970
the leading public cloud infrastructure

00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:34,940
providing in China and among the top

00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:39,229
three globally so I guess the secret's

00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:40,999
out now right I had exam and with with

00:20:39,229 --> 00:20:43,279
our membership with the cloud foundry I

00:20:40,999 --> 00:20:46,700
mean given that this is cloud foundry is

00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:49,820
the first know open source path offering

00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:51,830
it's designed for multi cloud multi

00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:53,960
framework and multi languages and in

00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:56,659
essence this aligns really really well

00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:59,389
well what Alibaba clouds are doing

00:20:56,659 --> 00:21:01,639
because it's all about giving customer

00:20:59,389 --> 00:21:05,840
choice we want customers to operate

00:21:01,639 --> 00:21:08,239
anywhere in the world and it just from a

00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,590
developer perspective and I guess all

00:21:08,239 --> 00:21:13,340
the audience here are developers right

00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:15,710
it so nice mix my nice mix as a public

00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:17,450
cloud platform vendors we love out of

00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:20,299
all of us we love our partner ecosystem

00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:22,489
you represent those developers who are

00:21:20,299 --> 00:21:25,489
building enriching solutions for your

00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:27,859
customers and as a cloud vendor we

00:21:25,489 --> 00:21:30,649
encourage you to join our journey in

00:21:27,859 --> 00:21:32,779
this process and go the light to

00:21:30,649 --> 00:21:34,129
customers together now one of the stats

00:21:32,779 --> 00:21:37,399
you mentioned earlier today that I

00:21:34,129 --> 00:21:38,929
wanted to remind you is we saw a few

00:21:37,399 --> 00:21:42,320
hands go up that new Alibaba cloud but

00:21:38,929 --> 00:21:46,220
not all how many regions is Alibaba

00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:49,039
cloud in today I would bet if I if you

00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:51,400
had to guess well let me just put it

00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:55,480
this way 43

00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:58,390
forty-three global availability zone so

00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:00,010
we're serious anything that we do we

00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:04,120
want to make sure that we do it well and

00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:06,880
we have and based on demand we are

00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:09,340
continually assessing where else to grow

00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:11,770
well that was important I wanted to flag

00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:14,320
the the breadth of Alibaba cloud and the

00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:16,900
availability because we also wanted to

00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,490
announce that the Alibaba cloud CPI is

00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,240
now available and it's been merged into

00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:21,160
the upstream

00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:23,440
yeah and we're super excited with that

00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:25,960
because what that means is that now our

00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:28,300
partners and our developers we just made

00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:30,190
it easy for you to interoperate and run

00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:32,320
on Alibaba cloud that's right

00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:34,000
yeah we're so thrilled to have Alibaba

00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,410
cloud as a member and are looking

00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,420
forward to doing a lot more with you

00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:46,240
well pleasure and thank you come join

00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:49,510
the journey so we're continuing to grow

00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,950
in membership and capability and I

00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:55,690
wanted to bring up a couple of other

00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:58,000
announcements next we have Don Booya the

00:22:55,690 --> 00:23:00,590
GM of cloud developer services for IBM

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:07,340
to talk about their new offerings

00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:09,679
I do thank you for joining us in Boston

00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:12,799
and the Sun came out and it's been a

00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:14,240
great week yes it has it's a good to see

00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:16,700
that it's not raining anymore

00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,950
it's not raining anymore so tell me

00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:20,570
about this new offering iBM has yeah so

00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:23,419
so as you know Abbey we're really

00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:25,700
looking at enterprise customers when we

00:23:23,419 --> 00:23:26,960
design our cloud and and based on the

00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:29,090
feedback from them we've heard

00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,669
consistently that in order for them to

00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:33,529
adopt public cloud in particular need to

00:23:31,669 --> 00:23:35,390
have a few things they need to be able

00:23:33,529 --> 00:23:37,820
to control placement of the workload

00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:39,500
which geography it's in most of the time

00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:42,200
that's due to regulatory type of

00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:44,419
concerns in-country concerns they need

00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,710
isolation and then they need to make

00:23:44,419 --> 00:23:47,720
sure that they can you know offer

00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:50,570
dedicated environments for them not just

00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:52,429
shared only so as a result of that

00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:54,140
that's really a design point we use for

00:23:52,429 --> 00:23:55,970
our container service on the IBM cloud

00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:58,880
which is based on kubernetes and has

00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:59,870
those attributes associated with it as a

00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,399
result of that we've had a lot of

00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:03,260
success we've got a lot of feedback from

00:24:01,399 --> 00:24:04,909
that and what we're announcing today is

00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:07,580
that we're actually able to now deploy

00:24:04,909 --> 00:24:10,730
Cloud Foundry on top of that container

00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:12,230
based infrastructure and so that is what

00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:13,250
we're announcing today and that gives us

00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:15,649
the ability to place Cloud Foundry

00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:17,720
workloads in any of our data centers in

00:24:15,649 --> 00:24:19,820
regions and ultimately allows us to give

00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:21,049
the isolation and the dedicated

00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:23,870
environments that people are looking for

00:24:21,049 --> 00:24:25,700
with a very cloud life model that is so

00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:27,320
awesome I'm really excited to see that

00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:30,409
momentum and I know that your customers

00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:32,390
are as well absolutely I have a demo if

00:24:30,409 --> 00:24:33,950
you would like me to show it to you I

00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:36,590
would love to see this I've been waiting

00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:38,510
all day to simmer well hopefully we

00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:42,080
won't tempt the demo gods too much here

00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:45,740
so okay let me ask let me quickly go

00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:48,559
through this for folks we can switch

00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:50,919
okay so this is this is our IBM cloud

00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:53,480
environment because this is still just

00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:56,179
announced an alpha it's in the

00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:58,279
experimental Services section so that's

00:24:56,179 --> 00:24:59,929
what you see at the top here and is if

00:24:58,279 --> 00:25:01,730
we scroll down through that you'll see

00:24:59,929 --> 00:25:03,919
that one of the choices here now is a

00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:06,799
cloud from the enterprise environment if

00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:09,169
I were to click on that and the Wi-Fi is

00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:11,990
working which it is then you'll see that

00:25:09,169 --> 00:25:14,919
I get an opportunity to to name my Cloud

00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:14,919
Foundry environment and

00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:20,109
and in this case the pricing plan is

00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:22,029
still free because it's experimental

00:25:20,109 --> 00:25:25,749
that will obviously not be the case

00:25:22,029 --> 00:25:29,049
forever sure that could be an

00:25:25,749 --> 00:25:30,580
interesting feature and then once I go

00:25:29,049 --> 00:25:32,950
to a configuration here you'll see that

00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:35,200
I get a few things that I can do and

00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:36,999
this will obviously expand right now we

00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,979
have this set up to a couple of our

00:25:36,999 --> 00:25:40,600
nodes in Dallas this will explain expand

00:25:38,979 --> 00:25:43,330
out into the data centers that we have

00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:44,799
available in in the IBM cloud so you'll

00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:46,690
be able to target where you place it and

00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:48,460
where that workload goes from a hardware

00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:51,460
perspective you'll be able to decide on

00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:53,080
shared versus dedicated and then you can

00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:55,059
see the CF version here as well as

00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:57,669
different machine types and kind of a

00:25:55,059 --> 00:25:59,080
t-shirt size sort of model but if I go

00:25:57,669 --> 00:26:00,429
down to the infrastructure you'll see

00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:02,799
that where you'd normally see

00:26:00,429 --> 00:26:05,139
maybe VMs as an infrastructure now you

00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:06,609
get to name your kubernetes cluster in

00:26:05,139 --> 00:26:08,919
this particular case and where you're

00:26:06,609 --> 00:26:10,450
going to target Cloud Foundry to to be

00:26:08,919 --> 00:26:13,090
deployed you see some other network

00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:14,830
configurations now at this point I would

00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:16,029
normally hit create and in a few minutes

00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:17,470
what you'll see is all that

00:26:16,029 --> 00:26:18,940
infrastructure deployed and Cloud

00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:20,440
Foundry deployed on top of it you get a

00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:22,330
running Cloud Foundry instance at the

00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:23,710
other side of that I'm not going to do

00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:25,539
that because that would absolutely tempt

00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:27,970
the demo gods and it takes a few minutes

00:26:25,539 --> 00:26:31,269
so I'm gonna go instead to you know kind

00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:33,460
of the chef's kitchen on TV version

00:26:31,269 --> 00:26:35,499
where we go right to the thing that's

00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:38,950
already been baked I previously deployed

00:26:35,499 --> 00:26:41,049
a cluster and what you'll see as you go

00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:43,090
through your dashboard in our cloud is

00:26:41,049 --> 00:26:45,519
you'll see that there's a CFE demo

00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:48,220
cluster which is created as a result of

00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:49,809
me creating the CFE demo in the cloud

00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:53,259
foundry environment and if I were to

00:26:49,809 --> 00:26:55,690
click in on that you get a dashboard

00:26:53,259 --> 00:26:58,179
that shows you the details of this

00:26:55,690 --> 00:27:00,070
particular CF instance and you'll see

00:26:58,179 --> 00:27:02,830
the API endpoint at the top this is

00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:04,269
where you target your CF push you'll see

00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:06,070
details about what's being used

00:27:04,269 --> 00:27:06,999
obviously not much being used here we

00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:09,129
don't have much running in this

00:27:06,999 --> 00:27:11,229
particular one as well as information

00:27:09,129 --> 00:27:13,029
about the coop cluster and then the

00:27:11,229 --> 00:27:14,859
applications that are deployed as well

00:27:13,029 --> 00:27:17,289
as the users that are deployed on it and

00:27:14,859 --> 00:27:19,479
so as we build this out what you'll see

00:27:17,289 --> 00:27:21,940
on this panel is the ability to shrink

00:27:19,479 --> 00:27:24,159
and grow that environment as needed be

00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:26,080
able to to manage all the aspects of

00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:27,170
that and now you have a dedicated

00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,520
instance of cloud

00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:30,470
every on our cloud you didn't have to

00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:32,480
deal with any of the infrastructure runs

00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:34,010
on our container service is awesome so

00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,600
when is this gonna be available for

00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:37,370
people to check out this should be

00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,920
available in third quarter so at the end

00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:41,810
of first half that's exciting

00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:43,160
well done thank you so much for coming

00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:44,840
on stage to show this and we're all

00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:46,370
excited about the new IBM Cloud Foundry

00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:55,310
Enterprise Edition my pleasure

00:27:46,370 --> 00:28:00,110
thanks it's what we're waiting for the

00:27:55,310 --> 00:28:05,750
slides to come back there we go a couple

00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:07,580
more announcements so bear with me I'd

00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:09,710
also like to bring up on stage Thomas

00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:13,260
DiGiacomo the CTO of Susi to talk about

00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:16,660
their latest offering come on Thomas

00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:16,660
[Music]

00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:26,270
excellent musical choice they knew they

00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:29,390
know you Thomas I know you hey good

00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:33,710
afternoon good evening so we have an

00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:36,290
announcement to do Sousa is developing a

00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:37,880
cloud family based solution called suit

00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:39,320
up

00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:43,760
choose a cloud application flat

00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:46,520
application platform right everything is

00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:48,200
a platform but and today we announce

00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:52,310
that it's flood fun we certified so we

00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:54,890
are very happy about that yes we're here

00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:58,010
it's a big milestone means a lot to us

00:28:54,890 --> 00:29:01,150
because we strongly believe in freedom

00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:04,640
of choice for users for not fun.we users

00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:06,290
but we have to keep consistency in the

00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,840
CF experience across the different

00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:10,100
platforms right and so it should not

00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:12,440
depend on the choices that you make

00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:14,180
today but we should also give you

00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:16,340
freedom of choices for the future

00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:20,630
changing platforms and taking what's

00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:22,760
best for you so we are very happy it's

00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:25,130
also reflecting and all the work we're

00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:28,550
doing in the community so we are an open

00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:31,090
source first company and we try to do as

00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:33,560
many things upstream as we can so we

00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:35,750
contribute to the existing CF projects

00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:38,180
we also contributed some new things

00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:39,539
around user interface continue rising

00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:43,379
Cloud Foundry

00:29:39,539 --> 00:29:47,100
and more to come so yeah lots of amazing

00:29:43,379 --> 00:29:49,049
projects in the works yeah yeah and so

00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:52,019
we have to talk about Cuba it is a bit

00:29:49,049 --> 00:29:53,220
as well right yes we have here so Souza

00:29:52,019 --> 00:29:55,979
cloud application platform is also

00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:58,289
kubernetes certified and of course it's

00:29:55,979 --> 00:30:00,809
free open source so we're trying to help

00:29:58,289 --> 00:30:03,840
bring the best of both worlds together

00:30:00,809 --> 00:30:06,509
we have a lot of customers using

00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:08,609
containers who asked us to bring the CF

00:30:06,509 --> 00:30:11,909
experience to the Container cluster

00:30:08,609 --> 00:30:13,529
because they don't get that all the good

00:30:11,909 --> 00:30:15,869
cloud fundraise you have to push things

00:30:13,529 --> 00:30:17,519
are native capabilities cluster so we

00:30:15,869 --> 00:30:19,200
developed the Cloud Foundry

00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:20,429
containerized version of that fun way

00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,970
that can run on any type of kubernetes

00:30:20,429 --> 00:30:27,330
cluster public cloud bare metal VM

00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:29,639
whatever and I'm not as brave as done so

00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:32,369
I'm not going to do a live demo now does

00:30:29,639 --> 00:30:33,720
one tomorrow so we will have a suzer

00:30:32,369 --> 00:30:35,999
container ice platform is running

00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:38,159
running on top of Microsoft Asia or

00:30:35,999 --> 00:30:39,989
kubernetes services that's exciting

00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:41,489
we're looking forward to that well

00:30:39,989 --> 00:30:44,009

application platform and you should

00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:48,529
check out that demo

00:30:52,049 --> 00:30:57,220
I'd have one lawyer announcement I won't

00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:59,080

00:31:01,889 --> 00:31:12,489
today we also want to announce another

00:31:04,059 --> 00:31:13,899
certified distribution cloud gov yes for

00:31:12,489 --> 00:31:15,940

the crowd here 18f has done an amazing

00:31:18,429 --> 00:31:24,879
job of delivery through open source

00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:27,700
Cloud Foundry to change the federal

00:31:24,879 --> 00:31:28,989
government and today we're excited to

00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:30,999
announce that it is now certified

00:31:28,989 --> 00:31:32,919
distribution so they can continue

00:31:30,999 --> 00:31:35,499
deliver Cloud Foundry services to the

00:31:32,919 --> 00:31:37,919
government and if you're not following

00:31:35,499 --> 00:31:40,809
the work that the 18f has been doing

00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:43,029
they are really awesome in that they put

00:31:40,809 --> 00:31:44,529
everything out there on get so they are

00:31:43,029 --> 00:31:46,389
very transparent about the work that

00:31:44,529 --> 00:31:48,460
they're doing and are willing to share

00:31:46,389 --> 00:31:50,979
it with everyone and so I highly

00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:53,679
recommend that you follow them go out to

00:31:50,979 --> 00:31:55,029
their get repo or just read their blogs

00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:57,399
where they're really talking about all

00:31:55,029 --> 00:32:00,159
the work that they're doing and oh by

00:31:57,399 --> 00:32:02,649
the way they were about 18 months ago

00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:04,809
the first one to ever FedRAMP certified

00:32:02,649 --> 00:32:07,149
Cloud Foundry so the version they're

00:32:04,809 --> 00:32:09,820
running for the government is now

00:32:07,149 --> 00:32:12,309
FedRAMP certified Cloud Foundry

00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:15,249
certified and now available to everyone

00:32:12,309 --> 00:32:17,379
in the government to use so if you're

00:32:15,249 --> 00:32:20,919
keeping track at home that's eight

00:32:17,379 --> 00:32:22,599
certified distributions for 2018 and

00:32:20,919 --> 00:32:25,090
we're really excited to show the breadth

00:32:22,599 --> 00:32:27,190
of the ecosystem but also the

00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:29,950
capabilities that Cloud Foundry brings

00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:36,210
to a lot of unique organizations and

00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:39,790
deployments so as I wrap

00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:42,310
my quasi monologue here this morning or

00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:42,850
this afternoon it's been a really long

00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:45,850
day

00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:48,850
as i pref of my monologue i did want to

00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:51,370
leave you with a couple of things get

00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:56,140
engaged and I'm going to continue to

00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:58,600
beat this drum all week Cloud Foundry is

00:32:56,140 --> 00:33:01,000
only successful because each and every

00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:03,190
one of you are participating in it it is

00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,650
an open source project and for it to

00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:07,330
continue to thrive and grow it needs

00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:09,730
each and every one of you to be part of

00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:12,820
that journey so I'm going to ask you all

00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:16,720
to continue to get engaged involved and

00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:19,290
bring your voices to the table but I'm

00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:21,220
also going to ask you to contribute and

00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:24,130
contribution to an open-source project

00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:27,600
can be hard for many of you the

00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:31,930
contribution takes many forms your time

00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:34,360

all have amazing talents and ideas and

00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:44,620
we need each and every one of them to be

00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:50,980
part of our community and part of the

00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:53,890
future of Cloud Foundry ultimately every

00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:58,450
one of us just want control control over

00:33:53,890 --> 00:34:01,570

fingertips with Cloud Foundry we're

00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:10,240
working towards a world where every

00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:14,620
single one of us has what we need to

00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:18,970
make great things this is one of those

00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:22,650
choices that changes everything one of

00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:26,290
