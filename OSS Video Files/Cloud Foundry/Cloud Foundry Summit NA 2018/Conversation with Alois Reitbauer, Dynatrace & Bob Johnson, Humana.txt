we were really thrilled today to have

00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:09,480
Bob Johnson from Humana join us

00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:11,550
alongside loi stripe Bauer from

00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,410
dynaTrace to talk about what running at

00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:17,280
scale looks like and what that means for

00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:22,820
a company the size of Humana come on up

00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:25,199
[Applause]

00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:27,660
thank you Bob for joining us thank you

00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,480
nice shirt change like for those of you

00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:33,270
that haven't checked out the new shirt

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,100
move fast and don't break things that's

00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:36,899
like that's a good theme for I don't

00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:46,110
know maybe the last week for sure oh

00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:50,610
yeah sorry Facebook joke too soon too

00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:54,510
soon but thank you both for joining us

00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:56,670
and I was really excited to to talk to

00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:59,280
both of you because I do think for many

00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:01,199
of the users particularly here the work

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,449
you're doing at Humana is super

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,580
interesting and super important because

00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:07,080
we talked a lot about some of the other

00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,299
industries changing but healthcare is

00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,040
changing really quickly as well and

00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:12,689
digital transformation is obviously

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,500
something you probably think a lot about

00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:17,430
these days and and it's been great you

00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,960
know we were talking a little bit

00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,759
earlier and you're like well we're not

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,590
running that much but when I think about

00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:25,110
enterprises even if you're running just

00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:27,930
a few apps you're still running at scale

00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:29,820
because you still have thousands and

00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:31,320
thousands and thousands of users even if

00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,829
it's an internal application and that

00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,970
creates a whole different set of issues

00:01:33,829 --> 00:01:37,439
so even tell us a little bit about the

00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,329
work that you're doing and really what

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:42,990
your focus has been yeah thanks Abby

00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:44,909
absolutely so we're no different from

00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:47,340
any other customer obviously in terms of

00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:50,100
wanting to go fast and and really doing

00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:54,450
it at scale focusing on pipelines and

00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:57,000
and delivery but we absolutely bring in

00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:59,700
a component of operational excellence

00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,119
and focus relative to operations to the

00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:05,130
table and specifically what can we do to

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,229
make sure that we stay as resilient and

00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:09,420
as stable as possible and there are lots

00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:11,940
of components to that the other piece of

00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:13,930
this is really when you think about the

00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:15,610
DevOps three-way

00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:17,200
the middle way being feedback loops

00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:19,990
which we've already talked about a

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,300
couple times today tightening those

00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:27,460
feedback loops is of utmost importance

00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:28,630
from from our perspective so we we

00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,350
really look at a lot of different ways

00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:31,270
to do that

00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:33,130
we employ several different tools and

00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:36,010
separate several different attempts to

00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:38,470
go after that some of the things we're

00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:40,680
able to do is bring some of our legacy

00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:42,900
monitoring solutions to the table

00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,660
application performance solutions

00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:48,100
application performance management and

00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:49,630
you know dynaTrace is really a key piece

00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:51,850
of that as well

00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:54,400
but it's it's really all about what can

00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:56,530
we do to optimize our processes and and

00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,360
really tighten the feedback loop how can

00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:00,550
we get as much information back in the

00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,510
hands of the developers as you know as

00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:03,490
we possibly can

00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:06,880
and from my perspective that's the most

00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:09,460
important thing that we're doing to

00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,720
really tighten things up so just to hit

00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:12,340
on that point cuz I think it's important

00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,650
the feedback loop is the most important

00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:16,360
part absolutely so it's it's very

00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:18,130
important to go fast but again don't

00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:20,080
don't break things right that that's

00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:22,390
really a key thing and then the other

00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,959
piece of it I think is you know what can

00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:27,760
we do to employ shortcuts so a lot of IT

00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:31,270
is really focused on what can we do to

00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:34,150
drive automation and to optimize things

00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:36,489
that are sort of traditional IT so how

00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:38,080
do we you know really take a quantum

00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:40,720
leap forward so if you think about the

00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,880
Boston Marathon it's a 26.2 mile race

00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,459
think about if you can actually you know

00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,620
cut that kind of kind of in the middle

00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:48,820
or across the field a bit and save a

00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:51,610
little bit of time and that's kind of

00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:53,230
the concept that we look at relative to

00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:55,480
Cloud Foundry that's a key piece for us

00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:56,830
again using that for systems where it

00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,120
makes sense we've got several systems

00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:01,420
where it doesn't you know necessarily

00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:03,670
apply but that that's really been a key

00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:05,770
part of our strategy which is phenomenal

00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:08,530
and I know that's probably top of mind

00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:10,870
for everybody else in this room as well

00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:14,350
I know dynaTrace has been a big part of

00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:15,400
of that journey for you is that an asset

00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:17,260
that you're gonna continue to build on

00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,299
or you know how what kind of difference

00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:22,570
is that making to your organization yeah

00:04:19,299 --> 00:04:24,880
from our perspective dynaTrace is really

00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:27,160
a capability that we've invested in for

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,560
quite some time right so it was very

00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,450
- it is for us to be able to leverage

00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:35,980
that technology and apply it as a

00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:37,720
feedback loop specifically to it kind of

00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:39,880
to the new world if you will the Cloud

00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:42,880
Foundry world so having the ability to

00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:45,070
take an existing tool that we had built

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,530
a number of operational processes around

00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:51,220
and apply it in the Cloud Foundry world

00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:52,600
was really key for us so we've kind of

00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:54,310
talked a little about the tech but I

00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,930
feel like where you're also saying is

00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:57,760
the culture change has been an important

00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:59,830
piece of that change for Humana as well

00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:01,690
and thinking about how do you make this

00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:05,380
change how how has that journey been for

00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:07,560
a Humana yeah it's been a journey and it

00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:10,420
continues to be a journey right so

00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:12,550
obviously with any any group you've got

00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:15,130
a number of people that embrace that the

00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:17,800
change that that you're looking to drive

00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:19,870
but the desire for speed doesn't change

00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:23,140
I mean that's getting you know much more

00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:25,030
important as we as we move forward so I

00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:28,120
think the the need for acceleration is

00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:30,900
really key again it's like most other

00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:33,160
things you you roll out certain

00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:35,830
approaches to software engineering and

00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,570
development and some groups embrace that

00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:39,910
other groups are a little slower to the

00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:43,270
table but you know as as part of our

00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:45,580
journey we're really focused on you know

00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:48,880
leveraging Cloud Foundry to really drive

00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:50,110
that and push that verse that ahead I'll

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,540
put you on the spot for a minute I know

00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:54,730
I told you I wouldn't do that but I am

00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:57,160
what is what is one lesson you've

00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:58,960
learned from this journey so far that

00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,130
you think would be really helpful for

00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,600
other people that are maybe just

00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:03,190
starting down this path and are just

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,580
trying to figure out what to do yeah

00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:08,800
that that's actually an easy one the one

00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:11,800
thing that that we find has been missing

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:14,770
and a lot of enterprise spaces

00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:16,510
specifically you you have and we all

00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:19,890
know this you have an operational world

00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:22,210
and a development world and it's very

00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:24,280
difficult to kind of find that common

00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:27,550
language so to the extent that we can

00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:29,530
leverage capabilities and tools to drive

00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:31,360
that common language to the extent that

00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:34,750
we can maybe take some of the tools that

00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:37,540
that people are using you know in the

00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:38,620
operational space and shifting those and

00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:40,180
putting those in the hands of the

00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:41,800
engineers

00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:43,870
that's probably the biggest lesson learn

00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,120
is to focus as much on that as possible

00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:48,340
so again don't just necessarily look at

00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,840
these tools as monitoring tools look at

00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:51,880
them as performance tools don't

00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,930
necessarily look at them you know for

00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,660
the use case that's maybe the most

00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:57,699
popular use case but try to find places

00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:59,889
where it applies to the developer and

00:06:57,699 --> 00:07:01,750
and I think from my perspective that's

00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:02,380
that's been our number one lesson

00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,840
learned

00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:06,250
that's an empowerment and I love how

00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,889
you're you're putting the developer

00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:11,560
first in this story it's not the the

00:07:08,889 --> 00:07:12,789
tech first or the end game first it's

00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,470
you're putting the developer first as

00:07:12,789 --> 00:07:17,410
you build the solution around them and

00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:19,960
really absolutely make that fast yeah

00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:22,960
while still doing that under control

00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:25,810
well control is helpful yes you know

00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,039
turns out you if you are publicly trying

00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:28,780
to company you just can't take the year

00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,100
off to go and rehab everything exactly

00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:33,699
cuz I think that would make it easier

00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:35,350
though right in mine but you know it's

00:07:33,699 --> 00:07:36,639
been such a fascinating to hear that

00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:39,280
because I think what we hear a lot about

00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,539
is starting that journey but how do you

00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,039
get started and how do you get the

00:07:40,539 --> 00:07:44,349
momentum and then how do you do it and

00:07:42,039 --> 00:07:46,960
still able to meet the demands of your

00:07:44,349 --> 00:07:48,820
customers both internal and external if

00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,270
you're a large company and I think

00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:51,010
Humana

00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:53,410
really hits on that because this is a

00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:56,229
journey you've been on for a couple of

00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:58,300
years but you know to your point there's

00:07:56,229 --> 00:08:00,220
still a little road left in that journey

00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:03,070
absolutely start small and then scale

00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:05,139
which is the name of the game and and

00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:07,930
don't break things and don't break

00:08:05,139 --> 00:08:10,090
things yet anything you would like to

00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:11,380
add from dinah traces standpoint around

00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:13,479
this journey I know you've been working

00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:15,370
quite closely with Humana for a while on

00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:17,110
this we're working quite closely with a

00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:19,270
Manor a lot of other enterprises and

00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:21,669
what we have really seen happening over

00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:23,800
the last year that cloud really goes

00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:26,080
mainstream in the enterprise as well so

00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,539
we have really seen it all go back to

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,280
that statistics that you showed before

00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:32,110
that it's no longer that pet project

00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:34,860
inside the company but now is a core

00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:38,770
building block of your future

00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:40,510
application and IT strategy and that's

00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:42,029
also why we how we see dynaTrace will be

00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:45,310
fitting well together with Cloud Foundry

00:08:42,029 --> 00:08:48,970
so the analogy that we use is autonomous

00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:53,500
self-driving IT and the idea is you want

00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:53,830
a nearly like a self-driving car you

00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,350
want to

00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:58,210
getting from A to B right you don't care

00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:59,440
so much how you get from A to B you

00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:00,850
don't care when you have to shift only

00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,560
if you change lanes when you have to

00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:04,420
change direction but you want it to

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,100
happen in a safe way and that's how the

00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:08,140
two technologies play well together so

00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:10,060
what we provide is more or less the

00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:11,740
software behind to tell you okay

00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:13,900
something's going wrong along the way

00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:15,520
you should go somewhere else oh it's not

00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:17,500
so smart to change lanes right now

00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:19,750
because there's a car coming right after

00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:22,060
you but what we also tell our customers

00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:24,010
along the journey we're not running

00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:25,900
applications that's not what dynaTrace

00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:27,340
does we provide a platform that helps

00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:29,230
you to manage and optimize your

00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:31,990
applications but not run them and that's

00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:34,330
why we tightly work together with cloud

00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:37,240
foundry and also tell our customers in

00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:40,030
order to really go down that vision of

00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:42,070
having your IT infrastructure manage and

00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:43,810
run itself and only gets you into the

00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:45,700
game in the case of an exception you

00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:48,310
also need to have an underlying platform

00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:50,440
that's actually able to do that if you

00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:52,660
have an application that's your so

00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:55,690
nothing against legacy technology but a

00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:59,170
25 year old GE application that you

00:09:55,690 --> 00:10:01,990
still deploy by FTP on a salary system

00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:03,310
that small as our warranty right now it

00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:05,110
won't help you to have the smallest

00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:07,120
systems realizing that there is a

00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:09,100
problem going on because the system is

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,140
not able to do anything with this

00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,880
information by scaling up by changing

00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:15,310
things by rolling back changes and so

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:19,060
forth so I just learned something my

00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:22,270
Solaris systems out of warranty you

00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:24,090
can't do it on Solaris here but ok

00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:26,050
that's gonna be a problem for later but

00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:28,150
yeah I think that makes sense is really

00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:29,650
you know how you help that how you

00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:30,760
package that up but you know one of the

00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:32,260
things we start talking about is as

00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:34,540
we're running at scale what does that

00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:36,550
look like how do you manage that how do

00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:38,140
you orchestrate that and also you know

00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:39,730
what happens when there's a failure how

00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:42,100
do you know there's a failure how do you

00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:44,230
you know really you know pinpoint that I

00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:46,090
think the key difference is you don't

00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:48,250
manage it yourself you have to really

00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:49,780
change your approach towards operation

00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:51,760
so what we've seen in the past would

00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:53,560
always what we refer to more or less a

00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,940
data on glass approach so you have this

00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,800
big knock room so this room still

00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:58,720
there's no daylight pretty much like in

00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,150
here we have daylight this area back

00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,650
there so a lot of screens you watch

00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:05,880
those screens and then when something

00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:07,780
happens you kind of act on reactive

00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:10,600
purely reactive

00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:12,250
it's a scripted action and you have

00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,800
people watching screens but that doesn't

00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:16,780
scale it's fine if you run at say 100

00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,250
service it's always a lot of work to do

00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:20,980
it with 100 serviced and get me wrong

00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:23,920
but what we've seen what happens when

00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:25,990
people approach move towards a more

00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,480
cloud native approach that their

00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:31,180
environments tend to get 20 times bigger

00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,830
so it's 20 times the size even for the

00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:34,690
same applications because you break it

00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:36,310
down into micro services it's more

00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:36,790
individually scaled components which is

00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:39,460
great

00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:41,590
it's just as complexity thus did now

00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:45,000
mean that it will also add 20 times the

00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:47,500
people know you down so you also have to

00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,270
make this part of looking at data or

00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:52,120
analyzing data and automate it as well

00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:53,830
and that's where really the approach

00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:56,650
that we have comes in where we have

00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:58,390
built and AI component in and out today

00:11:56,650 --> 00:12:01,030
everything is a I but think of it more

00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:04,210
or less building a system that does a

00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:07,030
lot of the analysis that a human would

00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:09,370
do into a software system and automate

00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:11,350
these processes because as you automate

00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:13,060
how you run your replications is also

00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:15,490
ultimate how you manage your replication

00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:18,670
and human intervention should be the

00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:22,930
exception and not the rule like today if

00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:25,150
you have to SSH into your past platform

00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:27,130
something is terribly wrong right and

00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:28,510
it's the same for when you push

00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:29,920
something through your pipeline if a

00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:33,339
human has to look at what you're pushing

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,750
through your pipeline something is most

00:12:33,339 --> 00:12:36,490
likely wrong as well it should be wrong

00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:38,080
it should be the reason why human

00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:40,690
intervention is needed we heard before

00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,980
about shifting left security we see

00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:43,839
pretty much the same happening for

00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:46,180
performance it doesn't help you to

00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,740
develop an editor variant realize once

00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:50,110
your first customer it's your side oh

00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:52,480
this thing is actually slow or they

00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:54,670
cannot login or they cannot form any

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:57,460
other task so that shifting left piece

00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:59,410
is also part in there and what we've

00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:01,750
also seen that is this additional

00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:04,770
visibility to Bob's point what we've

00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:07,390
really seen that visibility also creates

00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:09,850
responsibilities you can't expect your

00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:11,620
developers to feel responsible for

00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:12,910
things breaking into production if they

00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:14,800
have no access to their data

00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:16,330
how can you feel responsible for

00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,000
something that you don't know about and

00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:21,130
the positive side is and responsibility

00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,020
creates a lot of entrepreneurial

00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:25,210
with people okay this is how I can

00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:27,700
improve it starts to be really fun

00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:30,310
seeing okay this change I really had

00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:32,380
that positive impact so I think that's

00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:34,090
how we have to rethink how we work with

00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:36,280
Staters not just keeping the lights on

00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:37,660
as we've heard before in some way how do

00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:41,220
we move forward and what's the next step

00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:44,850
for us and don't break things move fast

00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:47,620
the cautionary tale don't break things

00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:50,980
you know maybe you should some of those

00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:57,970
tough Mark Zuckerberg Wow

00:13:50,980 --> 00:14:02,110
I find myself hilarious but that's also

00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:03,640
I think a a great example here too like

00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:07,630
that example you should know when things

00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:09,280
happen and should and those were and

00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:10,930
where things come into play for the

00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:13,240
enterprise we talked about security also

00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:16,210
before and especially in the

00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:18,490
observability domain and the monitoring

00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:20,620
to mean security also plays a vital role

00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:23,740
so back to that point so like

00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:25,660
historically we see usually you had like

00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:27,280
monitoring individual for individual

00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:28,930
apps so you were looking at apps

00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:31,120
individually but now you have a platform

00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:35,080
that runs pretty much full stack a lot

00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:36,850
of stuff so how do you segment so how do

00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:38,230
you segment there and how are you sure

00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:40,270
that people only see what they should

00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:42,880
see so I think that security topic is

00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:44,770
also extending into monitoring as well

00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,780
and we have for example introduced the

00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:48,570
concept which we call management zones

00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:50,740
so we're directly extracting

00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:52,320
organization information and our

00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:56,920
information out of Cloud Foundry and

00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:58,810
dynamically create access rules for for

00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:01,660
this type of information which is also

00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:03,370
key because the two of us might have be

00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:06,400
able to look at the same dashboard but

00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:09,070
we might be only able to see different

00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:10,690
types of data so yeah that's awesome and

00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:13,030
I love how you know you're talking about

00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:14,800
being proactive and really taking a

00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:16,180
proactive approach to the way you're

00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,250
architecting and deploying option you're

00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:19,930
tying it with your ear the way you're

00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:22,030
really putting that feedback loop in and

00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:23,620
I think combine those two things really

00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:26,260
put you in a powerful position to not

00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:28,330
only deploy new apps but scale and for

00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:29,770
the for the Humana case you run a lot of

00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:31,270
you have a lot of very critical data

00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:32,490
like other companies you were joking

00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:34,890
about

00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:36,930
in this case even more critically but

00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:38,760
you're in one hand you talk about like

00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:40,740
information democracy making information

00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:42,420
