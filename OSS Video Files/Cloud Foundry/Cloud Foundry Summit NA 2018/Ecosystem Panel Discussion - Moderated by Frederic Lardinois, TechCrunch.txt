Nawab techcrunch join me alongside Molly

00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:16,650
Crowther who was just on stage and hen

00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,850
Goldberg and Matt curry we're gonna

00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:24,660
spend a little time talking about

00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:28,640
security agility flexibility and what's

00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,640
going on in the ecosystem come on out

00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:36,140
[Music]

00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:36,140
[Applause]

let me take this one here okay well it's

00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,460
we're very excited about chairs sitting

00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:50,340
sitting

00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:53,040
we found an offering backstage we found

00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,720
coffee backstage yeah yeah everybody's

00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,670
perk here now than they were doing their

00:00:54,720 --> 00:01:00,680
analysis because we found coffee

00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:02,519
backstage well shots oh hell yeah

00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,989
should have brought to yourself you

00:01:02,519 --> 00:01:05,940
should have I could have used some

00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:07,979
coffee about it you want some we'll

00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:11,100
bring you yeah

00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:12,840
we're supposed to talk about the Cloud

00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,670
Foundry ecosystem but before we do that

00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:18,149
I want to talk about something more

00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:23,660
important that's that's money pivotal

00:01:18,149 --> 00:01:27,030
IPO Molly you excited I no comment

00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:28,160
you can't tell us your comment happening

00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:40,770
on Friday

00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:43,409
you didn't hear yeah okay we put that

00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:48,240
there so she can talk about it but it's

00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:59,580
nice - nice nice try Abby oh you're the

00:01:48,240 --> 00:02:01,560
fact we'll work on that we're just gonna

00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:04,140
roll with that back on track back on

00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:07,110
track Abby since this is the first time

00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:09,530
a company in the Cloud Foundry ecosystem

00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:13,440
is IP owing does that matter

00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:15,930
yeah I think it you know it's important

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,600
because to me it really represents a

00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:20,579
validation of Cloud Foundry the fact

00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,280
that a company is able to IPO with this

00:02:20,579 --> 00:02:24,540
to be a major part of its portfolio

00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,970
really says that Cloud Foundry

00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:29,700
is not only an enable meant for end

00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:31,350
users that are working really hard to

00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:34,049
digitally transform but it's also

00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:35,640
helping companies build other solutions

00:02:34,049 --> 00:02:38,190
on top of and I think it's important as

00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:40,950
a platform to be able to serve as both

00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:43,769
sides of that and so it really

00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:45,390
represents you know justice for me an

00:02:43,769 --> 00:02:47,280
amazing validation of the ecosystem that

00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:49,260
we have but also the technology that

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,730
sits here do you think we'll see more of

00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:56,550
this

00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:58,080
well we can pressure sa P to IPO I think

00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:00,150
they've already done that no I love to

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:04,620
see more of that maybe Google maybe

00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:06,420
Google look at Seoul IPO hey Matthew you

00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:09,060
guys have I filled a long time ago but

00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:13,319
when you made the decision to choose

00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:15,200
cloud foundry did you consider what the

00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:18,540
ecosystem was looking like at the time

00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:22,290
so I think when we chose cloud foundry

00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:25,349
the foundation didn't exist yet if I

00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:27,900
remember correctly so we're I mean we're

00:03:25,349 --> 00:03:29,700
definitely in terms of evaluating

00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:32,130
software as an enterprise and the

00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:34,790
process that you typically go through in

00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:39,239
doing that evaluation the open source

00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:42,239
dimension of it was very appealing and I

00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:44,760
believe at that time we had IBM and

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,500
pivotal as vendors that were supporting

00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:49,260
it as well as you know you were able to

00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:51,720
run open source cloud foundry and so

00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:53,700
that was appealing right so that then

00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,739
over time it's only gotten more

00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,389
appealing with the establishment of the

00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:59,910
foundation itself the establishment of

00:03:57,389 --> 00:04:02,670
the certification so that I can rest

00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:04,680
easy that I do have workload portability

00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:09,780
across different distributions of Cloud

00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:11,040
Foundry and so yes we did look I mean I

00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:13,530
would say that we looked at that and it

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,120
definitely influenced our decision did

00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:19,229
it feel like a risk still at the time

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:23,340
like shooting off fireworks next yeah

00:04:19,229 --> 00:04:27,710
I it so we there was a lot of unanswered

00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:30,979
questions when you talk about enabling

00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:32,850
self-service in a company that

00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:36,180
traditionally like doesn't enable

00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:38,580
self-service and so there was a lot of

00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:40,789
unanswered questions about you know how

00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:43,800
do we mean at risk how do we do security

00:04:40,789 --> 00:04:45,570
what impact does that have in terms of

00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,979
separation of duties if we're all of a

00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:49,200
sudden allowing developers to just

00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:51,870
deploy whenever they want how are we

00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:53,220
going to do change control which is part

00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:57,479
of the reason that you know we created

00:04:53,220 --> 00:05:00,330
the deployed actual stuff but you know

00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:03,240
so I think a lot of it a lot of the risk

00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:04,240
or perception of risk wasn't so much

00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,470
around the product

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,819
selection as much as it was on the

00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:13,930
operational impacts that it was going to

00:05:09,819 --> 00:05:15,910
have for just like how we do software in

00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:20,470
Mali since you're all about mitigating

00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:22,630
risk in the ecosystem right now there

00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:25,470
aren't a lot of pure-play security

00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:28,030
players necessarily do you think the

00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:31,240
community is doing enough in terms of

00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:34,120
security yeah so I think that's actually

00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:38,860
intentional I've talked about this

00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:41,620
before but the way that you provide a

00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:45,430
healthy culture for an open-source

00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:48,430
community like ours is that you can't

00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:50,020
have vendors competing over each other

00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:52,090
on security so it's something that we

00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:58,120
work together on which is great because

00:05:52,090 --> 00:06:01,180
any you know security kind of things

00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:03,310
that we're doing as as individual

00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:05,080
vendors we're trying to work together to

00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:07,479
make that story stronger for the entire

00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:10,330
ecosystem not just for one of us so

00:06:07,479 --> 00:06:12,460
working yeah I think it is I mean I love

00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:14,979
working with all the the partners that

00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:17,020
we get to kind of interact with all the

00:06:14,979 --> 00:06:20,680
time so we you know we talked to the

00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:24,880
other vendors we you know it's really

00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:27,840
collaborative and then what about Google

00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:32,860
you've made a big bet on kubernetes

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:37,349
you're here now what what do you what's

00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:37,349
your role in the Cloud Foundry ecosystem

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:43,900
so firstly as I said before Google and

00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:46,509
cloud foundry and kubernetes are sharing

00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:47,919
a common principles of how to build

00:06:46,509 --> 00:06:50,080
cloud native applications and how to

00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:53,139
modernize and we've been working very

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,710
closely with building those open

00:06:53,139 --> 00:06:56,680
standards

00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:59,740
Google was also working on a building

00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:02,080
decode fund a container run for example

00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:06,900
it gives that ability to run both

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:11,050
kubernetes and andrea on the application

00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:12,849
runtime in a consistent way so from our

00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:15,339
perspective our our main goal is really

00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:17,440
to bring those practices to the world

00:07:15,339 --> 00:07:20,030
because that's how Google has been

00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,800
managing services forever right so

00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:24,890
that's how we manage search and YouTube

00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:26,450
and maps and everything and with open

00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:28,010
source and with the community and the

00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:31,490
ecosystem we want to bring what we have

00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:33,170
learned but we also need the community

00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:34,910
because we are learning summit learning

00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:36,350
so many new things right if you think

00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:38,720
about kubernetes kubernetes wouldn't

00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:41,810
have been the same without partners that

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,370
are so experienced with on pram for

00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:45,740
example deployments and with co-founder

00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:49,130
it's it's the same the way we're working

00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:51,590
on the container storage interface for

00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:52,940
example and also with e steel so if you

00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:55,100
go to the cloud foundry you'll see that

00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:57,500
there is now already a project which I

00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:59,150
saw I think there's 13 contributors one

00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,620
three contributors already working on on

00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:02,810
integrating cloud foundry into a steel

00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:06,640
and giving that feedback back to the

00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:09,710
project will make it better no doubt

00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:12,590
it's the power of open source power of

00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:12,980
open source absolutely ideally you never

00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:16,490
know

00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:20,930
yes sir some projects come and go goals

00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:22,970
can go go fast where they can I really

00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:27,320
open source authority I think how much

00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:31,100
you really make yourself ready for open

00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:33,169
source and really know just talk about

00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:35,060
open source but really act with it mm-hm

00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:37,010
it's open opening a discussion and

00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:38,599
getting input and getting different

00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:41,020
ideas and you know we talked about

00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:43,669
secure this affordable the kubernetes a

00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:45,320
way we work so we do have a team which

00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:48,860
is a community working on security

00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:51,020
vulnerabilities and but we are also

00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:53,870
providing an interface that allows

00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:55,730
different companies and project to

00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:58,520
innovate for example I think that

00:08:55,730 --> 00:09:01,660
actually makes the pace of innovation

00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:07,040
faster since you mentioned the community

00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:09,050
Matt what what's your take on the state

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,910
of the community since your token user

00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:14,510
and it probably matters more to you than

00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:16,550
anybody else yeah I mean it's it's

00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:18,920
improving over time it's gotten better I

00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:20,210
think the Cloud Foundry community is

00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,310
different than most traditional

00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:24,680
open-source communities in that it's

00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:27,080
largely made up of enterprise users

00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:30,120
we're not used to being very community

00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:32,870
driven quite frankly

00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:36,390
and so were you before you started this

00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:39,029
I had spent quite a bit of time in

00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:41,490
open-source I did a lot of work with the

00:09:39,029 --> 00:09:45,510
open stack which I still have nightmares

00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:46,770
about but it's fine before I can't and

00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:48,150
you know when you're running open stack

00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:50,760
you learn to rely a lot on the community

00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:52,070
because like you have no yeah

00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:57,000
like you're hanging in the window okay

00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:58,710
what here so so yeah so tried to bring

00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
like the community dimension and that is

00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:02,040
why we open sourced

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,440
you know deploy dactalos to try and

00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:07,230
engage the community and and I think

00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:09,630
there's been a number of folks you know

00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:11,610
folks where you've seen users actually

00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:17,130
become a part of the Foundation which

00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:19,080
has been a great evolution and we're you

00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:20,420
know the customers and users of the

00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:23,250
open-source software are actually

00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:25,260
working to dictate kind of the roadmap

00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:29,370
and direction of the product in a very

00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:31,200
direct way and and it's great but it's

00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:34,830
it's not like we just turned on

00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:39,270
community I got a lot of these projects

00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:42,420
that kind of come out of open source by

00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:43,529
default build I it feels like I know

00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,940
there's a lot of people that do a lot of

00:10:43,529 --> 00:10:47,550
work but it feels like the community is

00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:50,640
more diverse and organic just say it

00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:52,980
like that way and then we're like this

00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:56,430
community is growing and evolving

00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:58,760
community and started out being a

00:10:56,430 --> 00:11:01,680
community of a very small number of

00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:05,220
players and then has become is becoming

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:10,130
more diverse over time is is a good

00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:15,000
thing like a be coached you to say that

00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:16,350
everything funny later ok well Abby and

00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,240
I have had a lot of discussions about

00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:19,860
that topic right yeah yeah about what we

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,880
need to do in order to improve the

00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:25,290
community and like she's obviously been

00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,450
hugely instrumental and getting us to

00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:29,250
where we where we are and you know

00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:31,620
directing us forward so it's awesome

00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:33,839
it's important and you know with nearly

00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:36,390
half of our membership now users like

00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:38,310
you know yourself at all-state it's it's

00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:40,620
important because you're what's

00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:42,390
propelling this forward this isn't just

00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:44,460
a single idea or

00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:45,840
single notion it is the collective and I

00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:48,000
think that's what makes open-source

00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:49,680
powerful and that really builds on on

00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,960
his point about the work that's

00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,700
happening in kubernetes initio is its is

00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:57,000
the collective and how this all propels

00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:59,430
each other Ford even separately with

00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,990
different communities I think we still

00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:03,900
are building and leveraging on each

00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:05,780
other in real ways that I think makes

00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:08,130
this more powerful at the end of the day

00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:10,310
that's been really cool seeing the

00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:13,800
container runtime kind of takes shape

00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:16,350
over the last year and seeing the open

00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:19,200
source kind of cloud foundry teams work

00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:20,580
together with the Google teams and just

00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,830
like the relationship that's formed

00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:24,630
between them has been really cool it

00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:26,760
definitely is an engineering manager

00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:28,080
there's something that I appreciate the

00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,720
most there's something called the

00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:32,040
engineering economics right and we as

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,730
engineers we want to innovate we don't

00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:39,090
want to reinvent the wheel yeah and just

00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:40,500
allow us to innovate faster we benefit

00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:41,720
from that for sure and that's something

00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:44,220
you've done with the kubernetes

00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:46,020
community quite well I think over the

00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:49,170
last two years since you've been at

00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:51,870
Google I think but when you're looking

00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:55,650
at the Cloud Foundry community right now

00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:56,880
an ecosystem around it is there

00:12:55,650 --> 00:13:00,720
something that could do better they

00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:02,720
could learn from you Frederick's putting

00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:09,090
you on the spot let's bring it yes just

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:12,390
it's not here just I don't know that I

00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:14,820
ever thought about that I really like

00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:16,320
the work that Cod foundry has been doing

00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:18,860
and really connecting the different

00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:22,530
communities and so far it's been great

00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:24,630
experience working with with people

00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:26,370
right it's all about the people I talk

00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:28,620
about the foundry the foundation but

00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:33,660
working with people in cloud foundry was

00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:35,130
is always great and I think everybody in

00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:38,360
both those communities really put the

00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:40,350
user in the center and solving problems

00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:42,330
here was hoping you're gonna say

00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:44,280
something no I actually you know I I

00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:46,140
think my father is actually evolving and

00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,670
changing and talk about operability and

00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:50,760
bringing other communities that sounds

00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:52,560
to me like great things and and I'm I

00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:54,180
would love to have also users talk about

00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:57,880
kubernetes the way they talk about

00:13:54,180 --> 00:14:02,510
[Laughter]

00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:05,840
some of them do do Molly if the

00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:07,220
community grows it security does it

00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:09,910
become a bigger challenge to hurt

00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:13,760
everybody together and ensure Security's

00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:16,610
it's not forgotten yeah definitely so I

00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:19,660
am technically on the Technical Program

00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:24,320
management team for Cloud Foundry and

00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:27,230
there's nine of us now and we basically

00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:31,010
herd the cats and it's not all security

00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:32,270
I mean there's just making sure that the

00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:34,160
different teams are working together

00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:37,190
when they need to and not breaking each

00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,900
other because they move really fast so

00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:41,150
you you know you have to help them

00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:44,690
create visibility between what they're

00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:47,540
doing so as we scale as a community like

00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:49,940
security becomes a bigger part of that

00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:51,860
and it's not just like let's make sure

00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:53,360
everybody's working well together it's

00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:56,180
like let's also make sure that

00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,760
everybody's being secure sure now what

00:14:56,180 --> 00:15:02,690
would you like to see from the ecosystem

00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:06,710
in the community that's a great question

00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:08,630
what's missing well I think I'd like to

00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:11,000
see us continue on the path that we're

00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:15,740
on in terms of like having more

00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:18,320
diversity not just from like overall

00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:21,260
community you know individual diversity

00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:24,830
which is great but just from a

00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:27,470
contributor perspective continuing to

00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:28,960
drive that diversity up I think is a

00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:34,670
good thing bring different perspectives

00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:38,960
I think it would be healthy to have more

00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:41,120
players so right now I think the

00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:43,190
ecosystem is largely dominated by a few

00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,350
distributions and so like the more

00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:46,730
choice that we have the better and I

00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:47,930
think we're starting to see that like

00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:51,320
with some of the work this you say is

00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:53,420
doing and the cool thing about that is

00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:56,360
with the certification like as a

00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:57,950
customer I'm not breaking the interfaces

00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,930
that are exposed to my developers but

00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:02,780
when you look at and the different

00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:04,820
companies they approach Cloud Foundry as

00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:08,230
in terms of how they deploy it slightly

00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:11,420
differently and it's nice that they have

00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:13,459
choice and that I as a customer can look

00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:15,829
at those decisions and make a choice on

00:16:13,459 --> 00:16:18,680
on what I like or don't like about those

00:16:15,829 --> 00:16:21,170
decisions but still have assurance that

00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:22,970
at the top layer like my cut my customer

00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:25,189
my developer is gonna have the same

00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:27,620
experience sure sure for a very similar

00:16:25,189 --> 00:16:31,579
experience do you care if those

00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:34,699
distributions are certified I do I don't

00:16:31,579 --> 00:16:37,189
know if if others do but I do yeah

00:16:34,699 --> 00:16:39,649
that's good that's good dinner yeah I

00:16:37,189 --> 00:16:41,779
was looking at the the foundry the

00:16:39,649 --> 00:16:43,970
marketplace earlier today and there's

00:16:41,779 --> 00:16:46,579
about what's it now eight certified

00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:49,790
secure distributions yes and another

00:16:46,579 --> 00:16:54,920
eight that are not certified yes why

00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:57,170
they're not certified well I don't know

00:16:54,920 --> 00:17:00,350
that everyone needs to be certified and

00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:02,600
I think certification is a signal

00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:05,000
particularly to customers or potential

00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,620
customers that you're maintaining with

00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,679
the upstream and it's a really good

00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:13,339
verification of that for end for their

00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:16,039
end-users whomever those are but it also

00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:18,649
if you're looking to promote it and talk

00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:20,959
about it externally allows for us we're

00:17:18,649 --> 00:17:24,860
really just as a foundation what do we

00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:26,240
have we have IP and Trademark and so for

00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:27,709
us it allows us to relinquish the

00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,169
trademark to you to use and say I'm

00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:31,789
running Cloud Foundry so we're we're

00:17:30,169 --> 00:17:34,460
linking the trademark to you but we're

00:17:31,789 --> 00:17:36,110
saying but we're you know we're forcing

00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:38,029
you to say okay yes but I'm also keeping

00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:41,240
pace with the upstream I'm not forking

00:17:38,029 --> 00:17:43,730
it and I'm really making sure that if

00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:45,679
Allstate wants to use my distribution

00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:47,450
they can move their workloads somewhere

00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:50,029
else if they wanted to and it's not a

00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:51,830
different experience and so for us it's

00:17:50,029 --> 00:17:53,539
really important to keep that but if

00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:56,240
you're running your own distribution and

00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:58,549
being able to say that or being able to

00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,080
remote that is not that important then I

00:17:58,549 --> 00:18:02,870
can see why you wouldn't want to have a

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,460
certification I mean our goal at the

00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:07,370
foundation isn't to have a million

00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:12,860
distributions it's to have a you know a

00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:14,809
nice selection of diverse options in a

00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:16,820
variety of regions I'd like to see it in

00:18:14,809 --> 00:18:19,960
more regions but giving people choice

00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:24,410
but giving them choice with a direct

00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:27,110
that's a seems like you've got you would

00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:28,040
like to have more choice well I mean 8

00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:31,640
is a good number

00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:35,000
right but I mean but I think you know I

00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:38,420
think when I think of it it's not so

00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,580
much the number as much as the

00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:44,900
distribution of customers across that

00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:47,750
number so you know if I have a but only

00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:53,360
to have customers then it's like I have

00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:55,130
two who are those two trying to make a

00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,980
scale fair yeah

00:18:55,130 --> 00:19:00,190
yeah and that comes back to kind of the

00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:02,540
community tie-in and like the influence

00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:05,360
dimensions of what we're talking about

00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:06,980
earlier right so maybe that's something

00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,440
that you know kubernetes is doing

00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:11,300
differently I think we didn't serve it

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,920
in silver ties everybody into

00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:15,830
communities to be conformance all right

00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:18,380
now I think there are 66 0 integration

00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:20,240
distribution that are all conformant and

00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:22,670
the community is working on on extending

00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,980
those conformance tests and in essence

00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:29,530
it's about of course for the user it's

00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:32,270
about the portability of workloads but

00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:33,440
we're also talking about that consistent

00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:35,660
experience right that's what we are

00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:38,720
proposing with modernization now for the

00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:41,270
vendor for example because the pace of

00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:43,010
innovation is so fast actually

00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:45,530
conformance is a tool for you to know

00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:47,570
that you can always upgrade and it won't

00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:49,580
be something that you need to work on

00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:51,560
for a long time so it's the same value

00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:53,540
as for user also for Bendel's you know

00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:55,910
when I know that a Google base engine is

00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:58,130
confirmed I know that upgrade is easy

00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:59,660
and I can offer the next version and

00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:04,760
whatever is coming from the community on

00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:08,980
GCP the certification matter from a

00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:11,390
security standpoint it matters that we

00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:13,520
the more people we can have using

00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:15,650
up-to-date versions the better off we

00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:18,170
are like I'm you know upgrade upgrade

00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:20,150
upgrade so if that uncertified

00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:22,880
distribution has a security issue it

00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:23,300
becomes a big deal I mean it can hold on

00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,120
you

00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:28,400
I mean I'm sure you can be not certified

00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:29,340
but also keeping up with us yeah so it's

00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,110
not

00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:33,780
is not related to the other I think it's

00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:35,490
um you know to Molly's point and I

00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:38,120
actually want to reiterate that again

00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:40,410
it's please upgrade well just

00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:42,720
maintaining the pace with the upstream

00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:44,670
which you know right now is about what

00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,890
every other week yes about that it's

00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:51,510
fast but maintaining that pace is

00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:52,620
important because more than just keeping

00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:55,380
pace with new features and

00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:56,970
functionalities it's keeping your your

00:20:55,380 --> 00:21:01,140
platform and subsequently your

00:20:56,970 --> 00:21:02,700
applications secure yeah I guess from my

00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:04,920
perspective when it just comes to

00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:07,290
platforms in general like the platform

00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:08,880
offers you a benefit in that you take

00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:10,440
away the work that every individual

00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,940
development team would have to do and

00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:15,720
you kind of formalize it and the

00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:18,420
construct of like a platform and so the

00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:20,460
more that security capabilities like

00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:22,380
maybe credential handling or something

00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:26,520
else become platform level abstractions

00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:27,900
then you know that certification well

00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:29,340
it's not important right now base time

00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:31,770
like what we what we have from a

00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:34,650
security perspective it will become more

00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:36,270
before important because like vendor a

00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:38,790
is like I didn't implement any other

00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:42,540
security stuff and it's like I'd really

00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:45,510
like to have that so Security's hard and

00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:48,120
important and and traditionally not very

00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:49,920
user friendly so if I can make that more

00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:51,800
you know if I can make those controls

00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:53,400
easier to consume that's all the better

00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:59,120
safety first

00:21:53,400 --> 00:22:03,710
yeah an easy safety easy safety yeah

00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:08,430
switching gears a little bit Abby with

00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:10,830
Alibaba joining the foundation what's

00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:13,050
the ecosystem like right now in Asia and

00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:14,910
China specifically because of what I'm

00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:16,530
hearing from a lot of the other open

00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:19,590
source foundations is that it's seeing a

00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:24,660
lot of growth especially in China well

00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:26,790
China is a fast-growing market and if

00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:29,250
for those of you that aren't paying

00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:30,960
attention it is a excessively fast

00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:34,830
growing organization country as a whole

00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:38,730
greater China and in the region is cloud

00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:41,100
they're vesting heavily in cloud our

00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:41,360
ecosystem is not as robust as it should

00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,010
be

00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,480
in China because we really frankly have

00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:46,850
an invested and haven't spent the time

00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,520
so we started in January of this year

00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:51,980
investing and spending the time we have

00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:55,370
a couple of distributions one of them is

00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:57,950
certified huawei in the area and mope

00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:59,179
has is another distribution that we have

00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:02,720
there and they've been running for

00:22:59,179 --> 00:23:04,640
several years but we have a long way to

00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,809
go to really invest in build an

00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,400
ecosystem because I think Matt really

00:23:05,809 --> 00:23:09,860
hit on the point is having the diversity

00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:11,179
in the breadth and so we're going to

00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:14,150
spend a lot of time in China this year

00:23:11,179 --> 00:23:16,190
in Alibaba cloud is a great way to kick

00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:17,360
that off for this year because you know

00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:19,549
to their point that they are the leading

00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:23,450
public cloud offering in in China and

00:23:19,549 --> 00:23:24,710
are doing phenomenal things and we're

00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:26,780
going to spend a lot more time there and

00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:27,799
I'm gonna be talking about it which for

00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,630
the Navy you they've spent more than

00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:32,530
five minutes with me I've talked about

00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:35,530
China I've been there I've been there

00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:39,919
why didn't you spend time there before

00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:43,850
we have a very very small team we have a

00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:45,919
team of about twelve people and it's we

00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:48,290
spend a lot of time trying to spend time

00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:53,600
with our users the community and other

00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:56,090
projects but you know we and so I want

00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:58,309
to be very thoughtful about when we go

00:23:56,090 --> 00:24:01,280
and invest in regions China is a very

00:23:58,309 --> 00:24:02,720
big region and really requires the

00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:05,120
thought in the investment behind it in

00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,710
order to be effective and we want to

00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,169
make sure that when we're doing that we

00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:12,140
can be intentional and thoughtful and

00:24:09,169 --> 00:24:15,140
and not overextend ourselves but also

00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:17,270
really continue to expand the brand of

00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:18,940
Cloud Foundry and bring is rich of an

00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:21,320
ecosystem around as we possibly can

00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:23,150
totally what's going to say something

00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:26,270
about the Google cloud in China that I

00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:29,030
know okay we can speak about kubernetes

00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:31,640
in China yes yes absolutely so from the

00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:34,070
furry first days of companies right so

00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:36,679
we have a wall we are actually a large

00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:38,799
queue jitter in kubernetes and we have a

00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:42,740
large community we have a lot of meetups

00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:44,660
and many users and cube con it's gonna

00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:46,640
be in Shanghai as well this year so it's

00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:50,419
gonna be a big event I think I don't

00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:51,480
September October to celebrate

00:24:50,419 --> 00:24:56,279
kubernetes

00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:57,500
in that region to celebrate yes should

00:24:56,279 --> 00:24:59,519
always be fun

00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:01,320
that's what this summit is about it's

00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:03,299
all about fun that's so I think there's

00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:07,380
beer later on so should be there is beer

00:25:03,299 --> 00:25:09,529
later on this coffee backstage to wrap

00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:13,309
it up we've got about a minute left just

00:25:09,529 --> 00:25:16,950
everybody on the panel what is it that

00:25:13,309 --> 00:25:20,070
Cloud Foundry could do better for you a

00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:24,029
be your last Matthew kind of already

00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:27,929
told us is there anything else in

00:25:24,029 --> 00:25:28,740
general wow you've got everybody here

00:25:27,929 --> 00:25:32,970
yeah

00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:34,919
the pressures on right I think for me I

00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:37,590
think it's gonna be interesting unity of

00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:39,330
cloud foundry and kubernetes and I think

00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:42,809
you know from an enterprise perspective

00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:45,750
it seems like we need both or both are

00:25:42,809 --> 00:25:48,409
useful and so it and it and it feels

00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:51,299
like kubernetes is taking on a more plat

00:25:48,409 --> 00:25:53,429
platforming nature as it evolves and

00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:55,760
more focused towards developer

00:25:53,429 --> 00:25:59,220
experience as it evolved just awesome

00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:00,630
and so it's gonna be an open question as

00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:02,789
to like how do those things come

00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:04,649
together I think we're in the early

00:26:02,789 --> 00:26:08,070
stages of trying to figure out what that

00:26:04,649 --> 00:26:10,200
looks like but you know I'm really

00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:12,510
excited to see those things come

00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:14,899
together so whatever we can do to

00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:18,750
accelerate that I think is a good thing

00:26:14,899 --> 00:26:19,889
in terms of community I I guess that's

00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:22,500
what I would say outside of what I've

00:26:19,889 --> 00:26:26,549
kind of already said I guess what I

00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:28,799
would say is I'm gonna put a put in a

00:26:26,549 --> 00:26:31,320
plug for security at Cloud Foundry org

00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:33,870
it's an email address where you can send

00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:37,860
any of your concerns about security

00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:39,809
related to Cloud Foundry I would hope

00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:41,639
that everyone who's part of the

00:26:39,809 --> 00:26:44,250
community if they see something that

00:26:41,639 --> 00:26:46,830
they say something because that's the

00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:49,320
main way that we hear about things that

00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:51,539
we need to improve in the platform so if

00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:53,760
you have an idea if you have a problem

00:26:51,539 --> 00:26:55,740
if you have something that you know your

00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:58,919
bosses want you to do with Cloud Foundry

00:26:55,740 --> 00:27:03,290
like we'd love to hear from you security

00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:05,540
of cloud foundry org for me I will echo

00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:08,030
that's definitely developer experience

00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:11,990
has been one of the hot topics in every

00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:14,140
cube con the last two at least and but

00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:16,340
there are different principles right so

00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:19,040
co-founder is more of a vineyard

00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:21,350
platform while Cubase is giving you more

00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:22,340
freedom of choice and I think was very

00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:24,350
interesting to really learn from the

00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:27,140
experience and understand what we can

00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:28,880
plug and play into kubernetes because as

00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:30,830
I said before there is a trade-off and

00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,970
sometimes people want to choose but you

00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:34,820
would like to choose from someone with

00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:41,000
that has experience sure and proven best

00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:45,050
practices oh yeah I over time it doesn't

00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:48,740
yes they'll let me talk for a limb

00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:50,570
that's why I I always think we can

00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:52,460
continuously improve and I think there

00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:54,380
that's the name of the game and we're

00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:57,890
intact so continuous improvement is

00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:59,330
necessary so I really highlighted this

00:27:57,890 --> 00:28:00,530
in my keynote but there's something

00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:03,590
that's really important to me is

00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:05,030
improving the ecosystem and improving

00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:06,590
the interoperability and building that

00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:08,180
connective tissue because I do think

00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:09,830
both of those things are equally

00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:13,310
important to what cloud foundry

00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:13,990
continues to evolve into that's a good

00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:16,750
answer

00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:18,800
it's like you've thought about this

00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:21,290
alright thanks everybody

00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:24,100
thank you let's go and celebrate the

00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:24,100
pivotal IPO

00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:29,330
