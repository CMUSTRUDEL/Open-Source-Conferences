Description: 
	Submitting Your Project to CF-Extensions: Process, Lessons, Pipeline - Michael Maximilien, IBM

 After a year of opening up CF for Extensions and experimentations. Where are we? What have we learned? And howâ€™s the new Extensions ecosystem doing? I will answer these questions and also give tips and advices on how to bring your own project into the Extensions ecosystem, covering all aspects of the process using a few recent examples as guides.

all right we're gonna go ahead and start

00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:06,930
this is the experiments and extensions

00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:09,179
track it is going to show a lot of great

00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:12,870
innovative development in and around

00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:15,089
cloud foundry and you know thankful for

00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,980
everyone who submitted there was a lot

00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:18,660
of great ideas presented unfortunately

00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,210
we could only take less than 10% of

00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,920
those submissions but it represents the

00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:25,830
richness of the activity that is

00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:28,529
happening around cloud foundry and to

00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:30,570
start it off we have dr. max who's going

00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:36,510
to present actually how you get yourself

00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:41,309
into this whole process you're good to

00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:44,640
go on the back almost okay all right so

00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:52,379
we can start dancing attracting more

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:55,260
people I'm gonna try me make it fun and

00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:57,590
fast and hopefully get some time for

00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,590
questions

00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:09,580
all right so the first thing I want to

00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:14,080
do is I don't know if some of you were

00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:17,260
in the keynote but there were a couple

00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:19,330
presentations and demos and I'm gonna do

00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:20,770
a similar demo so if you were in the

00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:23,440
keynote it's gonna be a little bit of

00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:29,530
the same but bear with me for a minute

00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:33,100
okay so say you have a cool extension to

00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:36,009
SIA and you happen to be at Sousa I have

00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:38,950
my nice Susa shirt here so I'll pretend

00:01:36,009 --> 00:01:42,160
to be a social engineer and then show

00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:49,090
you guys what they've done because it's

00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:52,149
so cool so the good folks there created

00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:56,259
this application

00:01:52,149 --> 00:01:57,850
it's called Stratus and it allows you to

00:01:56,259 --> 00:01:59,440
essentially browse Cloud Foundry and so

00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:04,509
on so let's try to use it so you get a

00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:08,140
feel for what it is ok so I got an

00:02:04,509 --> 00:02:10,929
account I think Neil from Bristol in

00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:13,360
England give me access to it so I'm

00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:15,430
logging in of course

00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,620
what it does is like most of these

00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:19,360
console type of application connects to

00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:21,130
cloud foundry so but what's cool is you

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,600
can actually connect to many co-founder

00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:24,850
and that's what's really powerful about

00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:27,040
it so I'll just show you that to the

00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:29,320
extent of you know making the demo more

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:34,000
fun so I'm gonna register an endpoint

00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:41,430
I'm gonna register the IBM end point so

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:45,540
it's HTTP API that ng that bluemix.net

00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:49,900
and call it IBM Cloud

00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:53,950
let's keep SSL and once you register at

00:02:49,900 --> 00:03:01,200
the endpoint you can actually connect so

00:02:53,950 --> 00:03:01,200
I'm gonna use my user ID and

00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:08,840
it actually what's cool about Stratos is

00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:12,049
not only you connect to different end

00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:13,819
points but you can see the various

00:03:12,049 --> 00:03:16,069
different application and orgs and

00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:19,609
spaces and so on that you have alright

00:03:16,069 --> 00:03:24,500
so you can see here I'm looking at the

00:03:19,609 --> 00:03:26,540
IBM app and it takes a few minutes to

00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:31,609
kind of like gather all the stuffs but

00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:35,359
it's gonna pick my space and then you

00:03:31,609 --> 00:03:37,609
can see the difference well the user the

00:03:35,359 --> 00:03:40,909
spaces and so on and it basically gives

00:03:37,609 --> 00:03:42,200
you this unified view of the different

00:03:40,909 --> 00:03:44,510
cloud foundry that you have and it

00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,700
actually combines them too which is

00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:50,629
really cool but I'll show you that you

00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:53,450
know adding an app is actually pretty

00:03:50,629 --> 00:03:55,220
straightforward so if you go to

00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:58,430
applications you can just say add

00:03:55,220 --> 00:04:03,920
applications to make this fair I I

00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:07,870
picked Swiss come has a go app that I

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:14,620
downloaded so I can just go and add that

00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:19,810
and and it tells you how to deploy it

00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:19,810
right everything so

00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:26,199
in addition to this you can see your log

00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:29,430
streams service instances and so on

00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:32,889
now the the guys at Sousa already

00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:35,139
connected to a endpoint on their side so

00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:36,850
there are applications you can see this

00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:38,530
application I just created is incomplete

00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:40,150
but they have an application that's

00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:42,550
already deployed so we can look at the

00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:46,870
log streams and this is all life right

00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:50,139
so these guys had Susa created this

00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:52,180
really cool thing and before extensions

00:04:50,139 --> 00:04:55,479
there was no very there was no clear way

00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:58,020
to get this in so the question is how do

00:04:55,479 --> 00:04:59,770
you take this and move it forward right

00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:02,050
and that's what we're going to talk

00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:04,419
about but I want to kind of show you

00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:07,389
more about this they even have a way for

00:05:04,419 --> 00:05:10,830
you to connect to SSH get events so you

00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:13,330
can see where things are

00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:16,300
but what's best is that it's skinnable

00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:20,949
too so you can actually have there's a

00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:27,190
different version that has the Cloud

00:05:20,949 --> 00:05:29,770
Foundry UI or at least skinned so that

00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:31,060
now it looks more like a foundry so part

00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:34,090
of the idea is you can actually take

00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:36,729
this and make it into your own so in

00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:39,250
your organization oh and by the way I

00:05:36,729 --> 00:05:41,139
tried this on my phone and it works on

00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:43,180
the iPad it also works so it's it's

00:05:41,139 --> 00:05:44,889
capable for this so back to the

00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:48,130
presentation so this is an example so

00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:54,400
you have this cool app that you created

00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:57,340
and the question is you know how do you

00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,930
get it into cff right into of course

00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:00,759
users hands so you can give you feedback

00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:02,949
and make it more interesting so what

00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:05,740
this is what this talk is about right so

00:06:02,949 --> 00:06:10,599
let's look at kind of what I want to

00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:14,110
cover first is the mission and the

00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:16,659
process because obviously we don't want

00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:19,620
to allow anything in but we want to make

00:06:16,659 --> 00:06:23,370
sure that it's open to anything so that

00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:25,599
what comes in actually follows a process

00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:29,279
I'll talk about some of the initial

00:06:25,599 --> 00:06:32,169
projects and then talk about some

00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:34,420
current projects that we want to

00:06:32,169 --> 00:06:36,820
highlight one of which I already did we

00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:38,680
strattice and then I'll show you guys

00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:42,010
where you can access those projects have

00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:44,080
a quick information about the status of

00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:47,980
those projects and what you can do into

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:53,080
one and then I'll call to action okay so

00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:55,420
the mission is I guess maybe you're the

00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:57,220
first question to you guys is how long

00:06:55,420 --> 00:07:00,520
have you been with Cloud Foundry so who

00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:05,290
here was using cloud foundry four years

00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:07,720
ago okay all right so if you ask these

00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:10,150
three people so I'm assuming everybody

00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:13,870
is after those two years

00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:16,260
it wasn't easy it was tightly controlled

00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:17,980
by a few companies and it wasn't

00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:19,330
straightforward on how you could

00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:21,430
actually contribute something and be

00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:22,960
part of the organization and so on so

00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:25,720
part of what we did an extension is to

00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:28,210
fix this but also fix it in a way that

00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:31,840
allows those extensions to become you

00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:35,410
know important so it's the place for all

00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:38,530
things that are SIA but not necessarily

00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:42,370
in runtime or bosh and I mean this by

00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:44,380
you're not trying to add a or replace a

00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:45,580
component and runtime or Bosch but

00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:48,580
you're trying to extend it and

00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:51,190
eventually it could become a component

00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:54,730
into Bosch or the runtime so this is the

00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:57,100
key right so this is your way to without

00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:58,840
having to be part of runtime or Bosch or

00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:01,600
trying to change it and convince the

00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:03,820
team that already is running those to

00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:06,280
add an extension and then eventually

00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:08,500
that extension could be coming to just

00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:12,130
an extension or part of the runtime so

00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:14,290
of course the Stratus UI it's a UI so it

00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:16,180
will not be replacing anything because

00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:18,370
there's nothing to replace there's no

00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:20,320
real UI right now for Cloud Foundry so

00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:22,060
it's gonna stay as an extension but if

00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,740
you were with if you were extending a

00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:25,830
component that could actually replace a

00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:28,410
core component then you would come here

00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:31,030
in what's the goal

00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:33,760
essentially simple make it the most

00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:35,440
extensible the most open platform and if

00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,870
we had done this two years ago I

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,600
guarantee you we would probably have a

00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:44,140
lot more a lot more people involved so

00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:46,810
so what are under the bridge but it's

00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:47,800
it's fair to mention it so what's the

00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:51,070
process

00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:54,100
it's pretty straightforward right now

00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:55,899
I'm kind of the gatekeeper for it of the

00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:58,240
process but as we add more and more

00:08:55,899 --> 00:09:00,370
extensions then people that are part of

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,920
the extension participate as part of the

00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:05,470
process it's completely open process

00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:07,839
okay so let's go over it very quickly so

00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:10,720
it's open to all as I mentioned we have

00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:12,610
a template which I'll show you that you

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,950
kind of have to follow just so that

00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:18,160
people don't send me like a 10-page

00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:21,160
proposal and it doesn't have access to

00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,930
the code or ways for me to try it and

00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:25,990
things like that right so we follow a

00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:30,610
template there are four stages which

00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:33,550
we'll cover and I think this is the most

00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:36,190
important part you can move as fast or

00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:38,019
as slow as you as you want now fast

00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:39,970
doesn't mean like you submit a proposal

00:09:38,019 --> 00:09:42,610
today and then get it to more so there

00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:45,220
is some level of you know what I mean by

00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:46,690
fast or slow there's some bounce but

00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:50,950
what I mean is you could submit it and

00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:53,079
say I'm ready I got all my stuff and I

00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:54,640
want to move like within two weeks and

00:09:53,079 --> 00:09:58,300
we'll make it happen

00:09:54,640 --> 00:10:00,310
but if you say I'm ready but I want

00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:01,990
feedback and this is kind of a new

00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:04,360
project it's more of an experiment I

00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:06,550
need more time and I need maybe a month

00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:08,649
that's okay too you need three months

00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:12,430
that's also okay so the point here is to

00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:14,770
make it so that you guide the community

00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:18,160
and myself on how fast or slow you want

00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:20,670
to move with some reasonable bound okay

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:23,170
and I'll give you some examples of these

00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:27,760
so this is the process and then we'll go

00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:29,230
and look at the the pages so you come so

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,480
what we've been doing so this process

00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:32,890
itself is also under review so you can

00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,839
give feedback to it and I'll show you

00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:36,850
how you can do that but the idea is that

00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:39,339
you come so I'll give you a clear

00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:41,500
example Stratos was a great example last

00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:43,000
year and you saw it and it's King

00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,930
bookstore now I mean tons of people

00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,510
using it already

00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:50,170
I know IBM for instance is already

00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:53,320
contributing to Stratos but with with

00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:56,500
this process Stephen Irvine who showed

00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:58,449
CF dev today he approached me I mean

00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:00,870
I've been working with him before but he

00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:03,120
approached us maybe

00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:07,370
a month ago saying hey I've got this

00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:09,900
update to CF local called CF death and I

00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:12,150
want to try to make sure that it happens

00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:14,520
before this summit and of course chip

00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:17,550
was also very excited so you know lots

00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:20,930
of things so what we did is got the

00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:24,620
proposal in I looked at what they had I

00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:27,480
act as a gatekeeper but everybody and

00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:29,880
PMC can also kind of be a gatekeeper

00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:32,370
meaning they can look at what is being

00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:35,580
proposed before we actually go to the

00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:38,850
process you fill in the template he sent

00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:41,850
it to me and then we review the code

00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:43,680
review what the project is trying to do

00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:46,650
make sure it's not duplicating effort

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:49,920
make sure that it's also not a place

00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:53,340
that you're just gonna dump code I was

00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:56,130
talking to rob me and he told me CF is

00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:57,810
very rich and could and I think to agree

00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:59,070
with them right we're not trying to be

00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:01,410
the place where you can just take your

00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:03,870
code that you can't use and just dump it

00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:06,060
but if you have a team behind it you

00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:08,430
have something interesting then you come

00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:10,320
and you propose it then it goes to a

00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:12,060
process where we're trying to get

00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,820
feedback right we're trying to be open

00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:17,130
to the community allow anybody to give

00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:20,130
feedback your comments and as part of

00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:21,960
this what I try to do is to encourage

00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:24,150
the community to participate and give

00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:26,310
feedback and part of the idea is that

00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:29,010
all feedback everything that's on the

00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:30,420
document needs to be addressed before we

00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:32,340
can accept to move to the next phase

00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:34,650
that's why you can move fast but you

00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:36,360
also have to address feedback so in a

00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:37,740
case of Savannah Vine for instance he

00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,930
didn't have a lot of feedback there were

00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:41,940
a few for me and then there were a few

00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:45,450
maybe one or two from the community I

00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:48,480
think dr. Nick gave some feedback and I

00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:51,270
think on Monday he sent me an email and

00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:55,080
Scott part of the team saying hey I want

00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:57,690
to try to move to a vote so usually what

00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:59,280
I do from there is to give a deadline to

00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:02,040
the community for the final chance for

00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:03,630
feedback and we did that to give the

00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:06,900
final chance for feedback for the cab

00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:11,720
call that we had yesterday and there was

00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:11,720
no other feedback so we move for a vote

00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:16,490
everything is in yoga there is nothing

00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:21,380
close the only thing that's not even

00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:24,020
close but that is kind of just myself

00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:26,780
and the team is when you initially think

00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:28,820
I have an idea I think I want to submit

00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:30,200
it could you take a look at it so that

00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:32,660
one I don't invite everybody to

00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:34,100
participate just because maybe you have

00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:35,930
an idea and you didn't you're not sure

00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:37,670
and you want to show it and it turns out

00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:39,050
that it's not gonna be something that

00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:41,690
fits you don't want to keep it outside

00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:44,000
so that gives you an opportunity to chat

00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:46,640
with me without necessarily having it

00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,770
and of course if I need a second opinion

00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:50,150
then I can invite somebody from the PMC

00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:52,190
to give a second opinion so that's a

00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:54,470
little bit private but not super private

00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:56,920
then everything else is in the open so a

00:13:54,470 --> 00:14:01,160
meaning you have to have slack channel

00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:05,060
and in the PM sequels and PMC calls all

00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:07,340
open to all so once Steven asked me I

00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:09,620
want to make I want to have a vote then

00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:14,090
we do a private thing in private in the

00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:17,480
sense that I issue a email to all the

00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:21,440
PMC leads so for instance Jules is part

00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:24,230
of it and ask for vote and the way we

00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:27,230
vote there's a lot of questions about

00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:29,450
what these days in the US so this is a

00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:32,810
much simpler vote there's no way for

00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:34,510
anybody including washes to hack accept

00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:38,690
Dimitri is an exception he's actually

00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:42,650
he's actually part of the vote but he's

00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:44,180
well vetted he is super well vetted so I

00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:47,840
wouldn't worry about him he's actually

00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:51,340
American now too so so we asked

00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:56,000
everybody to vote plus one minus one

00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:58,190
with an optional comment and the reason

00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,410
I asked for the comment is because like

00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:02,180
Princeton Jews woulded plus one like

00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:05,930
with I don't know what you said but like

00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:07,430
really super happy with CF dev right and

00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:09,470
I think those are important just because

00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:11,960
you kind of want to see where people

00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:13,880
excited when Stratos came in I made a

00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:16,640
comment because I really liked Stratos a

00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:19,010
lot so I mentioned how much I liked it

00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:21,950
but I also don't want to influence other

00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:23,750
people's to vote so you know the idea is

00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:24,710
to let everybody vote and we give a

00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:27,140
deadline of that

00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:30,440
so yesterday was from I think around

00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:35,690
noon to midnight so it was very fast and

00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:40,130
if you don't vote that counts as a no

00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:43,339
vote but it's not gonna impact the tally

00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:45,320
so the way we accept or not accept is to

00:15:43,339 --> 00:15:48,080
have a majority so if we have a majority

00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:50,899
of yes foot then that means it's in if

00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:55,250
you don't get in then of course you can

00:15:50,899 --> 00:15:58,399
try again ok so completely open and from

00:15:55,250 --> 00:16:01,339
that point Chris just walked in he

00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:04,540
actually participates and helping me get

00:16:01,339 --> 00:16:07,339
you into the cloud foundry so yesterday

00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:10,880
for midnight we accepted the vote and

00:16:07,339 --> 00:16:14,050
this morning I guess Chris and the team

00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:16,490
at the cff created a cough and Ryoga

00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:18,560
project under the cap and rank a video

00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:21,560
project for for Steve and his team and

00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:24,470
they already pushed that code so now you

00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:26,360
can go to Cloud Foundry incubator and

00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:28,940
find it so with that let me show you a

00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:31,040
little bit of this process I guess the

00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:33,650
different things that you need to do

00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:36,440
so first let's let's see we're a CF dev

00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:42,640
is I guess they said that foundry

00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:45,820
incubator let's see how fast Google can

00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,820
see you up there

00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
No

00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:59,110
so yeah or maybe one word there you go

00:16:56,590 --> 00:17:02,320
so you can see they already push that

00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:06,580
code and it's all there for you guys to

00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:09,060
try and that's the same eye same idea

00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:12,310
and if you're coming from a non pivotal

00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:14,140
project so Stephen is one pivotal so he

00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:15,820
probably already has tracker and so and

00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:17,560
so he probably doesn't need that but if

00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:19,870
you're coming from another organization

00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:21,790
and you want to use tracker will set up

00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:23,740
a tracker for you as well we'll work

00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:25,660
with you and so on so for instance

00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:28,540
there's a team from sa P that's going to

00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:33,010
this process so we create tracker for

00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:38,020
them and so on so as I mentioned this is

00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:40,570
the process I own purpose kept it to two

00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:42,730
page so I'm working very hard to not

00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:45,300
have more than two page so even this is

00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:48,460
gonna be I'm gonna try to move it up and

00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:51,700
you can just go ahead and read kind of

00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:54,250
officially some of the bylaws and of

00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:56,080
course you can comment on it and then

00:17:54,250 --> 00:18:02,010
the last thing I want to show you and

00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:07,570
then we'll go back to the slides is is I

00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:11,440
guess I can go here is the the template

00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:14,200
so there is a template and you'll see

00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:16,810
it's super straightforward right so we

00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:18,760
need a title summary what's the problem

00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:20,550
you're trying to solve solution to

00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:23,580
project lead an initial committers

00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:26,740
assumptions goes in tie goals and

00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:28,540
considerations and part of the reason to

00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:30,400
follow this is so that you don't go

00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:32,230
gangbuster and send me like a 10-page

00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,270
thing nobody's gonna read it alright so

00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:37,570
you need that and usually what I try to

00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:40,690
do when I work with the team at the

00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:42,280
initial phase is to also see the kind of

00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:44,080
things like make sure that there's no

00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:46,300
overlap to other projects if there is

00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:49,780
make sure you talk to those people if

00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:51,070
there's a need for a diagram at that if

00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:53,410
there's a need for a little bit more

00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:54,970
clarification at it I think the other

00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:58,150
thing I'm trying to do also is to make

00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:59,560
sure that you're not not only dumping

00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:01,870
but you have a team behind you

00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:05,360
so I'll give you a good example of this

00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:09,620
recently we've accepted the sequel the

00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:12,020
MS sequel bokor as a proposed extension

00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:16,700
and it's gone is gonna go to a vote next

00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:19,280
week actually and pivotal have created

00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:21,890
that Booker but Microsoft is gonna

00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:24,860
actually maintain it makes sense because

00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:26,180
MS sequel is a Microsoft product but

00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:27,650
that's actually how it's gonna work out

00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:29,300
so I was a bit worried about this

00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:31,100
initially because the Microsoft

00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:33,830
committees were in there so now they are

00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:36,140
added and you know to some extent I have

00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:38,810
verbal or email commitment from them

00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:41,840
that they will be maintaining this

00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:43,640
project so keep that in mind right so

00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,620
when you submit don't just come and say

00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:47,720
oh I have a project to submit you you

00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:50,660
also have to have a team and participate

00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:53,630
okay so let's go back to slides and I'll

00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:55,600
show you kind of the rest of this and

00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:57,710
it's an overview and then we'll close it

00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,630
so what are the initial projects

00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:02,840
obviously we had some extensions before

00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:04,550
we started and those to Escada

00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:06,650
grandfathered in this is dress

00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:09,140
determined and I guess English to say

00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:11,180
that those didn't go through the process

00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:13,160
they were initial projects so one of

00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:16,670
which is the abacus service worker that

00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:20,240
now s AP IB M submitted it but as ap is

00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:23,540
essentially leading this now another one

00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:27,920
is a port of scaling jewels here leads

00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:31,520
it cred up is also one of those projects

00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:35,360
that were initial and as you know now is

00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:37,970
super important to how we deploy CF and

00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:40,760
then multiple bill packs which Steven

00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:41,240
the line leads so since then what have

00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:45,230
we done

00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:48,830
right so we have Kubo or CFC or that

00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:51,050
started with us the backup bosch backup

00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:53,630
we store so that now you can backup and

00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:56,420
restore your entire cloud foundry that's

00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:58,760
part of it the local and dev service

00:20:56,420 --> 00:21:01,280
fabric which is an SI p project and then

00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:03,800
multi apps is another project I want to

00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:06,080
highlight so in Stratis UI which I

00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:09,170
already did so we'll go fast on this so

00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:13,100
kubu for instance is bas-reliefs for

00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:15,480
kubernetes and the two activities right

00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:17,220
so basically everything that you need

00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:21,180
do after you got computers up and

00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:22,470
running you use this and it's it's kind

00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:24,030
of interesting because a lot of people

00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:25,980
say well why are you doing this like

00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:29,310
what was the point of this kubu thing

00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:31,500
and I don't mean to preach to the choir

00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:34,200
but you know that getting a cloud

00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:36,420
project or software in you know

00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:38,430
something in the cloud I mean I think

00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:41,430
anybody can do it and it's pretty

00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:41,820
straightforward and it's like no big

00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:44,630
deal

00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:47,160
the difficult part is keeping it running

00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:48,900
and if you think about time also

00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:51,720
especially if you're gonna make money on

00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:54,510
whatever that thing is that's where the

00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:57,030
cost is so and that's why Bosch helps

00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:59,490
you and why because there are crackers

00:21:57,030 --> 00:22:02,070
everywhere are trying to create a

00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:04,170
vulnerability and hacking into your

00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:06,990
stuff so keeping it secure or keeping it

00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:09,090
running scaling it those are the

00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:11,040
difficult bits and that's what Bosch

00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:14,160
helps you with all right so the devops

00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:16,650
piece of it so that's why we have Kubo

00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:18,570
because it takes kubernetes and says i'm

00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:21,690
gonna deploy it but I'm also gonna allow

00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:24,420
you the way we do it Bosch to keep it

00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:27,630
running to keep it updated and to keep

00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:29,880
it healthy so that's what we're doing

00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:31,350
with canary update welding updates

00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:33,600
everything you can do with Bosch and

00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:36,420
then scale it up and down so Google

00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:40,440
worked with pivotal to do this and it

00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:45,380
became renamed to CFC R so that foundry

00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:47,790
container runtime another one is BB are

00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:50,310
all of these are not necessarily great

00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:52,320
demos like Stratus UI so I'm just gonna

00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:52,500
go through them very quickly I'll show

00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,370
you

00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:59,010
CF local so that's another demo I can do

00:22:55,370 --> 00:23:01,260
so backup and restore or CF so the idea

00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:04,050
is that every single part of your Cloud

00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:06,950
Foundry installation can actually now be

00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:08,820
backed up and restored very quickly and

00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:11,550
companies like stuck and Wayne actually

00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:13,740
extended it to add support for their

00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:15,480
backup and restore so you can integrate

00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:17,160
so now you'll have one way to

00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:21,210
essentially backup and restore your

00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:23,760
entire software and why it's because

00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:27,120
 happens right so you gotta be ready

00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:29,159
for when it happens and you can you can

00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:32,309
orchestrate these backup and restore

00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:33,840
so very important CF local so instead of

00:23:32,309 --> 00:23:37,340
like going through this let's just show

00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:47,190
it to you so CF Loco

00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:48,989
so I'll go like this I downloaded a a CF

00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:56,119
sample app it happens to be like a Swiss

00:23:48,989 --> 00:24:00,509
come up right so I have CF running and

00:23:56,119 --> 00:24:04,379
to get this it is visible even though

00:24:00,509 --> 00:24:12,139
it's transparent okay alright so you can

00:24:04,379 --> 00:24:17,970
see F um I think plugins repo plugins

00:24:12,139 --> 00:24:19,769
there you go and what that's gonna do is

00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:24,479
gonna take all the plugins and if you

00:24:19,769 --> 00:24:26,909
grab for local you'll see that these

00:24:24,479 --> 00:24:28,739
guys have something called CF local so

00:24:26,909 --> 00:24:31,229
you can then from there install the

00:24:28,739 --> 00:24:32,970
plug-in I already did that you do CF

00:24:31,229 --> 00:24:36,720
install plug-in and then you specify

00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:38,989
that plugin it downloads it I think I

00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,989
did

00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:47,639
let's see install plugins here local

00:24:44,849 --> 00:24:49,499
right so that will download it so once

00:24:47,639 --> 00:24:54,899
you have CF local installed there's

00:24:49,499 --> 00:24:59,729
actually not much for you to do so this

00:24:54,899 --> 00:25:03,899
is this is CF local and Stephen has this

00:24:59,729 --> 00:25:05,940
nice little I guess jiff

00:25:03,899 --> 00:25:07,559
that tells you everything so we'll just

00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:10,080
go through that and then you can read to

00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:12,779
it but part of the idea is that and just

00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:15,029
like CF dev he gives you a local

00:25:12,779 --> 00:25:18,359
environment and you can do stuff with it

00:25:15,029 --> 00:25:21,809
right so you do have to install docker

00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:23,159
for CF local in a case of CF dev it's a

00:25:21,809 --> 00:25:25,080
little bit bigger package because it

00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:26,549
sort of includes everything so it's you

00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:29,700
don't have to do that but you need more

00:25:26,549 --> 00:25:31,919
memory so local is a great way for any

00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:33,090
machine that you have old or new to

00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:36,809
essentially do what I'm going to do

00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:41,369
right now so once you have CF local

00:25:36,809 --> 00:25:42,960
installed then so you say CF local

00:25:41,369 --> 00:25:48,300
because it's a plugin so it

00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:50,520
this new command to the CFC Li and you

00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:51,930
can see in there you have tons of

00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:55,860
different things we can do right

00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:58,980
you can stage run export pool push your

00:25:55,860 --> 00:26:01,170
app the case of export and pool is where

00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:03,120
you're gonna essentially export your app

00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:04,350
as a droplet and then you can pick that

00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,870
up and move it somewhere else

00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:10,890
right so in this case I just downloaded

00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:14,550
a sample app from from Swiss come and

00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:17,010
I'm just gonna run it right so well this

00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:20,610
is I've been pretty much I dressed did

00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:23,430
get flown for that we pull and then I

00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:25,080
create a simple manifest but I don't

00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:26,820
even think you need the manifest at this

00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:31,610
point I just doing it so I could push it

00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:35,810
to the IBM cloud and then from there

00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:39,570
quit from there I can just say cf local

00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:41,280
run and then I think I have to give it I

00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:44,090
have to use the same name that the

00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:49,520
manifest is using right so let's say

00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:56,960
manifest so this is the name that I used

00:26:49,520 --> 00:27:01,320
and then I say I guess see ya loco run

00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:04,710
name and then it basically runs it and

00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:12,120
it gives you a port so I can then just

00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:14,310
go here and localhost boom and that's

00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:17,760
the app it's pretty straightforward app

00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:19,440
but I can guarantee you it works with

00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:23,010
tons of apps I've tried it with more

00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:24,900
complex app it works it also even rebind

00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:27,300
your services so if you were connected

00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:29,700
to a service it will rebind that service

00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:31,350
whether you're running on a cloud or

00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:32,970
you're running locally you of course

00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:36,750
have to have your credentials set and so

00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:39,600
on so the point is that this applicate

00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:43,260
this this extension alone I think is

00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:44,940
saving tons of time for developers to

00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:49,200
get their app up and running very

00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:51,240
quickly the same way you did docker apps

00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,710
and why people love docker apps now one

00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:57,090
thing you didn't see because I already

00:27:52,710 --> 00:28:00,179
ran it the first time you run CF local

00:27:57,090 --> 00:28:01,859
on an app it actually goes and creates a

00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:04,080
docker image for you so it's actually

00:28:01,859 --> 00:28:06,059
going to the whole process of setting it

00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,919
up and we'd see if dev is a little bit

00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:11,580
different but that's part of the idea so

00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:14,039
it completely removes the need for you

00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:15,960
to have a official CF but keeps

00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:18,330
everything locally so that you can do

00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:21,419
very very quick rapid iterations and

00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:24,139
then move it eventually to the cloud so

00:28:21,419 --> 00:28:27,299
this is a great example of a tool an

00:28:24,139 --> 00:28:30,029
extension to CF CLI but also a great

00:28:27,299 --> 00:28:33,269
user experience to Cloud Foundry right

00:28:30,029 --> 00:28:35,580
in general so if you see Steven I would

00:28:33,269 --> 00:28:37,289
say give him a pat on the back or better

00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:39,749
buy him a beer or something I don't know

00:28:37,289 --> 00:28:41,129
a few tricks PA but maybe right because

00:28:39,749 --> 00:28:45,049
I think I think it's a great great

00:28:41,129 --> 00:28:47,879
addition especially now we see up there

00:28:45,049 --> 00:28:51,269
so a couple more things I want to talk

00:28:47,879 --> 00:28:54,570
about service fabric is an example that

00:28:51,269 --> 00:28:56,909
s AP submitted part of the idea of

00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:59,249
service fabric is you got tons of

00:28:56,909 --> 00:29:01,440
services I know at IBM we have hundreds

00:28:59,249 --> 00:29:04,350
how do you manage them how do you keep

00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,210
them I guess you know the brokers for

00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:10,220
them if you wanted the worker to be in

00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:12,539
different aisles or even in kubernetes

00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:15,149
what's the experience like right so I

00:29:12,539 --> 00:29:17,999
think it's sort of one environment for

00:29:15,149 --> 00:29:20,850
you to deploy backup and restore upgrade

00:29:17,999 --> 00:29:23,190
and do the lifecycle management of

00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:25,679
services and you'll see this actually is

00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:27,779
a common theme around s AP they've

00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:30,509
submitted Service Worker but it's also

00:29:27,779 --> 00:29:32,279
submitted multi apps and it's kind of

00:29:30,509 --> 00:29:35,879
the same thing but instead of services

00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:38,519
for applications so a single app

00:29:35,879 --> 00:29:41,639
obviously like I just showed you is a

00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:44,909
little toy but most app most people

00:29:41,639 --> 00:29:46,830
using CF or using it seriously they'll

00:29:44,909 --> 00:29:48,779
have multiple apps so when you have

00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:50,909
multiple apps how do you deal with it

00:29:48,779 --> 00:29:52,739
right right now you can kind of deploy

00:29:50,909 --> 00:29:54,840
these different pieces to get by

00:29:52,739 --> 00:29:57,179
themselves but you want to usually have

00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:58,889
something much much better right so

00:29:57,179 --> 00:30:02,700
that's what these guys have done they've

00:29:58,889 --> 00:30:06,299
added a way for you to do a better

00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:08,730
composed lifecycle for multiple apps I

00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:10,050
like to look at it as together as one

00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:12,540
right and

00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:14,730
it's one llamo so it's a lot more llamo

00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:17,340
than you had to deal before but

00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:21,030
obviously it's solving a problem for you

00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:22,770
right and I think for micro services in

00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:24,800
particularly and this is one feedback

00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:27,840
that I've given them is to try to

00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:30,210
integrate with CF networking and order

00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:32,700
components so that it works much much

00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:34,170
better for micro services so multi apps

00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:37,410
is another one you should take a look at

00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:41,430
and then finally Stratus UI that I

00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:47,160
showed you guys and to finish this let's

00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:51,320
do a quick back to the demo I think I

00:30:47,160 --> 00:31:00,060
tried this but let's let's do it live so

00:30:51,320 --> 00:31:02,070
on this instance right I had the IBM so

00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:04,290
I basically created the app but I didn't

00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:07,110
push it yet so why don't why don't we

00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:09,570
try to push it so he said incomplete

00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:14,040
right and you can see this is a view of

00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:15,930
this app on IBM's cloud but it's not

00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:19,590
running yet so maybe we could try to run

00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:21,240
it so I can just go here and now it's

00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:23,760
running on CF local so imagine I made

00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:27,720
this really cool app I was ready to push

00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:31,830
it I think I'm already targeted to the

00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:40,560
IBM cloud and I'm logged in and I think

00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:44,220
I've already also targeted to my so if

00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:48,270
we go back here for a second this is the

00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:52,250
app and we need to basically push it so

00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:57,660
I'm gonna try to push it so CF push

00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:59,760
let's just come up and what's cool is

00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:02,160
I'm gonna go back to the slide when we

00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:06,570
get back it should hopefully be showing

00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:09,450
a new UI and this is a complete UI as I

00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:12,300
was saying before for multiple

00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:14,610
environments and we can keep adding to

00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:20,720
it so that's kind of cool

00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:20,720
so very quickly and I'll finish up is

00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:29,310
what's the call to action right so I

00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:32,160
suggest you go back to your offices and

00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:33,600
you say what school project what a cool

00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:36,390
project that I have that I want to

00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:40,980
include into CF right make sure you have

00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:44,250
a team obviously ping me on slack let's

00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:47,700
chat and we'll follow the process right

00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:50,370
and respond to comments and requests for

00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:53,220
a vote which as I mentioned Stephen did

00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:55,290
in two weeks so it's probably the

00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:58,080
fastest we've gotten a project and

00:32:55,290 --> 00:33:01,020
Stratos was the fastest before but maybe

00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:02,580
this one is the second fastest and then

00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:05,280
we will move your code to Cloud Foundry

00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:06,930
incubator and participate in monthly

00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:09,390
meetings and this is important all right

00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:12,900
we do have monthly meetings so very

00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:16,110
quickly let me show you this thing is

00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:20,580
still running so that's good so there is

00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:26,240
something called PMC notes where all the

00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:29,400
PMC's are pretty much keeping their

00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:35,700
notes and if you go there you'll see in

00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:40,080
2018 we have we skip march because I was

00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:42,480
on vacation it well so I could have

00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:45,810
tried to keep it but I had planned my

00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:48,480
vacation so anyway but you see detailed

00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:51,060
notes about what's going on Jews has

00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:53,460
promised me that for future one he will

00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:56,700
send me some updates and you don't have

00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:58,530
to as a once you're in a PMC the

00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:01,950
requirement for you to stay there is for

00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:03,870
you to submit those drumbeats you don't

00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:06,000
have to call in but I just need an email

00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:07,530
from you with the drum beat so oh how

00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,660
that I just wanted to show you that

00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:13,260
there is a community behind this okay

00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:15,960
all right oh look it's running so we can

00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:18,780
go to the UI and we should be able to

00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:21,480
see that it's running and I'll and I'll

00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:23,429
finish up so you can see now it's

00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:31,100
refreshing so this thing is gonna go to

00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:31,100
green hopefully soon let's see updated

00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:34,660
No

00:34:38,909 --> 00:34:45,289
there we go should be up and running

00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:45,289
still incomplete

00:34:49,529 --> 00:34:58,319
one in one started okay so maybe I'm

00:34:54,329 --> 00:35:02,730
finding a little bug here but this is

00:34:58,319 --> 00:35:06,299
what happens live man it will refresh

00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:09,569
I've tried this before it should go back

00:35:06,299 --> 00:35:10,710
to being green hey here it is so it

00:35:09,569 --> 00:35:14,760
takes a little bit of time I mean it's

00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:15,869
actually this is a su se UI I mean

00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:18,150
obviously it's open source now

00:35:15,869 --> 00:35:19,619
connecting to IBM and also connected to

00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:22,140
Susan and you can connect it to as many

00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:24,839
things and you can actually see all the

00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:27,539
details behind it it will pull up your

00:35:24,839 --> 00:35:30,210
stream you can even do the SSH into the

00:35:27,539 --> 00:35:31,380
app okay so this is fantastic extension

00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:31,890
I tell you this right now I'll just go

00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:36,359
try it

00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:40,710
alright so let me close so what's the

00:35:36,359 --> 00:35:42,329
philosophy behind what we try to do as I

00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:46,289
mentioned too if you were in part of top

00:35:42,329 --> 00:35:49,880
100 years ago this is like night and day

00:35:46,289 --> 00:35:52,200
right so what what are we trying to do

00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:57,329
it's a simple thing and I'll close with

00:35:52,200 --> 00:36:01,440
that I think this is it it's let a

00:35:57,329 --> 00:36:04,319
thousand flowers bloom I really really

00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:06,779
really believe that everybody here is

00:36:04,319 --> 00:36:07,980
smart but somebody smarter than us and

00:36:06,779 --> 00:36:10,950
it's not in this one

00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:13,380
so we need those smart people to

00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:16,829
participate that's it because that's the

00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:19,460
only way we're gonna achieve together

00:36:16,829 --> 00:36:23,670
right to make CF the best that it can be

00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:25,230
so with that I'll stop thank you and see

00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:28,770
if you have maybe one question I don't

00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:33,500
know if we have enough time one minute

00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:33,500
so maybe I'll take one question yes

00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:41,989
couldn't hear your question sorry so

00:36:39,589 --> 00:36:44,920
Jules you wanna come I'm just wondering

00:36:41,989 --> 00:36:48,289
how many proposals or ideas do you get

00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:50,059
like every month yeah so it's

00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:55,069
interesting so it's not necessarily a

00:36:50,059 --> 00:36:56,509
monthly thing sometimes I get like you

00:36:55,069 --> 00:36:58,130
know like two or three proposals

00:36:56,509 --> 00:37:01,279
immediately like so for instance after

00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:02,960
summit last time the Susi guys were

00:37:01,279 --> 00:37:05,390
really fantastic they had tons of idea

00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:08,630
orange had ideas so you they come in

00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:09,950
bunches but we do have a pipeline which

00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:11,839
I didn't get a chance to show you but I

00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:14,089
have actually an app that actually keeps

00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:16,190
track of a pipeline it's called CF

00:37:14,089 --> 00:37:19,670
extensions you can go there and see it

00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:22,759
and you can see what's coming I would

00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:25,130
say we have about seven also but as I

00:37:22,759 --> 00:37:27,579
mentioned at the beginning you can go as

00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:30,319
fast or as slow as you want so sometimes

00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:31,910
you get people that's submitted and it's

00:37:30,319 --> 00:37:34,670
been submitted for almost six months

00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:39,259
so that's kind of the track so what I

00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:41,839
ask you everybody is to ping me no idea

00:37:39,259 --> 00:37:43,549
small or big is I mean it's big or small

00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:44,809
enough if you have an idea it's

00:37:43,549 --> 00:37:48,079
interesting you think it's interesting

00:37:44,809 --> 00:37:49,640
to you let's chat so drills come thank

00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:52,750
you

00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:52,750
