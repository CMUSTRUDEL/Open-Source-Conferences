	Keynote: Enterprise-Ready Lessons for Building Multi-Cloud Apps - Bill Hilf, SVP & GM, HP Cloud, HPE

Many enterprise customers want to take advantage of the promise of cloud native applications, but need a bridge to their current IT infrastructure.  They want to reap the benefits of 12-factor apps and automation, but need strong tools to get started. In this session, HPE Helion SVP & GM, Bill Hilf, will share proven strategies for the Enterprise, the work HPE is focused on, and will highlight stories from HPE customers who have chosen Cloud Foundry technology as a key first step to evolving towards a multi-cloud approach.

good morning everybody my name is bill

00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:09,719
hilf and I'm very pleased to be here

00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,370
with you this morning and I have only a

00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:13,009
few slides to share with you what I'm

00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:15,089
going to spend most of my time on is

00:00:13,009 --> 00:00:18,480
talking to one of our customers here on

00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:21,210
stage I think the the customer stories

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,869
that we're hearing yesterday and and

00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:26,939
today just now earlier from Doug are the

00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:29,609
best indicator of where Cloud Foundry

00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:31,859
the project and the community and its

00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:34,320
customers are today better than hearing

00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:37,200
vendor blather about what we're all

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,210
doing to build products around Cloud

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,370
Foundry so I've been at Hewlett Packard

00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:43,399
Enterprise for three years actually

00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:47,730
three years coming up in about a week

00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:49,289
and it's been an absolute joy to work in

00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:52,020
the Cloud Foundry community and be part

00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:53,399
of the foundation on the board and I'm

00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,079
gonna talk a lot about that the

00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:57,780
importance of that and some of the

00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:01,199
things that happen behind the scenes to

00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:02,760
make this all go so I thought in the

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,260
morning I would start off with all the

00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,970
corporate marketing slides and then take

00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,840
you through deep marketing slides for

00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:08,990
about 20 minutes

00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:13,140
is that good everyone good with that

00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:17,970
awesome I know actually in reality I

00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:22,140
want to make sure you understand why HPE

00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:23,520
is in the business of cloud foundry why

00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,430
we are building products with cloud

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,159
foundry and and why we're doing these

00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:31,380
things a lot of people think of HP

00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:36,030
classically as a printer company PC

00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:37,619
company server storage company so often

00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,119
I'll get the question why are you in the

00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:42,030
developer game why are you working in

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,049
with with a pass platform an application

00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:45,420
platform and I want to take you through

00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:48,479
that a little bit before we we go too

00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,909
deep we we spent a lot of time with our

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,590
customers we target the large enterprise

00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:54,090
and large government's we talk we target

00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:56,130
all sides of businesses but I would say

00:01:54,090 --> 00:02:00,299
our focus primarily is on the very large

00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:01,950
enterprise and so we do get the benefit

00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:04,860
frankly of working with customers and

00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:07,320
understanding their requirements but

00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:08,789
also their complexity and I'll just sum

00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,009
it up for many of you who have been in

00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:12,330
the space for a long time I've been

00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:13,020
working with enterprises my entire

00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:15,480
career

00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:17,910
and and the the CIO statement the best

00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,140
sums it up is is something I've heard in

00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:21,060
many different languages in many

00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:23,070
different ways although I only

00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:24,330
understand one language so I'm presuming

00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:25,620
they're all saying something important

00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:28,560
to me when they speak in different

00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:30,840
languages including Klingon for all my

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,000
Klingon friends out there one of the

00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,550
things I hear a lot is Bill I have one

00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,040
of everything I have every database

00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:41,490
that's essentially been created I still

00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:43,790
run spark systems I talked to a customer

00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:45,990
yesterday that is the number one

00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:47,520
customer for side based databases they

00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:48,540
have more SCI based databases than any

00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,060
customer in the world and they're a very

00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:54,510
large bank we have customers our run

00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:57,030
legacy systems vintage systems they call

00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:59,940
them sometimes and these systems are

00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:01,770
frequently very very strategic and

00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,960
critical to the way that business runs

00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:05,760
sometimes we naively think particularly

00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:07,770
here in Silicon Valley we naively think

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:11,190
ah just cut those apron strings silly

00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:13,260
Enterprise move to the new world see the

00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:15,750
Facebook infrastructure be like Google

00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:19,380
pull your own sheet metal lay quark down

00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:21,540
you can do it and a reality is that's

00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:24,180
not what these businesses do these large

00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:25,800
enterprises are not in large scale out

00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:27,360
infrastructures where they can easily

00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,680
just roll out a distributed operating

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,870
system in a way they go

00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,880
many of them have critical systems

00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:36,150
sometimes life critical systems that

00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:39,000
need to work and grow as they build to

00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:41,610
the new and so that is the genesis or

00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,470
the root of what we call hybrid and so a

00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:45,690
lot of the work that we do at HPE is

00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:47,730
helping customers go through that

00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:50,550
journey of taking their existing

00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:52,860
business systems and building the new

00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:55,140
applications and new services and in

00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:57,780
many cases the new organizational and

00:03:55,140 --> 00:04:00,150
operational models around that entire

00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:03,000
environment that's what hybrid means to

00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:05,130
us so that this first area that we call

00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,100
transform to a hybrid infrastructure is

00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:10,410
one of our core for transformation areas

00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:12,930
these four slices of the pie represent

00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:14,430
that represent the HPE strategy and how

00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:16,080
we see the different challenges that

00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:19,020
customers are having as they think about

00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:20,370
moving to a hybrid and protecting more

00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:23,700
and more on their enterprise as things

00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:26,790
become digitized really empowering from

00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:28,320
analytics up the entire business

00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:31,170
and of course how do they enable their

00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,910
their employees and workforce but from

00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:35,730
the from the transformation to a hybrid

00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:37,950
infrastructure this is absolutely where

00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:39,300
Cloud Foundry in our Helion portfolio

00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:40,890
which is the name of our portfolio

00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:43,470
products for all the cloud things that

00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:45,480
we do really fit because these are

00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:48,270
technologies that we're building to help

00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:50,370
customers build apps build services that

00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:52,500
allow them to move across those

00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:54,210
traditional and new environments you

00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,040
notice I don't use the words public and

00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,670
private a lot I'm really trying my

00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,980
hardest

00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:02,310
I really am to eliminate those words in

00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:03,990
front of the word cloud computing I'm

00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:06,140
trying really hard to make public and

00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:10,560
private go away from our vernacular

00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:14,370
thank you I will pay you later

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:17,520
Australian man and the reason why is

00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:20,610
it's I think in five years time maybe

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:25,460
longer we'll look back at those words as

00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:28,170
very simple there in many cases wrong

00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:29,550
because the enterprises that I talk to

00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:32,730
you and I talked to enterprise customers

00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:35,250
literally every day do not think in this

00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:37,190
very simple naive construct of I have a

00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:40,320
public thing and I have a private thing

00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:41,880
they already run extremely hybrid

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,380
environments across multiple data

00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,900
centers some that they own some that

00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:47,310
they don't they're used to colocation

00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,420
they're used to hosting they're used to

00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:51,750
building their own they're used to

00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:54,000
renting so those that's the reality that

00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:55,770
enterprises are in so as we look at

00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,320
technologies that can help those

00:05:55,770 --> 00:06:00,300
customers move forward in their

00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:03,480
strategies and their agendas Cloud

00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:06,960
Foundry where the core value proposition

00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:08,280
is multi-cloud fits perfectly for those

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,930
types of customers that's why you're

00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,750
hearing these awesome stories about what

00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:14,760
I think Doug said 30% of his environment

00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:18,030
now running on Cloud Foundry a tall

00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:19,920
statement that's awesome I mean that is

00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:22,700
fricking awesome I'm a customer of

00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:25,860
Allstate I think it's awesome not

00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:28,440
snapchat not you know the newfangled

00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:30,180
coming but Allstate and that's part of

00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:32,370
the reason that that I think we should

00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:34,890
all be so excited here is it's not just

00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:37,530
happening for file new types of

00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:39,540
deployments and greenfield deployments

00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:40,560
and developers saying I'm going to hack

00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:42,480
something up on my

00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,000
and stand-up it's happening for mission

00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:46,710
critical systems and that's a very

00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,750
special time this community is in I've

00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:50,550
been fortunate to be part of open source

00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:52,350
communities at various points of their

00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:54,150
evolution probably the most notable one

00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:55,470
that I'm thinking of that's went through

00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:58,110
a similar revolution was the Apache

00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:59,730
project and a lot of the things I'm

00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:02,100
seeing with Cloud Foundry remind me of

00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:03,750
that where there's a point in time where

00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:06,150
it literally goes nonlinear and there's

00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:09,330
a breakthrough moment where the next

00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:11,639
thing you know Apache became a verb to

00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:13,889
web servers and that's happening now the

00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:16,620
Cloud Foundry so rather than having me

00:07:13,889 --> 00:07:18,960
blather about it even longer I'm gonna

00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:20,190
invite someone up to share some of these

00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,660
stories I'm going to talk with them

00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:23,580
about the journey they've gone through

00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:26,130
this is a customer that has been I'm

00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:28,770
dealing with with large systems and

00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:30,690
large applications for a long time and

00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:32,910
I'm going to invite Jason up to talk to

00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:34,260
us a little bit about their journey and

00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:35,850
spend some time with us on stage with

00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:43,050
Jason come on up

00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:44,820
Jason Armstrong Travelport thanks for

00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:46,680
joining us buddy I do I didn't just

00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:50,190
select the the other guy who was exactly

00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:52,500
my size out of the audience but thanks

00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:54,390
for coming out and talking to us anytime

00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,490
so Jason tell tell the group here about

00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:57,780
your role what Travelport does some of

00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:59,820
the things you told me about Travelport

00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:01,620
about the business that you're in and

00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,970
and how these these folks might be using

00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,900
travel board but they don't even know it

00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:06,960
excellent

00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:08,700
so welcome good morning my name is Jason

00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,870
Armstrong I'm a director of enterprise

00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:14,039
services in middleware at travel port

00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:15,600
probably never heard of travel part and

00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:17,580
that's okay I'll share a little bit

00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:21,210
about it with you trouble port is a

00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:22,919
travel commerce platform so what we do

00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:25,800
is we work with those travel providers

00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:27,690
that you work with and they work with us

00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:31,889
and they through our systems they can

00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:34,440
book sell share search for any travel

00:08:31,889 --> 00:08:37,110
option through our travel products for

00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:39,539
example many of you flew in or probably

00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:42,300
staying at a hotel this week more

00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:45,089
unlikely your travel provider is worked

00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:49,050
with travel port in order to book sell

00:08:45,089 --> 00:08:51,360
and reserve that that travel for you in

00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:53,610
and so travel ports been around about 40

00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,150
years that right yep and so what is your

00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:55,770
role

00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:58,050
travel board and then maybe tell us a

00:08:55,770 --> 00:09:01,590
little bit about how why you chose Cloud

00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:03,720
Foundry so my role at travel part is to

00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:05,610
lead a team that's implementing a lots

00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:08,610
of different tiers of our cloud

00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:10,980
strategies so I have middleware

00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:13,380
traditional engineers I have the

00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:15,330
operating system type of engineers I

00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:19,470
have the senior developers in a more

00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:22,470
creative area of cutting-edge service

00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:25,230
development awesome and and when you

00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:27,420
were looking at technologies to choose

00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:30,270
or platforms to choose what was it about

00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:34,050
cloud foundry that resonated it was the

00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:36,930
vendor lockout and the option that with

00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:39,840
cloud foundry we had one consistent way

00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:42,600
to be able to push content to scale

00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:44,940
content to develop applications it's

00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:47,340
actually funny one of the the beauties

00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:48,750
of cloud foundry was it embraced a term

00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:52,220
there's a lot of people at travel part

00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:56,070
hadn't heard of which is 12 actor apps

00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:58,440
so to us it's the add-on of by going to

00:09:56,070 --> 00:10:00,060
a cloud foundry solution where no matter

00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:02,070
which data center EURion within our

00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:03,990
complex of environments whether that's

00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:06,540
cloud or within our personal data

00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:08,100
centers it's the same experience for

00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,360
those developers the engineers have some

00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,130
work in the backend to deal with

00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,570
different distributions but for the

00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:14,430
development team which is the core where

00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:16,680
our revenue comes from they have that

00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:18,810
and so I got asked Jason what did you

00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:20,580
look at other options did you look at

00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:22,380
other cloud technologies or their

00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:23,220
application platform options before you

00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:26,730
made that decision

00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:28,770
absolutely we actually evaluated for a

00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:31,020
period of about six months all of the

00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:33,630
different options for cloud frameworks

00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:36,090
everything from docker and Sobell

00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:38,010
there's lots of vendor solutions I can

00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:39,560
name you're all probably know them very

00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:42,390
well

00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:44,600
and we kept coming back to it each time

00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:47,010
that we looked at the different flavors

00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,480
we really looked at Cloud Foundry as

00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:52,020
wait a second there's an open source

00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:54,200
community it's very robust our goal was

00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:56,550
to create an environment where we could

00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,620
implement best practices in the

00:10:56,550 --> 00:11:00,420
community you all of you out here are

00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:02,250
the ones that kind of convinced us to go

00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:03,810
to California because you convinced us

00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:06,630
that there are best practices that could

00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:07,680
increase our productivity there was best

00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:09,839
practices that would

00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,820
to play faster and there's best

00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,649
practices for how to cut our cost by

00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:16,560
using a centralized system like cloud

00:11:13,649 --> 00:11:19,230
foundry awesome one thing that we talked

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,029
about in I I think this is maybe one of

00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:22,500
the most important aspects of the

00:11:21,029 --> 00:11:24,450
transition that we see customers go

00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,950
through is the technology certain air

00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:28,380
there's tons of technologies out here

00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:31,320
the technology is one aspect of moving

00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:33,300
to a cloud native application platform

00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:35,070
but something that Doug also mentioned

00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:37,800
this morning tell me a little about the

00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:39,600
organization as you moved if you as you

00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,370
shifted left you know both

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,100
metaphorically and literally as you

00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:46,260
shifted left what happened to the org

00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:48,510
what happened to the culture that travel

00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:49,440
port or what's happening it because I

00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:52,020
know it's him yeah it's currently in

00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:55,950
progress and what we're seeing so far is

00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:57,240
that by shifting left and there there's

00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:59,190
a love-hate relationship with the word

00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,990
DevOps but shift left is the friendly

00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:02,520
term we use for it which means we're

00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:04,020
pushing more responsibility to the left

00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:06,480
side of the diagram where traditionally

00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:08,100
development people are so the

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,380
development community is taking on roles

00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:12,750
such as coordinating their builds doing

00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:15,270
their own regression testing managing

00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:17,640
their deployments production support but

00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:20,990
in fairness that leaves the right side

00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:23,190
of the diagram able to spend more time

00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:25,440
keeping the infrastructure up for those

00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:26,880
development teams so where traditionally

00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,500
they were spending a lot of time in the

00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,570
infrastructure side troubleshooting

00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:32,970
services and helping memory tune and

00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:34,709
other things with Cloud Foundry what

00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:36,570
we're seeing is a shift where those

00:12:34,709 --> 00:12:39,360
responsibilities for tuning and tweaking

00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:41,130
applications have moved to left and the

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,430
operation side is now focused on can I

00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:44,580
keep my servers up is my monitoring

00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:47,700
resilient

00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:52,140
how are my customer experiences awesome

00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:54,329
and in wait for customers out there in

00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:56,190
the audience what would you recommend

00:12:54,329 --> 00:12:58,740
what tips would you give them is there

00:12:56,190 --> 00:13:01,230
because you're on the journey as some

00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:02,550
are considering how do we get there so I

00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:04,350
talked to someone last night who's

00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:05,940
literally here just taking notes and

00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,870
learning before they take the you know

00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:09,270
the first step what would you recommend

00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:12,180
to them that's a great step on the

00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:13,980
community is excellent I said I kudos

00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:15,810
out to all of you for being such a great

00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:18,089
community because you're responsive we

00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:20,430
when people post items to boards you're

00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:21,660
very responsive so I'd encourage them to

00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:23,220
go out to the community

00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,710
and find out how they're working go up

00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:27,420
to the meetups and the things like that

00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:30,420
the the other important thing as a big

00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:32,160
enterprise and I make no qualms about it

00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:35,430
we're a big mainframe shop that has a

00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:37,950
whole lot of open systems around it it's

00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:39,600
hard to shift your organization's so you

00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:41,850
really need to brace them and bring them

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,830
into the process so where we brought in

00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:45,240
our network team and said look look at

00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:47,430
how many firewall requests you don't

00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:49,080
have to do look how many load balancer

00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:51,630
requests you do not have to do any more

00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:53,460
you can spend more time looking at it

00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:55,620
the cool new load balancer strategy

00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:57,960
versus having to worry about oh I have

00:13:55,620 --> 00:14:01,530
to implement 15 new little balancer

00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:03,810
requests today so by kind of bringing

00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:05,760
them into that process security server

00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:07,530
engineering all of them they really got

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,210
excited about the possibilities how they

00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:12,600
can do have more time to do the cool

00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:14,160
things great one last saying a year from

00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,860
now what does success look like so

00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,750
you're in process of this and you you're

00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:21,660
the organization's movie there where do

00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:23,850
you want to be in a year in a year we're

00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:26,130
hoping to move many of our micro service

00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:28,590
API so again the pieces of our travel

00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:30,690
commerce platform that agencies and

00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:32,640
travel providers are hooking into to

00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:35,280
have them hosted closer to those vendors

00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:37,380
so success is basically having Cloud

00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:39,780
Foundry instances running both in our

00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:41,730
data center and across the globe where

00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:45,120
we can actually have an experience where

00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:47,430
an Australian agency calls an Australian

00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,870
service which we happen to know that the

00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:50,880
data is coming from the Australian

00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:52,170
airline why come by call we do the

00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,360
United States through our personal data

00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:57,570
center just to go back out to Australia

00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:59,340
to get that data again success for us is

00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:02,250
being able to coast that with the

00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:04,020
benefit of reducing that development

00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:05,550
time reducing that deployment time

00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:08,600
that's an extremely important part for

00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:11,310
us where we're a very quick moving

00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:12,900
industry in travel and if you don't keep

00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:15,870
up you're gonna quickly get behind and

00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:18,180
those nimble deployments and processes

00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:19,620
or what we're looking for great Jason

00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,600
thank you very much man thank you

00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:24,329
appreciate it

00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:27,329
thank you right

00:15:24,329 --> 00:15:29,009
I think what the theme that you're also

00:15:27,329 --> 00:15:31,679
seeing from from from Allstate and

00:15:29,009 --> 00:15:33,809
Travelport is these are these are

00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:35,850
businesses that that had to make this

00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:38,339
transition that would be out of business

00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:40,199
if they were not moving this direction

00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:41,489
and taking advantage of the things that

00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:43,709
we're seeing with cloud native

00:15:41,489 --> 00:15:44,399
application platforms so I it's

00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:46,110
something we were talking about

00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,639
backstage a little bit it's not so much

00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:48,689
hey could we do something like that

00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:51,389
would that be interesting it's really

00:15:48,689 --> 00:15:53,759
survivability how do you make a get to

00:15:51,389 --> 00:15:55,949
the point where you're able to work at

00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:57,029
the speed of development and reach your

00:15:55,949 --> 00:15:59,429
customers at the speed of development

00:15:57,029 --> 00:16:02,040
because times become the the critical

00:15:59,429 --> 00:16:04,619
variable in extracting and delivering

00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:06,239
value to customers I got just a couple

00:16:04,619 --> 00:16:08,549
more things I want to talk about um one

00:16:06,239 --> 00:16:10,619
is about this slide here and I'll tell

00:16:08,549 --> 00:16:12,389
you 6 7 years ago when I first really

00:16:10,619 --> 00:16:13,980
really started spending time with with

00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:15,689
large enterprises and government

00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:18,269
agencies about cloud computing just

00:16:15,689 --> 00:16:22,410
generally um I would never have

00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:24,389
predicted this slide 7 years ago I would

00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:27,480
not have guessed that all of these types

00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:30,959
of vendors and customers would come

00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:32,759
together in some sort of community to

00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:36,389
build something related to cloud

00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:37,860
computing mmm I and to see how far and

00:16:36,389 --> 00:16:39,509
this isn't just a marketplace where

00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:42,089
people stuck up their logos in some

00:16:39,509 --> 00:16:44,309
nascar-like experience to slap something

00:16:42,089 --> 00:16:45,720
up on a slide to get on the slide means

00:16:44,309 --> 00:16:48,649
you're putting non-trivial money and

00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:51,959
time into being part of the foundation

00:16:48,649 --> 00:16:53,759
and I mean it's it's real time like

00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:57,239
there's real work that happens to make

00:16:53,759 --> 00:17:00,660
for all of these members to participate

00:16:57,239 --> 00:17:03,089
and I think this here the envy just look

00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:04,949
at some of the brands on here look at

00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:07,860
the six I think that were announced

00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:10,740
yesterday that came into to them to the

00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:12,689
foundation it's truly remarkable I don't

00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:14,850
think it's because we're all just

00:17:12,689 --> 00:17:17,399
happy-go-lucky guys and gals that like

00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:20,880
to get together I'd love to believe that

00:17:17,399 --> 00:17:23,639
but I'm not as as Sam does a better job

00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,919
of the Zen stuff like well let's say I'm

00:17:23,639 --> 00:17:27,480
stay in that in that zone I believe this

00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,610
is because the commercial market is

00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,130
demanding it I believe because we're in

00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:34,260
a different phase of cloud computing

00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:37,770
where it's becoming much more synonymous

00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:40,380
with IT I think the word cloud is star

00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:42,300
to me nighty in many ways and so because

00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:43,590
of that and the large complex

00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:45,900
heterogeneous requirements that

00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:48,540
enterprises have this the market has

00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:51,060
demanded a multi cloud application

00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:52,350
platform that's why this group exists

00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,820
and that's why it's come together but I

00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:55,800
just wanted to say thanks to all the

00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:57,360
members who've been part of this and I

00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,130
would say even a year and a half ago or

00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:02,550
so when the foundation was just being

00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:03,900
thought of or a couple years ago and I

00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:05,550
don't think anyone would have guessed

00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,990
the the amount of membership and the

00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:08,880
growth of this community it's truly

00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:12,420
remarkable and take a moment really

00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:14,160
while you're here to have deep and

00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:15,630
authentic conversations with people in

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,670
this community because I think Cloud

00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:20,220
Foundry really is at that liminal moment

00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:22,500
of growth that's exciting so as part of

00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:24,750
that one of the things that we do at HPE

00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:27,000
is is we want to help continue that

00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:32,190
growth so we're announcing today a new

00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:33,990
dojo in Seattle and that is open now and

00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:36,230
this is the one picture that we took of

00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:38,490
Seattle that didn't have rain and clouds

00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:39,780
but it looks really nice we call this

00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:43,920
interview weather when we're trying to

00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:47,160
hire people but we're really excited by

00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:48,840
this and and the model of how and many

00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:51,330
thanks to pivotal for for helping

00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:54,060
establish the the model that exists for

00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:56,610
how contributions happen and and how you

00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:58,530
build high quality software and we're

00:18:56,610 --> 00:19:00,060
very happy to participate by opening a

00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:03,000
seattle-based dojo we're not doing this

00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:05,190
because it's just my hometown maybe kind

00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,190
of we're actually doing this because

00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:09,630
there's a very large growing ecosystem

00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:11,640
in the Seattle in the Puget Sound area

00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:13,770
around cloud computing there's a couple

00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:15,780
really big players in the market there

00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:17,850
in terms of Microsoft and Amazon but

00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:21,690
that's also created a pretty significant

00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:23,580
ecosystem of of other startups and a

00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:25,980
pretty big developer community so we're

00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:29,070
very happy to be to be hosting that dojo

00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:32,910
in Seattle starting today I would also

00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:34,200
add as you think about the the one of

00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:35,790
the fun parts of coming to events like

00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:39,030
this is I ran into literally eight

00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:40,830
people eight who have all worked for me

00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:42,870
in different companies all out that I

00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:45,410
met in the outside of this room and

00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:49,290
there are all at different companies now

00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:50,400
eight different companies and I would

00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:51,630
like to think they're all here because

00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,790
I'm so terribly charming and they

00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:55,590
to see their old boss that's not it

00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:57,600
they've all gone off to different roles

00:19:55,590 --> 00:20:00,270
we're now Cloud Foundry is seated all

00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:03,270
over in in these different companies

00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:04,770
some vendors some customers some people

00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:06,690
doing you know services business

00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:09,330
businesses around around Cloud Foundry

00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:11,160
and that ecosystem just think how fast

00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:12,480
this has happened in the amount of time

00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:14,700
that growth has happened it's pretty

00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,200
remarkable so with that I'm going to

00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:20,130
close I'm going to give you my email

00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:21,870
address and my twitter handle I do want

00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:24,330
to have your feedback on how things are

00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:26,400
going not just with HPE and and and and

00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:28,290
what we're doing certainly to take any

00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,540
feedback except about my hair and being

00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:33,170
bald can write me about that can't tweet

00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:36,360
about that I get really really sensitive

00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:38,610
on that subject and it's because I'm not

00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:40,950
Australian but I do want to hear back I

00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:42,660
do want to hear from you how you think

00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:44,820
the Cloud Foundry project is going as

00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:46,650
well because there's a lot of still

00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:48,120
shaping and molding and growth that's

00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:50,670
happening in this project which makes it

00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:52,290
so vibrant and exciting to be part of so

00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:54,480
feel free to shoot me mail with your

00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:56,040
ideas and thoughts with that thank you

00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,600
very much have a great time for the rest

00:20:56,040 --> 00:21:01,630
of the event
