Description: 
	Hybrid Cloud in Finance - John Wetherill, BNY Mellon (moderator), David Lewis, BNY Mellon, and Asif Alam, Thomson Reuters, Janga Aliminati, Visa

Every major global financial institution is encountering the cloud, and each is adopting it in their own way. Some are diving in the deep end, moving all software delivery to public cloud like AWS or Azure. Others choose to keep everything on premise. Others are taking a "wait and see" approach, while still others are combining the best of both public and private clouds, adopting a hybrid strategy. 

This technical panel discussion features thought leaders from several major global finance corporations. It will explore the role of hybrid cloud in global enterprise software delivery. The  panelists will present their unique experienced viewpoints on the pros and cons of hybrid cloud, the reasons they have, or have not moved to hybrid, and the challenges they're facing in whatever cloud adoption strategy they've chosen, whether public, private, or hybrid.  This promises to be an invigorating, charged, and possibly somewhat controversial debate.

okay you guys ready yeah can you hear me

00:00:06,529 --> 00:00:09,740
all right

00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:12,809
very good well good evening and welcome

00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:16,500
this is a panel discussion the title of

00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:17,609
which is hybrid cloud in finance and

00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,220
I've been able that we've been able to

00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:22,830
get selection of people from finance

00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,390
companies and related finance companies

00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:26,849
to join us with the panel this afternoon

00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:29,150
and I think we'll have a pretty

00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:32,880
interesting discussion because obviously

00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:35,160
everybody in finance and everybody any

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,079
Enterprise is dealing with a lot of

00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,000
really hard issues these days in moving

00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:40,500
to the cloud so I'm not going to spend a

00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,190
lot of time introducing each of these

00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:46,230
speakers individually on their their

00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:48,930
photo and their their name is up on the

00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:51,960
on the slide here hopefully in the order

00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:55,289
almost in the order everybody's in well

00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:58,469
just run through everybody there you go

00:00:55,289 --> 00:01:00,780
thanks David so we've got Asif Alam from

architected Visa Marco hock hock

00:01:07,369 --> 00:01:13,590
Strasser from Swisscom who does a lot of

00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:16,140
work with all the financials where many

00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:18,689
of them had a cloud of cloud platform to

00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,580
have there my colleague David Lewis from

00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:24,900
BNY Mellon had a veiner Prize

00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:29,549
architecture practices there and right

00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:31,470
Andre Rybka from Bloomberg so these are

00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:33,240
the people that are dealing with all the

00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:35,729
decisions and all the challenges and

00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,290
problems that cloud is bringing and the

00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:40,140
software delivery and all that is

00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:42,420
bringing to the to this industry so it's

00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,310
a it's a good panel to discuss some of

00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,540
these issues and we're just going to

00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:47,189
dive right into it we're having some

00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:49,229
logistical issues with microphones but I

00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:50,520
think it should work out okay we entered

00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:52,229
it into a stand up

00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,509
yeah we'll turn it into a stand up this

00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:56,219
is a stand up meeting it will be passing

00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:59,939
the mics back

00:01:56,219 --> 00:02:02,399
very good so and what I'll invite you to

00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:03,960
just answer at will you don't have to go

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,270
in any particular order but I'm going to

00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,890
keep everybody up to you know up to you

00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:09,929
know three minutes or so on responses

00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:11,670
because we're short on time so let's get

00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:13,530
started so bill hilf this morning did

00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:15,570
mention a little bit about

00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,790
private versus public cloud and that

00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:19,740
whole concept is kind of evolving a lot

00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:22,050
maybe in five years there won't be such

00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:23,880
a thing but um I've been interested in

00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:26,520
private versus public for years and the

00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:28,380
challenges that are involved in moving

00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:31,140
one way or other or the restrictions are

00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:32,970
constraints to prevent moving from one

00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:36,690
place to another and I would love to get

00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:38,760
everybody here's opinion on that whole

00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:41,100
issue of moving to private moving to

00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,110
public what prevents you or forces you

00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:45,570
to go one to the other and what is your

00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:46,170
concepts of private versus public who'd

00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:51,120
like to start

00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:54,209
I can stop the mic thanks thanks a lot

00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,100
so so my my view is that there was a

00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:57,959
there's a concept of multi cloud which

00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:01,290
has been talked about a lot in the last

00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:03,390
two days and I feel that that's where at

00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:06,239
least I feel the Financial Services is

00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:09,300
heading to there is there will always be

00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:13,320
a place for public cloud for various

00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:15,600
reasons entitlements this that all the

00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:17,400
proprietary data that you have that you

00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,890
cannot move from one place or the other

00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:24,720
but in the larger scheme of things I

00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:28,709
feel that a multi cloud in in a public

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:32,430
cloud with multi vendors maybe even more

00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:34,230
than two vendors is the the momentum if

00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:36,750
you look at the momentum or direction

00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:37,290
that's what I'm seeing now is it there

00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:40,200
yet

00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:42,540
right now no because of a lot of

00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:45,450
complexities but that's where I see the

00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:51,420
industry driving towards and building

00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:56,760
solutions around that great in my view

00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:59,910
at visa I mean we chose private cloud so

00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:02,280
my it depends like generally like if the

00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:04,470
customer has a talent to build a cloud

00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:07,500
and what kind of infrastructure they

00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:09,269
have if it is a new consumer application

00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:12,030
company and moving to public cloud

00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:12,630
without having any infrastructure or

00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:15,540
Talent

00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:18,750
that makes sense but for in my company

00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:21,359
visa we have a talent we we are running

00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:23,520
our data center for years and we have

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:25,440
infrastructure so we have a talent we

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,450
have infrastructure going to public

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,180
cloud pinks

00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:30,980
buddy doesn't make sense does it it's

00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:33,350
not cost-effective to us building

00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:35,000
private cloud initially it may be I mean

00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:37,730
challenging but once we build the

00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,670
private cloud on our on-premise and so

00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:42,920
cost point of view it's very very

00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:45,500
meaningful and also security it's the

00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:48,080
one of the concern that we had so we

00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:50,030
just it's not about our customers but

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,790
it's about our customers customers

00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:54,680
customers customers customers so we have

00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:56,750
to ensure that trust that's only

00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:59,420
possible with the private cloud so

00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:01,670
that's the reason I mean in my view it

00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:03,530
makes sense to go in so you've talked

00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:05,720
about the the financial reasons and the

00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:08,480
security reasons or any of those forcing

00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:11,300
you not to go to public cloud or is it

00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:14,630
just that's the sort of the lease path

00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:16,880
so if you have applications I mean which

00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:18,620
is not considered as the secured

00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,750
applications are customer dependent

00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:24,050
applications definitely we can use

00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:25,850
public cloud so it's like somebody's

00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:27,950
hosting it we can just subscribe it

00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:34,820
instead of building and hosting

00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:36,530
on-premise ok Marco so we host a lot of

00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,910
financial companies but they also I'm

00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:40,190
also the foundation so that's why I

00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:42,800
represent a couple of them and what we

00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:46,000
see especially in Europe that the the

00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:49,370
audit and compliance e reasons are one

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,410
important reason that the banks or

00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:54,470
financial services in general need to

00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:55,940
host some stuff on prem still and for

00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:59,150
them multi cloud is not just about

00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:00,560
having on Prem and public offerings and

00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:02,780
moving them around but also have the

00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,150
possibility to within their private

00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:07,550
environments move it from the different

00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:09,950
clouds they have most of the financial

00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:12,620
service we see build in the last five

00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:16,190
years maybe four to six clouds by their

00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:18,740
own and just moving workload around them

00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:23,030
and leveraging them best is what they

00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:24,710
understand on multi climb yeah so a

00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:26,750
couple different perspectives John so

00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:28,640
you're probably fairly familiar with

00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:30,440
this so I think you know we we have a

00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32,240
substantial investment in private cloud

00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:34,730
historically we've built utility

00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,080
computing platforms for a long time we

00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:39,300
own our own data centers so

00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:42,360
you know as compelling as some of the

00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:44,729
financials claim to be for some of the

00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,620
public cloud providers that's not really

00:06:44,729 --> 00:06:48,840
a draw for us it would actually be a net

00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:51,000
expense increase for us in the short

00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:53,219
term so one of the things we're looking

00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,800
at and and the reason we look at

00:06:53,219 --> 00:06:57,449
technologies like cloud foundry and some

00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:00,120
of the other emerging cloud technologies

00:06:57,449 --> 00:07:02,879
is it allows us to make our applications

00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,409
cloud ready so that you have the

00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:06,240
mobility for the applications

00:07:04,409 --> 00:07:08,069
historically we never build application

00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,340
application that way twelve factor

00:07:08,069 --> 00:07:14,280
didn't exist and but even if we wanted

00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:16,199
to go to a public cloud today it doesn't

00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:18,030
make economic sense for us to do that

00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:20,400
for a lot of cases even if you disallow

00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:22,199
some of the security issues then I think

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,599
the other component which is one we

00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:26,460
talked about and you know Bill Health's

00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:28,379
comment this morning about you know

00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:30,900
public versus private and what does that

00:07:28,379 --> 00:07:33,449
mean for that to go away what it means

00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:36,599
is you know some of those security

00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:38,639
issues whether it's data locality issues

00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:41,580
you know regulatory issues around data

00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:43,770
locality or even just how do you secure

00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:45,629
an application so that if you're running

00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:48,990
multi-tenant either in your own data

00:07:45,629 --> 00:07:50,669
center or in a public data center once

00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:53,430
you've secured your application to the

00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:56,339
point where there you have complete

00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:57,449
isolation in a multi-tenant space it

00:07:56,339 --> 00:07:58,770
doesn't matter where it's running it

00:07:57,449 --> 00:07:59,879
could be running in your own data center

00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:02,219
it could be running somewhere else

00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:04,520
and it's really just the economics that

00:08:02,219 --> 00:08:07,589
drive that so I think when we look at

00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:09,419
multi cloud hybrid cloud the strategy is

00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:12,599
in the short term around the economics

00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:15,029
and then longer term around a security

00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:21,020
posture that allows applications to be

00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:24,569
mobile so some very good points I would

00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:27,000
certainly disagree with the point that

00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:29,490
you should just stay on private

00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,349
I understand visa you know might be very

00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:33,510
sensitive but there are some workloads

00:08:31,349 --> 00:08:35,250
that probably belong in public some

00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:37,849
workloads don't belong in public right

00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:40,229
so I would agree with that point I guess

00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:43,649
from like point of view of building data

00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:46,079
centers hell no I don't think we want to

00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:47,959
build another data center it's very

00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:50,290
expensive like in terms of the

00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:52,750
operational expenses

00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:55,450
you know I think cloud makes sense capex

00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:58,980
goes away right so I think that that's

00:08:55,450 --> 00:09:01,570
actually yeah I think you know but you

00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:03,130
know maybe the idea of sort of this

00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:05,380
cloud bursting I'm gonna throw that

00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:07,150
buzzword there makes sense where you

00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:09,280
know if like you said if your cloud

00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:10,690
ready then you can actually burst in the

00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,730
cloud and you know if you have some

00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:14,950
analytics jobs that require extra

00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:16,960
processing but I can't imagine you know

00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:19,960
if you're a global organization not

00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:23,200
having a multi cloud you know strategy

00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:24,670
you know I have a CDN we run one of the

00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,970
largest private networks in the world

00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:30,370
and you know I can't imagine put in a

00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:31,900
data center somewhere in Asia or

00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:35,370
building a data center in Asia I would

00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:36,550
rather use you know a cloud provider

00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:39,820
security-wise

00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:43,510
I actually trust more you know Google

00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:46,830
Amazon and Microsoft you know because

00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:49,150
I'm sure they you know they will lose

00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:51,700
business if there is you know security

00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:54,220
issues so I'm sure they thought of a lot

00:09:51,700 --> 00:10:00,490
of things that even on Prem we might not

00:09:54,220 --> 00:10:02,380
have thought of just add one slight I

00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:04,210
just have a question related to that and

00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:06,070
and and I think you have something you

00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:08,530
won't say but um I was talking to

00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:10,360
someone last year at a large enterprise

00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:12,190
that says they can't move to public hub

00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,500
because they need the ability to

00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:16,750
sledgehammer their disk drives after

00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:18,970
they're done for example as opposed to

00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:20,260
you know making sure that whatever even

00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:22,450
though they are securely erased or

00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:24,730
whatever they need to be owned by the

00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:26,560
you know make sure I read it I think

00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:28,420
shredded yes actually industrial

00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,610
shredders the tragedies drives we

00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:32,290
exactly does that imply does that apply

00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:33,970
and it's like is that actually still a

00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:36,100
valid well that was my point about

00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:39,880
security right once you have the ability

00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:41,860
to run secure applications anywhere it

00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:45,690
doesn't matter right you know if the

00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:48,820
data is encrypted in a secure way

00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:51,730
stagnant right I think that the thing is

00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:53,740
that and the sorry the point that I

00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:56,380
wanted to raise it's it's interesting

00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:58,420
that actually the competition Bloomberg

00:10:56,380 --> 00:11:00,529
and Reuters they are saying the same

00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:02,529
thing so that's a good thing right

00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:05,720
it's great we are saying the same thing

00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:08,569
because just just 30 seconds one point

00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:11,420
another thing is that and again we were

00:11:08,569 --> 00:11:13,430
talking about it earlier that in the

00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:15,709
center of all this what we are talking

00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:17,749
about is big data is all the different

00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:20,089
data that is coming in and cloud is the

00:11:17,749 --> 00:11:22,399
enabler now if you want to really

00:11:20,089 --> 00:11:24,680
utilize all the different unique sets

00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,839
structured unstructured this that no

00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:28,639
matter what it is coming from and and

00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:30,829
really scale it the right way

00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:32,809
cloud public cloud is the way to go you

00:11:30,829 --> 00:11:35,569
cannot just build all the security

00:11:32,809 --> 00:11:37,819
parameters in your data center and yes

00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:40,160
there would be five ten fifteen hundred

00:11:37,819 --> 00:11:44,089
applications that you absolutely cannot

00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:46,790
move out of your your boundaries fine

00:11:44,089 --> 00:11:50,180
but I think majority has to go that way

00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:52,759
is yeah I think in general I mean

00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:55,639
perception is the one thing and in

00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:59,269
reality I mean the companies like visa

00:11:55,639 --> 00:12:01,879
it's not about our our just one layer of

00:11:59,269 --> 00:12:04,459
customers we have to ensure the trust

00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:06,470
all the way to downstream so everybody

00:12:04,459 --> 00:12:08,930
understanding what is the security level

00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:11,420
of public cloud today it's not there

00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:12,920
maybe after five years it maybe there's

00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:16,309
a one thing and the second thing is in

00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:18,379
the visa we don't need to build the I

00:12:16,309 --> 00:12:20,089
mean data center we already have a data

00:12:18,379 --> 00:12:21,920
center we already have a infrastructure

00:12:20,089 --> 00:12:24,230
we already invested infrastructure for

00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,300
next five years maybe ten years so

00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:28,819
throwing out all that infrastructure and

00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:31,279
having talented people lightly talented

00:12:28,819 --> 00:12:33,199
people and just going public cloud I

00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:35,680
mean there is no way I mean capex and

00:12:33,199 --> 00:12:39,370
OPEX when you compare it doesn't add up

00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:42,589
right I mean the CIO never agrees that

00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:44,449
so there are multiple factors it's not

00:12:42,589 --> 00:12:46,220
just like the technology that you're

00:12:44,449 --> 00:12:48,410
seeing there you can go and consume it

00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:50,899
but in the financial sense when you go

00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:52,759
to your CIO and how effects and capex

00:12:50,899 --> 00:12:54,889
works and then how what is the

00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:57,050
investment you already made and what

00:12:54,889 --> 00:13:00,019
happens if you move that didn't work out

00:12:57,050 --> 00:13:01,790
to us so maybe if you are building a

00:13:00,019 --> 00:13:03,829
data center I mean from the scratch

00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:07,399
maybe it's a good idea to go to a public

00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:09,500
cloud and once the security is no more

00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:11,890
concerned for everybody understands that

00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:14,170
maybe that time we might go to public

00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:16,120
but today where we are where the

00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:18,399
industry is what customer thinks about

00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:22,110
public law so we are not we are unable

00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:24,850
to move the public cloud so that's that

00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:27,070
yeah but maybe the point on Big Data

00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:29,649
which is even made I think it's a very

00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:31,630
very important point bit so the data is

00:13:29,649 --> 00:13:33,910
new gold right that's what you always

00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:36,130
hear and to process this data you need a

00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:38,200
lot of technology you need new

00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:39,940
technology when we look at a tube right

00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:42,040
now it's already kind of old you know

00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:43,690
there are like 10 new frameworks which

00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:46,420
you can process your data even better

00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:48,519
and you need an engine for each of your

00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:51,250
kind of type of data you have is it

00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:53,410
whatever form and whatever format fits

00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:55,120
best so you need to build up all this

00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:56,709
technology in your own Prem environment

00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,320
whereas the cloud just allows you to

00:13:56,709 --> 00:14:01,089
scale so I think technology fostering

00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:03,190
leading-edge technology for your data

00:14:01,089 --> 00:14:05,440
will give you competitive and advantage

00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:07,450
by processing your data and this is also

00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:10,060
some benefits which I think cloud gives

00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:13,029
you and just another point that I want

00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:16,540
to add in there again in the support of

00:14:13,029 --> 00:14:19,810
public cloud is is that that community

00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:22,000
right so it's if you look at the the all

00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:25,060
the hundred billion dollar industries

00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,370
that you have is all about community how

00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:29,589
you build the community and and again

00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:31,480
specifically in the financial services

00:14:29,589 --> 00:14:34,360
if you really want to leverage and

00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:36,940
partner with the fintechs integrate

00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:39,279
different things you have to do that

00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:42,459
right so I totally get it I mean there

00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:45,670
are elements of data I totally get it

00:14:42,459 --> 00:14:48,279
that you cannot cannot repeat cannot

00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:51,970
leave from your for various reasons yes

00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:53,620
but again we are talking about most most

00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:56,320
of the datasets most of most of the

00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:58,120
content that you have how it will go and

00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:01,300
how it will transform and I think the

00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:03,190
journey has to be otherwise it's is the

00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:06,550
cliche it's being used a lot but it is

00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:11,140
about disrupt or get disrupted is the

00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:14,380
narrative in there so last year I was at

00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:17,380
a conference and a large company whose

00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:19,660
name starts with G had a little

00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:21,329
statement about that basically private

00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:22,829
cloud is dead and

00:15:21,329 --> 00:15:24,839
and that you know obviously they would

00:15:22,829 --> 00:15:26,999
write but they their statement was that

00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:28,439
it's like the old power plants 100 years

00:15:26,999 --> 00:15:30,299
ago or every enterprise every company

00:15:28,439 --> 00:15:31,949
had a power plant sitting on their front

00:15:30,299 --> 00:15:34,410
line to power the building and now that

00:15:31,949 --> 00:15:35,939
that power is a commodity that can be

00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:37,529
centralized at the same thing with that

00:15:35,939 --> 00:15:39,089
was their argument there from what you

00:15:37,529 --> 00:15:40,980
guys are saying or from what I'm hearing

00:15:39,089 --> 00:15:42,689
is that today that's not possible

00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:44,699
because of existing legacy

00:15:42,689 --> 00:15:47,519
infrastructure and because of security

00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:49,939
concerns but maybe in some short period

00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:52,799
of time in the future maybe the the

00:15:49,939 --> 00:15:54,839
private cloud will go the way of the arm

00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:56,970
premise power generator you know it's

00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:58,649
been yeah I think the interesting thing

00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:02,249
you know that us have brought up about

00:15:58,649 --> 00:16:03,959
data you know there's a lot of different

00:16:02,249 --> 00:16:06,749
kinds of data in the financial industry

00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:09,209
so like our data is predominantly not

00:16:06,749 --> 00:16:11,309
our data it's client data we actually

00:16:09,209 --> 00:16:13,559
have to sign agreements with our clients

00:16:11,309 --> 00:16:15,989
to use the data even to process on their

00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:18,660
behalf and most of those contracts were

00:16:15,989 --> 00:16:20,970
written before Big Data the internet etc

00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:23,489
all that kind of stuff so we literally

00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:25,259
have to rewrite contracts with our

00:16:23,489 --> 00:16:27,600
clients to be able to do some of those

00:16:25,259 --> 00:16:29,790
kinds of analytics I think also you know

00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,040
like in the case of Bloomberg and

00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:34,139
Thompson they own the data that's that's

00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:36,360
their stock in trade we were talking a

00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:38,339
little bit about before the series you

00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,410
know to really get to the next level for

00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:42,600
all these different kinds of data you

00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:44,790
have to have some way to secure at the

00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:47,399
unit level that data like maybe water

00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:49,350
market or have some other kind of way to

00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:52,169
transact on that data so if a client

00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:53,970
wants to lease their rights they can do

00:16:52,169 --> 00:16:55,829
that if you want to know who's using

00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:58,350
your data and get a piece of that every

00:16:55,829 --> 00:16:59,970
time it moves you can do that and that

00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:02,549
infrastructure just doesn't exist today

00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:05,159
so a lot of the one of the other reasons

00:17:02,549 --> 00:17:08,610
we keep our systems in-house is because

00:17:05,159 --> 00:17:10,919
of the way we have to secure data and we

00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:16,740
don't have any way to control it when it

00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:18,740
gets into you know the the wild wild one

00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:22,019
question that because we see that often

00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:25,350
especially in Europe yeah what is the

00:17:22,019 --> 00:17:27,569
request of having this data private is

00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:30,000
it because the technology is missing

00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:32,370
which can kind of prove that it's secure

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,680
enough or is it because of the gut

00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:37,920
feeling some of it is perception first

00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:40,500
and and you know there there you have to

00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:42,720
have a business reason to go through the

00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,990
effort to convince your internal and

00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:48,060
external compliance and regulators that

00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:50,280
it's a great idea and it requires a lot

00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:51,750
of convincing you know so there's got to

00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:54,450
be a real business reason to do it

00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:57,330
otherwise what's the point right and but

00:17:54,450 --> 00:18:00,000
if you had a way to secure that data and

00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:02,070
track it and manage it so that you could

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,160
you know as you know how it's being used

00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:06,920
if it has a financial value you extract

00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:09,170
that value when when it's appropriate

00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:12,210
that's a different story and I think

00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:14,910
when that comes along I think you're

00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:16,590
probably gonna see more pressure to put

00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:19,110
some of this data in places that could

00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:21,180
be more readily accessible yeah one one

00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:23,550
point one is I agree if the perception

00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:26,400
is the key thing actually today security

00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:28,260
I mean so you can ensure security in a

00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,300
public cloud as much as in a private

00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:31,380
cloud but the perception the perception

00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:33,840
is not there yet

00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:35,910
right that's a key thing so just to add

00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:39,180
another another point on the private

00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:42,170
cloud so we have to see I mean some of

00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:44,550
the early adopters like Netflix and

00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:47,730
Tommy and few other companies they are

00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:50,550
moving back to private cloud so we have

00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:52,620
to study why they are doing that so why

00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:54,900
earlier after some of the early adaptors

00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:57,150
they were the public cloud for very long

00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:59,610
time and why they are planning to build

00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:02,310
their private cloud that's actually

00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:04,380
recently I was in a cio conference I was

00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:06,450
talking to a customer they're planning

00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:09,360
to build from the scratch using the

00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:12,120
latest technology so I mean it's a

00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:14,550
perception and yeah you know one of them

00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:16,590
is you know data gravity you know once

00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:18,240
you build up a significant data set

00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:21,090
you know the meters running forever

00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,920
exactly and you know the only way to get

00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:24,570
it back you know like even now Amazon's

00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:26,130
got things like snowball and stuff like

00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:27,750
that but even that's just like pilot how

00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:30,030
do you get your data better you know and

00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:33,510
the meter keeps running but I think also

00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:35,430
you need to profile your applications

00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:37,170
from a financial perspective there's

00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:39,420
only a certain percentage that make

00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:40,890
sense economically and you know in

00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:43,890
particular some of the larger cloud

00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:45,430
providers have made their pricing so

00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:48,400
complex and opaque

00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:49,870
that you literally can't figure out how

00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,280
much it's gonna cost you so unless

00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:52,780
you're big enough and you're doing

00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,790
enough business to write a bespoke

00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:57,700
contract that locks in a certain rate

00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:59,220
you know which Netflix did and some

00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:01,990
other goods some of the other providers

00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:04,120
you're you know it could very well be

00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:06,520
more expensive and that's probably the

00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:08,080
objective is that's that's a great point

00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:10,420
right because I think so if you look at

00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:13,840
the challenge as I feel that you're spot

00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:16,090
on that I feel that most of the of

00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,860
course Microsoft knows b2b really well

00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:20,290
that they have been doing it for for

00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:22,030
many years but if you look at all the

00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:26,290
other most of the new vendors who are

00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:29,170
big ie the AWS s or the GCP which is

00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:31,360
coming up a lot Google cloud they are

00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:33,190
their rock when it comes to B B to C

00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,500
models to selling it to you and me as

00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:37,720
individuals but when it comes to b2b

00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:39,880
model they they're getting there there

00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:42,010
they are you know and again there is a

00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:44,560
challenge of what is the right business

00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:48,210
model to actually do that I think

00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:50,530
they're they what they have as tools is

00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:53,050
incredible I mean even from a GCP

00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:54,970
perspective tensorflow and some of the

00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:57,160
the capabilities cuban at ease we were

00:20:54,970 --> 00:21:00,340
talking about earlier of how you can

00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:03,310
actually that can support multi cloud is

00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:05,020
fascinating but back to your point David

00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:08,620
I think business model of how you

00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:11,230
actually take it and make it and and put

00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:13,510
it into a production is is is an issue

00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:16,300
that we are all facing and trying to

00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:19,800
solve but but I mean as we are in the

00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:24,010
cloud foundry Summit yeah ahran ahran

00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:25,240
ahran ahran technologies and what the

00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:28,570
standardization which cloud foundry

00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:30,850
offers you it is not a bridge due to

00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:33,400
public and private and which allows us

00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:35,410
then also to switch to providers switch

00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:37,720
the models whatever applies right now

00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:40,780
also may be based on where your company

00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:45,100
stands right so we see with the culture

00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:46,960
you know what we do we have time or no

00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:48,760
yeah we have a Gaga mas there's one more

00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:52,870
point to consider which is disaster

00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:57,780
recovery which is you know the right now

00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:59,290
the in my case you know I don't have

00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:01,900
presence in certain

00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:04,300
geographical regions right and for me

00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:07,210
even if it's just for dr purposes cloud

00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:09,490
makes a lot of sense because then I can

00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:13,390
have that presence there in that

00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:17,680
locality so you know and I can't imagine

00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:19,570
building a data center for that right if

00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:22,240
we're talking about economics you know

00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:24,820
building a dr in different regions I

00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:27,430
think that's pretty attractive you know

00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:30,640
even if it just comes up on demand I

00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:35,190
think that use case is actually quite

00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:39,910
good and if I use cloth foundry it will

00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:42,700
you know magically appear right wash up

00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:48,850
and that's it very good so while we're

00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:52,240
on there so then another another you've

00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:54,100
alluded it to already the the ability to

00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:57,250
move from cloud to cloud is one way to

00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:58,930
ensure avoiding vendor lock-in and how

00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:01,960
important I'm very curious to know how

00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:04,930
important vendor lock-in or or avoidance

00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:09,760
of liquor vendor lock-in is for you

00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:12,100
folks I mean III can already see this

00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:16,120
with AWS with all the wonderful features

00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:18,100
and candies that AWS has you know it the

00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:19,720
vendor lock-in is happening right now so

00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:22,980
it's definitely a big issue and

00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:26,440
certainly things like cloud foundry or

00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:29,200
kubernetes or you know other platforms

00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:33,040
abstract in a way it it makes perfect

00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:36,100
sense you know I don't think we have the

00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:39,040
full parity of all the services but at

00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:41,530
the same time if you don't think of it

00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:44,830
then you know you're basically going to

00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:48,490
be locked in and pricing and everything

00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:50,860
else is gonna you know get you don't I

00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:53,350
think I think that's why cloud foundry

00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:55,030
or even containers the new containers

00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:57,190
that are coming out the kubernetes and

00:23:55,030 --> 00:24:00,190
all whatever it is that actually keeps

00:23:57,190 --> 00:24:04,410
you agnostic is priority number one and

00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:07,330
if any any vendor any cloud provider is

00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:09,250
thinking any other way they will I don't

00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:12,280
think so they can survive long long term

00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:13,330
because it is about being agnostic it is

00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:15,640
about being

00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:18,130
actually again building that community

00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:22,180
of cloud and and that's the only way

00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:25,240
forward in my opinion yeah I mean for us

00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:27,280
actually vendor lock-in is not at all

00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:29,680
allowed I mean so we don't want vendor

00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:32,080
to dictate us so we want to build a

00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:34,270
solution based on the technologies that

00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:37,600
we like that the technologies which

00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:40,090
suits to us so in fact we are building

00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:42,790
actually multiple clouds I mean so the

00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:44,920
cloud with a I mean VM orchestration the

00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:47,320
cloud with a cloud foundry the cloud

00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:49,030
with a dark currents form so we are

00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:50,830
building multiple clouds based on

00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:53,200
requirements from different product

00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:55,000
teams and same times we are not we are

00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,830
we are trying to make sure we are not

00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:02,440
locked into any technology that

00:24:56,830 --> 00:25:04,600
particularly going to dictators yeah I

00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:06,850
think I mean I can just underline what

00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:09,790
they said and I think one one further

00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:13,870
point which also the foundation brings

00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:15,840
into place is area where people like you

00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:18,070
talk together and form the new

00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:20,620
requirements to to the product and I

00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:24,040
think that's that uniquely shows that

00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:26,650
the vendor lock-in is pretty pretty yeah

00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:29,230
yeah not here yeah I think even you know

00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:31,000
this ties in with the comment this

00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:34,000
morning about you know not private

00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:37,300
private or public but hybrid is you know

00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,400
certainly for us you know we got the

00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:42,700
same concern you do we've got capital

00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:43,960
investments but even once you start you

00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:47,200
know rolling off some of those assets

00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:48,700
you want mobility right you if I want I

00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,910
want to be able to say okay I can put it

00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:54,460
in this public or in this externally

00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:56,830
hosted area or I may want to put it in

00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:58,450
my own data center for my application

00:25:56,830 --> 00:26:00,370
teams perspective it shouldn't matter

00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:02,440
right they there shouldn't be a lift

00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:04,000
there shouldn't be an issue there's

00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:05,560
probably going to be some work behind

00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,840
the scenes in term from a compliance

00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:09,970
perspective but you know that's really

00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:12,490
the goal is whether it's moving from one

00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:15,070
external cloud providing provider to

00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:17,470
another to my own space or wherever I

00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:20,740
want that mobility and and I'm not going

00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:22,150
to get that even you know using

00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:24,190
something like Cloud Foundry because

00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:26,470
it's not just you know Amazon versus

00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:28,299
Azure versus Google it's also can I

00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:32,159
on my own infrastructure none of those

00:26:28,299 --> 00:26:34,330
guys offer an internal in a true sense

00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:38,500
something that I'd run in my own data

00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:39,940
center very good okay so we actually we

00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:42,370
have five minutes left and I'd like to

00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:43,929
at least invite if there's an audience

00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:46,570
question or two if there's anybody that

00:26:43,929 --> 00:26:48,309
has some burning question and then

00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:52,480
please step up to the mic control all

00:26:48,309 --> 00:26:56,799
right thanks guys so you have Nasdaq has

00:26:52,480 --> 00:27:01,990
something that runs an AWS q cloud cap

00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:04,690
ones on stage at AWS they're a visa you

00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:07,960
know brand so just curious what you're

00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:10,510
thinking is there what's the specific

00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:12,640
question I just wanted a yeah I think

00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:14,350
he's countering some of the comments

00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:19,000
we're making here that private the

00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:22,419
public cloud is a little farther off no

00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:25,299
they definitely I think the moment so so

00:27:22,419 --> 00:27:27,640
my my view is that everybody is

00:27:25,299 --> 00:27:29,890
definitely going towards the public

00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:31,419
there's no question about it I mean I'm

00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:33,850
sure that all of us are in some way

00:27:31,419 --> 00:27:35,919
shape or form how far are we in the

00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:39,130
journey right we also Thomson Reuters

00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:41,200
also just not from a financial services

00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:42,669
but in some other areas like we have

00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,159
other portfolios like tax and accounting

00:27:42,669 --> 00:27:47,559
and others maybe we are further down the

00:27:45,159 --> 00:27:49,299
road on the cloud story than we are on

00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:51,730
the financial just because of the

00:27:49,299 --> 00:27:53,650
complexity of where it is it does not

00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:56,289
mean that we are not on the cloud on the

00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:59,380
financial side and to your point there

00:27:56,289 --> 00:28:02,350
are a lot of other you know big names

00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:06,659
who are already using cloud so I think

00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:09,789
it goes back to again the complexity of

00:28:06,659 --> 00:28:12,700
entitlements of you know 400-plus

00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:14,409
exchanges how you actually what is what

00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:16,539
can I entitle you versus what I can

00:28:14,409 --> 00:28:19,090
entitle rest of the the room and so on

00:28:16,539 --> 00:28:21,760
forth and can public cloud handle that

00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:25,210
what are the issues in there because

00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:28,870
again V also and I'm using our good

00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:30,490
friend Bloomberg and NV we have a lot of

00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:33,010
different datasets a lot of different

00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:34,840
contents from 400 plus exchanges I'm

00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:38,289
sure bloom Bloomberg has the same thing

00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:40,380
and everyone has different entitlement

00:28:38,289 --> 00:28:43,740
things so how to handle that

00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:45,630
those are also yeah one thing I was

00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:47,760
saying they've heard some about the cap

00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:49,350
one story but you know just in terms of

00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,820
what's been spoken about publicly

00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:53,340
there's certainly you know in the

00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:56,120
spectrum there you know an outlier in

00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:59,159
terms of being very aggressive about

00:28:56,120 --> 00:29:01,380
converting their internal workforce to a

00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:03,539
completely agile workforce they've got a

00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:07,049
pretty interesting story you know I

00:29:03,539 --> 00:29:08,640
think the folks from Allstate as well

00:29:07,049 --> 00:29:10,799
you know I don't know how many caught

00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,510
their presentation in the afternoon

00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:14,429
about their culture but that's the same

00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:18,389
kind of thing that cap one is doing and

00:29:14,429 --> 00:29:20,730
I think you know I would be you know my

00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:22,799
I'm trying to remember if I heard them

00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:24,419
say specifically there's some things

00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:26,159
that are never gonna run in the cloud I

00:29:24,419 --> 00:29:27,590
think they're gonna say the same thing

00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:30,240
that we're saying but they're definitely

00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:32,909
way farther out in terms of what they're

00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:35,010
willing to put on public cloud now and

00:29:32,909 --> 00:29:36,600
they've done you know from an economics

00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:39,149
perspective that's the conversation we

00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:40,649
were saying they did the math they got

00:29:39,149 --> 00:29:42,600
their compliance and legal and

00:29:40,649 --> 00:29:44,760
regulatory and all those folks lined up

00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:46,679
that's a business strategy for them and

00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:49,200
you know we'll see how it works out but

00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:50,669
you know I think you can put all the

00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,830
pieces together I don't think anybody

00:29:50,669 --> 00:29:54,360
here said no you can't do it but you

00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:56,010
know it's just it's not part of our

00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:57,450
individual business strategies right

00:29:56,010 --> 00:30:00,570
okay very good so we have time for one

00:29:57,450 --> 00:30:02,639
more question briefly so go ahead thanks

00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:04,350
gentlemen and just picking up a bit on

00:30:02,639 --> 00:30:06,210
that theme I think there was the

00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:08,340
reference to Google saying it's all

00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:11,210
about public and Amazon used a really

00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:12,960
hard message it was all about public but

00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:14,850
giving your all representing the

00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,649
financial industry all information is

00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:18,840
not really valued and were created

00:30:16,649 --> 00:30:20,850
equally and I was just wondering it you

00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:22,769
know just like today there are so

00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:25,110
industries that generate their own power

00:30:22,769 --> 00:30:27,539
that have substantial backup power

00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:29,789
infrastructure because their industry

00:30:27,539 --> 00:30:32,039
requires that and I was just curious if

00:30:29,789 --> 00:30:33,960
you felt looking forward that that was

00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:36,929
likely to be an element that cloud

00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:38,870
public cloud would be relevant to

00:30:36,929 --> 00:30:41,309
different industries in different ways

00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:43,409
well yeah absolutely I think it's gonna

00:30:41,309 --> 00:30:44,820
be the the relevancy is going to be

00:30:43,409 --> 00:30:46,950
different one of the interesting things

00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:48,500
you know again I mentioned you know

00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:52,880
being why Mel and

00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:54,320
is really a back-office provider we do

00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,820
we do a lot of different kinds of

00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,680
financial products but one of our core

00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:59,420
businesses is doing business for other

00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:01,490
financial services companies so we don't

00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:05,230
own the data one of the interesting

00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:07,580
things you're gonna see is with

00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:11,300
blockchain and other types of

00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:13,190
peer-to-peer technologies you know where

00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:14,540
the ownership of the data lies how it

00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:17,570
gets moved from one place to another

00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:19,220
that's gonna be that's more likely to be

00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:20,930
a disruptive force in the financial

00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:21,710
industry than things like you know

00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:23,570
startups

00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:25,640
you know launching a new financial

00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:26,750
services company on Amazon and competing

00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:30,260
with one of us that's not going to

00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:31,790
happen like for a while they're they're

00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:33,680
regulatory and other reasons why that's

00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:35,660
difficult to do not impossible but

00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:37,580
difficult but I think some of the other

00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:39,140
technologies like blockchain I think

00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:43,850
have more potential to do things like

00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:44,240
that the way I see is I mean in next few

00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:46,070
years

00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,320
one or the other way every Enterprise

00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:49,760
try to move into the cloud whether I

00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,470
can't say that it's a private towards

00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:54,410
public cloud but the cloud is the

00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:56,570
essence so actually before coming to

00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:58,820
visa I was rhetorical and I was building

00:31:56,570 --> 00:32:00,560
the public cloud so security point of

00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:02,930
view I don't see much difference it's

00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:05,240
mainly perception so the data customer

00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:06,950
data that is in the public cloud may be

00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:10,070
completely encrypted the encryption key

00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:12,800
will be with the customer so vendor

00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:14,360
cannot do anything so your data you want

00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,740
it you have the key so the security

00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:17,950
point of view I don't see much

00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:20,330
difference but I mean as we said

00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:22,190
regulatory point of view so there may be

00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:23,810
applications that may need to stay in

00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:26,540
private and rest of the application

00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:28,550
might move into PI I I would say that

00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:30,380
very quickly it's the blackboard a

00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:32,360
BlackBerry model that we have talked

00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:34,400
about previously also and what I say is

00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:37,670
that living in financial services for

00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:40,490
many years five six years ago blackberry

00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:43,520
used to be the gold locked in you cannot

00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:45,170
do anything everything was locked in now

00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:47,360
five years later everybody has a

00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:49,520
smartphone and every that perception has

00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,290
gone away same thing will happen with

00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:52,850
public cloud in my opinion with the

00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:54,890
right time I don't know if it's five

00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:57,350
years two years three years but it is

00:32:54,890 --> 00:33:00,020
the black BlackBerry model and people

00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:00,590
who don't go with the smartphone model

00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:03,140
we

00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:04,730
you know face I feel the same thing as

00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:06,590
blackberry model what happened to

00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:08,179
blackberry very good okay well our time

00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:10,100
is up for this afternoon so I'd like to

00:33:08,179 --> 00:33:15,770
thank the panelists who showed up and

00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:17,630
participating and thanks everyone for

00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:20,380
being here and I guess next up is the

00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:20,380
