all right well I guess we'll get started

00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:08,370
this is a talk about cultural shift and

00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,870
change and some of the things we've done

00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:14,099
at all-state with branding and identity

00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:15,690
around how we're driving a cultural

00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:18,060
transformation I call this the feely

00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:19,640
talk because this is not really a

00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,600
technical talk it's really about

00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:25,140
organizational behavior how people

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,830
identify with brands and and how to

00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,699
amplify your enterprise transformation

00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:32,279
but I wanted to talk a little bit about

00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:34,140
myself my name is Matt curry I'm the

00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,870
director of cloud engineering over at

00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:39,420
Allstate and my business card actually

00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:41,399
says supafly cloud guy because that's

00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,680
what happens when you give somebody like

00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:45,210
me a free and open text field on their

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:52,649
first day of work to order business

00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:54,090
cards so I'm gonna kick this talk off

00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:58,100
this talk is a little bit of a narrative

00:00:54,090 --> 00:01:00,899
about how we're using brand and identity

00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:03,960
to drive cultural change and enterprise

00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:06,470
transformation at all-state and I'm

00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:09,570
gonna start off by talking about how

00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:11,939
companies and enterprises grow over time

00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:14,369
and how they develop processes and how

00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:17,060
we've ended up in this place where we

00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:20,159
have a moral imperative to change

00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:22,080
because decision making isn't fast

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,770
enough for us to adapt to the current

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:28,229
business environment and so I'm also

00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:30,780
going to talk then from there about how

00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:33,299
the current Allstate brand is impacting

00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,040
our delivery model and and how we

00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:37,650
interact with people in our internal

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,540
organization and then talk about how a

00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:41,549
small group of us came together and

00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,619
formulated some outcomes that we wanted

00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:46,320
to drive towards and then built a brand

00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:49,170
an identity around those outcomes and

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:52,320
some of the learnings and success

00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:54,360
stories we've had along the way so hmm

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,579
if any of you remember last year from

00:01:54,360 --> 00:02:00,240
Andy's at NIEHS keynote one of the

00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:02,070
things he really hit on was that we're

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,750
driving transformation into Allstate and

00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:06,000
we've had some challenges around the

00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,770
speed of decision making because

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,869
everything that we do is grounded in

00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:12,060
this idea of actuarial analysis and I

00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:13,180
think Doug actually hit on it during his

00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,400
keynote

00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:21,879
just now as well which kudos to Doug he

00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:24,069
did a fantastic job and I want to kind

00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:26,260
of think about that but I want to think

00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:27,909
about it in a broader context because

00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:30,239
Allstate and the insurance industry

00:02:27,909 --> 00:02:32,439
aren't the only ones that actually

00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,810
struggle with the problem of being able

00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:36,879
to make decisions quickly it's a much

00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:38,439
broader enterprise problem most large

00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,239
enterprises are dealing with this

00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:42,340
challenge and they're trying to deal

00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,319
with it with a variety of different ways

00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:46,870
and if you go back and look at the

00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:49,450
infamous Netflix culture deck there's

00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:51,220
about five or six slides in there that

00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:53,650
deal with this issue in a really

00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:57,220
interesting way where they bring it back

00:02:53,650 --> 00:03:00,400
to this idea of it's all about how

00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:03,700
companies grow and evolve and scale over

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:06,430
time and I'd like to review that with a

00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:08,799
little metaphor so when a company is new

00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:11,109
and small and agile it's like a

00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:12,969
speedboat life is good you're going

00:03:11,109 --> 00:03:16,120
really fast fine by the seat of your

00:03:12,969 --> 00:03:20,560
pants whoo-hoo we got beer in the koozie

00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:24,099
and Moroccan right and as we see growth

00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:26,769
and success in this model the business

00:03:24,099 --> 00:03:29,109
model starts to get more complicated it

00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:31,510
starts to show a little bit of chaos

00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:33,489
that needs to be controlled and so one

00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:35,799
of the simplest tools that we have at

00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:38,379
our disposal in order to control some of

00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:41,049
that chaos is to implement a few simple

00:03:38,379 --> 00:03:43,540
rules and when we start implementing

00:03:41,049 --> 00:03:45,699
rules and were early in the lifecycle of

00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:48,009
developing our company they don't really

00:03:45,699 --> 00:03:50,199
have a huge impact because usually early

00:03:48,009 --> 00:03:53,229
rules are tightly aligned to our core

00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:54,879
values and that's really important also

00:03:53,229 --> 00:03:57,040
they're small in number and they're

00:03:54,879 --> 00:04:01,599
fairly easy to navigate but as we grow

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:04,479
and scale we find that we accumulate

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,859
layers upon layers of rules and over

00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:08,799
time they start to weigh on our

00:04:05,859 --> 00:04:12,909
organizations and before long we need a

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:15,519
larger vessel and so now we have tools

00:04:12,909 --> 00:04:17,620
like committees to help us navigate this

00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,900
complicated ecosystem of rules that

00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:22,479
we've created and we're trying to figure

00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:25,539
out how to do that while maintaining

00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:26,350
speed and agility but at the end of the

00:04:25,539 --> 00:04:28,300
day we've base

00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:31,270
we made that trade-off we've made the

00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:34,000
trade-off of a facade of security and

00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:36,550
help and predictability for this idea

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:41,110
you know and this idea of centralized

00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:43,270
control for losing agility and losing

00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:45,100
our ability to pivot or rotate or take

00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:47,230
advantage of new business opportunities

00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:49,690
as they present themselves and what we

00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:51,550
ultimately end up with is a boat that

00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:53,560
we're like hey this boat can go pretty

00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:55,330
fast as long as we don't have to turn

00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:59,440
like but as soon as we have to turn

00:04:55,330 --> 00:05:03,040
we're basically screwed so hmm if you

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:05,170
think about it the rules were tools that

00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:07,870
we used to build and scale our

00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:10,330
organization there were things that

00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:13,450
enabled success early in the lifecycle

00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:15,940
of organizational development and then

00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:18,100
over time they become the wrong tool to

00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:19,780
continue that scale and they start to

00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:26,440
get in the way of the things that made

00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:29,200
us successful so before long rules and

00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:31,540
rules accumulate and we move from our

00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:34,180
nice little pontoon boat to the big

00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:36,490
river boat with now with having to tap

00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:38,350
into new tools tools like governance and

00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:40,150
and more committees and layers and

00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:43,450
layers of rules and it becomes very

00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:45,790
unclear for our internal employees as to

00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:48,100
how to navigate this ecosystem who's in

00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:49,750
charge of making the decision who isn't

00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,940
in charge of making the decision why am

00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:53,590
I going to this meeting where apparently

00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:55,180
nobody's allowed to make the decision

00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:57,670
but I have to go anyway like I don't

00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:59,230
understand this this is very confusing I

00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:02,740
don't really know how this ties to the

00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:08,770
outcome I'm trying to achieve and so

00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:11,230
this is the backdrop of how we came to

00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:14,380
end up and know in this place where we

00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:15,730
have a moral imperative to change you

00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:17,410
know Andy talked about speed of

00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:20,860
decision-making speed of decision making

00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:23,050
we have a moral imperative to change to

00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:24,640
make sure that we can take advantage of

00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:27,130
new business opportunities as they

00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:29,530
present themselves tying back to his

00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:31,630
talk I believe he discussed about how

00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:35,530
the insurance industry is ripe for an

00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:38,200
uber like disruption rewind 12 months

00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:39,230
ago yes that was absolutely a case for

00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,970
why now two or

00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:43,760
fast forward to where we are today and

00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:45,590
Doug hit on connected car is a real

00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:47,540
thing autonomous vehicles seem right

00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:49,460
around the corner we're seeing more

00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:51,100
venture capital come into our industry

00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:53,360
than we've ever seen before so

00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:55,280
absolutely the threat is real the

00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,920
imperative is real we have to make

00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,200
adjustments as to how we deliver and so

00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,910
as we came together as a group and

00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,740
started to decide how to navigate our

00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:05,930
current world and what we needed to do

00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:08,000
to change we decided that the real

00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:10,700
answer was decentralization of

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,070
decision-making and for those of you in

00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:15,680
here who are computer nerds it's

00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:17,210
basically like parallelism at its finest

00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,070
it's like hey us engineers had this

00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:20,330
figured out a while ago a few leadership

00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:21,620
would just come and talk to us we

00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:25,780
could've told you how this works right

00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:28,190
so so we're we're employing

00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:31,190
organizational parallelism in order to

00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:34,040
drive closeness to the customer better

00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:36,980
decision-making and scale and what we

00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:40,370
ultimately end up with is spreading our

00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:43,370
crew across a fleet of speedboats that

00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:45,910
are founded on this idea of values

00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:52,360
behaviors and outcomes in order to drive

00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:55,910
consistency in how they deliver hmm and

00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:58,760
as we were developing this we started to

00:07:55,910 --> 00:08:00,620
understand our existing situation a

00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:02,480
little better we had a lot of

00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:04,490
conversations both internally and

00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:06,320
externally about the challenges we had

00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:08,750
in our operating model and how we were

00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:10,220
delivering IT services and over time

00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:12,560
something that became more and more

00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:17,140
apparent to us is we had this challenge

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:21,380
of a singular brand identity you see

00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:23,480
you'll see our the icon up there and all

00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:25,160
of you know us by good hands and mayhem

00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:27,140
and we take care of our customers and we

00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:29,660
protect them from Nate mayhem and we

00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:31,760
provide them with safety and all of

00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:35,900
those things are absolutely critical and

00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:39,110
important however at the same time all

00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:41,390
of those ideas and behaviors and the

00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:44,330
aversion from wrist had sleep their way

00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:47,420
into our delivery model and art we had

00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:49,940
an IT organization that was built around

00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:52,350
this idea of we must protect the

00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:55,650
enterprise from any and all

00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:58,980
risk and ultimately what that ended up

00:08:55,650 --> 00:09:01,070
in was a delivery model that was yeah

00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:04,980
not very risky but it was also really

00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:08,970
slow and really challenging and really

00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:11,250
difficult to navigate and so we decided

00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:13,230
when we came together that we needed to

00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:17,880
define some outcomes that we wanted to

00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:20,310
drive we really wanted to talk about how

00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:23,310
engineers develop innovative software

00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:25,470
how we how we drive engineering best

00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:27,600
practices how we move with speed how we

00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:30,330
do experiments in order to test if our

00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:33,660
products are good ideas or not and and

00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:35,640
build a brand around the emphasis of

00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:38,400
those ideas now that doesn't mean we

00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:40,140
lose customer focus it doesn't mean that

00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:42,150
we're no longer taking care of our

00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:44,730
customers but it's a different emphasis

00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:47,280
for the engineers that we're relying on

00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:51,380
to innovate and get creative about

00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:51,380
building our next generation of products

00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:57,810
so it's really easy looking back with

00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,700
20/20 vision to kind of say hey we add

00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:01,230
all this insight to begin with this was

00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,790
really interesting we totally knew what

00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:04,320
we were doing but that's absolutely not

00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:06,240
the case like we had absolutely no idea

00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,330
what we were doing we're all huddled in

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,130
an office trying to figure out okay we

00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:12,810
want to write better software that

00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:15,090
sounds like a really great idea let's

00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:18,090
start there and as as we're talking

00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:21,060
about what that means with tightening

00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:23,910
feedback loops and driving continuous

00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:26,370
integration and doing things like

00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:27,960
extreme programming and pairing we said

00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:29,730
well we actually have to assign a name

00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:32,460
to this thing because it's actually

00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:33,900
bigger than any one of these principles

00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:35,850
like we can't really just call it

00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:38,730
extreme programming because that ignores

00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:40,320
the lean product design side of what

00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:42,930
we're trying to deliver and we can't

00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,120
really just call it pairing because it

00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:46,470
this goes way beyond pairing and and

00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,300
there are pieces that we're trying to

00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:50,780
implement that are bigger than that so

00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:54,270
let's come up with a name for this thing

00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:57,960
and we landed on this name called

00:10:54,270 --> 00:11:01,010
compose labs and I want to talk a little

00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:04,770
bit about how we ended up there

00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:06,089
so because Allstate is like many other

00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:08,160
enterprises we

00:11:06,089 --> 00:11:10,110
this interesting fascination with

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,480
acronyms where we believe that anytime

00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:15,720
we name anything it has to be an acronym

00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:18,779
and so our original ideas were built

00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:21,930
around things like idea labs and ideal

00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:23,759
labs and adepts labs these are acronyms

00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:25,079
that means something that I couldn't

00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:26,939
tell you what they mean today and I

00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:28,290
think if we had introduced them not a

00:11:26,939 --> 00:11:30,149
single person in all-state would have

00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:33,870
been able to tell you what they meant 12

00:11:30,149 --> 00:11:35,339
months later so we said you know maybe

00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:37,529
we need to take a different approach to

00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:40,019
this thing what we really care about is

00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:41,730
embodying the behaviors and the ideals

00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:43,199
of a Silicon Valley startup and

00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:45,509
transplanting that within our

00:11:43,199 --> 00:11:48,930
organization so we love this name

00:11:45,509 --> 00:11:51,600
composed because we it gives us visual

00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:53,579
indicators of you know an orchestra with

00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,290
a conductor and all these people working

00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:57,629
in harmony to build something that's of

00:11:55,290 --> 00:12:00,180
a greater good and then going on the

00:11:57,629 --> 00:12:02,459
nerdy side of it we talk about hey we

00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:03,899
can have fine-grained micro-services and

00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:06,660
start to compose these things together

00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:08,970
to uncover new business opportunities

00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:10,949
and new models that we can start to

00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:13,649
develop and index on and experiment with

00:12:10,949 --> 00:12:17,819
that could really unleash the next level

00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:19,980
of innovation for us it also did not

00:12:17,819 --> 00:12:24,050
hurt that once we changed the S to a Z

00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:24,050
legal gave us approval to move forward

00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:30,209
so it's really interesting because you

00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:33,269
know the composed brand is is emphasized

00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:35,429
on this idea of speed and moving fast

00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:37,230
and iterating quickly and then you've

00:12:35,429 --> 00:12:38,999
got the Allstate brand of safety and

00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:40,709
it'd be easy to say like yeah let's just

00:12:38,999 --> 00:12:42,959
keep those things completely separate

00:12:40,709 --> 00:12:45,540
and not and not have them integrated in

00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:47,370
any way and we've done that a little bit

00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:49,889
but we really wanted there to be a

00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:52,170
certain sense of harmony between the two

00:12:49,889 --> 00:12:54,629
we kept some of the color palette

00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:56,249
elements from the composed brand we made

00:12:54,629 --> 00:12:58,559
sure that it didn't look super awkward

00:12:56,249 --> 00:13:01,709
sitting next to the Allstate logo

00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:03,839
because we really wanted to highlight

00:13:01,709 --> 00:13:06,240
that these two things are complementary

00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,980
composed is an engine that empowers

00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,929
Allstate Allstate is an incredibly

00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:11,490
powerful brand that has a lot of meeting

00:13:09,929 --> 00:13:16,259
with our customers and with the general

00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:18,329
public and so we've built this symbol

00:13:16,259 --> 00:13:19,830
and this symbol has deep meaning for us

00:13:18,329 --> 00:13:23,310
you know we indexed on

00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:25,380
pairing and on the shape of the hexagon

00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:27,870
which basically symbolizes like a

00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:30,149
beehive and and all of these individuals

00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:32,540
working together and in a in a

00:13:30,149 --> 00:13:34,890
cooperative and engaging way to build

00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:39,180
something that's better than each

00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:41,820
individual and this symbol became an

00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:44,220
emblem or a flag for the change that we

00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:46,769
were trying to drive and really the fact

00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:50,760
that the change is touching every piece

00:13:46,769 --> 00:13:52,620
of our organization and as we were going

00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:54,930
through this and iterating we said hey

00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:57,660
you know what would be cool is if we

00:13:54,930 --> 00:14:02,190
could put powered by Allstate underneath

00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:04,200
that logo and needless to say corporate

00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:06,899
communications was not SuperDuper

00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:09,029
excited about that idea like not even a

00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:10,950
little bit and they were like well if

00:14:09,029 --> 00:14:14,519
you change her logo to the Allstate logo

00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:16,740
then that would be cool but they had

00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:18,930
proposed a number of compromises they're

00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:20,940
actually very pretty open-minded they

00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:23,250
had proposed a number of compromises

00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:25,290
which involved you know dropping the

00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:27,029
symbol and lower casing than Z and

00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:29,010
changing some fonts and color schemes

00:14:27,029 --> 00:14:30,660
and at the end of the day we had to

00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:32,730
bring it back to the outcomes we were

00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:34,649
trying to accomplish and say hey if we

00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:38,610
make these changes does this still feel

00:14:34,649 --> 00:14:40,260
like a Silicon Valley thing does this

00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:42,390
still embody those behaviors does this

00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:43,770
avail that still feel like a technology

00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:46,649
brand that's driving innovation

00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:47,940
experimentation we said no okay so what

00:14:46,649 --> 00:14:50,579
we'll do is we'll make minimal

00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:52,529
compromises so that the Allstate logo

00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:55,890
can exist in the same state as the

00:14:52,529 --> 00:14:58,980
composed logo but you know we won't

00:14:55,890 --> 00:15:00,690
actually make a lot of these broader

00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:02,490
changes that would allow the two to be

00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:05,839
tightly integrated with each other will

00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:09,240
ste still keep them somewhat separate

00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:11,310
hmm so as we sorted all this out we

00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:15,089
started to create t-shirts and I don't

00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:17,779
know about what you guys and ladies know

00:15:15,089 --> 00:15:20,940
about engineers but they love t-shirts

00:15:17,779 --> 00:15:22,949
it's amazing what a t-shirt can do to

00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:25,890
get people excited and galvanized around

00:15:22,949 --> 00:15:28,140
a route around a cause you know the

00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:30,660
symbol is something that folks started

00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:32,130
to unify around people in the

00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:33,329
organization would see somebody wearing

00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:35,129
the t-shirt and they would say

00:15:33,329 --> 00:15:38,279
where did you get that t-shirt I want to

00:15:35,129 --> 00:15:40,139
wear it and you know t-shirts aren't

00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:42,449
SuperDuper expensive I mean it was a

00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:44,699
really great tool for us to start to

00:15:42,449 --> 00:15:47,519
bring people together and circle them

00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:49,199
around something that was centralized in

00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,929
order to have a conversation about

00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:53,939
transformational change which is a hard

00:15:51,929 --> 00:15:56,100
topic for a lot of people to swallow and

00:15:53,939 --> 00:15:57,929
so it was really that conversation

00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:00,089
starter I think the other thing that's

00:15:57,929 --> 00:16:03,389
interesting is Allstate being a Midwest

00:16:00,089 --> 00:16:05,759
company most people do wear button-down

00:16:03,389 --> 00:16:08,970
shirts and like dress really formally

00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:10,589
and when the company buys you the

00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:12,299
t-shirt for some reason you're willing

00:16:10,589 --> 00:16:14,369
to wear it to work I don't know what's

00:16:12,299 --> 00:16:16,290
with that but as we're trying to drive a

00:16:14,369 --> 00:16:19,019
more casual atmosphere a more

00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:23,689
collaborative atmosphere around open

00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:26,610
feedback and really taking into account

00:16:23,689 --> 00:16:28,139
empowerment and collaboration we found

00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:29,670
that to be something that was really

00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:32,519
helped move us forward towards our

00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:34,439
objectives and everybody was happy and

00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:36,209
dancing in the street we had a flash mob

00:16:34,439 --> 00:16:41,790
in the middle of headquarters I'm pretty

00:16:36,209 --> 00:16:44,009
sure it was great but our work wasn't

00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:48,600
done right so we had to clarify this

00:16:44,009 --> 00:16:51,389
model and we had basically originally

00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:55,860
incepted this whole composed idea around

00:16:51,389 --> 00:16:57,239
Oh like it's all about the methodology

00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:58,829
and then as we developed it we're like

00:16:57,239 --> 00:17:01,110
oh my gosh it's not about the

00:16:58,829 --> 00:17:02,459
methodology it's about everything well

00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:05,839
let's clarify that because we're not

00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:09,360
going to call it composed everything so

00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:12,720
we broke the program down into three

00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:14,789
basic pillars composed Labs the composed

00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:18,029
methodology and the composed platform

00:17:14,789 --> 00:17:20,370
and so the labs was the physical

00:17:18,029 --> 00:17:23,069
location this is the defibrillator for

00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:24,959
our culture these are the changes in the

00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:27,059
environment and physical location that

00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:29,850
we're going to allow people and enable

00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:33,299
them to act and behave and work and

00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:35,639
deliver differently and so those were

00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:37,559
the the big original changes those were

00:17:35,639 --> 00:17:39,809
very visible people started to see these

00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:42,059
changes take place we started ripping

00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:44,520
down cubical farms and standing up these

00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:45,790
different locations and everyone was

00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:49,150
like what the hell is

00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:51,130
on here this is craziness and then we

00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:53,410
talk about the methodology and how we

00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:55,120
believe in hardcore engineering and

00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:56,890
test-driven development and doing

00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,290
continuous delivery and tightening

00:17:56,890 --> 00:18:01,780
feedback loops and things like DevOps

00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:03,190
and you know everybody gets excited

00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,690
about the words but then when they

00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:07,300
realize that it's actually gonna change

00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:10,810
their work maybe they're not as stoked

00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:12,640
on it and so we spend a lot of time

00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:14,710
talking about why we think this is key

00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,440
to success why we think you know

00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:19,440
integrating quality into the process of

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,460
building and deploying software is

00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:25,540
absolutely critical to be able to

00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:28,240
iterate quickly and we've still had some

00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:30,580
holdouts around core systems where

00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:33,220
people say well my service is to

00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:36,220
strategically important to the company

00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:39,310
for you to like test drive it or like

00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:41,500
build automated tests which is a

00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:43,630
challenge we try to be empathetic to

00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:45,400
that but it's roughly equivalent to say

00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:47,770
like I'm really great at driving

00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:49,900
blindfolded I kill a very predictable

00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:52,270
number of pedestrians on my way to work

00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:54,340
like why on earth would I take the

00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:56,920
blindfold off when I can just keep doing

00:18:54,340 --> 00:19:04,480
what I'm doing and like it's two a day

00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:06,460
it's not that bad so and then on the

00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:09,820
platform side we've built a platform and

00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:12,040
we've built cloud foundry as the center

00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:14,260
of our platform which is why this talk

00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:16,390
is relevant for this summit mmm but

00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:18,400
we've also built a bunch of services

00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:20,530
around that platform as we've gotten

00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,210
feedback from our developers one of the

00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:24,340
biggest services we built early was

00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:28,090
identity and single sign-on we found a

00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:30,730
huge need as applications had users that

00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:33,250
needed to bounce between our legacy

00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:34,450
stack and the new Cloud Foundry stack

00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:36,550
and we wanted that to be a seamless

00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:38,020
experience where the Allstate customer

00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:39,520
actually wouldn't know that that was

00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:41,320
happening and that was transparent from

00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,780
them so we spent a lot of time

00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:46,360
engineering that and then of course on

00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:48,100
the run side of actually making your app

00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:50,250
operable we have things around

00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:53,470
application performance monitoring and

00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:55,270
log analytics as well as pushing

00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:57,640
notifications for mobile and a few other

00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:59,320
services

00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,910
communicate communicate communicate if

00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:02,140
there's one lesson that you take away

00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:04,660
from this you can't do enough

00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:06,880
storytelling in communication we created

00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:08,530
a website a central landing page for

00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:13,120
people to learn more about what we're

00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:15,160
doing we do track engagement metrics on

00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:18,910
it they're not great offline

00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:20,950
conversations cannot replace one on one

00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:22,750
conversation guest speakers showing

00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:24,790
people how to do this it's a great

00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:27,429
mechanism for getting people into the

00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:29,470
pipeline and starting the discussion but

00:20:27,429 --> 00:20:32,590
it's not the end-all be-all and we've

00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:35,020
built a blog a newsletter a number of

00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:38,169
learning resources into here and we're

00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:40,120
seeing more use over time however again

00:20:38,169 --> 00:20:42,160
we really find that the more infective

00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:44,650
effective engagement mechanisms are

00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:46,990
things like hosting events hosting lunch

00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:49,059
and learns presenting at meetups and

00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:50,470
inviting colleagues works really well

00:20:49,059 --> 00:20:52,840
because then you're presenting out to

00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:55,360
the external community and we have

00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:57,610
expanded our reach into the external

00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,559
community like I said traditionally all

00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:01,299
states been very internal facing we've

00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:02,830
done some things that are different as

00:21:01,299 --> 00:21:04,600
many of you know we've joined the Cloud

00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:07,179
Foundry foundation that's a huge step

00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:09,790
forward for us and participating in open

00:21:07,179 --> 00:21:12,250
source in a more active way in addition

00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:15,309
we've founded the Cloud Foundry meetup

00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:17,919
group wit in Arizona which is now a

00:21:15,309 --> 00:21:19,929
hundred members large just and it's only

00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:23,200
maybe a year old which is fantastic

00:21:19,929 --> 00:21:26,650
we're seeing a ton of momentum there and

00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:29,260
we we use that to shore up our message

00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:30,640
and to give us a platform for the

00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:32,559
message that we have to carry about the

00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,299
cool things that we're doing as well as

00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:36,220
to interact with all of you and find out

00:21:34,299 --> 00:21:38,260
what you're doing around platforms and

00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:41,140
culture and transformational change

00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:43,960
because we're all in this together we're

00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:46,110
here to drive change and drive

00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:51,070
transformation and bring our companies

00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:53,620
into the modern era together we also

00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:55,840
clarified values and we had a few people

00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:57,549
that put together this composed

00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,559
manifesto and I thought it was really

00:21:57,549 --> 00:22:01,419
clever and it was really well branded

00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:03,820
and they did a great job I mean it in

00:22:01,419 --> 00:22:05,890
and of itself is a piece of art and it

00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:07,990
really hits on the core behaviors that

00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:09,640
we're trying to drive you see things on

00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:11,170
there like deliver as early as possible

00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:13,570
and foster learning

00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:15,730
empowerment those are key values and

00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:18,430
what we started to do is we actually

00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:20,680
started to say well what are our rules

00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:22,420
and I don't know if any of you were

00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:27,820
paying attention to the beginning of my

00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:29,680
talk hmm but that was a bad idea so this

00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:31,840
is not about rules we're saying this is

00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:34,270
about values there are implied rules

00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,520
here but what we actually care about our

00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:38,830
values and outcomes we care about

00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:41,800
respecting your pair and respecting your

00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:44,470
team and trying to get better and always

00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:49,650
putting the user first and continuously

00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:52,570
learning and we made cooler t-shirts and

00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:54,370
people got even more excited right these

00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:56,020
t-shirts are awesome they make people

00:22:54,370 --> 00:23:00,790
look like superheroes that's why I'm

00:22:56,020 --> 00:23:03,850
wearing it so I can feel cool and you

00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:06,460
know we saw even more momentum when Andy

00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:08,410
would give his All Hands he would wear a

00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:11,320
hoodie and t-shirts I can't tell you

00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:12,670
what having a leadership leader stand up

00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:16,180
in front of an organization with a

00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:19,030
hoodie and t-shirt does to cultural

00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:20,920
change it is absolutely amazing it all

00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:22,690
of a sudden makes it okay for everybody

00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:25,450
within that organization to participate

00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:27,460
in that change and it's not something we

00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:29,380
see very commonly today and I think it's

00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:30,700
something that as all of us as leaders

00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:34,360
should do more of if we're really

00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:36,970
serious about our teams participating in

00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:39,220
this way PowerPoint slides do not change

00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:46,630
culture changes in behavior change

00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:48,250
culture t-shirts are hard we learned

00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:49,720
that a lot I can't tell you how many

00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:52,090
different t-shirts from different

00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:55,690
vendors we printed and we probably

00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:57,730
through a few away all along the way but

00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:59,560
it was really important for us to make

00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:02,440
sure that the quality of something even

00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:04,090
as simple as t-shirts was important you

00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,800
know it was important to us it was a

00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:07,360
representative of this brand that we

00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,770
were creating it we were treating it

00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,930
like we were entrepreneurs of this

00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:12,820
company if people are gonna look at this

00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:15,160
symbol and think about what we're doing

00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:17,280
we wanted it to be of quality and that

00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:20,470
meant that we would get feedback from

00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:22,180
individuals of all sizes and all genders

00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:25,389
in order to figure out how to get this

00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:27,820
right because we got it wrong

00:24:25,389 --> 00:24:29,649
and you know this is one of those ways

00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:32,649
it's a simple thing but it's one of

00:24:29,649 --> 00:24:34,539
those ways that we consistently live the

00:24:32,649 --> 00:24:37,539
behaviors that we're trying to get the

00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:38,980
organization to participate in as we're

00:24:37,539 --> 00:24:41,169
iterating through this thing and it'd be

00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:43,179
very easy to be very dismissive and say

00:24:41,169 --> 00:24:45,309
oh it's just t-shirts we spent X number

00:24:43,179 --> 00:24:46,419
of dollars and we don't really want to

00:24:45,309 --> 00:24:48,129
redo the work because we've got all

00:24:46,419 --> 00:24:51,220
these t-shirts that nobody wants to wear

00:24:48,129 --> 00:24:53,740
but it's really important to send that

00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:55,690
message of we care about the quality we

00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:59,110
care about doing right by our engineers

00:24:55,690 --> 00:25:00,789
and our UX designers and our PM's we

00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:03,370
want them to feel like superheroes and

00:25:00,789 --> 00:25:06,070
we want to create clothing that's

00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:07,990
comfortable for diversity like we want

00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:10,720
this whole environment to feel welcoming

00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:12,759
to anyone who wants to participate and

00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,889
so there's nothing that will kill your

00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:16,389
culture faster than hypocrisy and that's

00:25:14,889 --> 00:25:17,919
one of the things that's really

00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:20,830
challenging with rules because you can

00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:23,139
only accumulate so many before at some

00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:26,110
point you have contradiction hitting you

00:25:23,139 --> 00:25:28,690
in the face then we took branding even

00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:30,190
further and we started to brand catch

00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:31,929
boxes and these are like these little

00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:33,399
pillows with microphones and then we

00:25:31,929 --> 00:25:37,120
throw them around during stand up so we

00:25:33,399 --> 00:25:38,950
can do global stand up and we decided to

00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,690
put the compose logo on there obviously

00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:42,250
because we brand everything that we do

00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:43,870
and we get people excited about what

00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:45,610
we're doing but we also put this

00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:48,490
beautiful just saying no to waterfall

00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:51,820
logo on there because that's what we're

00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:54,309
about like it Oh waterfall will exist at

00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:56,590
all State for a while but within the

00:25:54,309 --> 00:25:58,629
composed program we apply agile

00:25:56,590 --> 00:26:01,090
methodologies to anything and everything

00:25:58,629 --> 00:26:03,250
that we do and it looks cool and I want

00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:07,240
a t-shirt with it on there so that I can

00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:10,929
wear it but you know it was really a way

00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:12,490
to introduce fun and like you know you

00:26:10,929 --> 00:26:13,809
throw the catch box to somebody who's

00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:15,100
new into the environment and they look

00:26:13,809 --> 00:26:16,809
at that and I'm like I can't believe

00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:19,120
somebody let you put this on there and

00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:24,879
we're like they kind of didn't like we

00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:26,230
just did it anyway so as we've evolved

00:26:24,879 --> 00:26:27,669
this over time I realized there was a

00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:29,620
need for the composed accelerator

00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:31,720
program a training program for internal

00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:36,549
employees to expose them to the platform

00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:37,929
the methodology and the labs and it was

00:26:36,549 --> 00:26:40,240
what we found was real

00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:41,679
the interesting benefit as we said oh we

00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:45,309
just need something to shore up our

00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:46,960
skill set but actually cultural and

00:26:45,309 --> 00:26:48,879
transformational change is much bigger

00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,470
than just you need the skills to do

00:26:48,879 --> 00:26:52,029
test-driven development and what we

00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:53,440
found is by putting them in the

00:26:52,029 --> 00:26:55,899
environment exposing them to the

00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:59,080
platform and teaching them the skills of

00:26:55,899 --> 00:27:01,749
the methodology that culture was

00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:04,480
reinforced for 12 solid weeks day-in

00:27:01,749 --> 00:27:06,149
day-out and we were found that it really

00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,679
helped us accelerate the transformation

00:27:06,149 --> 00:27:11,379
by the end of this year I think we'll

00:27:08,679 --> 00:27:13,299
have over 250 developers developing

00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:15,730
against the compos'd platform was

00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:17,440
fabulous momentum considering that I

00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:20,289
think we started the year at less than a

00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:22,179
hundred so we're seeing that doubling

00:27:20,289 --> 00:27:23,529
factor we're seeing growth we're seeing

00:27:22,179 --> 00:27:24,399
it organically and we're super excited

00:27:23,529 --> 00:27:29,169
about it

00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:31,360
mm-hmm compose changes the game you know

00:27:29,169 --> 00:27:32,769
as we start to embrace these behaviors

00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:36,029
as we start to look at our talent

00:27:32,769 --> 00:27:38,950
pipeline holistically we used to treat

00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:40,179
campus recruiting separate from we're

00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:42,999
gonna recruit from other companies

00:27:40,179 --> 00:27:45,909
separate from we're gonna recruit at

00:27:42,999 --> 00:27:47,110
community event XYZ and we actually had

00:27:45,909 --> 00:27:49,029
like different people running those

00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:51,220
things and we've actually started to

00:27:49,029 --> 00:27:53,559
internalize some of that and say you

00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:55,090
know the whole talent pipeline is a

00:27:53,559 --> 00:27:57,100
strategy and we need to lean on our

00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:59,289
existing developers and resources in

00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:01,149
order to help us recruit because they're

00:27:59,289 --> 00:28:03,039
going to be the best vocal advocates of

00:28:01,149 --> 00:28:04,840
what we're trying to do and it's really

00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:06,039
funny when you interview engineers

00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:09,159
you're like yeah we're doing agile

00:28:06,039 --> 00:28:11,440
they're like uh-huh and you're like no

00:28:09,159 --> 00:28:17,049
seriously like and they're like uh-huh

00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:19,090
sure you are all state whatever and so

00:28:17,049 --> 00:28:22,059
it's really important for us to have

00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:24,039
that advocacy because the developers can

00:28:22,059 --> 00:28:25,299
stand in front of their peers in front

00:28:24,039 --> 00:28:27,490
of their peers in the community and say

00:28:25,299 --> 00:28:29,470
hey no this is real we are really doing

00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:31,360
this my boss put a meeting on my

00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:34,799
calendar that says don't go to meetings

00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:37,840
like that's a real thing that we did and

00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:39,789
the developers love it because they are

00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,289
connected to the value that they're

00:28:39,789 --> 00:28:44,440
delivering and they feel like they have

00:28:41,289 --> 00:28:47,950
meaningful work this is the first time

00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:50,559
we've changed everything literally we

00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:51,730
are changing everything nothing is out

00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:53,409
of scope for this per

00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:56,200
we're touching real estate were touching

00:28:53,409 --> 00:28:58,450
HR we're touching application design and

00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:00,399
customer focus many of us have been a

00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:02,830
part of change programs that touch one

00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:05,080
of these items or another but this is

00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:06,730
the first time at least as Allstate that

00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:08,620
we've touched all of it and it's the

00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:11,440
reason that we've seen such momentum and

00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:14,350
success thus far nothing is out of scope

00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,940
and I think we see some groups kind of

00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:18,429
like cowering away like please don't

00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:21,789
like touch me like go away leave me

00:29:18,429 --> 00:29:25,419
alone stop spreading this crazy agile

00:29:21,789 --> 00:29:29,320
stuff and so it's been really powerful

00:29:25,419 --> 00:29:31,240
and and you know like Doug said the role

00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:33,850
of the management and the leadership

00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:36,789
layer has really been just unblocked

00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:38,889
unblocked unblocked take feedback on how

00:29:36,789 --> 00:29:41,200
we can be better how we can enable these

00:29:38,889 --> 00:29:44,710
distributed teams to be empowered in

00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:47,169
collaborate and learn and go do more

00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:51,700
unblocking at every layer no matter what

00:29:47,169 --> 00:29:54,309
it takes lessons learned iterate quickly

00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:55,750
so like I said when we started out we

00:29:54,309 --> 00:29:57,309
had no idea what we're doing we still

00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:58,630
maybe have no idea what we're doing but

00:29:57,309 --> 00:30:01,840
we're pushing forward and we're learning

00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:04,450
a lot as we're going communicate always

00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:05,950
I hit on communications and the website

00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:08,169
that we built and how important

00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:10,269
storytelling is it's why I'm here

00:30:08,169 --> 00:30:11,799
telling you this story because people in

00:30:10,269 --> 00:30:13,929
my organization will watch this on

00:30:11,799 --> 00:30:15,279
youtube and send me nasty notes about

00:30:13,929 --> 00:30:17,980
all the things I said that I shouldn't

00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:20,260
have said and constantly be inclusive

00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:24,100
right so we got to be empathetic there's

00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:27,159
this bimodal challenge where like I

00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:30,549
think Bridgette calls it awesome mode

00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:33,730
and sad mode like it creates this

00:30:30,549 --> 00:30:35,440
dichotomy of competition and resistance

00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:38,139
and that's really not what we're trying

00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:41,620
to create like the people in your legacy

00:30:38,139 --> 00:30:42,399
stacks are really proud that they re

00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:47,019
platformed

00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:48,700
their what like it took them 10 years to

00:30:47,019 --> 00:30:50,110
Rhett what pre platform under WebSphere

00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:52,480
like they're really excited about that

00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:54,669
as an amazing accomplishment and you can

00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:57,190
stand at back at that and throw stones

00:30:54,669 --> 00:30:59,350
but you really need to be empathetic and

00:30:57,190 --> 00:31:01,629
start to understand it and really see

00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:03,190
like ok why did it take 10 years like

00:31:01,629 --> 00:31:05,500
what are the learnings here and let's

00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:07,900
build a shared purpose around

00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:10,150
going and like making this easier next

00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:13,590
time because I'm pretty sure they

00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:15,460
wouldn't want to do that again either

00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:17,230
understanding incentives how do we

00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:19,420
incentivize people how do we make sure

00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:21,340
the environment is conducive for them to

00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:24,040
be successful how do we make sure that

00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:26,530
they get public notoriety and kudos when

00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:28,680
they go out and give public talks when

00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:31,420
they live the behaviors we want to see

00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:33,220
you know obviously changing performance

00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:34,930
management within a company the size of

00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:38,350
Allstate is super challenging and we're

00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:40,420
not there yet but we do everything we

00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:43,840
possibly can whether it's through little

00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:45,520
gestures or personal emails or taking

00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:47,710
teams out to lunch in order to try and

00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:49,330
reinforce those behaviors and actually

00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:51,280
it's those little personal things that

00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:53,410
make a much bigger difference than

00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:56,230
getting an email from the CTO who

00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:59,470
someone's never met that says like hey

00:31:56,230 --> 00:32:02,590
congratulations like I don't know here's

00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:04,900
a sock or something yeah I don't know it

00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:06,850
you know some some willy nilly gift

00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:09,460
that's very impersonal and kind of

00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:11,650
disconnected so that personal high-touch

00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:13,960
is like really an important part of this

00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:17,080
and like getting to know people in the

00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:18,460
human aspect and and really kind of

00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:21,370
understanding like how this stuff

00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:23,620
evolves and then living the culture at

00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:26,170
all levels you heard me hit on when at

00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:28,000
the start of my talk about nothing will

00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:30,430
kill your culture like hypocrisy I'm

00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,080
gonna repeat that again because it's

00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:33,700
absolutely true I mean that's the

00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:35,890
challenge with the rules which says oh

00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:39,460
we have a rule that says you can't ride

00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:42,010
scooters because their tools of

00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:44,020
vehicular destruction and you're like oh

00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:45,970
maybe not so much you're like well

00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:47,740
that's really interesting like but we

00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:49,390
you give us bikes to ride across the

00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:50,770
parking lot because the buildings are so

00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:52,150
far apart and that doesn't really seem

00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:54,730
particularly safe either and they're

00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:58,500
like oh it's cool like if you get killed

00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:58,500
outside that's all right

00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:10,330
but if you sprain your ankle inside then

00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:11,890
we've got a problem so this is my

00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:14,200
mission statement this is our emblem

00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:16,150
we're composed we're serious about

00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:18,310
building software craftsmanship

00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:21,760
we've galvanized around this symbol

00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:24,490
we're changing everything and we're

00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:25,930
super excited about the cultural change

00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:28,120
that we're driving and being a real

00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:30,960
software company within all state that's

00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:30,960
all I have thank you

00:33:35,299 --> 00:33:52,999
I guess oh so Allstate is a big company

00:33:50,239 --> 00:33:54,529
you guys have a compensation structure

00:33:52,999 --> 00:33:57,499
similar to all the big companies you

00:33:54,529 --> 00:33:59,090
have a base and a bonus and all that how

00:33:57,499 --> 00:34:02,299
do you change your performance

00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:05,299
evaluation structure and the process to

00:34:02,299 --> 00:34:07,940
match with the cultural change you're

00:34:05,299 --> 00:34:10,190
talking about sure so I think like

00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:12,260
anything you have to iterate into it so

00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:15,440
there while your performance and

00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:18,589
compensation structure is something if

00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:21,440
you have buy-in at least at the local

00:34:18,589 --> 00:34:24,200
organizational level you can definitely

00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:27,260
have conversations about how you rank

00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:29,089
people and make sure that as you're

00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:30,260
ranking individuals and as you're going

00:34:29,089 --> 00:34:33,950
through the performance management

00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:36,589
process if you say hey this person is a

00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:38,510
top performer can you stand back and

00:34:36,589 --> 00:34:40,220
look at the values and behaviors that

00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:42,740
you want and say that that person

00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:44,960
embodies those because if the answer's

00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:47,240
no they're probably not a top performer

00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,409
and that's a really hard conversation to

00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:50,119
have with your peers but it's a

00:34:48,409 --> 00:34:53,480
conversation that needs to be had and

00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:56,419
then furthermore usually there are small

00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:58,430
bonuses and tokens of appreciation like

00:34:56,419 --> 00:35:00,710
I said you have to use those to your

00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:02,990
advantage as you iterate into the larger

00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:05,900
conversation with HR encumbers and

00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:08,000
compensation and other teams to really

00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:13,970
make meaningful impactful long-lasting

00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:17,780
change questions just wondering how much

00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:20,329
and you know internally have you guys

00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:22,130
like people not being on board this and

00:35:20,329 --> 00:35:24,020
the attrition rate I did you guys a

00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:27,109
turnover increase because some people

00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:32,150
just couldn't make this shift to a more

00:35:27,109 --> 00:35:36,140
DevOps e agile type environment so we

00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:37,700
have seen some it depends on the group

00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:39,650
I'll say that it depends on the group

00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:41,540
we've seen some increase in some

00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:44,180
localized increase in nutrition in

00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:46,010
certain cases where we've tried to make

00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:47,510
their shift more aggressively and folks

00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:49,730
have said oh this isn't for me

00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:52,160
in most cases we've been able to locate

00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:54,020
them positions elsewhere in the company

00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:57,710
or within on other teams but we've also

00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:59,600
seen the opposite effect where somebody

00:35:57,710 --> 00:36:01,610
will engage in a conversation with their

00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:03,170
team a waterfall team that's maybe not

00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:05,450
ready to make that transformation and

00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:07,130
usually what happens is one or two of

00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:09,830
the top engineers step forward and they

00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:11,510
say actually I want to do this like can

00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:13,490
you help me find a job in a team that's

00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:15,590
actually going to do this because I want

00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:17,540
to participate so it's kind of an

00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:19,610
interesting dynamic it's kind of a

00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:23,510
shuffling of the piece on the plate a

00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:26,140
little bit right now you know there are

00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:29,830
certainly some people who've opted out

00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:32,750
but you know I don't know if that's just

00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:34,430
they like going to meetings all day long

00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:37,600
and sitting on the phone I mean some

00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:37,600
people are kind of into that right

00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:43,940
programming engineer I know that you

00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:45,380
learn well while pairing on the job is

00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:47,390
there a reason why you guys chose to

00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:52,160
have a training center so spent 810

00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:54,350
weeks training the engineers so the

00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:57,220
training center why did we choose to

00:36:54,350 --> 00:37:01,070
have a training center is the question

00:36:57,220 --> 00:37:03,080
because it was important that we helped

00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:05,120
people get comfortable with pairing

00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:07,490
because none of these folks had ever

00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:09,800
pair program before induct many of them

00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:11,930
haven't programmed at all in a very long

00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:15,730
time so it was bringing their skills

00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:18,140
back up to back up to snuff and

00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:20,510
communicating patterns that are that are

00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:22,070
now well accepted that maybe five to ten

00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:24,170
years ago weren't things like twelve

00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:26,300
factor application architectures and

00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:29,600
what are best practices for how to do

00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:31,310
release management as well as like

00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:33,050
getting people shored up on test-driven

00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:35,420
development which if you haven't done

00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:37,430
before is a different mindset in a

00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:39,230
different way of thinking so we felt

00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:42,680
like wrapping the training around all of

00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:47,540
that would help people to adjust a

00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:49,670
little bit more seamlessly hi there nice

00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:53,720
talk hey quick question

00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:55,010
on coming from a communications my my

00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:56,690
communications interests of what you're

00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:57,890
doing put up a little slide there talked

00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:59,240
about getting real estate involved

00:37:57,890 --> 00:38:00,190
getting a couple of other groups

00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:02,530
involved I want

00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:04,450
where are you with going outside of your

00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:06,069
developer team because there does seem

00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:09,190
to be this danger of making this an

00:38:06,069 --> 00:38:11,260
either-or thing cool not so cool and you

00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:12,609
don't want to do that yeah like what are

00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:14,440
you doing are you doing stand ups are

00:38:12,609 --> 00:38:15,369
you doing Tuesday talks what are what

00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,720
are some ways that you're actually

00:38:15,369 --> 00:38:19,450
talking to other teams in your own team

00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:21,490
yeah we do all of those things so we're

00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:22,930
doing stand-up in Tuesdays there we

00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:24,640
don't do Tuesday talks about we do lunch

00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:28,359
and learns things like that community

00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:30,400
events we still battle what you're

00:38:28,359 --> 00:38:32,560
talking about right this is the core

00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,420
cool team the awesome mode versus sad

00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:36,220
mode thing there were you know I like to

00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:39,609
call it bridging the bimodal gap right

00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:42,220
so bimodal drives this wedge into your

00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:46,770
organization and it's a terrible

00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:50,589
terrible thing and so it's really about

00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:52,390
empathy as developers come over they

00:38:50,589 --> 00:38:53,710
tend to reach out to their friends that

00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:55,510
they've been working with for a long

00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:58,210
time and kind of spread the message and

00:38:55,510 --> 00:39:00,609
say hey I'm and you know Doug talked

00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:02,740
about the frozen middle and that's where

00:39:00,609 --> 00:39:05,020
we see a lot of the misinformation come

00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:08,109
from because they're trying to protect

00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:10,660
like hey I don't want to come off as the

00:39:08,109 --> 00:39:12,940
bad guy for not letting you go agile cuz

00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:15,910
as Doug said like the engineers want to

00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:20,650
and so there's this hesitation kind of

00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:22,450
at that frozen middle level and the way

00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:24,310
to manage through that I guess is just

00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:26,050
to kind of use the interpersonal

00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:28,480
relationships in direct communication as

00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:30,940
much as possible we're trying to get

00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:34,930
better at it what we've started to see

00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:36,550
is where we have business level buy-in

00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:37,599
where our business partners are bought

00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:39,460
into what we're doing and they're

00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:43,150
starting to see the difference that

00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:45,520
those leaders who've been unthawed so to

00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:47,349
speak are starting to have a discussion

00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:50,230
about how they transition their entire

00:39:47,349 --> 00:39:53,829
portfolio into this way of working so

00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:56,020
the the transition becomes more of how

00:39:53,829 --> 00:39:58,119
do we integrate it back in but we're

00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:59,619
very careful about the facts that we

00:39:58,119 --> 00:40:02,440
don't integrate it back into quick

00:39:59,619 --> 00:40:04,569
because what we found is that if we

00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:06,730
start to do that then the the corporate

00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:08,980
culture like Doug said with the gravity

00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:10,780
it will suck you back in and next thing

00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:12,280
you know you're integrating with teams

00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:13,600
in your organization who are going to

00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:16,090
meeting you to death and what you

00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:20,430
prepare 8,000 architecture diagrams to

00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:20,430
like change a print print line statement

00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:30,240
have you guys had success bleeding some

00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:33,839
of these practices into other

00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:37,670
departments like IT security the larger

00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:42,060
business as a whole architecture yeah so

00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:43,800
we've had hmm it's been interesting from

00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:46,530
an architecture perspective the role has

00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:48,630
changed a little bit it's a more of a

00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:51,000
consulting role early on and then maybe

00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:53,220
if if we need architectural leadership

00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:56,070
they get plugged into the dev team like

00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:59,280
we're very insistent on this like hey

00:40:56,070 --> 00:41:02,730
who ever liked architecture security

00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:05,010
real estate you know risk and governance

00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:06,990
we're not gonna show up to some meeting

00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:08,670
that's scheduled once a week that you're

00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:10,650
gonna only show up to like half the time

00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:12,810
like we're not gonna waste everybody's

00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:14,339
time that way if you want to have input

00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:15,960
into how we do this like give us a

00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:17,150
person and we will transplant them into

00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:20,040
the team and we will be happy to

00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:22,020
represent that interest and we've had a

00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:23,700
lot of success actually we're just

00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:26,940
starting I'm really excited we're just

00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:28,740
starting on a tool to allow us to

00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:31,950
automate the provisioning of firewall

00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:33,630
rules which is like not a thing and

00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:35,550
we've managed to find a partner within

00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:37,319
the security organization was like yeah

00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:40,140
this can be done and like I'm really

00:41:37,319 --> 00:41:42,510
tired of working weekends and so like

00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:43,859
let's let's do this and he's been a

00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:47,130
great partner he's partnered with our

00:41:43,859 --> 00:41:48,660
developers and again it's putting each

00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:51,180
other you know getting in each other's

00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:52,589
shoes and he's like hey this I don't

00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:54,119
like this this doesn't feel secure and

00:41:52,589 --> 00:41:55,079
we're like hey we don't like this this

00:41:54,119 --> 00:41:57,180
feels like a terrible customer

00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:58,500
experience like maybe we can meet in the

00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:06,869
middle and like figure out how to work

00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:09,210
together right all right the process of

00:42:06,869 --> 00:42:11,369
change you have for the the engineering

00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:14,339
and developers what have you done to

00:42:11,369 --> 00:42:16,800
help your business partners get better

00:42:14,339 --> 00:42:19,109
and more focused around requirements and

00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:22,410
not having you know a three year six

00:42:19,109 --> 00:42:24,510
month design phase I think that we're in

00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:26,910
the beginning stages of earning

00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:29,700
credibility and I think that was really

00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:31,410
important like we had to start this

00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:33,630
journey knowing that we had lost

00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:36,569
credibility with the business on our

00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:38,400
delivery and know that we were gonna

00:42:36,569 --> 00:42:39,800
catch up and get to the place that we

00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,180
needed to be so

00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:43,040
that we could then go have the

00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:45,260
conversation we're talking about that

00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:47,420
you're talking about and we have a

00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:48,830
couple strategic business areas where

00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:51,290
we've started to have that conversation

00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:53,360
and we started to orient it around

00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:56,750
metrics how do you how are you seeing

00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:58,970
whatever they call the the pirate and if

00:42:56,750 --> 00:43:01,730
you call it pirate metrics the our thing

00:42:58,970 --> 00:43:02,840
which is like adoption and I can't

00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:04,820
remember what they are but anyway

00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:06,860
there's some metrics about you know how

00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:08,660
are you driving business value into your

00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:09,860
products and those are the conversations

00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:12,650
we want to take back to the business

00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:15,440
partners because that's a value like hey

00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:17,300
we delivered this in MVP in eight weeks

00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,890
and guess what nobody wants to use it so

00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:21,890
like let's just kill it and like let's

00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:23,570
go do something fruitful but that's a

00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:25,790
tough conversation to have when you

00:43:23,570 --> 00:43:29,980
they're used to you taking nine months

00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:32,510
to deliver anything two quick questions

00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:35,570
one can you quantify the difference

00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:38,690
between the compose team and the rest of

00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:40,940
traditional and then even Gartner likes

00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:42,820
to talk about this bimodal you know

00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:45,770
systems of record systems of engagement

00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:48,800
concept any other thoughts about how to

00:43:45,770 --> 00:43:53,620
try and minimize that us-versus-them

00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:56,000
mentality um I have a couple thoughts

00:43:53,620 --> 00:44:04,040
how do you want me to quantify it like

00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:07,070
people account oh that's a tough so

00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:08,960
whatever what percentage do you I'm

00:44:07,070 --> 00:44:17,780
looking at Linda what percentage do you

00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:20,990
think it's about - yep we're 200 out of

00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:26,540
7,000 so it's a very small percentage

00:44:20,990 --> 00:44:28,550
but yeah yeah it's leaps and bounds like

00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:29,960
I said it's the doubling effect and then

00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:34,370
on your question about bimodal

00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:36,880
I think awesome mode the people who are

00:44:34,370 --> 00:44:40,070
in awesome mode have to go after

00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:41,600
optimizing legacy systems because as you

00:44:40,070 --> 00:44:43,100
build new systems they'll have

00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:45,050
dependencies into the legacy

00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:47,030
infrastructure and you can't have your

00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:48,470
agile team waiting six to eight months

00:44:47,030 --> 00:44:51,260
for a test environment from your

00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:53,510
waterfall team and so as you start to

00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:53,900
create that bridge and actually do

00:44:53,510 --> 00:44:57,340
things

00:44:53,900 --> 00:45:03,350
to help people in sad mode they become

00:44:57,340 --> 00:45:04,850
mildly upset mode well that's it I think

00:45:03,350 --> 00:45:05,330
I'm out of time thank you for all your

00:45:04,850 --> 00:45:10,520
questions

00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:10,520
