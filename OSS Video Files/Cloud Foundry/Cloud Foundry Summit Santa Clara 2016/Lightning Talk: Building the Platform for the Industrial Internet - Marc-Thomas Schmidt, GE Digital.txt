hi my name is Martin wash mitt I've

00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:07,200
worked for GE Digital and I want to talk

00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,510
a few minutes about the platform for the

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,700
industrial Internet of products that

00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:15,949
were building at the key digital

00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:18,900
facility in San Ramon across the bay and

00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:25,580
what I want to start with is actually

00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:25,580
showing you a chart can I get the chart

00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:33,300
so I've been I'm gonna start off by

00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:39,090
basically talking talking a little bit

00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:41,010
about how to position the platform that

00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:43,320
we're building I could tell you that

00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:44,700
prediction is an IOT platform but that

00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,420
wouldn't tell you much because there's

00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,110
so many of them

00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:51,449
there is variations on the theme of IOT

00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,030
platforms wherever you go you see them

00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:57,870
often being created as extensions to

00:00:54,030 --> 00:01:00,000
existing systems out there for example

00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:03,149
enterprise systems are often extended

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,040
with with IOT extensions are Salesforce

00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:08,400
or commerce has an IOT play I'll tell

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,860
you also see a lot of IOT platforms

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,810
emerging in consumer space the things

00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:15,630
that basically were the things that you

00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:18,000
want to want to integrate in your house

00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:20,220
the thermos starts the the toothbrushes

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,650
that you have and again those are often

00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:25,110
kind of implemented extensions to

00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:27,479
existing systems of engagement I think

00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:28,560
the really interesting action I'm a

00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:30,450
little biased here but really

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,270
interesting actually an IOT space at the

00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:35,220
moment is at the industrial end of the

00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:39,900
spectrum where the things that you're

00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:41,490
basically dealing with in that IO IO T

00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,829
their industrial assets they're

00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:45,329
relatively complex machines the kind of

00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:47,939
machines that GE actually builds for

00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:49,979
example wind turbines or gas turbines or

00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:52,170
locomotives or MRI machines that

00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:55,020
basically look inside a patient and give

00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:57,299
you a 3d picture of what they have and I

00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:59,460
think the reason why much of the really

00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:02,040
interesting advanced action happens in

00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:05,070
this space the reason why you see the

00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,930
pure play IOT applications not

00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:08,910
extensions to existing systems but

00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:10,709
systems I really focus on assets and

00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:13,800
nothing but ask why they happen in that

00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:14,180
space is two reasons reason number one

00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,730
is

00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:18,680
the things out there that you find in

00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:20,329
the industrial space they have been

00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,280
instrumented for a while they're really

00:02:20,329 --> 00:02:24,319
well instrumented they're well connected

00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,480
they give you a ton of information even

00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,980
before I achieve other thing so you have

00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,140
a spectrum of really interesting

00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:31,909
machines out there they can tap into and

00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:33,950
extract your information and then the

00:02:31,909 --> 00:02:35,060
second thing is the applications that

00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:37,489
you can build in this space

00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:40,280
I'll give you immediate value if you can

00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:42,140
optimize the behavior of a wind farm or

00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,459
a fleet of wind farms out there there's

00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:48,200
immediate business value if you can

00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:49,609
optimize our the rail system in the

00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,980
northwest of there of the United States

00:02:49,609 --> 00:02:54,530
there's immediate business value so when

00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:56,299
we set out to basically build our two

00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:58,519
each platform for the industrial

00:02:56,299 --> 00:03:00,379
Internet one of the things that we made

00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:01,370
one of the decisions we made from her

00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:03,650
from an architectural perspective

00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:05,750
earlier on was we said going to build is

00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:07,819
entirely on open source we do not want

00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:10,340
to reemployment a bunch of things that

00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:12,230
we find out there so basically three

00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:14,989
three quick things on this chart that

00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:16,760
place it gives you the GE platform we're

00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:18,379
not sure thing number one is for

00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:22,040
standing on the shoulders of open-source

00:03:18,379 --> 00:03:24,349
Giants we're using a lot of technology

00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,819
that was innovated in the context of

00:03:24,349 --> 00:03:28,819
systems of engagement when it comes to

00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:30,199
big data analytics we're using Kafka and

00:03:28,819 --> 00:03:32,329
Cassandra and the like

00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:35,540
but also very importantly we pick cloud

00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:37,400
foundry as our cloud platform it's the

00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:40,250
environment that basically enables us to

00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,900
build and deploy at scale the kind of

00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:43,790
applications the service system micro

00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:45,260
services that make out the platform but

00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:47,000
more importantly it enables us to

00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:48,290
actually work with many many partners

00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,829
that we have so that they can add

00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:54,799
services to our our ecosystem the cloud

00:03:51,829 --> 00:03:56,060
service you see on top of on top of this

00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,379
chart so what we innovated in the

00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:59,000
platform is creating and building out

00:03:57,379 --> 00:04:02,479
those micro services on cloud foundry

00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,650
and the last comment I want to make on

00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:05,510
this chart is an interesting challenge

00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:07,010
that we're facing that either T

00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:08,900
platforms especially the ones in the

00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:10,940
industrial internet that they do not

00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:12,979
only live in a cloud what I'm showing in

00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:14,659
this picture here is that basically we

00:04:12,979 --> 00:04:16,099
have a variation on the hybrid theme

00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:18,049
that that built hearthstone

00:04:16,099 --> 00:04:19,699
but in this case hybrid is not kind of a

00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:21,530
private cloud in a data center on the

00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:23,930
enterprise connecting to a public cloud

00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:26,630
the hybrid here is actually a presence

00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,740
of the platform close to the devices we

00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:29,930
need basically put

00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:32,120
other applications beyond the boundaries

00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:33,710
of the cloud we refer to this edge of

00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,330
the clouds we pushed and basically out

00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:37,699
there into the environment we have

00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:39,259
analytics that operate on those

00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:40,940
industrial machines close to those

00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:43,280
machines we push them into the winter

00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:45,220
lights we push them out to the the wind

00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:48,139
farms we put them onto the local motors

00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:49,669
that drive around there so so one of the

00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:51,740
challenges we're facing is how come I'm

00:04:49,669 --> 00:04:53,900
basically push the concept of cloud

00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:56,630
computing outside of the data center

00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:58,910
into the real world and now we have a

00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:00,620
few interesting applications that are

00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:02,840
just going to catch on here with basic

00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:05,120
event life with this platform a few

00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:06,620
months ago here's here's a few really

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,229
interesting applications that we built

00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:11,419
on top of that as part of the work that

00:05:09,229 --> 00:05:12,919
our team is doing when are only using

00:05:11,419 --> 00:05:15,020
Cloud Foundry were actually helping to

00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:18,080
extend it there's a few things that we

00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:19,960
found that a cloud platform that was

00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,370
meant to basically cater to

00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:24,470
transactional systems as it's lacking so

00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:26,419
our teams have been working on adding

00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:28,550
IOT extensions to cloud foundry to

00:05:26,419 --> 00:05:30,800
enable more event based communication

00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:32,630
and then as I said the big challenge

00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,849
that we're currently facing is how can

00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:37,009
we make use of the multi cloud

00:05:34,849 --> 00:05:39,380
capabilities that cloud foundry has we

00:05:37,009 --> 00:05:41,599
run our own data centers we also deploy

00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,919
our platform into public clouds but how

00:05:41,599 --> 00:05:45,199
can we take the next step how can we

00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:47,570
basically make it so that the cloud

00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,969
platform in a native way can actually

00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:52,039
get into the edge of the cloud into the

00:05:49,969 --> 00:05:54,409
gateways into the controller's closer to

00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:55,580
the sensors out there gives us basically

00:05:54,409 --> 00:05:58,400
that environment in which we can then

00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:59,870
deploy end-to-end applications from the

00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,210
point where where the wind turbine is

00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:04,060
out there in the field to the cloud tech

00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:06,979
and that once the analytics across it

00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:08,509
that's in a nutshell if you want to see

00:06:06,979 --> 00:06:10,849
a lot more about this we have a booth

00:06:08,509 --> 00:06:13,710
over there and the exhibition so please

00:06:10,849 --> 00:06:18,060
go and take a look at critics thank you

00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:18,060
