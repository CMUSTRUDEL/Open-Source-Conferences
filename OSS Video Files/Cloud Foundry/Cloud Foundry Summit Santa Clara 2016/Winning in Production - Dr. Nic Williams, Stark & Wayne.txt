Title: Winning in Production - Dr. Nic Williams, Stark & Wayne
Publication date: 2016-05-29
Playlist: Cloud Foundry Summit Santa Clara 2016
Description: 
	Dr. Nic tells a ten year story from learning to create web applications but not yet knowing how to run them in production, thru to his discovery of Cloud Foundry, and its use in production by clients for over 10,000 applications in 2015. 

It includes a demonstration of deploying a new application to Cloud Foundry, seeing the logs and running database migrations - all which form the backdrop for Dr Nic's wide ranging perspectives and humour. 

Dr. Nic Williams
Dr Nic has been working with BOSH and Cloud Foundry for 4 years; is the CEO of Stark & Wayne, the largest consultancy focused on Cloud Foundry operations and enablement. Previous he was VP Technology at Engine Yard.

	00:00:00,349 --> 00:00:06,750
let's start 10 years ago literally 10

00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:08,250
years ago was for many people we started

00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:12,480
asked the question how the hell did

00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:14,460
Google do Google Maps like if you

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,160
remember the web back then like there

00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,720
was we all had webmail where you would

00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,339
write this long mail and you press send

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,509
and it would crash and your mail would

00:00:20,339 --> 00:00:26,009
be gone and and Google fix that I mean

00:00:24,509 --> 00:00:32,040
they did so much else with Google with

00:00:26,009 --> 00:00:34,140
Gmail in autosave was magical and and

00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,670
then Google Maps like there's no way

00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,950
they were loading all that map in the

00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:40,770
browser at the start they were doing

00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:43,740
something credible that was given a name

00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:45,450
called Ajax about the same time there

00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:47,520
was this new web framework that came out

00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:49,080
built on it and what with me a new

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,340
language in fact I didn't even see the

00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,510
language at the time to me it was all

00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,940
this thing called rails there was this

00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:56,340
Danish guy who had a little squeaky

00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:58,340
voice and he was very excited about this

00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:01,650
thing he'd built called Ruben Reyes and

00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:05,249
and to me the web came alive and I was

00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:07,320
so excited but I had this problem and

00:01:05,249 --> 00:01:11,869
the problem was even though I could make

00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:16,009
my app be awesome on my Windows laptop I

00:01:11,869 --> 00:01:18,990
had no idea what happened next

00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:20,640
like I was cheap I didn't really want to

00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:23,549
pay for hosting but even if he did want

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,780
to pay for hosting you know that no one

00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:30,420
knew how to run rails apps in you know

00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:32,069
2005-2006 and the ones that said they

00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:36,420
did would charge a lot of money relative

00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:37,950
to my budget of zero and you know I was

00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,880
just making these little trivial things

00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:44,219
so I had this this this this life lesson

00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,799
that I've sort of carried on and really

00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:50,249
does apply it's um if you want to win in

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:54,840
production you do have to be in

00:01:50,249 --> 00:02:00,600
production there is a joke I held I saw

00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:03,029
in total once it was the admin comes to

00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,979
the to the to the developers says yeah

00:02:03,029 --> 00:02:07,799
and the developer says well it works on

00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:09,479
my machine and the admin says great back

00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:11,380
up your email because it's done in a

00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,490
production

00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:14,630
the whole problem yeah there's so many

00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:16,340
problems we trying to solve here in

00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:18,790
Cloud Foundry but they're getting your

00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:22,070
app off your laptop and Inter production

00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:25,250
like fractions of seconds after you've

00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:26,870
started I think is essential don't muck

00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:28,580
around thinking that the experience

00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:30,830
you're having a laptop is at all

00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:33,860
relevant get it into your production

00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:35,980
environment so back then there were a

00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:39,170
couple of barriers to production one was

00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:40,190
one was technical I didn't know how to

00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:43,070
deploy rails the other one is

00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:48,830
institutional for many people back then

00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:52,070
rails was knew it wasn't Java and they

00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:53,870
would sort of told you no allowed to

00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:55,100
there's no we have no way to deploy this

00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:57,530
thing we don't know what it is we don't

00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:58,490
know how that led to things like JRuby

00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:02,090
where it's like you know what we can

00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:06,160
hide this let's put it in a war file and

00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:09,020
I won't know that's very clever I proved

00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:11,510
but for many of us we have this

00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:15,380
institutional problems seven years ago

00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:19,060
seven and a half years ago I was I had

00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:21,380
that ten years ago I was living overseas

00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:22,940
which I guess technically I know I I

00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:25,130
don't know where I live now so I was

00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:27,800
living in I discovered rails when I was

00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:31,130
in India just to make this a whole

00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:32,930
organic and so you can imagine you know

00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:35,720
I was pretty desperate for any anything

00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:36,800
that might eventually be the next thing

00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,830
that got me out of in my current

00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:41,720
situation seven years ago is back in

00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:46,640
Australia is that at the ribbon rails

00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:51,080
meetup in Sydney which is held in a pub

00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:55,550
and this awesome pub food was pretty

00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:57,380
good and this guy called Tim Lucas did

00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:59,780
two talks to like Oh to little talks one

00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:01,550
was on SAS which I didn't care about the

00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:02,810
other was this this thing called Heroku

00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:05,810
oh my lord

00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:08,450
ha he just a it was free that was cool

00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:10,670
and B he just did get push it was kind

00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:11,900
of new back then a lot of us were

00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:13,970
playing with it while solving some of

00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:17,870
our challenges in open-source community

00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:21,140
of sharing and maintaining branches but

00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:23,900
he used this get tool to push these in

00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:25,130
rails app and it was on the Internet it

00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,650
was like oh my mirror

00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:31,340
calls it just become a product that was

00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:33,710
free ah there was so exciting so we

00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:35,240
started a little web consultancy and so

00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:36,620
we started using this for every school

00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,270
enough for everything that would you

00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:40,340
know like you don't shell it Excel

00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:42,230
spreadsheets or anything but write notes

00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:44,060
to your wife or anything you use it for

00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:46,910
web apps but every web app now went

00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:49,160
straight to Heroku in fact it was so

00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:51,410
simple and so implicit that we'd share

00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:53,630
the app like that was the original git

00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:56,150
repo before we then go and put it on

00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:57,890
what became github or anywhere else like

00:04:56,150 --> 00:05:01,520
it was easier just to leave it on on

00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:03,140
Heroku is as a source so it's very

00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,560
excited about this whole experience and

00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:09,680
so having had the personal pain I am a

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,910
developer I like making HTML become

00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:15,320
interesting or you know the whole

00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:17,060
experience as I've gone further down the

00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:19,490
stack in my profession that led me to

00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:22,480
this point now I have had to stop paying

00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:25,580
attention to the JavaScript frameworks I

00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:27,290
can tell no jokes don't get me wrong I

00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:29,690
can tell those jokes I know why

00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:33,170
javascript is funny but i i've had to

00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:35,210
stop paying attention but i became super

00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:39,320
fascinated and my mission really I grew

00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:40,910
this mission and so when I'm sorry that

00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,710
reminds me I get to see my slides in

00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:46,210
advance that's now we're not gonna make

00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:48,320
those mistakes so it's okay so Heroku

00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:49,730
the wonderful thing about Heroku in

00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,170
terms of winning in production was that

00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:55,130
you were in production on day one

00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:58,370
literally rails new app get in it get

00:05:55,130 --> 00:06:00,590
out get commit push your basic rails

00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:02,390
that was running really the only thing

00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:04,160
that we don't have now and that story

00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:06,250
doesn't have that I believe should be

00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,120
that it should have happened through CI

00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,750
like from the day you start a new

00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,570
project

00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:13,720
I'd rather every project start in CI and

00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:18,170
got deployed before you put your first

00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:19,850
bespoke commits in but that's that's my

00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:20,960
story for the future of our you know

00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:25,310
what we're trying to give to it to

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:29,560
developers so anyway but here we are

00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:31,970
with with Heroku so work from day one

00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:34,310
our consulting clients were super happy

00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:35,240
because they could now see if they can

00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,580
interact they could share with

00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,740
stakeholders

00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:41,169
and and financially it was free to get

00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:43,060
started over time we discovered some

00:06:41,169 --> 00:06:46,389
longer-term barriers to being on Heroku

00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:48,460
at the time it was still a new platform

00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:50,560
and as you can see from Cloud Foundry

00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:55,180
this stuff is complex and so they would

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:57,430
have issues but unlike Heroku

00:06:55,180 --> 00:07:00,460
unlike Cloud Foundry Heroku is private

00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:01,810
and you can't see the code back then

00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:05,500
they didn't have build packs so he

00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:07,930
didn't even know how it was running and

00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:09,729
so that was a problem you then go to

00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:11,229
institutional customers and they were

00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:17,680
still not very excited about this public

00:07:11,229 --> 00:07:19,810
cloud concept and the going from free to

00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,909
not free became expensive very quickly

00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:23,680
rayul Ruby on Rails applications have

00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:27,330
one attribute that their hosting

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:29,409
providers love and that as they love RAM

00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:30,610
that's if your hosting provider you

00:07:29,409 --> 00:07:35,530
pretty much in the business of selling

00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:37,960
Ram and so so they loved hosting rails

00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:40,360
apps and Java apps not so exciting to

00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:43,780
host node apps which don't just tend to

00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:45,070
have flat usage so should you wish to

00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:46,750
get into the business and wondering who

00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:48,610
your customers should be go after rails

00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:50,020
apps they have no idea how to run they

00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:53,229
like to don't care about efficiency and

00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:54,520
they'll just pay you more money good

00:07:53,229 --> 00:07:59,740
business to be in

00:07:54,520 --> 00:08:02,800
all right and so that led so I was

00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:05,440
talking in public mostly about rails and

00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,840
things and I just enjoyed sharing things

00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,310
I found it was I would go from one side

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,539
of the planet to the other to do a talk

00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:12,909
at a conference to talk about some a

00:08:10,539 --> 00:08:14,229
third persons thing that I used that I

00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:16,389
thought was you know making the world a

00:08:14,229 --> 00:08:20,949
better place and just like sharing the

00:08:16,389 --> 00:08:26,250
things I find and so I was invited to

00:08:20,949 --> 00:08:31,000
come to America which which is here and

00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:32,459
I need you to understand that that for

00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,640
all the ways that you are mixed in and

00:08:32,459 --> 00:08:37,779
diverse and wonderful group of people

00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,910
this is how the rest of world looks at

00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:42,680
you

00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:45,200
you don't have 11 aircraft carriers for

00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:47,750
no reason you just like to park them

00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:51,350
around like police officers just letting

00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:53,540
everyone know is what we got and then

00:08:51,350 --> 00:09:02,990
when you come to the rich diverse group

00:08:53,540 --> 00:09:06,800
you find these sorts of characters it

00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:09,770
makes me laugh so much anyway

00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,060
I love America I do but if I if I had a

00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:13,100
green car if I became citizen I would

00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:17,210
still put that slide up use he is so

00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:19,130
cute so the people Asian yard who were I

00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:20,810
guess in the same business as Heroku but

00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:24,020
while one of the original people that

00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:26,810
helped make rails app successful they

00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:29,180
asked me to come in and be part of their

00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:31,250
mission and I was super excited its

00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:33,920
proper packed it's similar because I was

00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:35,660
living in Brisbane Australia which is a

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,870
mere as we discussed yesterday it's just

00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:41,960
not America it's somewhere else it

00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:44,180
doesn't matter where I mean it does to

00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:46,540
me well it does to the airline pilot as

00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:48,410
long as he knows we're all good and it's

00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:51,230
funny how they like to tell you where

00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:53,600
you're going yeah that's a Jerry

00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:55,040
Seinfeld joke I'll leave him so I was

00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,960
invited to go to engine yard and it's a

00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,490
lot like being if you're a banker or in

00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,320
finance and being invited to go to Wall

00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:02,570
Street it's like there's there's this

00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,400
there's this brand to it you get to go

00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:06,770
to Silicon Valley I didn't know that San

00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:08,020
Francisco wasn't Silicon Valley I found

00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:11,810
that out later

00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:14,150
and I found out many things later that

00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:17,750
turned out to be not the shiny aspect of

00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:20,870
like how expensive it was to breathe the

00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:23,210
air on 24 by 7 basis here and due to

00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:25,100
real-estate prices and my wonderful

00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:29,000
salary after expenses and taxes and

00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:31,130
everything but it was the the two years

00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,890
I spent there I the contact with a

00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:35,510
thousand production customers as they're

00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:37,370
mostly Ruby on Rails applications but

00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:39,110
production nonetheless of of Web Apps

00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:41,960
this is people's businesses livelihoods

00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:43,940
running in production and the work that

00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:46,160
the support organization did the

00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:47,960
platform engineering group the the

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,310
configuration management group the

00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:52,040
rolling out the challenges we had

00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:54,889
rolling out patches

00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:56,149
whilst at the same time look you know we

00:10:54,889 --> 00:10:58,370
have many challenges and I just want to

00:10:56,149 --> 00:10:59,839
go through them one was you know we

00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:02,209
wanted customers to have this experience

00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:04,100
of of dev staging and pride environment

00:11:02,209 --> 00:11:05,779
being the same but we we found that hard

00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:08,480
the way we'd built the platform is that

00:11:05,779 --> 00:11:09,949
idea it because that have came along is

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,209
that's what happened once you have your

00:11:09,949 --> 00:11:13,220
product you start see how people use it

00:11:11,209 --> 00:11:14,509
you start to have the next idea and this

00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:17,060
is certainly a next idea is you want

00:11:14,509 --> 00:11:19,040
people to go through a pipeline but but

00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:21,230
our platform made it we didn't really

00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,899
have a nice way to extend that idea to

00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:25,250
customers they could bring up a staging

00:11:23,899 --> 00:11:27,110
environment but then we didn't really

00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:29,000
make it easy for them to push the

00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:31,670
configuration of what isn't staging to

00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,190
production we didn't really have a great

00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:35,360
dev story I guess like a local laptop

00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:36,800
version of our product we tried

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,459
different things over time keeping them

00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,600
up to date was was not consistent

00:11:39,459 --> 00:11:44,089
another challenge we've discovered over

00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,829
time I say we because I was going to

00:11:44,089 --> 00:11:47,540
sort of borrow the entire corporate

00:11:45,829 --> 00:11:50,389
history of engineer here and much of as

00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:51,740
I learned from our our lesson so I was

00:11:50,389 --> 00:11:53,990
really interested in the life history of

00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:56,180
Engine Yard like and and and many

00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:58,279
stories like why do we do this and if

00:11:56,180 --> 00:12:00,519
you followed the path it was you know

00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:06,790
one of the founders made this choice and

00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:09,019
and it was undoable we use gen 2 and

00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:11,269
which has a lot of benefits we could own

00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:13,069
the packages right there was exactly

00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:15,889
that it was exactly what we wanted to

00:12:13,069 --> 00:12:17,389
distribute a lot like Bosch except we

00:12:15,889 --> 00:12:20,000
didn't have any of the tooling like we

00:12:17,389 --> 00:12:22,760
have with Bosch we shipped one ami in

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,310
five years and everything else is

00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:29,360
patches and you know at deployment time

00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:31,850
in front of customers we we had a leaky

00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,519
platform abstraction we sort of we were

00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:37,040
one of the first people groups to use

00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:40,519
chef like literally engineer cloud was

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:42,620
being built simultaneously with Adam at

00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:44,480
chef I have the mob's code building chef

00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:46,819
like Ezra and Adam were working together

00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,350
and what was to become chef and so you

00:12:46,819 --> 00:12:49,189
know the idea of platform abstraction

00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:52,009
was a long way off

00:12:49,189 --> 00:12:54,110
and so teasing that out was really

00:12:52,009 --> 00:12:55,990
challenging and if we can't tease it out

00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:58,759
was really hard to provide services I

00:12:55,990 --> 00:13:01,220
guess the prime example was a nginx

00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:03,649
configuration file that was where a lot

00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:05,420
of conflict happened we had our ideas of

00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:07,040
what should go in it

00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:09,589
the customer had their ideas of what

00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,600
should go in it and and they would win

00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:13,760
because they're the customer and so we

00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,050
was really hard to move that that bun

00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,579
does a bunch of little attributes of our

00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:18,860
platform that came hard to move forward

00:13:16,579 --> 00:13:20,450
because of these points of of conflict

00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:27,079
where we didn't have nice clean platform

00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:29,209
abstractions Bella lesson I I've got a

00:13:27,079 --> 00:13:30,740
feeling that perhaps due to cost due to

00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:32,779
whatever we wasn't really customers

00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:34,339
weren't really encouraged implicitly to

00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:37,010
do the right thing and deploy on day one

00:13:34,339 --> 00:13:39,110
you would save that up for when you were

00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:40,850
ready because you know it's you go

00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:43,029
deploy cluster machines it was cost and

00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:45,260
and that I don't think is the best thing

00:13:43,029 --> 00:13:49,040
we weren't encouraging them to do the

00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:51,800
right thing in my belief about four

00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:54,290
years ago almost exactly four years ago

00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:58,220
on April I sowed mentioned this earlier

00:13:54,290 --> 00:14:00,380
today I was I had some friends yeah

00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:02,510
there'd be a bit of Twitter back and

00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:04,339
forward friendly banter between between

00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:06,380
competing companies and there were some

00:14:04,339 --> 00:14:08,029
people at this company called VMware I

00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:10,370
was never a VMware customer because I

00:14:08,029 --> 00:14:11,660
came from Apple world so but I knew they

00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:13,640
existed I knew everyone else is scared

00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:14,870
of them and I would banter with some of

00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:17,899
it with it some of the people like James

00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:20,930
Waters who ultimately goes goes on in

00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:23,449
his own story to you know almost run

00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:25,640
pivotal and and so a lot of me had great

00:14:23,449 --> 00:14:27,920
success and there was another guy called

00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:30,740
Dave McCrory who was because is one of

00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,420
my good friends and and he would be

00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:33,680
telling me about this thing that they

00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:37,220
were about to open source called Bosh

00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:39,620
and I felt like it could really solve a

00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:41,029
lot of our problems and I went into the

00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:43,220
demo and as I said then the next day I

00:14:41,029 --> 00:14:44,449
invited myself I'd never know I didn't

00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,620
know that everyone else who was in the

00:14:44,449 --> 00:14:48,470
cloud founder you consistent the time

00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:49,670
used to beg and ask and and and want it

00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:51,949
you know please can we come meet your

00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:56,120
developers I just went over like never

00:14:51,949 --> 00:14:57,620
occurred to me to us so and they were

00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,540
lovely they're really nice and they

00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:01,370
showed me a demo of Bosh for the first

00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:03,320
time and what they had was in one

00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:04,760
terminal one one side of the screen was

00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,899
was a terminal where they're running

00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,899
Bosh commands the other side they were

00:15:05,899 --> 00:15:11,720
showing B Center which I've never seen

00:15:07,899 --> 00:15:14,420
and and what it did was they'd run a

00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:15,200
command he changed the size of a disk

00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:18,980
and he

00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:21,080
replace the stem cell in the same

00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:23,720
manifest change and he ran Bosch deploy

00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:25,970
and over on the other window it went

00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:27,770
through the sequential changes to

00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:32,860
automate that and I was like having a

00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:32,860
small party inside my clothes and it was

00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:40,360
like this he was dancing without moving

00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,360
well I know what you're all thinking

00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:45,500
this was so exciting and so I had sort

00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:47,000
of ignored platforms at this point and I

00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,200
still really and for the rest of my time

00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,660
an engineer through the end of the year

00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:53,390
I sort of put it to one side but I did

00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:55,010
try to evangelize Bosch publicly and in

00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:57,800
turn I mean I couldn't stop it was very

00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:59,420
excited you know they could ship stem so

00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:02,270
they had a whole build tool change for

00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:03,800
building base images not just on Amazon

00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:06,320
but on vSphere and later on OpenStack

00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:09,200
and everything else we had nothing we

00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,790
have to beg permission to you know the

00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,500
old IT thing of trying to convince that

00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:14,690
one guy who knows how to do something to

00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:17,390
prioritize your request we had that with

00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:19,730
a builds for the packages for Gen 2 we

00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:21,560
had two guys with a sort of an unlined

00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:23,660
pipeline of what they were going to work

00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:26,540
on and it seemed to take forever with

00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:28,760
Bosch releases you can do 95% of making

00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:30,500
a package work I mean it can go into

00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:32,870
production and then you can go and ask

00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:34,580
for help like or how else could I do

00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:36,170
this what was the flag I could have used

00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:37,940
you know there is such a different model

00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:39,680
you can use of taking expertise and

00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:42,650
spreading it wide as opposed to putting

00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:45,820
it all through that bottleneck and all

00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:49,190
right so when it later on eventually I

00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:54,460
was not successful I had run out of had

00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:58,940
run out of political capital yeah

00:16:54,460 --> 00:17:00,410
there's tough time and so I left and but

00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:03,590
I was so excited about cloud foundry and

00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:05,420
and I learned that that that the VMware

00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:06,980
and was gonna move this cloud foundry

00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:09,680
thing into this other organization I met

00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:10,820
those people Rob me and James Bayer and

00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,350
a whole bunch of people that went on to

00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:16,040
lead cloud foundry and and I was so

00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:17,180
excited and but you know this was the

00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,530
things I was learning about cloud

00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:20,300
foundry in terms of what it was going to

00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:22,280
be like to win a production one was it

00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:24,470
was all open source if you needed to

00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:26,770
know what had just happened it was all

00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:26,770
there

00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:32,700
this was exciting institution running in

00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:35,310
your own datacenter we're still three

00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:36,450
four five years ago the idea of running

00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:38,310
own datacenter was a foregone conclusion

00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:40,590
of course we were what was the point of

00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:42,900
being a CIO if you couldn't go and build

00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:44,360
a datacenter there's that what else are

00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:47,490
you supposed to be doing with your job

00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:48,360
that's it's like corruption in India

00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:50,220
it's like that's the point

00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:52,980
like I want that job so I could be as

00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:54,480
corrupt as my boss and I don't mean to

00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:58,170
just say India there are a lot of

00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,370
corrupt countries like America I mean

00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:02,630
yeah it's not called corrupting here

00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:02,630
it's called lobbying but that's cool

00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:13,680
so just trying to there's a whole chain

00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:16,610
of these and I'm just trying to stop and

00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,610
not say them out loud

00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:32,430
Thanks let's build a wall to stop them I

00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:35,580
actually read many years ago Donald

00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:37,440
Trump's one of his first books and he

00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:39,660
was he was really successful he was

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:42,660
doing really well he said and it was a

00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:44,250
good book so you know not only was it

00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:47,180
open source but there were vendors and

00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:50,190
not just one but many coming along and

00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:53,730
and the next part was super important as

00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:55,710
a developer deploying the experience was

00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:57,510
going to be the same for five years I

00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:58,980
mean you gotta think I used to joke that

00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:01,080
a rails app because that's what I used

00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:02,490
to do rails new was how you start a new

00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,440
rails happen it's so simple to get

00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:06,230
started I had this feeling that it

00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:10,530
should come with a with a health warning

00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:12,720
like in yellow blinking text warning you

00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:15,390
are creating a production app do you

00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:18,690
wish to proceed right just cause it's

00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:20,130
easy doesn't make it right but it is

00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:22,260
easy and it's our responsibility to

00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:24,330
catch them all and and make and help

00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:26,670
make you know our developers successful

00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:28,320
to let them create success than

00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:30,420
organizations for their end users and

00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,340
ultimately you know I strongly believe

00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:33,630
that the world CEOs in the next 15 years

00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:35,030
are going to be heavily populated with

00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:38,670
people who came through our profession

00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:39,330
we have to let that happen for their own

00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:41,040
company's sake

00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:42,480
so a lot of winning in production

00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:44,760
Claire vanish so I left engineer at

00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,380
stubs dark and Wayne and it's a pure

00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,040
metric that we're doing well that you

00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:49,590
know this is more representative

00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:51,120
everything like this conference is grown

00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:52,260
the number of conferences growing the

00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:55,230
number of people that want to

00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:59,970
participate we are a magnet for you know

00:19:55,230 --> 00:20:01,770
a path to success so one interesting

00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:03,270
thing was just in this I don't have

00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:04,980
access to everyone's deployment Eclair

00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:07,200
foundry but just looking across some of

00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:08,850
our own customers there's like five

00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,430
thousand apps deployed by the end of

00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:14,850
last year like within that year many of

00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:16,260
them started earlier on the year and so

00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:18,810
there are just so many little metrics of

00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:22,710
success that I can have my opinions all

00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:24,450
day long so like we didn't like in the

00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:26,400
front there's a man called Wayne Stegman

00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:29,220
who his job at Engine Yard in the day

00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,230
used to be helping to deploy rails apps

00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:33,210
like a custom would come along to the

00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:36,540
engineer comm website and say I'd like

00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:40,860
help deploying and there was no magical

00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:42,750
script it was handed off to Wayne Wayne

00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:44,400
wrote the web magical scripts like back

00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:46,710
in the day it was all manual and I

00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,780
didn't touch any of these I mean not one

00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:50,820
person in the ops team from Starke away

00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:52,920
nor the IDE or Swisscom or with that we

00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:54,180
don't do this they do it themselves this

00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:56,910
is an incredible future

00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:59,280
it creates incredible problems and they

00:20:56,910 --> 00:21:02,130
are different talks when you've made

00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,900
deploying apps easy you now need to make

00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:06,870
every other attribute easy as well and

00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:09,920
self self-service all right so then

00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:11,760
story goes on I moved to Australia

00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,750
somewhere in the last five years it

00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,760
started being called straya

00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:18,350
which i think is pretty cute that's

00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:20,370
that's not a picture of my house that is

00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:26,220
representative of how bad the internet

00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:29,730
is so I miss America and your your

00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:31,350
internet and I started working on sort

00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:34,560
of production things that you know would

00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:36,540
sort of perhaps the ideas we've learned

00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:38,510
over in this story ten years seven years

00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:41,490
wherever you want to start my story

00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:42,900
we've learned a lot of things and we're

00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:44,190
trying to find different ways to help

00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,540
when our consulting company you only

00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:47,700
sort of get to help five or ten

00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:49,560
customers and all their users at a time

00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:51,330
and to my mind and our mission that's

00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,620
not sufficient so we're going to try

00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:54,400
different ways to try to help more

00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:57,490
people and that's

00:21:54,400 --> 00:22:01,360
cool so we have like a few minutes about

00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:02,620
I don't know we have I've know alive

00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,970
we're going to do a quick down here for

00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:05,260
the people who have not seen a CF two

00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:08,800
players want to go through and talk

00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:10,120
through this is a rails app because many

00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:15,130
of you Java people and I'd like to

00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:16,450
expose you to diversity so this just

00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:18,460
happens to be where I'm deploying it

00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:21,460
this is I guess pivotal z' ops manager

00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:23,350
and it's you know what it's free to

00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:24,460
download and use and play with so if you

00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:29,050
want to play with something that's kind

00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:36,180
of fun alright so we we're going to

00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:39,340
build a rails app I cannot alright so

00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:40,960
it's this is this is an experience you

00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:43,360
want to make so simple for everyone else

00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,470
that you're not there and we know you

00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,640
don't know if I can say to any other

00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:47,410
different modes this is what we're

00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:49,180
trying to do is to let people move on

00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:53,230
with their jobs without creating tickets

00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:56,580
asking for help and to you know you just

00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:59,020
count the success by looking in cf curl

00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:59,980
and if you've ever UCF curl it's a

00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:03,840
wonderful way to get the data from

00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:05,830
inside clef Andrea thanks Jamie

00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:08,230
alright so I'm making a little rails app

00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:09,820
and this is a screencast so I can't skip

00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:12,130
this bit that you don't care about but I

00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:13,900
did this screencast for the benefit of a

00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:15,910
group of Ruby people and they love

00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:19,060
seeing Ruby an HTML fly across the

00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:23,020
screen it's their little thing and I

00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:24,970
wish to take it away from them Puma is

00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:27,070
is a framework that's pretty popular in

00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:30,160
the Ruby space now for being efficient

00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:33,010
at hosting your app so it works locally

00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:34,840
that's great but as I said we need to

00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:36,640
get off our laptop as quickly as

00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,770
possible otherwise you're gonna start

00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,720
thinking that you're massively powerful

00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:42,910
laptop is somehow representative of

00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:46,420
production which is we're not giving you

00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:48,340
that much capacity in production so this

00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:50,230
is it you just point it at your cloud

00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:53,650
foundry where whichever one it is and

00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:55,900
it's done it is just incredible and if

00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:59,740
it's not done let's say you have a

00:23:55,900 --> 00:24:01,720
problem now you know about it do you

00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:04,360
remember how painful it is when you

00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:06,280
packaged up in an envelope your code and

00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,980
okay that might be you know but you hand

00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:09,390
it over the wall to the IT

00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:12,289
they don't know what to do with it they

00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:15,059
give it back it that is ridiculous

00:24:12,289 --> 00:24:19,169
there's a whole line of empathy that I I

00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:21,029
spouse give developers more empathy a

00:24:19,169 --> 00:24:22,679
room for more empathy for the end user

00:24:21,029 --> 00:24:25,200
for that only the operations experience

00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:27,929
they're the best people to fix so many

00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:31,470
problems so here we are

00:24:27,929 --> 00:24:33,899
is the logs that you've all seen if this

00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:35,580
is new you happy to show you other

00:24:33,899 --> 00:24:36,360
examples afterwards to a million people

00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:39,809
seen this before

00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:42,210
we'll go through a couple things because

00:24:39,809 --> 00:24:48,870
I want to tell a story so as we go

00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:51,240
through we pause here for no reason this

00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:54,870
is mean as as the guys the spring of

00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:59,070
nature guys are saying no no need to set

00:24:54,870 --> 00:25:03,120
D NER snow is just works ssl/tls is just

00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:07,730
done not by deployment but you know as

00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:11,100
operators you would turn on HTTP please

00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:12,750
you know the the the build packs we can

00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:14,909
write our build packs in such a way to

00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:17,220
teach our users what to do next

00:25:14,909 --> 00:25:20,070
right so the Ruby build pack teaches

00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:22,110
users to say go and install this gem why

00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:24,559
well currently no one can see your logs

00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:26,820
because you're writing them to files and

00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:28,559
that's one of the things all our users

00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:29,549
discover first is they can't see their

00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,049
logs because they're writing through

00:25:29,549 --> 00:25:32,490
files we need you to write them to

00:25:31,049 --> 00:25:34,679
standard out standard error there's a

00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:36,360
simple way in Ruby we just tell them

00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:39,600
what to do so we try to educate them to

00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:41,309
solve their own problems it's asking us

00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:47,309
to be explicit about what we're running

00:25:41,309 --> 00:25:49,049
so let's do that and this you know these

00:25:47,309 --> 00:25:52,710
little hooks of how we can communicate

00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:54,149
with our anonymous users and we don't

00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:57,059
you don't know when they're doing this

00:25:54,149 --> 00:25:58,169
right you can't catch them like when

00:25:57,059 --> 00:26:00,090
someone decides they're going to start a

00:25:58,169 --> 00:26:03,570
new web service you're not there to sort

00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:05,700
of go no no don't do that right so we

00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:09,360
have to make this as as as resilient as

00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:10,679
possible and let them be a little bit

00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,450
successful and let them be more

00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:15,690
successful over time all right how

00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:17,250
warnings are going away and if and if

00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:18,990
you're Bill pack that you your team

00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:20,429
doesn't that users like whether it's

00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:21,600
spring or whatever doesn't have lots of

00:26:20,429 --> 00:26:24,240
nice help

00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:26,700
I mean that's a wonderful place to

00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:29,670
participate in Cloud Foundry is to flesh

00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:32,160
out the build packs and make them make

00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:35,730
your users more successful I love the CF

00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:37,740
scale command conversely I don't like

00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:39,690
when the old IT departments would say

00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:42,510
all right you're about to deploy an app

00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:45,840
let's just all relax how much capacity

00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:47,340
you want like what are you talking about

00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:50,730
I don't know if anyone's gonna use this

00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:54,750
yet I have such slow self esteem that I

00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:56,610
am NOT ready to answer your question so

00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:58,260
you start small now it is a good idea to

00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:59,670
start with multiple because then as they

00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:02,400
get killed and restarted you always have

00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:04,560
one running I still don't think today

00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:07,830
there is a way to set a default of two

00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:10,260
so that's something you uses about white

00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:12,810
I have two logs oh my lord giving you

00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:14,400
developers back their logs can only

00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:17,010
breed empathy for those who are going to

00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:19,110
read them in production logs tell a

00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:21,630
story of what just happened

00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:24,030
all right after you want to know about

00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:26,180
it because you don't look at the logs

00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:29,130
it's like visiting a doctor's office

00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:30,300
you're there cuz something's wrong the

00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:32,070
only time you're looking at logs or

00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:34,560
something's wrong you need them to tell

00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:37,350
you a story at that time I would very

00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:39,960
much like developers and PMS and and and

00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:42,030
the stories that go in your backlog to

00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:46,590
have a and this is what the log should

00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:48,720
look like and over time that that level

00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:51,990
of empathy I think will grow into teams

00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:54,660
as that DevOps loop which is a DevOps as

00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:56,940
a communication and an team aspect more

00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:59,160
than a fancy word builds out these ideas

00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:03,120
of what what do we need from developers

00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:04,070
so we can do a better job or developers

00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:07,470
do you want to be on call all the time

00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:10,110
how about that no no great then do some

00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:14,850
decent logs and so they can see their

00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:16,650
own logs doesn't make it any easier by

00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:21,120
the way if your cloud foundry doesn't

00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:23,850
have a nice place to collect logs I like

00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:26,460
to use paper trail just a SAS thing you

00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:28,020
don't need to ask permission I mean you

00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:30,150
might like to ask permission but you

00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:33,000
could just go and create an account and

00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:34,710
quietly connect it into your app at

00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,350
least you can see you

00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:39,450
you can be you know you can win the

00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:41,910
paper out does have a nice set of Cloud

00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:44,910
Foundry documentation on what to do

00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:48,210
using the set CF cups that stands for

00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:50,820
create user provided service so that's

00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:52,320
the mechanism which you can register you

00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:54,900
know syslog endpoints so all the logs

00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:57,660
will drain out and hopefully over time

00:28:54,900 --> 00:29:00,300
we stubs your service brokers streaming

00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:01,590
service instance logs through that as

00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:06,750
well so you can tell that full

00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:08,580
end-to-end story we bind this and cloud

00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:10,680
fair it's just a special mechanism for

00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:14,120
telling cloud boundary to stream logs

00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:17,340
for your app and you can collect them

00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:19,280
because you know at the game once at the

00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:21,900
time that you want to see your logs

00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:28,290
they're not gonna be available you know

00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:29,970
you want to store them you may have your

00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:33,630
own favorite assassin you may not think

00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:36,240
of using SAS hosted this look but it's

00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:39,210
ridiculous to wait for someone set up

00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:41,490
elk like you you've got production app

00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:44,220
so this is a workaround until you have

00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:47,250
something you like I mean also I like

00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:52,130
this experience the cabañas experience

00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:52,130
isn't I'm not a big fan there's a wrap

00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:56,970
again just just as a developers think

00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:59,190
through the story think through the user

00:29:56,970 --> 00:30:02,040
story of what support gonna be looking

00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:04,500
like alright the last thing I want to

00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:05,760
show in this demo is is the SSH command

00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:08,310
and we'll skip that and get the last

00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,900
slide there you have CF SSH it means you

00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:13,410
can get inside one of your containers

00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:15,270
and and have access to the environment

00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:17,640
which might mean you can run one-off

00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:20,010
tasks like migrate databases and those

00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:23,280
sorts of things so if your cloud foundry

00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:25,770
has an upgraded to yet Diego CF SSH

00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:26,910
command is one reason that's the best

00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:29,370
reason you know they actually

00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:34,140
value-added reason to move to Diego is

00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:35,970
CF SSH alright so in summary we have

00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:39,390
winning in production we want to elevate

00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:41,970
developers don't you've got only so many

00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:44,600
great people stop doing undifferentiated

00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:47,960
heavy lifting I borrowed these firm from

00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:50,340
Adrian from from Netflix

00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:52,860
his are the ones on the right minor ones

00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:54,810
on the left turbocharger developers

00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:57,750
speed and in all our marketplace is what

00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:59,160
wins Foster's empathy let you know

00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:01,680
encourage developers to run what they

00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:03,090
wrote and be responsible for it and not

00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:06,120
enough people have talked about docker

00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:07,230
yes as the buzz died down no ones I

00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:09,990
don't think any of the keynotes

00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:11,490
say the docker word you can push docker

00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:14,730
apps so if you need to prove cloud

00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:17,780
foundries awesome show the demo and then

00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:20,100
go back to never using it again but so

00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:21,050
alright thank you very much have a great

00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:24,260
day

00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:24,260
