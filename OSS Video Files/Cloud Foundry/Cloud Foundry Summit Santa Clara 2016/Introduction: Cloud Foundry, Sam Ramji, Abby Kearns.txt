one of my favorite quotes from the last

00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:04,620
several years of marketing and recent

00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:06,000
saying sophomores eat in the world but

00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,120
more recently Jeffrey Immelt

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,980
is the CEO of GE said every industrial

00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,139
company must become a software and

00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,839
analytics company so Cloud Foundry is

00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:18,539
our gift to every company in every

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,310
industry to go and take these modern

00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:21,960
approaches and just make their business

00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:23,119
better all of these organizations are

00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,140
undergoing a digital transformation

00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:27,180
through this transformation their

00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,920
expectations and requirements for an

00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:31,980
infrastructure are going to change and

00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:34,020
evolve so Cloud Foundry sits as a

00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:37,070
completely coherently constructed

00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:39,300
framework focused on one thing

00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:40,829
application velocity so many of the

00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,450
details have been pulled out and

00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:44,160
everything's focused on that line of

00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,559
sight how am i satisfying what my

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,620
customer or my partner with a new app

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:52,020
can i revise that in a minute Cloud

00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,760
Foundry allows developers to quickly

00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,579
iterate on ideas and reach their

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,649
customers and new and inventive ways

00:00:55,579 --> 00:01:02,129
multi-cloud allows organizations to have

00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:03,510
optionality to their infrastructure the

00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:05,400
only way to understand the changes in

00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:07,229
the software industry are to be right at

00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,380
the front of it it's going to change the

00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:09,380
world

00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:14,039
