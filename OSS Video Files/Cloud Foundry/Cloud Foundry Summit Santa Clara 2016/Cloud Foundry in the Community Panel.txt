Description: 
	Cloud Foundry in the Community - Moderated by Stormy Peters; Kim Bannerman, IBM; Mark Carlson, ECS Team; Daniel Krook, IBM; Paula Kennedy, Pivotal & Bridget Kromhout, Pivotal

Cloud Foundry is more than an open source platform; it’s a growing community! In the past two years, our community has grown by leaps and bounds as a result of very passionate and dedicated people as well as crucial community tools like GitHub, IRC, Slack, and Twitter. These meetups foster a collaborative, inclusive environment focused on new releases, best practices, and how customers are using Cloud Foundry. Come meet Cloud Foundry organizer for Seattle and Atlanta Kim Bannerman of IBM, Denver organizer Mark Carlson of ECS Team, London organizer Paula Kennedy of Cloud Credo/Pivotal, and New York organizer Daniel Krook of IBM along with frequent speaker and community leader Bridget Kromhout of Pivotal. Moderated by Stormy Peters, VP of Evangelism for Cloud Foundry Foundation. 

The panel will discuss lessons learned, what 2016 looks like for the Cloud Foundry community, and how they have managed to grow and nurture this vibrant community. Learn best practices and tips and tricks for starting meetups in your area and retaining your devoted Cloud Foundry followers.

welcome to the Cloud Foundry community

00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:06,000
panel for those of you have been

00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:08,340
watching the keynotes you probably know

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,440
at this point that cloud foundry is an

00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,910
open-source software project and it has

00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,040
a lot of members if you look at even the

00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:16,199
the slide that has all the member

00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,000
companies one of the things I think is

00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:20,220
most powerful is that it's not just

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,619
providers on that slide it's also a lot

00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,060
of users so people that are using Cloud

00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:25,560
Foundry are participating in the

00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,760
community they're participating at the

00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,109
organizational level and they're

00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,929
participating at the individual level

00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:33,300
and those people are from all sorts of

00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:36,390
different industries from automotive to

00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:38,010
financial to Internet of Things and so

00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,360
we have I think one of the strongest

00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,270
most diverse open-source software

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,920
communities that are out there right now

00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:45,899
to give you an idea of the size there

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,390
are a hundred and ninety meetups listed

00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:50,670
on just meetup calm of people that meet

00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,469
I'm trying to meet regularly once a

00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:55,739
month to talk about cloud foundry

00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:57,120
there's 45,000 people signed up in those

00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:59,100
meetup groups and they're around the

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,570
world every every continent except

00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,960
Antarctica so I'm gonna have to have a

00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:05,100
mission to start a meet-up in Antarctica

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,840
so I've brought some of the most

00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,820
successful meetup runners here I didn't

00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:12,659
bring them they actually so asked to

00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:14,159
come and participate and what I wanted

00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:15,930
to point out before we get started is

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,729
that this is a panel and this is an open

00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:19,320
source software project and so you will

00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:21,360
get out of it what you put into it and

00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,520
so we're hoping that you all participate

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,009
that you throw out your ideas that you

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,420
ask questions I just finished a book a

00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:29,520
couple nights ago that was a science

00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,409
fiction book about Mars it was really

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,360
interesting it had awesome technology

00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:35,189
awesome character development the plot

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,390
was going really well and I was getting

00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:37,680
really worried because every time I

00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:39,540
looked at the bottom of my Kindle it was

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,430
like 20 minutes left and there's still

00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,990
like three spaceships flooding out there

00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:44,850
that don't have power and there's like

00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:47,640
aliens chasing them and I'm like how is

00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:50,009
the author going to wrap this up well he

00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,780
didn't so I was left hanging with the

00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:53,130
spaceship still you know floating out in

00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,659
outer space and I don't know if there's

00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:56,460
aliens and I don't know what happened

00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:58,259
that will happen to you if you don't

00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:01,500
participate in this panel so if you have

00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:03,479
a question you have a question it is up

00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,340
to you to bring it up and we'll have the

00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:06,479
mic in the middle is open at any time if

00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,000
you want to jump up and ask a question

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,979
and there's a URL where you can submit

00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,540
them and I can see them here and I could

00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,870
ask them for you if you would rather do

00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,700
it that

00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:16,890
I'm so first I'm gonna have the

00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,510
panelists introduce themselves and

00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:20,640
they'll say their name and maybe what

00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:23,190
meetup meet up our meetups they run and

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:26,450
kind of who they are so since they can't

00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:30,360
see the slides we'll start with Kim oh

00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:33,420
it is on hi I'm Kim Bannerman

00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,280
I run the Seattle in the Atlanta Cloud

00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:38,909
Foundry meetup groups and I started both

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:41,370
of them okay this sounds like they're

00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:44,459
doing really modest introductions but

00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:48,569
Kim started to really active huge meetup

00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:51,450
groups mark I'm mark Carlson with ECS

00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:52,980
team and helped co-organized the Denver

00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:56,340
meetup we've been doing that a little

00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:58,200
over two years and we started out in the

00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,239
the days when we'd have about eight or

00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,250
ten people and it was sad and we'd bring

00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,140
speakers in and they would have not very

00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:06,060
many people to talk to the good news is

00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:08,819
after a lot of work and kind of

00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:10,980
promotion we average around 75 people in

00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:13,170
our meetups and we have kind of our

00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:15,260
content calendar now planned out through

00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:17,579
September of this year and so people

00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:20,099
interested in coming to speak and so

00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:21,389
it's been a fun journey to see the

00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:25,130
community really get behind Cloud

00:03:21,389 --> 00:03:25,130
Foundry and come want to talk about it

00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:33,780
hi I'm Paula Kennedy so I run the London

00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:36,000
platform as a service user group so our

00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:39,690
group is slightly different it's not

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,470
just Cloud Foundry it's a wider kind of

00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:47,609
group so other platforms essentially

00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:49,919
we've been going since about 2012 and

00:03:47,609 --> 00:03:51,840
we've got just over 800 members now so

00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:55,799
it's a really big big community in

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,959
London and Paula has trained her group

00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:59,489
that well not only to focus on Cloud

00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:05,560
Foundry but also to have fun and they're

00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:09,700
all in the bar right now Bridget

00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:13,120
hi folks Wow my mic is very loud hi

00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:14,890
so I'm Bridget crumb coat and um I don't

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:19,030
actually run a Cloud Foundry specific

00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:22,060
meetup what I do is I am the current

00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:24,580
unelected head of the shadowy global

00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:26,470
cabal that brings you DevOps days and I

00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:28,600
also run the Minneapolis DevOps meet up

00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:30,970
so that means I'm encouraging people to

00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:34,270
submit their Cloud Foundry content to

00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:35,860
devops days conferences everywhere and I

00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:37,960
have a couple of co-workers showing up

00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:39,730
in Minneapolis June 1st and I checked

00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,800
earlier today and there were about a

00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:43,980
hundred and seventy people RSVP'd to a

00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:47,130
DevOps meetup to hear them talk about

00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:51,040
you know Cloud Foundry you know spring

00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:52,360
docker neo4j so like kc weston kenny

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,460
Bustani are coming and speaking so

00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,410
that's kind of an example of in our

00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,820
turnout is I'd expect at least a hundred

00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:00,240
and twenty hundred and thirty people to

00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:03,250
show up for that so that's kind of my I

00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:06,970
like to bring the Cloud Foundry into the

00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:08,860
other meetups and further parts of the

00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:14,290
ecosystem which is an awesome way to

00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:16,750
grow the community I'm Daniel crook I'm

00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:18,310
a software engineer at IBM I founded the

00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:21,940
New York City Cloud Foundry meetup in

00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:23,650
2013 also helped co-organized OpenStack

00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:26,050
New York and have been running New York

Austin in Seattle along with Kim and

00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:38,530
Silicon Valley area so if you went to

00:05:36,729 --> 00:05:41,560
that CF camp that was scheduled on

00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:44,370
Sunday that was a outgrowth of a vibrant

00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:46,600
user group around here that was able to

00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:51,640
align with the summit and create some

00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:53,350
great content I didn't introduce myself

00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:55,210
I work for the cod foundry Foundation

00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:57,130
and I focus on the community and the

00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:59,470

however you'd like to do it so I'm gonna

00:06:23,539 --> 00:06:26,599
start out with a question for the panel

00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,069
and at any point in time you were

00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:30,259
welcome to jump in but I'll just kick it

00:06:28,069 --> 00:06:32,779
off with a question I'm curious why you

00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:35,089
all do this like what what is important

00:06:32,779 --> 00:06:37,759
about growing the community to you why

00:06:35,089 --> 00:06:39,679
do you invest your Thursday evenings or

00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:43,610
your free time into growing this

00:06:39,679 --> 00:06:45,019
community I guess I'll start so

00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:46,610
I one of the great experiences of

00:06:45,019 --> 00:06:48,559
running a meet-up for PHP for all those

00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:52,580
years was that you learned that it was a

00:06:48,559 --> 00:06:55,309
great place to learn new skills find new

00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:57,050
job opportunities and for people hiring

00:06:55,309 --> 00:06:59,659
or freelance you know looking for

00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:02,479
partners the meetup was a great place to

00:06:59,659 --> 00:07:04,069
find that so I thought it was a great

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,050
idea that Cloud Foundry was growing it

00:07:04,069 --> 00:07:09,110
needed to build a community around it

00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:10,610
and one of the I think most important

00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:12,649
parts of what we do in terms of running

00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:14,240
a meet-up is that cloud foundry is such

00:07:12,649 --> 00:07:16,069
a complex sophisticated piece of

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,029
software that in order to learn how to

00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:18,679
use it effectively

00:07:17,029 --> 00:07:20,509
you can't just work with virtual

00:07:18,679 --> 00:07:22,669
resources it really helps to talk to

00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:24,589
people that are in the community using

00:07:22,669 --> 00:07:27,349
the technology and sharing their lessons

00:07:24,589 --> 00:07:31,089
so that's why I do it so the ability to

00:07:27,349 --> 00:07:31,089
ask face-to-face questions was important

00:07:31,749 --> 00:07:37,099
I'll go as I'll say as a service

00:07:34,369 --> 00:07:39,169
provider you know we believe in the

00:07:37,099 --> 00:07:41,119
value that Cloud Foundry brings to a lot

00:07:39,169 --> 00:07:42,740
of our business customers and so it's

00:07:41,119 --> 00:07:44,659
really growing the community and growing

00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:47,719
the exposure of those customers to Cloud

00:07:44,659 --> 00:07:50,269
Foundry helps them and and then getting

00:07:47,719 --> 00:07:53,300
to kind of hear real-time feedback from

00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:55,369
people are trying to do real exciting at

00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,869
scale things with Cloud Foundry helps us

00:07:55,369 --> 00:07:58,579
to get better and see where the

00:07:56,869 --> 00:07:59,869
challenges are and obviously it gives us

00:07:58,579 --> 00:08:01,879
great market intelligence from the

00:07:59,869 --> 00:08:03,409
service of router's standpoint but

00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:05,869
mainly it helps us understand the areas

00:08:03,409 --> 00:08:07,399
of pain that we can help it really take

00:08:05,869 --> 00:08:09,229
back into the Cloud Foundry community

00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:10,579
itself to make the product better but

00:08:09,229 --> 00:08:13,610
also you know services that we can

00:08:10,579 --> 00:08:16,039
provide to help our customers don't

00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:18,079
forget the part where it's fun yeah I

00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:19,550
mean I was running meetups before I

00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:22,579
worked for a vendor just because it's

00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:24,679
fun and now that I do it certainly is

00:08:22,579 --> 00:08:27,949
also great for you know our field

00:08:24,679 --> 00:08:30,110
because it's easy for them to say hey we

00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:31,490
have you know some pivotal coworkers are

00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,300
gonna be speaking at are going to be

00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:34,099
running this event

00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:37,339
you should show up and it's a great

00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:39,500
place a good soft entree for people to

00:08:37,339 --> 00:08:44,750
come and learn something without getting

00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:46,910
you know the handshake hard sell it is

00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:50,060
fun and I agree with Bridget but it's

00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:52,339
also ridiculously hard work I'd have to

00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:54,890
say I mean I do with our London pals

00:08:52,339 --> 00:08:58,250
user group so we call it low pug we do

00:08:54,890 --> 00:09:00,019
an event every month except for August

00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:04,579
and December we skip because people tend

00:09:00,019 --> 00:09:08,180
to be away and doing an event every

00:09:04,579 --> 00:09:10,880
single month is hard work I mean I enjoy

00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:13,910
it it is fun but it's finding the

00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:15,589
speakers and organizing the food and you

00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:19,190
know making sure you have the venue and

00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:21,380
it's it's not it's not nothing it

00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:23,120
shouldn't be underestimated yeah I'm

00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:24,529
gonna skip ahead I know you're really

00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,060
good at finding speakers and you have a

00:09:24,529 --> 00:09:27,829
couple tech specific techniques I

00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:31,899
watched you use you want to talk about

00:09:27,829 --> 00:09:34,370
how you find speakers yes okay so

00:09:31,899 --> 00:09:37,760
there's a couple of things I tend to do

00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:39,620
so being up as user group we try to keep

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:43,339
an eye on the competition it's one of

00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:44,930
our secret agendas which is great it's

00:09:43,339 --> 00:09:48,320
great for all of our community we like

00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:51,079
to invite people from openshift

00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,339
and docker and various other people that

00:09:51,079 --> 00:09:54,649
are doing similar things similar

00:09:52,339 --> 00:09:55,370
technology so that we get to see what

00:09:54,649 --> 00:10:00,350
they're up to

00:09:55,370 --> 00:10:02,180
mostly and try not to be too sarcastic

00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:04,870
when we kind of ask them questions about

00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:07,880
why they aren't using Cloud Foundry

00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:09,320
another thing I tend to do is actually

00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,630
look at other events that are going on

00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:14,510
so Bridgette mentioned Deb up days and I

00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:17,300
like to see other speakers that are kind

00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:19,670
of in our community particularly and I

00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:22,970
look for people that are kind of not

00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:24,920
always white men kind of the typical

00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:27,470
speakers we try to encourage a more

00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:30,380
diverse kind of group of speakers at low

00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:32,720
back and I find reaching out to groups

00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:34,070
so we have a women who code group in

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,570
London that's very big we try and reach

00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:38,540
out to them for speakers we try to

00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:40,339
approach you know different groups just

00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:43,670
to have a balanced view actually at Loeb

00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:45,350
ugh oh and I should to play off of that

00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:45,880
and I want to hear your thoughts on that

00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:48,040
- Kim

00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:50,590
but it's not just getting you know

00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:52,780
people to come and talk about the stuff

00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:54,550
they're doing it's also kind of fun when

00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:56,050
you can get a docker meetup to let you

00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:58,420
go talk about Cloud Foundry at their

00:10:56,050 --> 00:11:00,040
Meetup I mean and honestly or even at

00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:01,570
like a DevOps meetup but pretty much if

00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,980
you put the word docker in it it's like

00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:04,210
you know it's like putting the word near

00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:06,400
in a kernels and I that's starting to be

00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:08,560
it's just sprinkle some magic on it so

00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:10,450
if you can show them demos and be like

00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,550
hey these are exciting and yet

00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:14,980
irrelevant details but let's look at

00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:17,200
exactly what the capabilities are that

00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:20,350
goes really well actually have our

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:22,090
docker organizers pretty good friends of

00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:23,830
mine and so we cross posts and different

00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:25,150
our groups and we try not to do them on

00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:27,250
the same night so that we can share the

00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:29,590
community that works really well in

00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:31,030
Seattle yeah it works same in New York

00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:33,250
one of our best meetups our biggest

00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:35,380
meetup to the cross overs so especially

00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:36,510
with the OpenStack cloud foundry you

00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:38,380
have opinionated people on both sides

00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:40,540
you know they're always trying to one-up

00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:42,280
ya now with the dotnet support within

00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:44,050
cloud foundry we've done some crossovers

00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,910
with visual studio users groups where

00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:47,770
people are hearing about things like

00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:49,540
well factor and cloud native for the

00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:51,100
first time ever and so that's you know

00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:52,600
it's exciting to kind of broaden out the

00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,760
awareness to a group that may not have

00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,780
even encountered those concepts which is

00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,910
kind of hard for us that have been in

00:11:55,780 --> 00:12:00,430
the echo chamber for a while to consider

00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:02,050
but there's there are you know large you

00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:03,310
know technology communities that are not

00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:04,510
familiar with the things that we've kind

00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:06,640
of been hearing every day for the last

00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:08,500
several years and that cross-pollination

00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:11,140
between meetups and user groups is so

00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:12,880
key because you get people who maybe

00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:14,290
would never think to go to a Cloud

00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,120
Foundry meetup because there'd be like

00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:17,440
well I'm not using that so I'll just go

00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,170
to a meetup about something that the

00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,610
hype cycle has told me I should go to

00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:23,770
but you have a meetup and actually when

00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:25,360
I said 170 people RSVP'd that was just

00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:26,950
on the DevOps part of meetup comm

00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,990
because we are Co meeting for that one

00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:31,570
June 1st in Minneapolis with the docker

00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:33,610
meetup and the 500 meetup so that

00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:36,040
probably puts us above 200 RSVPs if I

00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:37,930
went and counted and that's getting

00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:40,350
people who maybe wouldn't have thought

00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:42,310
about it to consider it and look at it

00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:43,690
so I'm gonna move a little bit to the

00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:45,730
audience because someone has asked the

00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:47,380
first question you asked it anonymously

00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:49,120
but if you tell me who you are I can

00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:52,720
give you a little cloud foundry Lego

00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:54,940
creature later so to get everybody

00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:58,410
warmed up um could everybody who has

00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:58,410
been to a meetup stand up

00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:03,680
awesome so you need to share with a

00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,150
person next to you after this is over

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,860
what the best thing about the meetup was

00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:08,690
you can sit down has anyone helped

00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:09,410
organize a meet-up or organized it

00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:16,040
themselves

00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:18,290
awesome round of applause it's anyone

00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:20,300
here because they want to run a meet-up

00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:25,370
and they haven't done it yet that's

00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:27,170
willing to raise their hand all right so

00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:29,600
all of you have experiences at meetups

00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:31,160
that are valuable or organizing meetups

00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,450
that are also valuable so feel free to

00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,920
share those or feel free to ask

00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:35,600
questions of our panelists if you had

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,040
something that didn't work well that

00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,930
didn't work well for you and you're

00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,360
curious how they did it differently now

00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:43,730
is the time to ask and we got a couple

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,650
of concrete questions online and one of

00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:48,110
them that's getting a little lego guy or

00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:51,800
gal there's no hair there's no facial

00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:53,990
features no gender when we're talking

00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:56,180
about community what kind of breakdown

00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:58,040
are we talking about is it users service

00:13:56,180 --> 00:14:00,140
providers core committers evangelist

00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:03,320
who's in your community it's everybody

00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:06,470
so we get everyone from VP level down to

00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:08,390
core users down to people who are I am

00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:10,220
in the enterprise and I'm sick of

00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:12,470
shipping applications and it's taking

00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:13,580
way too long and so I'm a little curious

00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:16,460
I've heard about this cloud foundry

00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:18,260
thing so we get a very big gambit when

00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:19,760
we were first going like I think mark

00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:23,000
and I talked a lot when we first got it

00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:24,440
off the ground on our meetups in 2013 we

00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,050
were mostly vendor sitting in a room

00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:29,390
talking at each other and thank goodness

00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:31,370
we've moved past that pretty quickly yep

00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:33,470
I would say that we've seen it shift

00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:36,020
just like Kim was saying so in the early

00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:37,610
days it was interested parties either

00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:40,460
from providers or from service providers

00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:42,140
and unfortunately we've seen the

00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:44,240
adoption take place so that now we have

00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:46,700
more actual business customers

00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,170
enterprise customers at scale and and

00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,250
we've been you know really fortunate to

00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:50,810
have them come and talk about what

00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:52,340
they're doing and and that's why we

00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:54,590
really see the growth kind of

00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:56,210
accelerated so we move past kind of

00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:58,370
technology hobbyists and enthusiasts

00:14:56,210 --> 00:15:00,110
into actual real world use cases that we

00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:02,540
all really want to be talking about

00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:04,550
that's right yeah we do a mix as well so

00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:06,200
we have to bury our content we have some

00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:09,110
regulars that are experienced with Cloud

00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:10,490
Foundry and that brand new beginners so

00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:11,740
you got to make sure you know you can

00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:13,180
tailor the talk to the audience

00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:15,070
who's there I think that's pretty

00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:17,560
important as well so we get a mix and

00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:19,210
it's not consistent and in fact one of

00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:21,970
the funny things about the name Cloud

00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:23,560
Foundry is it like OpenStack open Zak's

00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:25,390
clear but Cloud Foundry sounds like a

00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,950
place it sounds like a startup incubator

00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:29,050
so sometimes you get people come in

00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:30,550
they're not thinking about glad founded

00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:32,740
a technology they're thinking about

00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:34,420
cloud in general a place to build clouds

00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:39,130
so it's kind of interesting you always

00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:41,230
get a few of those people a couple

00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:43,060
questions here the next one's kind of a

00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:48,130
logistical one how did you find the

00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:51,340
space for your meetup um the key for us

00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:53,920
is local employers who very much would

00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:56,260
like to attract like practitioners to

00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:58,390
their companies tend to be very

00:15:56,260 --> 00:16:00,280
interested in hosting and sometimes they

00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:02,050
can fund the food and drink sometimes

00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:03,460
you need another party to come in and

00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:05,890
fund the food and drink just depending

00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:08,410
but that has been the least of our

00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:10,660
problems really just because like in

00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:12,430
Minneapolis we have SPS commerce as a

00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:14,200
supply chain logistics company that

00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:16,600
wants to hire people you know in this

00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:19,270
like whole DevOps platform orchestration

00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:21,640
realm and then Target headquartered in

00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:25,720
Minneapolis is very excited and happy to

00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:28,210
host so one thing I would recommend is

00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:31,450
when you find a good venue keep going

00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:33,460
back I mean we have with our lopud group

00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:36,280
we go to the pivotal office in London

00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:36,640
and we meet there same place same day of

00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,740
the week

00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:40,960
every month which means that our

00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:43,000
regulars kind of know even before we've

00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:45,550
announced when the next meetup is or the

00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,290
schedule they know it's probably gonna

00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:49,090
be this time it's gonna be at this place

00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:53,290
we know how to find parking

00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:54,880
exactly around with different locations

00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:56,200
for awhile we were trying to do I mean

00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,810
in Seattle you've got the east side and

00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:01,540
you've got a Seattle and then in Atlanta

00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:02,920
you've got OTP and ITP and so very

00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:04,240
different people outside the perimeter

00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,650
don't want to travel the other side it's

00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,960
very similar to Seattle they don't want

00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:10,090
to travel across bridges it's traffic so

00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,500
we started getting more consistency when

00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:13,240
we started have it in the same place for

00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,920
sure I generally agree with that but

00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:17,590
we've actually had some success in New

00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:20,410
York with scheduling at IBM at pivotal

00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:22,300
at third-party companies that are users

00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:23,920
not vendors and actually a Pace

00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,910
University so we had a whole bunch of

00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,500
students come

00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:29,440
consistency is key I think the time of

00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:31,540
month the day right the third Tuesday

00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,330
and what every month I think that's more

00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:36,730
important at least for our venue in our

00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:38,470
city but if you're able to vary up the

00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:41,260
menu then you get different types of

00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:42,790
folks come out sometimes you can attach

00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:44,620
to a conference may be at the conference

00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:46,750
venue going on just like what the

00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:48,910
Silicon Valley group did here but also

00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:50,860
if you can engage students you know at

00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:53,950
the start of their semester January

00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:55,870
September you get a nice so we have a

00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:57,970
couple questions about how to start up

00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:59,710
meetup group so when you're first

00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:01,450
getting started in your small how do you

00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:03,970
attract the sponsors and the speakers

00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:05,320
and how do you generate interest when

00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:07,750
you're just beginning there's a there's

00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:09,940
several questions on that topic so so

00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:11,350
the best place to start is to look at

00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:13,930
the sponsor companies for Quad foundry

00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:15,250
foundation see who's local in your town

00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:17,260
and reach out to them via LinkedIn

00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:19,210
that's what I did in Twitter

00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:20,860
I found a pivotal se that was in

00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:23,560
Portland Oregon this is before the

00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:25,530
pivotal office in Seattle open and we

00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:27,910
kind of got it off the ground from there

00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:30,460
something related to what we were just

00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:32,680
talking about keep in mind is if you're

00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:35,290
going to bring a speaker in often like a

00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:37,900
vendor might have you know someone like

00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:39,220
me or the members of my team who travel

00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:41,560
around and speak it a lot of things

00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:43,720
having a little bit of flexibility with

00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:45,340
your days is really key because if you

00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,650
can only have your event on the third

00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:49,720
Wednesday and then the speaker that you

00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:51,340
really want is available only on Tuesday

00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:53,560
like having the flexibility there

00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:55,960
between if you can manage it with your

00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:57,400
venue and everything else gives you the

00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,350
ability to book speakers that otherwise

00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:02,740
their work travel schedule would make it

00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:04,690
impossible so in terms of starting your

00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:06,280
own meetup so we actually did a

00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:07,690
presentation last summit here and had a

00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,520
couple of best practices for that

00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:12,490
there's some slides unavailable if you

00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,930
look at clap down your summit 2015 but

00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:15,610
number one I think one of the best

00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:19,090
lessons is if you've seen a great talk

00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:21,550
here and you want that person to try to

00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:23,290
be your first speaker talk to them go

00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:24,730
out engage them on Twitter talk to them

00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:27,280
after their talks see if they're gonna

00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:27,880
be around the area or if you go to

00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,430
meetup.com

00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:32,530
find maybe you know a city that's near

00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:35,550
you and then if someone's already in

00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:37,110
town for that perhaps you know for us

00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:39,120
we CAF Bahston Washington Philadelphia

00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:41,460
New York we can kind of find the speaker

00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,260
that's on the circuit as or and kind of

00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:45,180
bring them in so that's those are two

00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:46,500
different ways and be careful too if

00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,910
you're wanting to start one from scratch

00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:50,010
make sure there's not one that's already

00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:52,380
there exactly that's my biggest number

00:19:50,010 --> 00:20:11,580
one pet peeve of community we have an

00:19:52,380 --> 00:20:16,020
audience question in person I mean I can

00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:18,180
I definitely do try to schedule to meet

00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:19,830
together with a relevant meetup group as

00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:21,990
opposed to trying to oppose them on the

00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:24,890
same night we actually the most recent

00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:27,840
DevOps meet up in Minneapolis we had a

00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:29,940
local go meetup was just starting up and

00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,200
and they were doing the work there's

00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:32,610
already ago meetup but it was really

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,890
different so they were trying to start

00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:36,930
one that would actually meet and they

00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:38,670
were actually going to book the exact

00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:39,810
same target venue on the same date and

00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:41,730
time as us and they were kind of

00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:43,620
approaching it through a different silo

00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:45,000
inside target and I suppose you know

00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:46,260
since we were already existing and

00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,580
probably could have crushed them we

00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:51,020
could have done that and instead I said

00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:51,020
come meet with us and we'll feature you

00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:56,730
and I'm trying to get to a lot of the

00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,530
questions online so if you really want

00:20:56,730 --> 00:21:00,480
yours I'm probably standing up so easier

00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:02,940
way to get it answered so I just had a

00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:05,190
couple quick questions the first one is

00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:08,010
we have a some Corey are from st. Louis

00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:10,110
we have a Cloud Foundry user group

00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:13,020
meetup in st. Louis but attendance is

00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:14,520
typically been pretty like small like

00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:18,270
typically less than 10 and most of those

00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:19,740
people are the pivotal employees so how

00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:21,210
do we you know how do we increase

00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:22,710
attendance how do we reach a broader

00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:25,440
audience I do like the idea of having

00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:27,690
like a PA's user group but I guess the

00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:30,150
second thought is since most of the

00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:32,550
employees are pivotal employees or most

00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:33,990
the attendees or pivotal employees you

00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:35,580
know I kind of get the feel I guess that

00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:37,920
it's a like a pivotal Cloud Foundry

00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:39,240
meetup instead of just like a cloud

00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:42,750
foundry in general you know we were an

00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:44,700
open source is that is there are there

00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:46,860
any other you know meetups that are that

00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:48,090
are having that kind of yeah yeah I know

00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:49,210
st. Louis pretty well because I used to

00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:51,130
work at CenturyLink and I

00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:52,540
some of the guys that help out where we

00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:54,280
always meet yeah it's in Tremont right

00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:56,590
yeah the best thing to do is look at

00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,910
your customer base and then look at

00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:59,410
other meetups that are going on and

00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:01,270
start having them cross post for you

00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:04,210
exactly yeah the cross posting so if

00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:06,760
there's a Java node Ruby open source so

00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:09,130
anything like that you can join and do a

00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:11,500
co meetup on a particular topic like for

00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:13,090
us we did you know Cloud Foundry for PHP

00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:15,190
developers right and that was a

00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:17,770
crossover that we had to get on and it

00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:19,000
made both groups you know larger they

00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:20,620
both got to meet and learn the

00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,710
technology and that's we want to do

00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:26,800
going forward in New York is you know

00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:28,660
there's Java and YC there's NYC Rubeus

00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:31,150
things like that by joining with those

00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:32,770
groups it's a good way to just cross

00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:34,180
pollinate and get people aware and I

00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:36,160
think if you look for strong meetups in

00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:37,870
your area in related topics so the

00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:40,090
Denver Java users group and the Denver

00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:41,830
open source users group are both kind of

00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:43,660
related to what we're doing and

00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:46,090
interested in so we've actually gone and

00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:47,740
done presentations at those venues and

00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:49,450
what that tends to do is drive

00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:51,550
attendance back because they want to go

00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:53,380
deep perhaps on the Cloud Foundry side

00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:55,720
and and you know we're support each

00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:56,830
other's communities and and so that's

00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,690
you know it's just we helped drive

00:22:56,830 --> 00:23:00,490
attendance for them and in return we get

00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:03,160
something back and so it's you know it's

00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:04,630
a win for both you really you can't go

00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:08,410
wrong partnering with darker darker

00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:09,850
darker bingo focus that's like if I

00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:10,960
could go back and say hey you know to

00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:12,730
the Cloud Foundry meetup let's start

00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,250
talking about docker kubernetes or like

00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:17,050
some great containers and Anita and just

00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:18,550
tweet it and have people tweet you think

00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:21,160
you know just container eyes your meetup

00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:23,800
exactly so we are an open source

00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:24,760
software project and and so those those

00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,680
other projects may sound like

00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:28,180
competitors but part of our strengths is

00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:30,040
figuring out how to work with them and

00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:31,900
how to how to make those technologies

00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:33,580
work together if users are trying to use

00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:35,260
them both so I don't think it's bad to

00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:37,540
like feed your doctor at a cloud from

00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:39,520
you know when considering I just like

00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:41,920
just came out of a great talk at Cloud

00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:44,320
Foundry summit all about using

00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:46,710
containers using cloud Condrey as a

00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:49,450
container orchestration engine and how I

00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:51,400
run see is now in cloud foundry like

00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:52,720
that would be a great talk at anyone's

00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,700
made up you could get something like

00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:57,010
that it was standing room only three

00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:59,920
rows back is what I heard I have another

00:23:57,010 --> 00:24:00,679
logistical question how do you schedule

00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,509
that

00:24:00,679 --> 00:24:04,580
like it always talks is that sometimes

00:24:02,509 --> 00:24:06,830
workshop Cesare one speaker two speakers

00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:08,299
I think like the Denver meetup usually

00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:11,240
tries I have like a user story and then

00:24:08,299 --> 00:24:16,940
a technical talk what so we have a

00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:18,710
pretty standard format in lo pug I don't

00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:20,950
know if it's the right format but as

00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:24,320
what we always do so typically we have

00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:26,450
two speakers on a night we will open the

00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:28,610
doors at 6:30 p.m. and we have food and

00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:31,580
drinks available for people to arrive we

00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:33,440
start the first talk at 7:00 p.m. and we

00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:36,169
offer the speaker kind of 25 to 30

00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:38,539
minutes with cue a quick break second

00:24:36,169 --> 00:24:40,460
speaker that's also 30 minutes so we aim

00:24:38,539 --> 00:24:42,259
to be kind of done with the talks just

00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:44,330
after 8:00 p.m. then we have a bit more

00:24:42,259 --> 00:24:46,399
time for networking and conversation and

00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:49,909
then people leave generally around 9:00

00:24:46,399 --> 00:24:52,100
and then what we started doing is once a

00:24:49,909 --> 00:24:54,440
years we do it in November we'll have a

00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:57,049
lightning talks of em and we tend to

00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:59,230
have between 6 to 8 speakers each

00:24:57,049 --> 00:25:01,309
speaker does five minutes and what we

00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:03,350
specifically try and do at that meetup

00:25:01,309 --> 00:25:06,259
is encourage speakers who have never

00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:08,929
spoken before so we try to get you know

00:25:06,259 --> 00:25:11,840
first time speakers or kind of

00:25:08,929 --> 00:25:14,029
underrepresented kind of groups to kind

00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,379
of come someone to come and speak we had

00:25:14,029 --> 00:25:17,960
somebody who spoke at our lightning

00:25:15,379 --> 00:25:20,450
talks two years ago and she's now gone

00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:22,190
on to speak all around the world at

00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:24,799
different conferences and she came she

00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:27,379
came back last week and gave a half an

00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:29,029
hour talk at our session and one of our

00:25:27,379 --> 00:25:31,610
kind of audience members said it was the

00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:33,619
best talk they'd ever seen I think we

00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:37,129
also rotate and try to pick an

00:25:33,619 --> 00:25:39,019
introductory topic so in January we had

00:25:37,129 --> 00:25:41,840
a couple of our regulars you have a kind

00:25:39,019 --> 00:25:43,879
of a Cloud Foundry 101 talk and it was

00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:47,480
one of our biggest attendance you know

00:25:43,879 --> 00:25:48,889
events of the year because there over

00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:52,399
time it becomes kind of this pent-up

00:25:48,889 --> 00:25:54,470
demand to do you know to really get into

00:25:52,399 --> 00:25:56,330
the basics and and you gather people

00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:57,950
that are new and you need to come back

00:25:56,330 --> 00:26:00,740
and address that from time to time as

00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:02,210
well yeah we do that too the Atlanta

00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:04,850
meetup is very different than Seattle

00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:06,259
Atlanta has not you know traditionally a

00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:10,639
little bit behind the curve sometimes

00:26:06,259 --> 00:26:11,990
and so we have to do mostly just meet up

00:26:10,639 --> 00:26:13,070
and get starting to build community

00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:14,419
we're still very much in the

00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:16,909
holding community things there and so

00:26:14,419 --> 00:26:18,769
well we'll do the 101 will do you know a

00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:20,659
little a piece of what the clock foundry

00:26:18,769 --> 00:26:22,309
platform does you know what kind of

00:26:20,659 --> 00:26:24,950
focus on those things Seattle were

00:26:22,309 --> 00:26:26,750
afforded better you know not better but

00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:28,250
like more speaker availability it seems

00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:29,899
like because we do have so many of the

00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:32,929
vendors that are there in Seattle and we

00:26:29,899 --> 00:26:34,460
do it we have one speaker typically but

00:26:32,929 --> 00:26:36,470
we meet every third Thursday of the web

00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:39,830
Wednesday when every third Wednesday so

00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:42,080
so we have a another set of questions

00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:44,029
that relates to how do you get feedback

00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:46,429
from your meetups to the broader

00:26:44,029 --> 00:26:47,690
community what support does the Cloud

00:26:46,429 --> 00:26:49,370
Foundry foundation of the Cloud Foundry

00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:51,200
community offer you so how did your

00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:54,320
meetup interact with the larger world of

00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:58,100
Cloud Foundry both directions I'm asking

00:26:54,320 --> 00:27:01,279
you like four questions at once so

00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:02,389
feedback we try try to email folks twice

00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:03,889
a month like usually when we're

00:27:02,389 --> 00:27:05,419
announcing the meetup and then we tell

00:27:03,889 --> 00:27:07,039
them what's going on but after the

00:27:05,419 --> 00:27:08,570
meetup say hey here's the slides you

00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:10,580
know what did you like would you not

00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:12,350
like you know which are you interested

00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:14,600
in speaking we're always asking that as

00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:17,389
well so as far as foundation goes

00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:18,559
Stormies created pulling together the

00:27:17,389 --> 00:27:19,940
foundations pulling the other list of

00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:21,320
speakers who people are willing to come

00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:23,149
speak at different meetups and things

00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:25,429
like that and so that's been helpful as

00:27:23,149 --> 00:27:26,629
well yeah I'll put in the pitch if you

00:27:25,429 --> 00:27:27,740
are a speaker and want to speak at a

00:27:26,629 --> 00:27:32,539
meet-up there are a lot of people

00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:36,259
looking for speakers so question on the

00:27:32,539 --> 00:27:39,289
floor just wondering how big of a factor

00:27:36,259 --> 00:27:41,120
is a beer and a draw for attendance at

00:27:39,289 --> 00:27:43,190
these meetups is that to help with the

00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,659
tendance and president rumor that there

00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:46,639
was possibly gonna be something here

00:27:44,659 --> 00:27:48,740
later today yeah I told y'all to go to

00:27:46,639 --> 00:27:53,870
the bar and get a beer and apparently

00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:56,539
I'm the only one who did that ya know we

00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:58,279
have beer pivitol does beer and wine and

00:27:56,539 --> 00:28:00,169
we provide the food and it's usually

00:27:58,279 --> 00:28:03,139
people look forward to that conversation

00:28:00,169 --> 00:28:04,429
for sure it's more of a festive yeah you

00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:06,769
definitely have like one of the best

00:28:04,429 --> 00:28:09,169
practices we have now is similar to

00:28:06,769 --> 00:28:12,049
Paula's where we have the pre networking

00:28:09,169 --> 00:28:13,610
which is the drinking the snacks you do

00:28:12,049 --> 00:28:15,470
the presentation and then you have the

00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:16,730
QA and a little more networking even if

00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:17,870
it's not the same venue people are

00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:20,299
encouraged to kind of go to a nearby

00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:22,129
watering hole or something like that but

00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:23,330
you definitely it's table stakes now it

00:28:22,129 --> 00:28:25,220
used to be you could just do ad hoc

00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:26,720
meetups and not have beer but

00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:28,730
you have to do that how you know your

00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,169
meetup is going well as everybody wants

00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:32,240
to get together after and go drink your

00:28:30,169 --> 00:28:35,390
yeah something I think important to

00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:37,760
remember though is if you have delicious

00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:39,770
beer and delicious food and if somebody

00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,990
like say me I like beer but I don't

00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:43,490
always want beer and if I don't want to

00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:45,500
drink a beer or my friends who don't

00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:47,150
drink beer are there and like there's

00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:48,440
literally nothing for them to drink and

00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:50,750
it's like there's the drinking fountain

00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:51,950
that's not very hospitable so it's

00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:53,450
important to remember that not

00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:55,100
everyone's gonna want a beer at any

00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:59,120
given moment and you have some other

00:28:55,100 --> 00:29:01,130
choice we've had sponsors in our meetup

00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,480
in Denver that have signed up to either

00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:04,970
provide the drink will provide the food

00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:07,130
and so that's been a big enabler so that

00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:08,659
we we don't have to necessarily go hat

00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:11,179
in hand trying to find people for that

00:29:08,659 --> 00:29:13,400
we've had some sign up for multiple

00:29:11,179 --> 00:29:14,900
events you know or a quarter or two

00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:19,340
quarters at a time and so that's been

00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:21,140
it's been helpful so I'd like to hear

00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:23,000
from everybody on this next question and

00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:24,409
that's how do you know if your meetup is

00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,960
successful like how do you know if your

00:29:24,409 --> 00:29:29,030
community is growing and is vibrant and

00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,830
is a healthy happy community

00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:32,150
Kim you mentioned that if they like to

00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:33,789
go out afterwards and hang out together

00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:36,380
that's a good sign

00:29:33,789 --> 00:29:38,000
definitely it feels like we haven't had

00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:39,289
enough time they're kicking us out let's

00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,669
go over here and you know hang out and

00:29:39,289 --> 00:29:42,860
keep talking so that I think that's

00:29:40,669 --> 00:29:44,659
always a great sign yeah what starts

00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:45,710
happening yep one of my favorite

00:29:44,659 --> 00:29:47,750
features actually I just discovered

00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:49,760
about meetup.com is you can set up for

00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:52,970
your group that anybody can schedule an

00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:55,010
event and once three or five people RSVP

00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:56,120
for it it's automatically announced and

00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:58,490
sometimes that's happened to me I'm like

00:29:56,120 --> 00:30:00,169
oh I didn't know that happening but it

00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:01,460
shows user interest people are getting

00:30:00,169 --> 00:30:03,950
involved they're coming up with topics

00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:05,630
they're you know presenting just being

00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:09,020
proactive about it that makes me excited

00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:11,600
one good indicator I find is the kind of

00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:13,549
the regulars that keep coming back I

00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:16,669
think it's a really good sign when

00:30:13,549 --> 00:30:18,409
you've got a set it's not always great

00:30:16,669 --> 00:30:20,450
but to see the lots of faces who are

00:30:18,409 --> 00:30:21,620
kind of continuously interested in keep

00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:22,760
coming back and then they're spreading

00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:24,770
the word and they're not bring a few

00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:27,380
more people along with them you'll see

00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:29,090
someone who maybe came as a new person

00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:30,740
to Clara foundry and suddenly they're

00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:32,539
working at pivotal and you're like oh

00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:33,919
I've seen your face before because

00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:35,929
you've been to my Meetup and now you're

00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:37,700
working here which is you know fantastic

00:30:35,929 --> 00:30:38,110
I think another sign of health is when

00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,790
the

00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:41,650
starts being identity so that the the

00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:42,670
group itself says hey we don't want

00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:44,620
vendor pitches

00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:46,720
we don't want fluff you know we either

00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:48,940
want substantive technical content or

00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,740
real-world business stories but don't

00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:53,080
you know don't give us kind of easy

00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:54,670
stakes kind of things and so the group

00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:56,950
begins to take on an identity and kind

00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:58,420
of demand a higher quality of content a

00:30:56,950 --> 00:31:00,610
higher quality of speaker not the

00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:02,170
professional pitch but you know more

00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:04,330
substantive content and I think that's

00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:06,280
you know when we saw kind of a the

00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:08,070
tipping point for our meetup is when the

00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:12,940
group began to say this is what we want

00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:15,970
yeah that wasn't it and yeah and I think

00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:18,429
that that's totally right and also per

00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:19,840
Paula's point not just people coming to

00:31:18,429 --> 00:31:21,760
work at pivot although please can work

00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,230
at pivotal pivotal dot IO slash careers

00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:26,380
she saw it was on the keynote stage this

00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:27,850
morning but for not just any specific

00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:30,250
company that may or may not be assisting

00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:31,540
with the meetup but people inside your

00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:33,910
community excited about the technology

00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:35,919
learning about it and getting jobs

00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:37,990
throughout your community using the

00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:39,580
technology as you see that happening I

00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:41,799
think that's a sign that the meetup is

00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:44,169
functioning as you know within

00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:45,370
acceptable parameters because the whole

00:31:44,169 --> 00:31:46,780
point of getting people together in

00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:48,250
person is so that they can do things

00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:50,919
that they're going to do in person like

00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:52,870
you know get these new jobs when I think

00:31:50,919 --> 00:31:55,270
you know the participants of the meetup

00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:58,090
begin to be recognized for hey I saw you

00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:59,679
in the Meetup I heard that talk I really

00:31:58,090 --> 00:32:01,510
liked what you said and then that

00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:03,850
becomes you know you become known for

00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:06,460
contributions and and your company or

00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:08,380
your individual brand is is known you

00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:09,669
know beyond just the that scheduled

00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:12,940
night of the month when you're having

00:32:09,669 --> 00:32:14,320
the meeting so that is some tidbits to

00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:16,690
give you on how to run a meet-up

00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:18,280
hopefully you were inspired to either go

00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:20,980
to your local meetup or help start one

00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:23,350
if you don't have one to wrap this up I

00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:25,540
have a mint a little Lego Cloud Foundry

00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:27,850
figures and some of them have smiles

00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:32,070
some of them have frowns one has a beard

00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:35,290
and we're gonna do a odd foundry mita

00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:37,210
bake-off so a bunch of you stood up and

00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:38,830

you very much for joining us the meetups

00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:23,860
are a super important part of Cloud

00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:25,990
Foundry they are I think a really vital

00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:28,120
part of how new people join the Cloud

00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:29,650
Foundry community and how companies and

00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:31,450
individuals decide to evaluate the

00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:33,670
technology and find other people to talk

00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:35,220
to so this is a crucial part of keeping

00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:37,180
our community alive and healthy and

00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:39,310

00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:41,680
