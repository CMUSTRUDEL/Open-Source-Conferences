Oh

00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,500
you

00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:17,280
I think it's being recorded excellent

00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:18,210
welcome to Cloud Foundry July community

00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:21,210
advisory board

00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:25,170
I guess the meeting is being recorded so

00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:28,380
if you sort disapprove of that I guess

00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:32,369
you have to drop with that said we have

00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:35,460
a nice agenda today and we'll get

00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:37,800
started I'm actually very excited about

00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,329
you know some of the talks oh so that

00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,820
should be good let's see if we can give

00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:44,910
them as much time as possible we usually

00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:49,290
go and do kind of a regular set of

00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:51,270
checks so we start with the foundation

00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:54,240
especially because there's a summit

00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:57,000
coming up in Hague the Netherlands in

00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:59,490
September and we have suona here who can

00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,220
probably give us some some of that you

00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:03,710
also put it in agenda so if you go to

00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:07,170
the agenda you can see some of that

00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:09,900
updates there yeah

00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:11,880
I will keep it short and sweet um the

00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,850
schedule is now live it's on the website

00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:17,820
so you can take a look at it and start

00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:19,350
adding sessions to your agenda there are

00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,540
a lot of pre-summit activities even

00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:24,290
though the summit actually starts on

00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:27,630
September 11th which is 17 months away

00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:29,340
there are a lot of these zero activities

00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:31,110
like unconference contributors some ID

00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,060
user day certification hackathon so

00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:36,030
let's check up on all of those in the

00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,680
agenda document or the meeting notes

00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,440
documents so take a look at those and

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,850
make sure that you are attending

00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:43,619
planning your travel accordingly so that

00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:46,350
you can attend one or more of those

00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:48,900
Stasia activities just quick reminder

00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:51,330
the standard registration ends on August

00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:54,090
2nd so the prices will go up from August

00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:55,440
3rd so if you are not registered yet I

00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:57,780
would highly recommend get registered

00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:00,180
now if you are a current or a past

00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:03,390
contributor there is a code where you

00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:05,820
can register at 0 go so let me know if

00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,409
you haven't seen the code or there I

00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:10,080
have sent an email in this year to have

00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:12,330
meting list with the code other than

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,980
that I don't have any updates but if you

00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:16,790
have any questions I'm around to the end

00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:18,750
of this call or on slack or email

00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:23,279
excellent very efficient think he's

00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:27,150
gonna again i guess i'll you know rien

00:02:23,279 --> 00:02:30,930
cyst on the hackathon be helped

00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:33,030
run that again so it's it's a great

00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:35,099
opportunity for you to happen something

00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:38,760
you'll have a day and there's good

00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:42,799
prizes and you get to be to go in on

00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:46,290
stage and chicken with happy addy so

00:02:42,799 --> 00:02:47,849
that's that's what something I think we

00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:49,799
also have the tradition of the previous

00:02:47,849 --> 00:02:51,750
hackathon winners becoming the keynote

00:02:49,799 --> 00:02:53,790
speakers at the following or the

00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:57,269
subsequent summit so that's one chance

00:02:53,790 --> 00:03:00,629
as well indeed whatever the cost of like

00:02:57,269 --> 00:03:02,370
getting an invited speaker you know or

00:03:00,629 --> 00:03:04,049
not invited speaker sorry the sponsored

00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:06,659
speaker that's about what it's what it's

00:03:04,049 --> 00:03:08,489
worth you know you look at it from money

00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:10,709
perspective but I don't get it more

00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:12,239
that's pride right so more important

00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:14,879
anyway

00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,799
so you listening to this when you

00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,010
register you can click on the hackathon

00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:23,549
thing there's like a little button

00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:25,950
alright yes we do updates of projects we

00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:31,260
have Eric here who's gonna tell us all

00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:32,879
about thanks dr. max yeah sure oh just

00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:34,949
give a quick rundown of some updates

00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,180
over the past month or so actually one

00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:38,250
thing that I'll be sending an email to

00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,349
see if dev about soon is that we're

00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:41,459
trying to have a more centralized point

00:03:40,349 --> 00:03:43,409
for tracking

00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:45,569
community proposals that typically just

00:03:43,409 --> 00:03:48,659
get broadcast on CF dev

00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:50,430
so I've linked to the repo in there

00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:51,540
we've already pre-populated it with some

00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:54,389
of the proposals that have come out

00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:56,609
recently the idea is to have using

00:03:54,389 --> 00:03:59,040
github issues and projects with them

00:03:56,609 --> 00:04:00,810
somewhat more systematic format to track

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:04,859
those proposals where to find them who

00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:07,019
to contact expectations around deadlines

00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:09,060
for commentary that kind of thing and

00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:10,769
statuses of course like if they're still

00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,299
under review if teams working on them

00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:15,000
that kind of thing

00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:18,120
yeah so definitely thanks just wanna and

00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,669
chip and Li Chen here live Atal or

00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,380
helping actually make that happen

00:04:19,669 --> 00:04:23,760
definitely appreciate it a few other

00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:27,389
things to note

00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:28,800
speaking of proposals we've had Necedah

00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:30,599
breaking changes for safe deployment

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,220
version 10 proposed should be getting

00:04:30,599 --> 00:04:34,380
released soon I think most of the

00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:36,780
discussions died down on that document

00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:38,610
also had a minor release of the CLI I

00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:42,300
think the main feature there is some

00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:44,190
experimental support for initiating

00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:47,190
upgrades of service instances through

00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:49,530
the CLI so that's pretty exciting some

00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:52,620
of the updates know Kathy is continuing

00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:54,480
to work on better States and reporting

00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:56,310
around rolling deployments tactic of all

00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:58,410
the proposals and that proposals repo

00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:59,880
address those I think there's still time

00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:01,170
for some commentary on those if you

00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:04,470
haven't had a chance to take a look at

00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:05,790
those one thing of note UAA apparently

00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,590
has some dramatic performance

00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:08,910
improvements on its users end point so

00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:11,390
if you've been using that frame kind of

00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:12,960
polling or synchronization time systems

00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:18,870
some other things

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:22,050
Diego has closed up some of the last non

00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:24,960
TLS communication inside of fly Fabri

00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:26,550
we've had this little file server

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,410
component to deliver some fairly static

00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:31,980
assets that had previously been

00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:33,780
overplayed HTTP so that's all secured I

00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:36,030
know everyone's very interested in

00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:38,040
ireenie updates released I've seen from

00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:40,770
the team is that originally been working

00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:45,090
on various scale and performance

00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:47,430
improvements and pardoning there they

00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:48,870
also recently had a internal team

00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,790
intention about the next set of

00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:53,640
priorities so I will be getting some up

00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:55,080
a schedule so that seen some other

00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:57,060
things speaking of scale of the

00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:59,580
networking program is continuing to

00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:02,400
improve the scale on which they can

00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:05,400
support various new integrations so kind

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,670
of weighted routing for traffic

00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:10,140
ingressing to the platform and then also

00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:12,860
continuing to support better scale for

00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:15,900
the still experimental sidecar

00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:19,370
client-side load balancing that takes

00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:22,980
takes advantage of ESI coverage there

00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:25,560
and all in those lines we've we've had

00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:27,690
something of a gap between Linux and

00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:30,450
Windows apps in terms of having goo

00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:32,220
routers do TLS to application instances

00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:34,200
and the garden windows team has been

00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:37,670
making great progress on actually using

00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:40,020
nginx to absorb some of the Envoy

00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:42,120
configuration and provide that on

00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:43,710
Windows given that envoy is still pretty

00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,630
unstable and not really supported on

00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:51,410
with it it's all

00:06:46,630 --> 00:07:00,289
some thank you Eric any questions for

00:06:51,410 --> 00:07:02,810
Eric no okay we'll go to update from

00:07:00,289 --> 00:07:06,169
Bosch the team already posted their

00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:08,419
updates I don't know if Morgan is on the

00:07:06,169 --> 00:07:11,900
call I think they think maybe it's a

00:07:08,419 --> 00:07:14,710
little bit ok anybody else from Baja

00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:19,550
otherwise I'll read it I guess there are

00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:23,840
version released 270 point three that's

00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:29,300
kind of impressive is it anyone unless

00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:33,380
it's 27 but I'm not sure but that's what

00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:35,840
they said and then they mentioned that

00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:38,449
the director team is main focus right

00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:41,530
now is working on new endpoints to

00:07:38,449 --> 00:07:45,919
improve the behavior of Bosch start/stop

00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:48,909
recreate restart types of come in so

00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:55,580
very small updates on Bosch but I guess

00:07:48,909 --> 00:07:57,620
they're training alone I'm not able to

00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:59,930
answer any questions on Bosch at this

00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:04,009
point so maybe if you have questions you

00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:08,240
can ping Morgan or Marco thank you and

00:08:04,009 --> 00:08:10,280
for extensions briefly I'll mention that

00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,940
you know a lot of the projects have

00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:16,550
graduated or at least one of them is

00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:18,289
moving to attic I keep them there I'll

00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:22,130
remove it for next time I said that last

00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:24,530
time but I'll do it this time and we

00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:27,349
have a demo from Stratos which is

00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:30,050
probably our most that's whole project

00:08:27,349 --> 00:08:32,719
and you'll see it's actually quite good

00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:35,839
and me'll is here to give us some of

00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:37,520
where he's moving the project he's also

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,560
looking to graduate so that will

00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:41,719
graduate you so if you have projects

00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,380
that you want to submit to extension you

00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:46,970
let me know

00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:49,100
and with that we'll stop here and see if

00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:52,550
there's any questions on you know

00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:56,360
communities start for projects otherwise

00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:58,850
we'll ask David to take over so he can

00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,140
present this from the Comcast team and

00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:04,420
it's presenting a

00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:04,420
external DNS connection for my laundry I

00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:22,100
don't see any question David okay let me

00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:27,410
share my screen we can see it okay cool

00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:29,060
okay let me get started so I think a few

00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:31,820
few the Comcast folks including myself

00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:34,160
around two months ago we were gonna talk

00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:35,750
about two projects I think you only got

00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,090
a chance to talk about the vault plug

00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:41,510
app so I'm gonna spend some time today

00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:45,080
talking about some DNS connector work

00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:49,280
we've been doing or that was proposed by

00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:56,750
some of the Cloud Foundry operators here

00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:59,720
Comcast so this is a David I mean sankur

00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:02,270
yours the presentation because it's at

00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:04,550
least on my and it's not trilling it's

00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:08,180
getting come on getting cut under lit up

00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:11,420
okay let me stop doing the unplug the

00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:14,530
second monitor cool thank you so

00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:14,530
everything now you

00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:21,450
you just share a PowerPoint you see if

00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:26,519
that makes it better yeah that should be

00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:28,649
good now better oh no once with I guess

00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:30,600
a full screen that's when it's in Tucker

00:10:28,649 --> 00:10:35,180
I'll keep it off presentation load them

00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:35,180
all right perfect not wait okay cool so

00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:40,019
problem statement I think in this leg

00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:42,930
Ana I'm coming in as a developer I think

00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:44,910
some of these features were described to

00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:47,370
me and some of the developer folks from

00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:50,100
the operators as problems that they have

00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:52,800
found with or people that developers

00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,850
using Cloud Foundry have found with some

00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,870
things here at Comcast were just

00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:56,790
generally so from a developer's

00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:58,050
perspective you know your application is

00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:01,380
only bound to a single Cloud Foundry

00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:04,230
foundation so not necessarily that

00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:07,829
portable and the DNS name is tied to the

00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:09,390
name of the application so what we

00:11:07,829 --> 00:11:11,490
started looking at is there's a project

00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:14,940
called external DNS it's a kubernetes

00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:16,620
incubator project and if the premise of

00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:21,060
that project is that configures external

00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:23,160
DNS servers so AWS 1:53 GCP it's got a

00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:27,839
whole list of them for kubernetes

00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:31,260
ingress and services so our proposal was

00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:34,170
to look at could we extend that project

00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:37,709
to also support Cloud Foundry so that

00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:39,480
way you'd get the benefit of having all

00:11:37,709 --> 00:11:42,750
the integration with the existing DNS

00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:44,370
providers and extend that to Cloud

00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:47,490
Foundry so 70 functionality of external

00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:51,360
DNS to include cloud hugger as a source

00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:53,160
type and that will basically extract DNS

00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:57,329
so the fqdn s are not tied to a single

00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:59,250
foundation so the general idea would be

00:11:57,329 --> 00:12:02,490
let's say you have two Cloud Foundry

00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:04,529
sites and you have this external DNS

00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:08,699
let's say you have two of them running

00:12:04,529 --> 00:12:12,480
pointing to route 53 and the idea with

00:12:08,699 --> 00:12:14,070
them is that they're looking for routes

00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,019
that show up on the Cloud Foundry sites

00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:19,829
with a certain DNS name so let's say I

00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:22,110
anything that's Comcast net so if you

00:12:19,829 --> 00:12:24,270
have a domain registrar convey to the

00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:27,060
Cloud Foundry sites Comcast net when you

00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:28,800
make a new app on Cloud Foundry let's

00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:30,630
say it assumes the default name of the

00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,150
compadre foundation

00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:35,600
so on the Comcast side that's some

00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:40,170
site-specific name dot you know

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:44,040
comcast.net or.net or whatever if you

00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:45,380
add an app there with this name let's

00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:48,960
say you want to add another route

00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:51,410
something like app comcast.net this

00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:54,030
really inherently is not a routable name

00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:56,150
because Comcast on that is not

00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:59,240
controlled by this Cloud Foundry site

00:12:56,150 --> 00:13:02,460
it's controlled by let's say rough mp3

00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:06,180
the idea here would be that external DNS

00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:08,550
can kind of pull Cloud Foundry saying

00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:12,000
give me all the routes that match this

00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:15,030
donate this domain and then make an

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,410
entry on the rough and d3 side or any of

00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:21,120
the DNS providers of external DNS

00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:24,630
supports so that this cname basically

00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:27,060
maps back to this name on the Cloud

00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:29,670
Foundry side and then the benefit of

00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:31,440
that or like like one of the common use

00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:33,090
cases we see here is that if you wanted

00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,030
to move this app now from Cloud Foundry

00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:38,370
site 1 to cloud foundry site to your

00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:40,950
your clients using this name basically

00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:44,280
don't have to change the name of the app

00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:47,900
they're using or you know they don't

00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:49,860
have to have any of the DNS records

00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,580
manually update that this is just

00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:52,140
something that's running in the

00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:55,650
background kind of polling both of these

00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:58,950
Cloud Foundry sites and updating the

00:13:55,650 --> 00:14:01,350
name of the DNS provider side so I have

00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:04,170
a quick demo that I recorded just so I

00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:05,490
wouldn't end up stumbling to things that

00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:06,600
I can show real quick but I just wanted

00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:15,870
to pause and see if anybody has any

00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:27,090
questions ok let me show this quick

00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:29,310
video and you see this ok yeah looks ok

00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:31,020
well so one of the challenges I had with

00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:32,670
this was just trying to record a video

00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:34,500
using our Cloud Foundry instance I'm not

00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:37,800
showing too many host names so the demo

00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:39,900
is a little sparse since it's being

00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:41,640
recorded but I'll go through and then we

00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:43,830
can kinda just explain what's happening

00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:46,860
so in the

00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:48,750
let's say I have no apps deployed on the

00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:53,250
cloud country that I'm using no apps no

00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:56,399
routes so I push a new app

00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:58,670
I sped this up because it takes a long

00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,670
time

00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:09,150
say I have that new app and that's some

00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:11,220
some random generally a name and then

00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:14,220
this is the DNS name I chose which is

00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:17,430
just a zone that we had here at Comcast

00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:19,590
that we use for testing and let's say I

00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:24,840
add another route to that so in the end

00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:27,180
I have two routes for my app this random

00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:29,340
name and then let's say demo site in

00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:31,170
theory this this first one wouldn't be

00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:32,760
mapped this time I just wanted to hide

00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:34,860
what the actual Cloud Foundry domain

00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:37,110
here is a Comcast but the the general

00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:39,780
idea is that if I want to keep this demo

00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:42,180
site dot illness not kept SPS that

00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:43,950
Comcast that net name portable across

00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:48,540
Cloud Foundry grande gyms I'd like to

00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:51,270
map this to the DNS provider outside of

00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:52,770
cloud foundry so now that this is these

00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:55,980
routes are there and the app is up and

00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:57,410
running external the DNS is basically

00:15:55,980 --> 00:16:00,390
running it in the background

00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:02,370
the default is it runs every minute so

00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:03,840
it's gonna look and see did a new entry

00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:05,370
get added and should I register that

00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:07,740
with the DNS provider so I'm gonna do a

00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:09,930
dig against this just to show that this

00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:14,070
like nothing comes back and if I do a

00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:15,660
curl right now also it's not nothing's

00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:17,490
gonna it's not gonna work just because

00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:19,950
the DNS isn't resolved yet

00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:22,680
I basically waited a minute or two and

00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:26,010
then from another machine basically show

00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:27,930
that the curl will work against that

00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:29,820
site now again I'm not showing the DNS

00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:32,460
ID but that was just because I was

00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:42,210
trying to you know hide hide some

00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:46,380
details for the for the video so that

00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:48,839
that's it that's the demo I can show

00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,920
some more details or show code doing and

00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:53,040
what people want to see or if they have

00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:55,980
they have questions so I remember that

00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:58,350
the link that you said that we included

00:16:55,980 --> 00:17:01,280
in the agenda is a PR what's the status

00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:04,890
of that the PR is actually merged

00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:07,800
there's not a ton of documentation that

00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:10,890
got merged along with it I was kind of

00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:12,270
holding off until the I presented at the

00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:13,699
cabinet kind of figure out like what the

00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:16,350
feedback was that there's anything

00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:18,029
specific we wanted to include

00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:21,209
so if you go to the external DNS site

00:17:18,029 --> 00:17:23,039
now what you end up seeing is it mostly

00:17:21,209 --> 00:17:24,750
talks about kubernetes not necessarily

00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:27,510
cloud boundary but the source is in

00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:32,760
there so they support like I said the

00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:35,070
two kubernetes sources and then the the

00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:39,390
Cloud Foundry boundary basically they

00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:41,760
look for anything with routes now and as

00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:43,740
a operator of the Cloud Foundry

00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:46,020
foundation what do I need to do to

00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:48,809
enable this maybe you can give us an

00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:51,210
idea yeah so you would though the common

00:17:48,809 --> 00:17:53,399
pattern I think to run external DNS now

00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:55,350
for kubernetes is to run it within the

00:17:53,399 --> 00:17:56,970
pod that you're running kubernetes so

00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:58,140
the way that I have been running in the

00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:59,640
way that we talked about running it is

00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:02,039
kind of similar like you would just run

00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:05,669
it within your within your Cloud Foundry

00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:09,630
site so maybe each developer would run

00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:10,919
it for their app or you can run it

00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:13,200
within your organization or whatever

00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:14,669
there's no restrictions of that a

00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:18,270
certain Cloud Foundry it's just a docker

00:18:14,669 --> 00:18:20,399
container so the idea is you when you

00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:22,200
run it you point it at a DNS provider

00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:23,940
and you point it up the clump Hungary

00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,500
instance that you want to run just with

00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:29,100
some authentication so we can read the

00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:30,720
routes and then it's syncing the two is

00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:32,010
that that's yeah it's sinking in the

00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,929
background so basically every minute

00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:36,480
we'll we'll go list all the routes on

00:18:33,929 --> 00:18:39,630
the Cloud Foundry side and then it will

00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,580
go list all the entries on the whatever

00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:44,399
hosted zone you're using and if long as

00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:48,200
a domain names match then it will create

00:18:44,399 --> 00:18:50,820
delete or update to keep them in sync

00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:52,529
and then you know there's kind of

00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:54,539
nuances to each DNS provider of like

00:18:52,529 --> 00:18:57,120
what kind of names it's creating and how

00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:58,350
it keeps track of the records it's

00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:02,190
creating versus once you don't want it

00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:06,720
to touch but you know just from like the

00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:08,880
comment like create a cname for each app

00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:12,110
I have and like let's say rough 53

00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,110
that's straight board

00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:18,900
and of course I mean obvious question is

00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:23,460
that if the foundation got let's say

00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:25,740
updated and you know if it's deployed on

00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:29,820
VMs the VMS got recreated and so on to

00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:31,890
blush it it will sync up everything yeah

00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:34,050
the idea is and I mean this might be a

00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:35,190
difference between I guess how people

00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:36,480
set up Cloud Foundry different companies

00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:38,220
the way that ours is the way that ours

00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,470
is set up is that there's a wild-card

00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:43,320
DNS to everything on a certain

00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:45,690
foundation site so like site 1 Comcast

00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:48,180
on that whatever the URL is so as long

00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:51,090
as the as long as you you're getting

00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:57,150
back to that Cloud Foundry foundation

00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:59,010
with the right app name and you know

00:19:57,150 --> 00:20:00,270
wildcard DNS came to get you back to the

00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:02,750
foundation it doesn't necessarily matter

00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:05,460
where it's deployed behind the scenes I

00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:09,300
don't know if that's like a nuance of

00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:10,710
our deployment or not but I think one of

00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:12,660
the things that would be would be good

00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:14,730
is if people think this would be useful

00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:16,470
to get some feedback on like is there a

00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:18,810
reg cases that we didn't think about

00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:22,170
that are potentially applicable to other

00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:26,460
people running Cloud Foundry in

00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:29,010
different ways cool let's see if there

00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:33,740
is more questions I don't see anything

00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:36,840
in the chat and on the slack Channel

00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:38,010
let me share the make sure the repo real

00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:40,260
quick just so I can to her like the

00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:46,800
project replica people know it or there

00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:48,570
is sure there's actually a question I'll

00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:54,180
read it

00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:56,700
so in stacked or bush PL I'm sorry I'm

00:20:54,180 --> 00:21:01,230
mispronouncing it it's a great great

00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:03,090
presentation on DNS and he asked is the

00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:07,890
intent of this project to eventually

00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:10,140
allow users global DNS so that if one CF

00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:15,240
foundation is down the app can fail to

00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:18,960
another foundation so that that would be

00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:20,940
doable I think the and this is kind of

00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,880
DNS provider specific I think so some

00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:26,820
providers like let's say that run 53 let

00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,960
you do like wait and see names and then

00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:31,619
they do health checks

00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:33,029
so like you can imagine creating to see

00:21:31,619 --> 00:21:34,649
names with the same DMS into two

00:21:33,029 --> 00:21:37,769
different foundations so it could kind

00:21:34,649 --> 00:21:40,559
of do like global load balancing based

00:21:37,769 --> 00:21:42,059
on DNS but I think that each DNS

00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:44,279
provider is slightly different so I

00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:47,909
could imagine doing something like that

00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:51,749
the future cool and I look you know a

00:21:47,909 --> 00:21:54,749
it's Blaine Forbush who asked that

00:21:51,749 --> 00:21:56,820
question and he has a follow-up so we'll

00:21:54,749 --> 00:22:02,970
see but thanks for showing us a repo I

00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:04,559
guess yeah yeah I give you thumbs up so

00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:06,600
thank you for that all right so I don't

00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:08,159
see any other question thank you for

00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,809
showing us this then I guess you're

00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,559
looking for contributors you already

00:22:09,809 --> 00:22:13,559
have

00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:14,990
well the external DNS has quite a bit of

00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:17,340
contributors already so that's great

00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:18,539
yeah and as I say I can I'll send this

00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:21,389
out if there's more do you want more

00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:22,710
details later if I have questions yeah

00:22:21,389 --> 00:22:25,440
thank you David

00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:27,059
appreciate it excellent so that was the

00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,710
second presentation from Comcast

00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:31,320
actually so this is great thank you for

00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:34,590
that also in general Comcast all right

00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:38,029
so the next one is neo MacDougall from

00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:41,429
Susa who's gonna show us an update on

00:22:38,029 --> 00:22:44,970
Stratis if you don't know about Stratis

00:22:41,429 --> 00:22:48,119
I highly recommend you to watch this and

00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:50,039
then go try it but Neil you want to take

00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:52,919
over you you might have to share your

00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:58,970
screen or something yeah okay yes so

00:22:52,919 --> 00:23:01,320
we're gonna hear awesome can you see my

00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:02,269
yeah we can see it and it's centered

00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,409
thank you for that

00:23:02,269 --> 00:23:07,980
it's looking weird on my screen it's not

00:23:04,409 --> 00:23:09,899
just can you just see the slide yeah I

00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:13,409
just see the size Green's awesome oh

00:23:09,899 --> 00:23:16,379
good okay so let's see the last time we

00:23:13,409 --> 00:23:19,379
we did a Stratis sort of demo at the cab

00:23:16,379 --> 00:23:20,820
meeting was back in 2017 when we were I

00:23:19,379 --> 00:23:24,029
think we were just about to propose for

00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:26,759
incubation yeah we do various updates

00:23:24,029 --> 00:23:29,820
for the summit and as dr. Mac said we're

00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:32,210
I think we're hoping to kind of graduate

00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:34,379
or suggest graduation maybe next month

00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:36,200
but he he's gestured it would be good

00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:37,379
good opportunity to give an update on

00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:41,140
Stratos

00:23:37,379 --> 00:23:42,730
and also demo some of the

00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:44,590
I'll call it naan Cloud Foundry bits

00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:47,590
that we've added in from Souza's point

00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:49,510
of view I just so the community are kind

00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:52,510
of aware of those so I spend a bit of

00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:53,500
time just on a few of the things you

00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:56,260
might have missed that we've added to

00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:58,720
Stratos talk about the Sousa bits we've

00:23:56,260 --> 00:24:01,110
added and then I will switch to a demo

00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:04,390
so you can actually see those in action

00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:05,860
so kind of real quick I was trying to

00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:08,980
think of some of the things we've had it

00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:12,160
more recently in Stratos that you'll see

00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:14,290
as I do the demo so lots of look and

00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,910
feel improvements so particularly around

00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:19,480
the navigation so that's something we've

00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:21,460
been toying with playing with trying to

00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:23,530
trying to improve and get right there's

00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:24,880
still more to do and you'll see it's

00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:27,670
maybe changed since you last looked it

00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:30,960
lots of bug fixes and improvements too

00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:34,270
many to mention they're harder to see

00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:38,290
something we've added you will see is

00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:41,530
the thing called user favorites so if

00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:44,550
you have multiple Cloud Foundry you know

00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:47,170
servers foundations clusters connected

00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:49,090
then it can be hard to kind of dig into

00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:51,280
where you want to get to if you're

00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:53,590
interested in particular app or space so

00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:56,860
we now have the ability to just favorite

00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:59,260
an org or a space or an app or even a

00:24:56,860 --> 00:25:01,510
car foundry to make it easier for you to

00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:02,950
then get to where you want to go kind of

00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:05,470
from a home home screen and you'll see

00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:07,720
what I'm talking about this is something

00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:09,040
that some some of our users had a

00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:13,120
problem with and hopefully this feature

00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:14,710
helps helps with that invite users so

00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:17,140
although we do some sort of role

00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:18,850
management within Stratis we don't have

00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:20,830
sort of full user management in terms of

00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:22,870
being able to you know add users with an

00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:27,160
AOA this was a feature that was

00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:30,220
requested where you can now invite users

00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:32,410
into your Cloud Foundry so you can be

00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:34,870
within an augur a space if you have the

00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:37,120
right permissions you can invite users

00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:39,460
by email they will be sent an invitation

00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:41,860
email if they accept it they can then

00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:44,920
log in to your cloud foundry and start

00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:47,200
start developing I'm quoting management

00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:51,040
again this is something that's not quite

00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:54,710
in but adding the ability to view a

00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:57,090
quota and then manage open space quotas

00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:59,520
metrics this is something we have had

00:25:57,090 --> 00:26:02,070
for a while I want to just show it in

00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:04,020
case you've not seen it and I think the

00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:05,730
point there is this works with not only

00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:08,130
with the kind of metrics how Charlotte

00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:12,150
we are with Suzy use but also with the

00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:13,590
Prometheus boss relations so it does add

00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:15,150
a few things it's the UI which I'll show

00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:16,950
and hopefully if you've not seen those

00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:19,470
and might encourage you to go take a

00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:21,480
look I also want to quickly show the

00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:23,330
autoscaler UI integration this is

00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:26,280
working actually done by the IBM team so

00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:27,870
kind of shout out to them we've been

00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:29,790
working with them for a while they've

00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:31,650
been doing all of the hard work actually

00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:34,590
building the UI we've been kind of

00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:38,010
assisting with helping to integrate that

00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:39,630
and just give them some initial kind of

00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:41,100
help getting started with Stratus and

00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:44,400
I'll talk about that maybe in the

00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:46,170
context of extensibility and then lastly

00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,840
as I've shown here extensibility we're

00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:50,370
doing a lot of work at the moment on

00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:53,280
kind of improving the way you can extend

00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:55,560
Stratus this is this is worth taking

00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:58,040
quite a bit of time there's a lot more

00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:58,040
to do so

00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:01,740
yeah a bit more on that kind of the way

00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:05,610
we've done extensibility at the moment

00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:08,130
is very much as a kind of a company or

00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:10,020
organization wanting to have your own

00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:14,700
custom version of Stratus you would fork

00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:17,550
Stratus repo there's a space in the kind

00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:20,070
of repositories where you can create

00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:22,770
your customizations and then when you

00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:24,120
build it those will be bought in and so

00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:26,010
there's a good separation between your

00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:28,140
customizations and the core code so when

00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:30,390
you come to have to rebase and you know

00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:33,330
update hopefully you know there are

00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:35,370
they're all you know none maybe one or

00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:36,720
two small things you need to merge

00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:38,670
conflicts you might need to resolve but

00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,740
typically there are none and so you can

00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:43,260
just keep building and refreshing that's

00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:45,360
the model we have at the moment where we

00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:47,250
want to get to is make it easier for

00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,480
people to build and publish extension

00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:50,190
and separately so that people can then

00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,680
share those so the the auto-scale is a

00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:54,090
good example of this we're at the moment

00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:56,910
that's being brought into the core and

00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:58,110
Stratus repository but our intent would

00:27:56,910 --> 00:28:00,420
be that that would be in a separate

00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:02,940
Gaborik positive maintained by the IBM

00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:04,650
team people building their own Stratus

00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:07,500
or or kind of taking a Stratus

00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:08,280
distribution can choose which extensions

00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:11,070
they want

00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:14,310
be in that release by just effectively

00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:15,510
declaring those dependencies so this is

00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:16,590
where we want to get to this is what

00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:18,240
we're doing at the moment and this

00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:20,760
consuming quite a lot there F of the

00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:24,180
team so that's a quick update on Stratus

00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:26,670
I'll demo those in a sec I also wanted

00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:29,100
to talk about the work we do a Sousa dr.

00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:31,650
max saw a presentation I gave her Sousa

00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:34,590
conference and suggested might be of

00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:36,600
interest to the broader community so

00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:38,490
obviously I won't talk too much about

00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:40,590
Souza's kind of patient platform

00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:42,720
porosity that's our Cloud Foundry

00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:44,330
distribution and we can tenderize it we

00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:47,040
deploy it on top of Cuba Nessie's

00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:49,110
obviously the users of that have the

00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:51,690
option of using either Cloud Foundry or

00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:55,620
obviously developing workloads on

00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:58,860
directly on top of kubernetes obviously

00:28:55,620 --> 00:29:00,690
the application platform being based on

00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:02,460
committees can run on various kubernetes

00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:04,230
distribution so the ones you see here

00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:08,970
from that the standard vendors as well

00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:10,950
as in this case Souza's own and so sort

00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:12,660
of guys that Susan said why what can we

00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:14,280
sort of extend Stratos to offer an

00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:16,140
experience for both of those

00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:18,360
environments so that's kind of what

00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:19,680
we've been doing we've been taking

00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:21,450
Stratis

00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:23,550
with the extensibility framework and

00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:25,980
adding in our own extensions to allow

00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:30,720
you to connect in kubernetes and I'll

00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:33,720
show also how so the extensions we've

00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:35,580
got we've got some I guess to two core

00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:37,980
ones that are different if you like from

00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:40,830
the kind of upstream Cloud Foundry one

00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:43,080
around kubernetes where you can connect

00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:45,690
in to a committee AI servo we've got the

00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:47,010
authentication for the different

00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:50,550
environment you see there so as your

00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:54,780
addresses you key and our initial focus

00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:56,220
was on views that would help you

00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:59,880
understand how Clara foundry is running

00:29:56,220 --> 00:30:00,990
on top of the kubernetes platform but

00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,850
that's something we can choose to build

00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:05,250
out and we also are adding the ability

00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:06,690
to kind of link into and embed the

00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:08,220
kubinashi dashboard if that's deployed

00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:10,700
because clearly that's a UI that does

00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:12,690
quite a lot of nice stuff

00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:14,190
Prometheus's optometric so this is

00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:16,260
something that's obviously in the

00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:19,020
upstream version I just wanted to call

00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:20,760
out here the main thing really here is

00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:22,140
we have a separate pound chart if you're

00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:26,010
on the committee's work for deploying

00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:28,140
metrics the other one we've added more

00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:31,620
recently as a kind of tech preview in

00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:33,600
the suzer world is the ability to at

00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:35,190
home repositories so we're we're

00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,750
leveraging an open source project called

00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:40,770
binocular integrating that into Stratis

00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:42,480
this allows you to add how repositories

00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:46,290
you can view charts you can review

00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,730
releases you can install a release from

00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:51,720
a home chart and you can delete and all

00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:54,090
that kind of management okay

00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:55,980
so I'll try and get onto demo quickly

00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:58,920
point I want to make you know this is

00:30:55,980 --> 00:31:02,220
all open source so Stratus is the Cloud

00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:04,470
Foundry incubator get AB repo the Sousa

00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:06,450
version is as you can see there forked

00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:09,660
off of that repo both completely

00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:11,190
open-source they're both with apache

00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:13,260
license so you can take any of this

00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:15,150
stuff and use it yourself we're using

00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:17,940
the same extensibility mechanism in the

00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:22,560
suzer kind of variant as we use for

00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:25,730
autoscaler and for other extensions and

00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:25,730
so they look a little bit different okay

00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:34,070
I will pause and if I can't remember how

00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:38,100
there we go I will switch and show my

00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:42,000
browser so neo one thing as you do this

00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:44,970
yeah I mean as you graduate straddles

00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:48,330
from town drink a bit of you go to some

00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:50,190
place that is bigger like let's say CN

00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:53,100
CF or something that is sort of more

00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:55,170
encompassing so that since it it's

00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:56,990
dealing with multiple different projects

00:31:55,170 --> 00:32:00,930
now you have an idea

00:31:56,990 --> 00:32:02,430
can you internet I don't know I think

00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:04,470
our plan was to stay within the Cloud

00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:06,060
Foundry is this a question to stay

00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:09,300
wasn't a Clara friendly organization

00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:12,600
right in graduate from incubation within

00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:14,910
that the suzer extensions that we

00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:16,380
develop as we improve the extension

00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:19,110
mechanism we would like those to be

00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:20,310
published in a separate github repos to

00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:22,380
make it easier for other people to

00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:24,030
leverage those at the moment we're kind

00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:26,640
of keeping this separate from the core

00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:29,640
Stratos because you know a lot of the

00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:32,370
users are just you know you know vanilla

00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:34,200
cloud foundry users if you like and so

00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:35,760
not everybody obviously wants kubernetes

00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,770
functionality

00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,780
from the outset so we want to make it

00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:42,540
easy for those users that do want it to

00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:45,750
to kind of include it if they need it I

00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:47,340
think we will maybe start to look at you

00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:50,580
know showcasing some of this stuff at

00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:53,130
other almost like some acute combat but

00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:55,650
if we have any any motivation at the

00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:59,040
moment to kind of move Stratis to a

00:32:55,650 --> 00:33:01,380
different foundation if that was the

00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:03,570
question right right not cool we're

00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:05,510
happy to have you so sorry to distract

00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:09,050
you thank you for now it's fine

00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:12,040
so yeah who knows but for not right now

00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:14,750
can you see this now

00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:16,400
yes we can see it awesome so this is the

00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:18,380
suit of Aaron so everything that's

00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:20,630
upstream is in this version plus the

00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:22,910
extra stuff I just show this also as a

00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:24,290
way of illustrating you can you can take

00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:26,840
Stratus and obviously theme it

00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:28,310
differently and change the names of

00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:34,760
stuff and add a copyright or that kind

00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:37,550
of stuff if you wish so I'll just talk

00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:40,190
about some of the changes or updates

00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:43,670
that I mention on that first like before

00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:45,110
I get into the kubernetes stuff so when

00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:48,740
you come in now instead of going into

00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:51,230
applications you get this favorites sort

00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:52,280
of homepage screen this the small what

00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:53,570
we want to do just to make it look a bit

00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:56,480
nicer than it does at the moment a

00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:58,550
couple of things really to point out

00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,260
here when originally you'd go into

00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:01,790
applications which shows you all if your

00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:04,280
applications across your cloud foundries

00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:06,380
so you know if you had a large number of

00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:08,510
those you know it could take a little

00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:10,550
while to load so you know when you come

00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:12,830
in now to home it's nice and quick

00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:14,810
if applications is not your destination

00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:16,129
then it makes it much easier to kind of

00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:18,649
not have to wait for that to load and

00:34:16,129 --> 00:34:20,750
jump somewhere else what you do see here

00:34:18,649 --> 00:34:22,820
are the the entities that you've

00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:25,250
favorited and those can be I can say

00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:27,260
they can be a Cloud Foundry you can see

00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:28,879
actually a favorite of kubernetes they

00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:32,419
can be an application or an organ I can

00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:34,790
just click straight through and get to

00:34:32,419 --> 00:34:36,500
the view for that particular entity so

00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:38,690
if I'm a developer working on a small

00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:40,790
number of applications or you know

00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:42,560
working in a particular space it makes

00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:44,120
it easy for me to jump straight into

00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:45,889
that part of the UI without having to

00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:50,240
kind of navigate through the verse

00:34:45,889 --> 00:34:52,389
hierarchy so that's the that sees your

00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:56,030
favorites as I do kind of jump around

00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:58,790
you'll see that the activity tracks

00:34:56,030 --> 00:35:03,530
where I went so I can easily get back to

00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:05,270
there you can see also let's see when I

00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:07,460
went in there we've changed this nav

00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:10,340
slightly you can collapse this one down

00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:12,500
which I'll do and we've got this side

00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:14,120
now this if you remember or paying

00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:17,000
attention there this used to be across

00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:19,760
the top as tabs and that kind of caused

00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,440
some confusion now these are down the

00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:24,500
side which i think is better and it

00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,490
allows us to kind of have global actions

00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,930
just at the top here

00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:30,110
in actions specific to your kind of

00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:32,480
context in this area here which has

00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:34,010
cleared up some some kind of usability

00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:38,960
issues that we've had reported back from

00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:40,540
our users okay so that's just a hint of

00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:44,510
RAM some of the restructuring we've done

00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:47,150
these are favorites I guess if I go into

00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:48,890
cloud foundry one of the things we've

00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:51,170
added here is the invitations what I

00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:56,390
mentioned so this needs configuring you

00:35:51,170 --> 00:36:00,170
need to configure a UA a client that has

00:35:56,390 --> 00:36:01,520
a CM invite access so you have to be a

00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:03,770
cloud foundry administrator to do this

00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:07,970
and that once you've done that it means

00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:10,070
you can drill in to an organization you

00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:13,850
can look at the users and then I can

00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:18,200
invite a user so I can maybe win to it

00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:25,700
right now but I can go well total user

00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:28,550
nate entry users email address hit

00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:33,170
invite so this will actually create a

00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:35,990
user in the system for this person it

00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:38,690
will add them as a user of the New York

00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:40,880
that I'm in and as soon as they then

00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:42,410
will see that email and click on it to

00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,760
kind of set up their account they can

00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:46,190
automatically log straight into cloud

00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:48,950
foundry and and start using it so this

00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:51,920
was a feature the cloud gov guys kind of

00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:54,050
requested and relied on so you can do

00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,030
this at both the org and also the space

00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:58,660
level so if you do at the space level

00:36:56,030 --> 00:37:00,890
you can specify which roles those users

00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:03,830
should get within the space by default

00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:05,510
and you can also do multiple users so I

00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:06,790
just did one there but you can you can

00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:10,369
put in many

00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:13,970
so that's user invites I guess the next

00:37:10,369 --> 00:37:16,580
thing we've added is quotas so if I look

00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:18,980
at the top level Cloud Foundry view you

00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:21,109
can see I can see all quotas now so this

00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:23,869
is showing me all of the all quotas I

00:37:21,109 --> 00:37:26,510
have within this Cloud Foundry if I go

00:37:23,869 --> 00:37:29,000
back actually select the IBM Cloud

00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:33,920
Foundry you'll see it's got quite a few

00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:37,850
more I can look at one of those and I

00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:40,850
can see the quote limits for the verse

00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:42,620
memory application I can actually edit

00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:45,260
there's a bit of tied up to do here with

00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:49,030
the the ones that are unlimited but you

00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:55,970
can go and either edit that quota I can

00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:58,940
go back and from an organization I can

00:37:55,970 --> 00:38:01,820
get onto quota I could see a doubt

00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:03,500
permissions so because I don't for

00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:05,750
mission is to create a all quota within

00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:07,250
the IBM foundry which is well I'm not

00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:09,530
seeing the button but if I went down to

00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:12,170
space quotas it doesn't look like I've

00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:15,020
got permission area so that's good that

00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:16,550
we we track these permissions model but

00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:18,140
if I was in one where I do have

00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:19,430
permissions then you'll see there's the

00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:21,620
create button and I can go through and

00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:24,800
krei yeah and you quit from scratch and

00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:26,800
assign those two orgs or drill down and

00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:29,870
go into spaces and sign those two spaces

00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:31,430
so that's the quotas stuff we've added

00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:32,990
recently that's a thing that we for an

00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:36,590
area that Claire foundry okay we've not

00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:38,920
had a coverage for up till now just

00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:42,860
quickly on metrics

00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:44,150
I've pre registered and connected

00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:46,430
everything up here in the interest of

00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:49,490
time if you're familiar then the way the

00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:51,440
EU had endpoints in the UI is from this

00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:54,140
endpoint screen this has been made a bit

00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:56,420
more visuals and then previously just

00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:57,680
kind of help users so in the upstream

00:38:56,420 --> 00:39:00,860
version you would only see Cloud Foundry

00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:02,540
metrics because as version has some

00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:05,420
extra extensions then you get different

00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:08,330
endpoint types as well so you can add a

00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:09,670
metric standpoint you give it the name

00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:11,900
the address of your Prometheus server

00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:15,920
connect with your credentials if they're

00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:18,620
needed and then you Stratos will work

00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:20,840
out which Cloud Foundry and off also

00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:22,580
kubernetes if that's relevant that

00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:24,080
prometheus service has metrics for and

00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:26,150
then you'll get additional views within

00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:27,470
the UI so if you just click on the

00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:30,740
metric standpoint you can at least see

00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:32,840
which polices exporters are configured

00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:35,810
and where they're getting a day trying

00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:40,970
to fit some cutting it got any errors if

00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:46,160
I go back to my cloud foundry and if I

00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:46,789
pick like an application here you can

00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:50,419
see I get next

00:39:46,789 --> 00:39:53,269
metrics tab and I can see some basic CPU

00:39:50,419 --> 00:39:54,739
memory disk metrics for the applications

00:39:53,269 --> 00:39:56,449
only got one instance I only get one

00:39:54,739 --> 00:39:58,489
graph but office if there are multiple

00:39:56,449 --> 00:40:01,669
instances you get grass for those and

00:39:58,489 --> 00:40:03,169
you can change the the time window or a

00:40:01,669 --> 00:40:07,669
custom one if you want all that kind of

00:40:03,169 --> 00:40:10,880
nice stuff we also on the instances view

00:40:07,669 --> 00:40:12,979
if you've got metrics configured we are

00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:14,869
able to determine what sound that

00:40:12,979 --> 00:40:16,999
metrics are sort of that application

00:40:14,869 --> 00:40:19,549
instance is running on and so you can

00:40:16,999 --> 00:40:20,539
then drill down and you can get that

00:40:19,549 --> 00:40:22,130
information I think only the

00:40:20,539 --> 00:40:24,709
administrator can see these views not

00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:26,239
not regular users but these are useful

00:40:24,709 --> 00:40:30,919
if there's an issue with a particular

00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:32,329
diego cell you can see what's going on

00:40:30,919 --> 00:40:35,900
and you can also make it more easily

00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:37,400
kind of see which which other app

00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:39,049
instances are running on the same cell

00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:42,049
so if you had a problem with your system

00:40:39,049 --> 00:40:43,249
with one of the applications is crashing

00:40:42,049 --> 00:40:44,929
or something you might be that another

00:40:43,249 --> 00:40:46,579
application is actually causing the

00:40:44,929 --> 00:40:49,099
issue so there's some some additional

00:40:46,579 --> 00:40:53,179
stuff here to help you from a metrics

00:40:49,099 --> 00:40:57,650
point of view I almost forgot to show

00:40:53,179 --> 00:41:00,219
autoscaler so if I go to the IBM Cloud

00:40:57,650 --> 00:41:02,569
Foundry and look at a dead simple app

00:41:00,219 --> 00:41:04,999
then you'll see because auto scale is

00:41:02,569 --> 00:41:10,279
enabled on this CAD foundry I get auto

00:41:04,999 --> 00:41:11,809
scale tab so I side side item and this

00:41:10,279 --> 00:41:13,159
ones I just set up with a policy I'm not

00:41:11,809 --> 00:41:14,749
going to go into too much detail this

00:41:13,159 --> 00:41:16,759
it's not gonna take too much credit for

00:41:14,749 --> 00:41:18,709
great with you guys have done they're

00:41:16,759 --> 00:41:20,900
working to refine this a bit further but

00:41:18,709 --> 00:41:22,729
you can see you can enable it you can

00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:25,189
enable all scalar for particular app

00:41:22,729 --> 00:41:27,289
from here you can set the limits in

00:41:25,189 --> 00:41:30,799
terms of how many instances it can scale

00:41:27,289 --> 00:41:32,689
between so this can sculpt 2115 you can

00:41:30,799 --> 00:41:34,339
set up the scaling rules this is showing

00:41:32,689 --> 00:41:36,439
the last metrics the auto scale has

00:41:34,339 --> 00:41:38,809
collected that it's then using to drive

00:41:36,439 --> 00:41:40,759
weather scale things up and down and you

00:41:38,809 --> 00:41:43,459
can see earlier on I was testing this so

00:41:40,759 --> 00:41:45,829
I scaled the app instance to two and

00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:47,989
then after a while it spotted that I was

00:41:45,829 --> 00:41:49,759
using a less than 15 megabytes which is

00:41:47,989 --> 00:41:52,039
my rule here and so it scaled it back

00:41:49,759 --> 00:41:55,130
down to one so this just shows me the

00:41:52,039 --> 00:41:58,159
kind of the event trail of what it did

00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:59,959
as it was auto scaling this app so this

00:41:58,159 --> 00:42:01,720
is a nice feature that will be in the

00:41:59,959 --> 00:42:04,670
next release

00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:06,200
so that's everything on the sort of

00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:07,940
strata side that we've we've been added

00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:12,619
here in the last couple of months or so

00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:14,060
on the kubernetes side so this is this

00:42:12,619 --> 00:42:15,200
is stuff that we've added as the Sousa

00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:16,280
point of view it's in the suitor repo

00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,780
but you'll you know it's awfully open

00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:20,210
source you're welcome to take it put it

00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:21,980
in your own version if you wish as I

00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:23,480
said you go into endpoints you can add a

00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:25,160
Cuban a ten-point just as you would add

00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:27,380
a Cloud Foundry endpoint you give it a

00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:28,420
name and address and then on the next

00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:30,079
screen you can optionally connect

00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:31,280
straight through it so that's one

00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:32,869
improvement we've made Stratos

00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,609
previously you registered and connected

00:42:32,869 --> 00:42:36,980
there's two steps would make it easier

00:42:34,609 --> 00:42:40,369
to do that in one go now and depending

00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:43,160
on which kubernetes environment you're

00:42:40,369 --> 00:42:45,500
you're registering the authentication is

00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:46,960
different so there's different forms to

00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:49,609
supply the right amount of information

00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:51,349
this is just a dev system so I'm using

00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:55,579
mini cube for simplicity and I've gone

00:42:51,349 --> 00:42:57,710
ahead and connected that I can drill

00:42:55,579 --> 00:42:59,420
down into the kubernetes we'll talk to

00:42:57,710 --> 00:43:02,510
the Cuban and his API in the same way we

00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:04,460
would talk to the cloud foundry API so

00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:05,990
these views you know this more

00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:08,300
refinement to be done but you can see we

00:43:05,990 --> 00:43:09,980
get some high level kind of gross in

00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:11,960
terms of usage and whether there's any

00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:14,900
pressure application count that kind of

00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:17,180
stuff there's some views where you can

00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:21,200
look at the nodes you can drill into a

00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:23,060
node again because we've got some the

00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:27,079
metric server connected up we can get

00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:29,900
some basic metrics from the communities

00:43:27,079 --> 00:43:31,760
as well we can see some pod information

00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:34,760
in terms of the pods running on this

00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:36,170
particular node so some of this you can

00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:38,750
get obviously from the cube dashboard

00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:40,460
our focus was some initial work here to

00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:41,869
make it easy if people in the context of

00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:43,730
Stratos to see what's going on with

00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:46,220
their Cloud Foundry deployment so here

00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:48,079
I've got Sousa Cloud Foundry as part of

00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:52,280
the cloud application platform running

00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:54,579
on Cuba Nettie's and also jump through

00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:56,359
to the dashboard if I wish so if I know

00:43:54,579 --> 00:43:58,880
this things I want to in the cube

00:43:56,359 --> 00:44:00,859
dashboard then if it's installed we

00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:02,660
figure that out and we can proxy it

00:44:00,859 --> 00:44:06,079
through using the cube proxy or

00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:09,020
tunneling API and I can use it within

00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:10,280
Stratos here we can also I don't think

00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:12,200
I've got it here but you can jump

00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:14,090
through to you know from a namespace

00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:15,860
view directly into the namespace

00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:16,940
view inside of the cube dashboard this

00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:19,220
is something we're thinking a bit more

00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:20,600
about in terms of how best to kind of

00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:25,250
integrate the Cuban eighties dashboard

00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:29,150
and then also if I wish I can open a

00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:31,520
console so hopefully this will work so

00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:33,620
we'll spin up a pod in the background in

00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:35,510
kubernetes and then we'll configure it

00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:40,160
and then we'll exit through using the

00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:42,730
Cuban eighties API because I've already

00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:46,070
registered the ham repository we'll also

00:44:42,730 --> 00:44:48,110
set up for as hair as well so what this

00:44:46,070 --> 00:44:49,790
is done is it's set me up with an

00:44:48,110 --> 00:44:54,020
environment or I can basically run in

00:44:49,790 --> 00:44:55,910
Cuba CTL commands and also ham commands

00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:58,010
and so this is all configured with the

00:44:55,910 --> 00:45:00,170
Cuba config already generated before me

00:44:58,010 --> 00:45:02,150
based on my mini cube environment if I

00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:04,220
had other cloud providers connected I

00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:05,210
can do the same right and not have to do

00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:07,130
all that different setup for the

00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:08,900
different environments so this shorty

00:45:07,130 --> 00:45:10,430
shows I've got you know the cloud

00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:14,840
application platform the metrics

00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:18,170
deployed UA a and it's also configured

00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:19,370
the ham repositories that I've added so

00:45:18,170 --> 00:45:22,550
that's that's quite useful from develop

00:45:19,370 --> 00:45:24,890
point of view they seem to know just

00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:27,230
skip applications then the other last

00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:31,700
bit I want to show quickly is that helm

00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:33,230
so obviously helm is described as the

00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:34,700
package manager for kubernetes so you

00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:36,770
can have hound charts which make it easy

00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:39,050
for you to install applications or

00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:41,030
services within cubed eTI's we use

00:45:39,050 --> 00:45:42,740
project called binocular as I mentioned

00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:45,200
which has a UI and we've done some

00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:47,780
extensions to that so just as you can

00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:52,670
add a kubernetes endpoint you can add a

00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:53,990
helm repository so I added the stable

00:45:52,670 --> 00:45:56,030
helm charts already that's quite a large

00:45:53,990 --> 00:46:00,340
ones it takes a while to synchronize but

00:45:56,030 --> 00:46:06,320
I could add the Stratos home repository

00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:07,310
finish hopefully it'll work cool so you

00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:08,690
can see I've got a second home

00:46:07,310 --> 00:46:10,550
repository now and it's busy

00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:12,380
synchronizing the charts from that

00:46:10,550 --> 00:46:15,980
repository into a local store by can

00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:18,110
then browse I can jump through to see

00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:22,610
what my stay at my two repositories are

00:46:18,110 --> 00:46:24,080
I can look at charts and I can then view

00:46:22,610 --> 00:46:26,210
the the charts this is a bit like the

00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:27,530
services view that we have if you seen

00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:29,930
the marketplace but

00:46:27,530 --> 00:46:31,670
instead of it being for Clara foundry

00:46:29,930 --> 00:46:39,850
services it's for kind of kublai teased

00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:45,920
or helm chance go back so I can pick a

00:46:39,850 --> 00:46:48,260
computer a chart like airflow we get the

00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:49,760
view of of the chart in terms of the

00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:51,650
readme the icon and we can then send a

00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:53,210
bit more about that chart the various

00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:56,570
versions I can pick a different version

00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:58,610
I can understand how I wouldn't deploy

00:46:56,570 --> 00:47:03,200
it from the you are the CLI or I can

00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:09,500
also deploy it from directly from the UI

00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:11,720
here to work there's more work to do

00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:21,110
with allowing you to specify the value

00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:22,340
overrides for this hand chart okay it's

00:47:21,110 --> 00:47:23,660
hopefully that well though it's a little

00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:25,550
bit slow here with the helm API at the

00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:27,830
moment in helm version 3 this will

00:47:25,550 --> 00:47:29,870
improve drastically when they remove the

00:47:27,830 --> 00:47:33,620
backing component so you can see now the

00:47:29,870 --> 00:47:36,830
we've deployed that helm chart so

00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:38,360
there's now a new release containers etc

00:47:36,830 --> 00:47:42,710
inside of Cuba Nettie's which we can

00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:44,630
then retrieve cool so we're in a state

00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:47,000
of our chart or release being created

00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:49,730
sort of six pods crating I'll go back

00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:53,260
and just quickly show you I can look at

00:47:49,730 --> 00:47:55,700
the fabrication platform Cloud Foundry I

00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:59,060
get a summary of this release in terms

00:47:55,700 --> 00:48:02,270
of pots and containers to see what

00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:03,920
version I've got deployed when a ham

00:48:02,270 --> 00:48:05,690
chart deploys at the end typically you

00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:08,210
get some notes so we can retrieve those

00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:10,550
for you we can show you what helm values

00:48:08,210 --> 00:48:12,080
you deployed this chart with and then we

00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:17,410
can also show you which pods and

00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:17,410
services are part of this this release

00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:24,110
it's pretty much it so at the moment and

00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:26,000
also you can actually look at what

00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:27,860
version of how you've got deployed in

00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,230
each of your kubernetes environments so

00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:33,290
any much like Cloud Foundry you can

00:48:30,230 --> 00:48:35,480
there's kind of ethos with Stratis is

00:48:33,290 --> 00:48:37,010
that you should be the connect as many a

00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:38,510
multiple of each of the different type

00:48:37,010 --> 00:48:40,790
of endpoint so I've only got one

00:48:38,510 --> 00:48:43,550
kubernetes connected here but I could

00:48:40,790 --> 00:48:46,130
have connected you know an e KS and a G

00:48:43,550 --> 00:48:47,810
ke and here we would I go great across

00:48:46,130 --> 00:48:54,410
those different clusters and show it all

00:48:47,810 --> 00:48:56,440
in one view same with releases okay so I

00:48:54,410 --> 00:48:58,840
tried to wade through that quite quickly

00:48:56,440 --> 00:49:00,920
it's a probably a few minutes left I

00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:04,280
think I covered everything I wanted to

00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:05,780
cover a lot of the helm kubernetes work

00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:07,850
some some of it's actually already in

00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:09,620
Susak an application platform we

00:49:07,850 --> 00:49:11,300
consider it production ready some of the

00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:12,830
new your stuff in here it's kind of in a

00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:15,170
tech preview state and that's that's

00:49:12,830 --> 00:49:20,000
functionality where I'm we're kind of

00:49:15,170 --> 00:49:22,100
finishing off at the moment if I pause

00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:28,760
there and for any questions happy to

00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:33,590
take them you should see the tap so I've

00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:41,060
got a question you such a state of

00:49:33,590 --> 00:49:42,650
Awesomeness very kind of you um I'd have

00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:46,310
a great team I have a great team behind

00:49:42,650 --> 00:49:50,450
me that's the key thing I'm talented

00:49:46,310 --> 00:49:54,800
I look at this and I think this is one

00:49:50,450 --> 00:49:57,650
UI to rule them all and and again we

00:49:54,800 --> 00:50:01,030
insert the same thing too so this is

00:49:57,650 --> 00:50:03,170
this is this is awesome Thank You Neil

00:50:01,030 --> 00:50:04,700
yeah I mean we're trying to be careful

00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:06,080
right because there are there are you

00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:08,810
guys like to keep Nettie's dashboard I'm

00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:10,250
on oculus so our approach is to try and

00:50:08,810 --> 00:50:12,980
integrate those in the best way and

00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:15,350
leverage their functionality fill gaps

00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:17,540
and make it easy for people to to kind

00:50:15,350 --> 00:50:19,670
of see stuff in the right context right

00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:21,050
so the metrics here you know you want to

00:50:19,670 --> 00:50:22,130
we don't want people to have to jump in

00:50:21,050 --> 00:50:24,320
and out differently always want to make

00:50:22,130 --> 00:50:26,390
it easy to context rise so definition

00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:29,180
they're saying that the beautiful thing

00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:33,320
and the part that I love is the fact

00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:34,490
that you guys are embracing the other

00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:37,270
you eyes

00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:40,069
all the other you guys are very context

00:50:37,270 --> 00:50:41,809
box founded right like therefore

00:50:40,069 --> 00:50:45,109
specific context like a single cluster

00:50:41,809 --> 00:50:46,940
or a single entity at them and you guys

00:50:45,109 --> 00:50:48,829
are basically embracing that wrapping

00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:54,260
that that's what I absolutely love about

00:50:48,829 --> 00:50:57,250
this thank you yeah let's see if there

00:50:54,260 --> 00:51:01,099
are more questions from people yeah

00:50:57,250 --> 00:51:02,510
right so Sora is suggesting present this

00:51:01,099 --> 00:51:04,460
to communities but I think I think you

00:51:02,510 --> 00:51:06,859
have a talk right coming up at the Hugh

00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:09,800
plan I've got a tool coming I put the

00:51:06,859 --> 00:51:11,359
summit I'll probably show this in maybe

00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:12,680
more detail I haven't got one at the

00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:15,849
cube con yet that's something we're

00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:18,619
looking looking to do for sure okay

00:51:15,849 --> 00:51:22,040
couple more things I remember when I

00:51:18,619 --> 00:51:27,109
first used this I set up a host Prados

00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:30,890
thing and used it on a cab to to to the

00:51:27,109 --> 00:51:32,390
summit in Boston using my phone and I

00:51:30,890 --> 00:51:35,059
was blown away at the fact that

00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:39,319
everything was quite usable is it still

00:51:35,059 --> 00:51:41,119
usable on on a phone it is I think that

00:51:39,319 --> 00:51:43,730
there are there is more to do we did a

00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:46,010
recent round of I guess regression

00:51:43,730 --> 00:51:48,680
fixing where some things had had not got

00:51:46,010 --> 00:51:50,420
so easy to use on a phone and I think

00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:53,390
there is more we can we can do there but

00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:55,160
I missed it stood it should still be

00:51:53,390 --> 00:51:57,740
useful on their mobile device yeah and

00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:59,809
if it's not then then you know file for

00:51:57,740 --> 00:52:01,760
defects on issues and well certainly

00:51:59,809 --> 00:52:05,180
look at those okay so basically this

00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:08,710
it's part of your your your your goals

00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:11,180
to make it you know UI responsive to

00:52:08,710 --> 00:52:13,220
yeah I mean it's not the highest

00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:15,230
priority in our list because it's quite

00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:18,920
a rich UI so some of the you know some

00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:20,390
of the things you do it's it is harder

00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:23,359
to make them scale down to a mobile

00:52:20,390 --> 00:52:25,849
device but it is a certainly a a goal we

00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:27,140
would like to have that ultimately we

00:52:25,849 --> 00:52:30,470
make the best of the device that you

00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:32,270
have cool any other question actually is

00:52:30,470 --> 00:52:34,099
something we've been chatting with some

00:52:32,270 --> 00:52:38,119
some colleagues at IBM is are you

00:52:34,099 --> 00:52:40,700
planning to add something like you know

00:52:38,119 --> 00:52:43,160
order I guess with the endpoint

00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:44,900
mechanism that job now in theory you

00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:46,910
should be able to add order components

00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:47,990
right so something like for instance K

00:52:46,910 --> 00:52:51,830
native that sort of

00:52:47,990 --> 00:52:53,599
you know burgeoning this is that on your

00:52:51,830 --> 00:52:55,700
radar is it something that maybe you

00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:58,010
would be willing to have other people

00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:59,810
help you well oh yeah

00:52:58,010 --> 00:53:01,849
so I'm not sure Kennedy was directly on

00:52:59,810 --> 00:53:03,260
my radar right now because we you know a

00:53:01,849 --> 00:53:05,750
small team and we're trying to juggle

00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:07,040
all of this stuff I have but certainly

00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:08,510
if other people are interested in

00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:10,670
pitching in we would definitely be

00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:12,500
welcoming of that you know like I said

00:53:10,670 --> 00:53:14,300
this does use the extensions mechanism

00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:17,630
so you know you can add new endpoint

00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:19,609
types through the extensions api's and

00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:21,950
new authentication you know mechanisms

00:53:19,609 --> 00:53:24,650
and types through that API so we've

00:53:21,950 --> 00:53:26,390
we've been using our own API used to

00:53:24,650 --> 00:53:27,710
build these extensions and so that

00:53:26,390 --> 00:53:28,970
should enable other people to do the

00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:31,310
same if they wish we're sitting willing

00:53:28,970 --> 00:53:32,990
to kind of help those help other people

00:53:31,310 --> 00:53:35,420
or you know work together on things like

00:53:32,990 --> 00:53:39,410
tentative for sure and when the

00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:41,089
extension I guess we engineering is is

00:53:39,410 --> 00:53:43,820
done it will make it a little bit easier

00:53:41,089 --> 00:53:45,080
because we yeah it will make it

00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:46,130
it will make it easier for people and

00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:53,599
it'll certainly make it easier for
