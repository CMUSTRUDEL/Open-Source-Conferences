Makes swapping hot and fun again!

Touching some of the internals of the director so are being careful and adding tests to backfill if anything is missing.

CAn read more about this on BOSH notes.

In addition to helping to spin up some of the deployments will help to unblock some of the future changes to the director where will improve diffing such that diffing will show what will change persistent disk / vms / etc…

Eventually will unblock granular deploy, which will allow to be much more exact in not having to update any other instance having to specify on command line.

Ask in slack channel if curious.

WOrking on making BOSH DNS production tested with pipelines based on PWS rollout. Has been quiet and good and boring.

[Music]

00:00:03,259 --> 00:00:18,930
okay yeah I'm pulling it up here soon

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:21,900
what we usually do every the first thing

00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:26,910
is a pee new year I think it's the first

00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:28,949
time since last year we have I guess 20

00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:31,619
people now plus the people here in this

00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:35,460
room and we have two two presentations

00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:37,829
I'll be doing a presentation on kind of

00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:41,070
the survey results so kind of what if

00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:43,170
what what happened what did you say

00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,840
we've got a few respondent so it should

00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:47,550
be interesting and then we have our

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:52,230
colleagues when I say P in equal I and

00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:54,600
Georgie who are going to present on you

00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:56,520
know how to run multiple applications I

00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,260
guess complex applications so they've

00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,140
been working on this for a while so it

00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:03,359
should be good they have a demo so with

00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:07,560
that we typically start these

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:11,869
presentations these I guess cat calls

00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:15,770
with updates from the different PMC's

00:01:11,869 --> 00:01:18,060
great thing is we have Yui Eric a

00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:21,000
pivotal so they're gonna give us an

00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,590
update at some point and then we'll go

00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,390
through the rest of the PMC's but first

00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:27,479
thing we're going to do as we usually do

00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:29,400
is to get cal foundry update and I don't

00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:33,329
know how many of you knows Warner she

00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:36,119
joined the tri-county foundation towards

00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:38,759
the end of last year I've been

00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:40,650
communicating with her a lot I think you

00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:43,530
know it's a great addition to the

00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:46,200
foundation so you're gonna hear more

00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:47,610
from her so including today so suona

00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,860
do you want to give us an update on

00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:51,329

presence as well so we can have the

00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:26,039
communities prisons a lot more invisible

00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:28,380
in the largest founder but also outside

00:04:26,039 --> 00:04:30,810
of the other communities

00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:32,880
and also one last note if there are any

00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:35,190
cool projects that you're working on a

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:38,639
part of the Tech Talk or the keynote

00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:40,860
request we got a whole lot of cool ideas

00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,169
or cool new projects that you all are

00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:44,400
working on so if there is something like

00:04:43,169 --> 00:04:46,110
that that you're already working on

00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,979
please do let us know I know it's

00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:51,150
sometimes it kind of gets becomes part

00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:52,949
of your muscle memory that you're

00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:54,660
already working on it but it would be

00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:57,810
great for the rest of the community now

00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:59,820
and also great for other open source

00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:01,199
communities to know about the projects

00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,310
that we're working here within Cloud

00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,780
Foundry there's a lot of cross

00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:07,139
collaboration that is happening right

00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:09,180
now within across co-founded kubernetes

00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:11,039
community I got clogged foundry and

00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:12,000
OpenStack communities so I would like to

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,919
see more of the kind of

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,080
cross-pollination cross collaboration

00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:19,169
happening so if we have any of those

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,430
kind of new and upcoming up projects I

00:05:19,169 --> 00:05:22,349
would love for the rest of the

00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:24,270
open-source communities as well to be

00:05:22,349 --> 00:05:26,009
aware of what we're doing so if you have

00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:28,979
any of those that you're already working

00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:30,930
on I would love to connect you with our

00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:32,880
marketing team so we can either write a

00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,419
blog post to a video or any of those

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,220
things

00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:37,380
so please do reach out to me even if

00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:42,389
you're not sure if your project or idea

00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:44,250
is kind of worth mentioning it again in

00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:46,500
a blog post or video just drop me a note

00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:49,949
we will figure that we'll figure out a

00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:51,510
way to promote it again it's always a

00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:54,210
good kind of reminder for the rest of

00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:55,800
the community so it just that's the kind

00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:57,900
of updates and requests from the

00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:05,550
foundation foot anyone have questions

00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:06,870
for me or comment feedback you have the

00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:10,110
numbers in terms of the number of

00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:12,360
submissions and any stats on I guess

00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:14,400
Boston since it's coming up that you can

00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:16,020
share I don't have it at the top of my

00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,979
head but if I remember I think it was

00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:21,090
close to 400 but I will check and

00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:24,300
confirm the number of submissions that

00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:26,849
we received for Boston I think it was

00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:29,000
definitely either around the same range

00:06:26,849 --> 00:06:31,919
of submissions that we receive for

00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,440
either babble or Silicon Valley last

00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:36,889
year or it's slightly above that number

00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:40,540
so I come from I don't have the number

00:06:36,889 --> 00:06:41,950
exact number at the top of my head and I

00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:45,040
the other thing I want to mention is

00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:47,530
that there are different CF days going

00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:49,270
on in the first quarter before the bus

00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:51,190
and meeting so if you can't make the

00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:53,650
summit obviously the summit would be

00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:55,180
best but if you can't make it look for

00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:57,700
those local ones so for instance I know

00:06:55,180 --> 00:07:00,100
there is one si P is doing in Sofia and

00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:05,740
then we also doing one here in San

00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:09,060
Francisco and Moscone in Everett thank

00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:16,180
you very much for reminding that yes

00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:17,670
again stepmom say that again I guess

00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:22,750
people need to be unmuted

00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:25,620
sorry guys hey any other questions post

00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:33,390
one our foundation related questions

00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:36,280
comments No all right cool

00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:40,690
thank you yeah

00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:45,490
I guess we'll go now to run time usually

00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:50,440
do that U is here with Eric so what's

00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:53,230
going on cool stuff yeah sure I think so

00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:55,510
Diego and routing have been putting the

00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:57,930
finishing touches on some of its work

00:07:55,510 --> 00:08:01,390
that we're calling route integrity or we

00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:05,650
were using these envoy proxies in that

00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:07,840
containers to present the for instance

00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:09,430
credentials so that they go router can

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,440
verify that it's connecting to the

00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:13,240
intended instance when it does make a

00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,920
connection I think we might have just

00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,510
hit a snag around WebSockets so if

00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:19,230
you're using those maybe don't try it

00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:22,240
out experimentally but other than that

00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:28,450
we're excited to roll it out soon and to

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:31,630
get feedback on it I think you also sent

00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:33,610
me AIDS Eagle v2 yeah so we're we're

00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:35,710
gonna be cutting a v2 of Diego release

00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:37,030
just to introduce a bunch of breaking

00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:40,000
changes and kind of slow design

00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:41,800
solidifies some configurations I think

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,690
all of that is reflected in CF

00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:46,090
deployment or if it isn't we'll be

00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:48,460
making some minor adjustments to make

00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:49,750
sure that that configuration reflects

00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:54,190
what you need to have in your manifest

00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:58,720
for any breaking Bosch property changes

00:08:54,190 --> 00:09:02,800
and we're also we've been careful to

00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:04,180
keep windows of api compatibility long

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,470
enough so that there shouldn't be any

00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:07,089
problem with their component

00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:08,620
communications the things being up to

00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:09,819
date but it's really if you have any

00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:11,500
feedback about your concerns on that

00:09:09,819 --> 00:09:17,139
we'd appreciate it on the proposed and

00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:18,430
you have a proposal in so III think you

00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:22,149
know we're just gonna be progressing

00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:23,560
through that work and if we don't hear

00:09:22,149 --> 00:09:26,850
any feedback by the time we're ready to

00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:30,540
come well we'll go ahead and make that

00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:35,399
but probably in a couple of weeks okay

00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:35,399
thank you any question for Erica lue

00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:45,580
that a few highlights strong from

00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:48,779
Trenton PMC meeting notes there's the

00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:54,600
server side at manor house proposal

00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:57,100
that's Zack and EJ have been working on

00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,779
so thanks

00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:03,660
fact that will go out soon if it hasn't

00:09:58,779 --> 00:10:06,610
already the steel item is also

00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:09,970
deprecating a few things in the app

00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:11,769
manifest and they together blog why and

00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:16,350
what things they're planning on

00:10:11,769 --> 00:10:16,350
fabricating so check that out as well

00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:23,649
see what else garden team is very

00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:26,500
excited about the Zinio stem cell that's

00:10:23,649 --> 00:10:30,720
coming that the Bosch team is working on

00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:37,420
I don't believe it's there's a published

00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:40,720
final version of that yet on audio but

00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:43,450
the Guardian team is very much looking

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:50,200
at the new kernel that's available and

00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:54,459
see against himself and the container

00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:58,000
networking team is they have their one

00:10:54,459 --> 00:11:01,660
dot o R zero dot one dot a release of

00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,180
their app discovery work with

00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:07,209
infrastructure names so those are all

00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:10,990
very cool things that people should

00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:13,740
check out yeah thanks I think as Yuri

00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:16,660
mention I guess this is for purposes of

00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:20,920
recording and people listening each one

00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:23,110
of the PMC's have notes so if you are

00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:25,510
interested you can just go and find that

00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:27,880
out I'll put a link I think if it's not

00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:29,529
already there and call so you can go and

00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,779
find the detail so this is mostly for

00:11:29,529 --> 00:11:33,519
highlight so that you can know that this

00:11:31,779 --> 00:11:35,350
is happening my points and see go how's

00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,089
it be to coming so if you're interested

00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:39,750
in that you may want to pay attention to

00:11:37,089 --> 00:11:45,730
Eric's email so they ignore it kind of

00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:47,040
all right let's see any questions for

00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:49,420
run time I think

00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,550
Jews are you in

00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:54,610
you you had a big update for gardening

00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:56,890
you wanna talk about that I don't know

00:11:54,610 --> 00:12:04,690
if she's there it's late for your trade

00:11:56,890 --> 00:12:08,290
might be yeah I don't know yeah yes so

00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:10,090
we collapsed the two teams down and then

00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:13,570
they decided to also collapse the

00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:16,560
carcases yeah I guessed always a

00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:19,090
challenge to do these things with cool

00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,880
yeah the the latest version of garden

00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:24,640
run sea just includes screwed FS and

00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:25,960
enables it by default and so if you've

00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:28,210
already switched to see if deployment

00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:31,480
you won't notice anything and you'll

00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:35,020
you'll be I believe opted into that

00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:37,770
configuration by default I'll actually

00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:40,210
send a note about this to see if shortly

00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:42,190
if you're still on the classic manifest

00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:45,010
generation the templates that come from

00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:47,950
CF released in Diego release then

00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:50,320
unfortunately the manifests aren't

00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:53,830
exactly compatible and so you can't use

00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:55,660
the latest garden run si release on the

00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:59,560
Diego manifest that you generate with

00:12:55,660 --> 00:13:01,720
that and we've just finished doing the

00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:03,640
chain to have to do acceptance on it to

00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,860
make that manifest generation compatible

00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:07,090
with the latest garden run C release but

00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:09,490
it won't be compatible with previous

00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:11,410
ones generally we haven't seen a problem

00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:13,510
with people just upgrading their garden

00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:16,240
run C release but I'll point that out on

00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:17,770
CF Devon in the release notes again

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,150
there's no fundamental and compatibility

00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:22,020
with the releases it's just the manifest

00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:25,360
generation that's old clunky but also

00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:27,550
take this opportunity to reprioritize

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,200
your efforts to migrate to CF deployment

00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:31,560
because all that meant this generation

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,300
system will stop being supported version

00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:38,260
yeah I mean I can't you can't stress

00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:40,810
this enough maybe I'll talk to David see

00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:43,180
if he wants to come next time and maybe

00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:44,830
told you know be there in case people

00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:46,870
have questions and so generally it's

00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:49,270
been very good and I think most people

00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:54,130
happy with it maybe that's that's the

00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:57,580
message yeah no news good news anyhow I

00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:58,790
don't see any questions for Erica you

00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:01,690
week

00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:03,640
[Music]

00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:06,640
okay I don't know if you wanted to

00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:10,900
highlight anything additional Adam your

00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:13,240
Newt yeah one thing that's actually a

00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:15,900
feedback from the community on and we

00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:19,390
just want to make sure we educate on is

00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:21,940
trade-offs around streaming of logs and

00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:24,670
log ordering and how to use the time

00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:28,990
stamp to best achieve ordering

00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:32,680
techniques of a post about this on the

00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:34,510
cfd the list there's a couple of the

00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:38,110
kind of highlights here to know one is

00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:40,180
that the CFC oh I had it does its best

00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:42,010
effort at ordering it does that by

00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:45,130
batching logs and then displaying them

00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:47,920
I'm ordering based on the time stamp but

00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:49,990
that functionality was removed in a

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:54,760
previous version and only recently added

00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:57,010
back in so I think it's 6.3 3.1 my head

00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:59,680
that has it again if you look at that CF

00:14:57,010 --> 00:15:01,180
Deb post I have the specific version so

00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,670
if you are seeing logs at a border on

00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:05,860
your COI might be worth making sure you

00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:08,080
grab the latest version additionally if

00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:09,640
you work on a client I just reached out

00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:12,550
to the Strad o--'s team to make sure

00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:14,530
they know about ordering based on

00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:17,020
timestamp but if you work on a client

00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:19,960
it's a good idea to order based on the

00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:22,510
timestamp really improves the debugging

00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,980
experience for developers so give any

00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:24,850
questions about that largely the team is

00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:27,430
happy to help

00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:30,220
we have suggestions for syslog ingestion

00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:39,790
as well to make that work with the the

00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:40,390
popular syslog providers any other

00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:42,610
questions

00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:48,610
remember you can paste questions I guess

00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:50,110
when the cap channel or the agenda if

00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:52,440
you don't want to read it and will read

00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:52,440
it for you

00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:57,950
nope all right you can we can well we

00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:01,910
may have time for questions towards the

00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:05,960
end okay so next is gonna be I guess

00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:09,200
highlights from the Bosch community

00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:14,780
I know Dimitri is on the call he can

00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:17,720
give us an I highlight okay hey um well

00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:20,720
we've been working on this tinkle

00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:23,060
hot-swap continuing to work on it it's

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:26,470
it's touching some of the internals of

00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:29,920
the director so we're making it

00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:32,720
carefully and the adding appropriate

00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:36,650
tests and whatnot to backfill if

00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:38,330
anything is missing you can read a

00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:43,690
little bit more about that so upon Bush

00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:46,010
notes but this was in addition to

00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:49,960
helping to speed up some of the

00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:53,180
deployments it will also help us to

00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:54,560
unblock some of the future changes to

00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:57,620
the director where we're going to

00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,630
improve diffing such that the diffing

00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:01,040
will show which vm's and persistent disk

00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:06,140
and all kinds of other stuff could be

00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:09,620
changing so much more much more intense

00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:11,630
diff coming up and then eventually to

00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:14,089
also unblock this thing called granular

00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:19,120
deploy which will allow us to be much

00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:22,570
much more exact and not having to update

00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:24,949
any other instance that you've specified

00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:26,750
that you haven't specified McMullan

00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:28,600
right so this this work will be I'm

00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:31,880
blocking some of the other larger pieces

00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:33,910
you know swing by the slack channel to

00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:38,570
ask more questions if if you're curious

00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:46,460
we also have been working on making some

00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:49,030
of the board DNS production testing

00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:53,360
additions to our pipelines based on our

00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:56,660
PWAs rollout it's been quiet and good

00:17:53,360 --> 00:18:00,950
and boring so we're adding a little bit

00:17:56,660 --> 00:18:05,270
of production data to tour test Suites

00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:05,960
to lock down the behavior and you know

00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:08,330
we were

00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:10,130
rolling out burstiness in all kinds of

00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:17,570
other places including our commercial

00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:19,340
offering what else been going on fixing

00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:23,480
all kinds of bugs and whatnot I know

00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:26,080
that software team has a few PRS to pull

00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:30,830
in there so we will be behind on that

00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:37,370
Alibaba team has been quietly preparing

00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:40,490
their CTI to reveal for for the official

00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:42,770
support they're very close so that's the

00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:48,799
another cloud provider that will be

00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:50,809
joining us team is also working on links

00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:55,370
API I'm not sure how many of you heard

00:18:50,809 --> 00:19:00,890
of it it's a it's an API for some of the

00:18:55,370 --> 00:19:03,440
service broker integration but generally

00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:06,500
it will also help to visualize the state

00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:10,070
of links and all the details within a

00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:12,080
deployment so one can write a tool that

00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:14,120
shows you all of the links within the

00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:16,700
deployment and how they you know come

00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:20,000
together and cross deployments as well

00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:23,990
oh yeah

00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:28,010
we'll also be trying to migrate to both

00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:31,940
process manager BPM for our next boss

00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:35,230
release to make it more official I

00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:38,690
similar to howdy ago has been doing it

00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:40,669
and I'm not sure when Eric will pull the

00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:43,789
trigger to say that the only way to run

00:19:40,669 --> 00:19:47,480
da goo is with BPM but from Bosch it

00:19:43,789 --> 00:19:49,340
will come in the next release and of

00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:52,940
course as you mentioned the xenial stem

00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:55,880
cells are still in progress but slated

00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:57,440
to be released soon we have a few things

00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:59,450
that we're still investigating to make

00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,169
sure that everything is working as

00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:04,490
expected

00:20:00,169 --> 00:20:10,010
but overall it seems to work okay we're

00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:13,220
running the BPM for Diego on PWS at 10%

00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:16,429
right now I think we're waiting on the

00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:21,080
signal from Chris breath and

00:20:16,429 --> 00:20:24,019
Aaron and Jim Myers - if they're ready

00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:28,490
to go to 50 or 100 percent I expect

00:20:24,019 --> 00:20:30,169
soon after we'll be able to once I give

00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:32,539
that signal we'll roll that out and then

00:20:30,169 --> 00:20:36,619
can't be released will follow and then

00:20:32,539 --> 00:20:40,220
the other release as well cool thank you

00:20:36,619 --> 00:20:42,499
decay any questions I'm trying to move

00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:45,379
on a little bit faster so we can give

00:20:42,499 --> 00:20:50,149
the speakers some chance but thank you

00:20:45,379 --> 00:20:53,440
decadence is great update if you've

00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:56,350
never communicated with Dimitri on slack

00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:58,369
you probably got a response from him

00:20:56,350 --> 00:21:01,639
even though you didn't talk to him so

00:20:58,369 --> 00:21:07,009
he's very good at keeping open slack so

00:21:01,639 --> 00:21:10,100
whatever you need pinyin all right so

00:21:07,009 --> 00:21:12,559
Alex for open serviceworker maybe you

00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:14,990
can give us a quick update yeah

00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:17,179
hey folks like I keep the brief all the

00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:19,970
notes are in the report in agender

00:21:17,179 --> 00:21:22,220
anyway but the main thing is the 2:14

00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:24,559
version of the open service broker API

00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:27,619
specification is with targeting for

00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:30,889
release in February this had three kind

00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:33,710
of goals one to i've tidy up the spec a

00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:35,450
lot and get it very consistent across in

00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:38,509
terms of documentation across all the

00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:41,029
API calls and add support for

00:21:38,509 --> 00:21:42,710
asynchronous bindings so this will allow

00:21:41,029 --> 00:21:45,679
you to do the same asynchronous behavior

00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:47,119
for create delete but on bindings we're

00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,249
finding some service brokers we're

00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:53,029
finding it hard to do the binding

00:21:49,249 --> 00:21:55,700
operation within the default timeout in

00:21:53,029 --> 00:21:57,529
a foundry which is a 60 seconds so we're

00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:59,360
adding support for asynchronous bindings

00:21:57,529 --> 00:22:02,749
and then adding support for get

00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:05,059
endpoints and this allows you to

00:22:02,749 --> 00:22:07,700
retrieve information about an instance

00:22:05,059 --> 00:22:10,249
or a binding such as the configuration

00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:13,879
parameters that are used so you can see

00:22:10,249 --> 00:22:15,230
both of the PRS in the links and they're

00:22:13,879 --> 00:22:17,179
currently in this validation -

00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:18,950
implementation phase which means

00:22:17,179 --> 00:22:20,990
platforms are implementing the

00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:23,570
specification proposal to see if this

00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:26,119
works in reality and can enable some new

00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:27,649
use cases in the platform's so async

00:22:26,119 --> 00:22:30,410
bindings is now supported in service

00:22:27,649 --> 00:22:32,960
catalog and get endpoint

00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:35,260
has just been kicked off by the services

00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,280
api team so we should see some

00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:41,180
experimental support in the platform and

00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:44,960
soon for those also with we're creating

00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:47,000
an open API document for the service for

00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,740
the API said this is almost ready to

00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,560
merge or has just been merged so you can

00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:53,690
go check that out and you know use

00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:56,300
things like swagger pet store to render

00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:57,920
it there interesting is is broker

00:22:56,300 --> 00:23:00,710
actions is the thing that we're working

00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:04,370
on and this is to enable use cases where

00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:07,370
brokers could offer actions on instances

00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:09,950
so you might have an example restart

00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:13,070
service or stop service or backup

00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:15,380
service restore service and it's an

00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:16,550
extension mechanism to the API so

00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:18,740
there's a really interesting proposal

00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:23,030
that's being driven by Google and Dell

00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:25,220
on this and then final updates is we've

00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:27,950
got Scott Nichols from Google joining

00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:30,740
the PMC and Andreas Gus here from

00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:32,300
fidgets who's leaving the PMC but we're

00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:33,560
in discussion with seeing if there's

00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:35,840
someone else from Fujitsu that's gonna

00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:38,150
be joining the group so that's a

00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:41,420
whirlwind tour of a open serviceworker

00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:45,460
API and lots of links in the agenda cool

00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:47,030
thank you Alex I don't see any questions

00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:49,220
anything

00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:52,040
one thing I would mention is I guess

00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:55,850
just in general a lot of the cab calls

00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:58,370
we've used I guess the second part of

00:23:55,850 --> 00:24:00,170
the hour to do demos which as you will

00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:02,150
see from the survey results very popular

00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:04,970
but it's been mostly the extensions

00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:07,010
demos however it's perfectly fine like

00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:09,440
if like for instance somebody wants to

00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:12,230
Alex wants to give an update and a demo

00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:14,930
of the open service broker at least one

00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:16,850
example will open to that - so just ping

00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:18,140
me on that especially if you in the

00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:21,460
community would like to see something

00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:24,230
that's being discussed let us know okay

00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:27,440
I'll be quick on extension so I can get

00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:30,650
to the cab survey and then pass it to

00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:33,170
the SAE team for their presentation so

00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:35,870
on extensions we have two new proposals

00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:38,660
that are coming down the pipeline in

00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:41,260
addition to a few more that have been in

00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:43,910
the pipeline but you know these are new

00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:46,460
to some extent we have

00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:48,800
Stephen Levine who did CF local he has

00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:50,420
one that he's trying to put together

00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:52,940
cause he of death and I guess you'll

00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:55,150
hear about it soon and then composite

00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:58,880
application which you will hear today

00:24:55,150 --> 00:25:02,210
for Bacchus PSAP team which is leaving

00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:04,100
it now they've merged a broker as part

00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:07,070
of a backer so now in the code base you

00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:09,260
will get also a service broker that you

00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:13,550
can use to spin up instances of a

00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:16,070
package that's equal it will try I will

00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:17,750
try to have them do a demo in an

00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:20,480
upcoming cap call because they've

00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:24,110
already requested it and they have a

00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:25,940
nice UI to show also so you know if

00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:28,250
you've been interested in our backers

00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:31,730
it's worth it against for people that

00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:34,400
own new abacus is the metering engine

00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:36,710
for foundry at least one of them it's

00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:40,670
the open-source version and it's being

00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:42,470
used by s AP and IB M and then the

00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:44,840
swallows UI which has generated a lot of

00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:48,380
buzz there's a blog post that's coming

00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:50,480
up we have our extensions notes so you

00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:53,930
can get details from that if you go

00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:55,820
there alright if you have questions

00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:59,330
piece it for me what I'm gonna do now is

00:25:55,820 --> 00:26:03,560
to switch it to my laptop so I can show

00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:05,510
you guys the survey results okay and

00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:11,090
I'll try to use about 10 minutes for

00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:13,460
this make sure we all text dr. max well

00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:18,440
look at the survey results actually

00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:23,270
interesting so at the end of the year

00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:27,290
I'm trying to present so give me and

00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:30,050
all right at the end of the year I set

00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:33,170
out a survey I made it short brief so

00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:37,670
that people can actually take it

00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:40,880
so just tweet questions and I think I

00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:44,170
keep getting this and the goal was to

00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:46,250
kind of do a retro for catcalls right

00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:48,530
obviously I've been running these things

00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:51,860
for two years I also wanna I wanted to

00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:54,170
find out it did people not want me all

00:26:51,860 --> 00:27:01,160
right or want something else or what

00:26:54,170 --> 00:27:03,650
format so it's it's it was you know

00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:05,720
anonymous just tweet questions mostly

00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:07,960
just corrected back right and then also

00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:11,390
see what works and what doesn't work so

00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:13,460
the questions were if you've taken it

00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:17,750
there's about thirty six people that

00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:19,730
taken it around that you know how often

00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:24,230
do you attend just so we can get a feel

00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:26,690
for you know ten minutes what did you

00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:28,640
enjoy the most just so we can see some

00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:30,940
highlights you know what what works well

00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:33,080
and then of course constructive

00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:34,910
constructive feedback so I didn't want

00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:36,800
to say what did you not enjoy but

00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:39,940
instead like what what would you do

00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:43,490
different so these are the results

00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:45,710
so first is that we got about twenty

00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:47,360
four completed responses but forty three

00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:49,910
responses so I think some people like

00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:52,970
skip a question and the way Survey

00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:54,559
Monkey puts it is that they'll basically

00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:56,480
say that it wasn't completed even though

00:27:54,559 --> 00:28:01,190
you answer two questions out of the

00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:03,860
three and I closed it yesterday around

00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:07,760
noon so I don't take anything change

00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:11,030
sense so what are the results so for

00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:14,210
question one you can see about 25

00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:18,890
percent actually attend regularly and

00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:20,990
then there's a few that are attending I

00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:25,030
mean more than about half for attending

00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:31,040
here and there and maybe about a third

00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:32,540
never so I guess in the response to read

00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:35,030
the constructive feedback you're gonna

00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:36,460
see a specific feedback on how we can

00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:39,009
maybe improve attendance

00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:41,710
and and there's it was a suggestion even

00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:45,730
and maybe you can discuss it so that's

00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:49,360
kind of the overall view of it at rather

00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:50,619
it was fifty percent of the green but

00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,210
we're not quite there yet

00:28:50,619 --> 00:28:56,019
maybe that's a that's a goal for this

00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:56,889
year the second question is what did you

00:28:56,019 --> 00:28:59,860
enjoy the most

00:28:56,889 --> 00:29:01,450
I kind of ran through the text and I did

00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:05,169
this and I'll I'll show you another view

00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:08,440
of the results but basically project

00:29:05,169 --> 00:29:10,509
updates people still like this a lot in

00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:13,059
demos so I would say those are the

00:29:10,509 --> 00:29:15,460
things and in of course q and A's there

00:29:13,059 --> 00:29:18,519
was a lot of pointers to discussions the

00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:20,619
fact that people enjoy when there is an

00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:23,289
active discussion obviously today we

00:29:20,619 --> 00:29:28,389
haven't had much questions but those

00:29:23,289 --> 00:29:30,039
happen and people enjoy them this is a I

00:29:28,389 --> 00:29:35,470
guess a word cloud

00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:36,970
I just so the way I built this and that

00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:41,889
was that's what I was doing right now

00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:44,919
right before you know we started this

00:29:41,889 --> 00:29:47,259
meeting is I took all the text from the

00:29:44,919 --> 00:29:49,749
responses and then I just plugged them

00:29:47,259 --> 00:29:53,080
to a word I mean that's what I generated

00:29:49,749 --> 00:29:55,350
so you can see updates community sharing

00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:58,029
discussions those are the highlights

00:29:55,350 --> 00:30:01,240
what's this magical - in the middle I

00:29:58,029 --> 00:30:06,879
know I could have removed it my bad

00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:08,889
Thanks yeah this is what happens when

00:30:06,879 --> 00:30:12,100
when you do it at the last minute but

00:30:08,889 --> 00:30:14,440
the good thing here is I did not touch

00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:15,700
the text right I just took all the text

00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:20,200
from the responses and that's what

00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:22,899
you're seeing but here's a good one

00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:25,629
these are the highlights so I went to

00:30:22,899 --> 00:30:29,409
all the responses and I pick five that I

00:30:25,629 --> 00:30:31,690
thought were really good so we're going

00:30:29,409 --> 00:30:33,159
to them not necessarily in order of what

00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:35,440
I think is the best I just thought those

00:30:33,159 --> 00:30:36,999
five were great so first thing is people

00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,619
said quadriga please like so somebody

00:30:36,999 --> 00:30:39,999
insert project updates and of course

00:30:38,619 --> 00:30:42,879
there's a project updates on all the

00:30:39,999 --> 00:30:44,889
other responses somebody says I like

00:30:42,879 --> 00:30:49,169
sharing things I'm working on which I

00:30:44,889 --> 00:30:49,169
guess is great you know we all do that

00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:53,730
your presentations from guests so that

00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:56,640
was a response

00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:58,350
one more is I guess community project

00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:01,350
updates and extensions I guess we were

00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:04,080
hearing that again and it's my friends

00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:07,640
even the vine there I don't know if he

00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:10,440
answered that but I loved it says yeah

00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:12,570
somebody said CF local was the highlight

00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:15,120
demo for me concise powerful and

00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:21,049
well-prepared if you did not write this

00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:26,220
even somebody loves you well thank you

00:31:21,049 --> 00:31:28,080
so that's the highlight all right so the

00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:30,510
next question the last questions I guess

00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,669
is this question three so a little typo

00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:36,929
here there is constructive feedback for

00:31:32,669 --> 00:31:40,500
2018 and I think these are the things

00:31:36,929 --> 00:31:43,590
that that that came up that I thought

00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:45,659
was interesting multiple times so some

00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:49,049
people asking people you know folks to

00:31:45,659 --> 00:31:50,640
talk slower just because we have an

00:31:49,049 --> 00:31:52,529
international team and some people don't

00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,779
necessarily speak English perfectly so

00:31:52,529 --> 00:31:57,059
if you can I guess

00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:59,279
spend some time speaking short I would

00:31:57,059 --> 00:32:02,520
help some people were saying keep the

00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:04,409
format as is people asked for the video

00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:06,659
the YouTube videos so that's something I

00:32:04,409 --> 00:32:08,429
saw also it had more demos that's

00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:11,520
something that was very very clear and

00:32:08,429 --> 00:32:15,029
the highlights so I did also a word

00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:18,600
cloud for this and you can see the

00:32:15,029 --> 00:32:20,340
results here it's it's a little bit

00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:24,299
there were a lot more text but you can

00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:26,820
see updates projects time was an issue

00:32:24,299 --> 00:32:30,809
so we definitely need to try to address

00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:33,659
this which is how do we make it I guess

00:32:30,809 --> 00:32:36,990
maybe we alternate the time I'll try to

00:32:33,659 --> 00:32:39,690
see if I can run a specific question on

00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:41,549
the CF there to address that particular

00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:43,700
topic because that that came up multiple

00:32:41,549 --> 00:32:46,080
times so in other words this 8 a.m. a

00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:49,620
civic time works well of course for the

00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:51,210
US and works well for maybe some points

00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:54,419
of the world like you up but it doesn't

00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:58,080
work at all for Australia and followed

00:32:54,419 --> 00:33:01,100
be China as well right so we need to try

00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:02,759
to figure out what we can do about that

00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:06,269
so the

00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:11,579
lights of the responses YouTube videos

00:33:06,269 --> 00:33:15,239
quicker so Wayne talking deep so

00:33:11,579 --> 00:33:17,789
somebody said that we can make that

00:33:15,239 --> 00:33:21,149
happen right keep major project updates

00:33:17,789 --> 00:33:25,139
to the point so basically you know quick

00:33:21,149 --> 00:33:27,299
updates but to the point keep it going

00:33:25,139 --> 00:33:28,859
that's another one that somebody said I

00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:32,279
thought I loved those kind of small

00:33:28,859 --> 00:33:35,009
responses get the leads to attend a

00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:36,629
project you know if you have an update

00:33:35,009 --> 00:33:39,119
in your lead for something you kind of

00:33:36,629 --> 00:33:40,759
have to attend so people are reminding

00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:44,429
us of that I thought I was interesting

00:33:40,759 --> 00:33:46,499
and I'm pretty sure dr. Nick with this

00:33:44,429 --> 00:33:51,509
one but give up you up include

00:33:46,499 --> 00:33:53,669
Australian timezone that's fair I did

00:33:51,509 --> 00:33:55,799
not write the last one and I don't know

00:33:53,669 --> 00:34:00,739
if Nick over it either but somebody said

00:33:55,799 --> 00:34:03,959
this more of us so I appreciated that

00:34:00,739 --> 00:34:06,539
that's that's the highlights I shared

00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:09,139
these slides with you towards the end I

00:34:06,539 --> 00:34:12,720
have actually the complete answers I

00:34:09,139 --> 00:34:15,509
don't have a way to I guess I could just

00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:18,000
put the text I'll replace this image

00:34:15,509 --> 00:34:20,069
with the text so these are exactly what

00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,659
people have answered so you can good

00:34:20,069 --> 00:34:25,740
with them so if you go through this you

00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:27,450
can see everything I I see that there

00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:34,049
are a couple of questions so let me see

00:34:27,450 --> 00:34:36,119
if our comments people what people ask

00:34:34,049 --> 00:34:39,599
and then we'll switch to the last

00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:44,339
presentation let's see what people are

00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:46,500
saying in the chat okay so these were

00:34:44,339 --> 00:34:49,440
just small comments all right fair

00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:51,929
enough so let me stop sharing let's see

00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:55,710
if if if you guys have a question for me

00:34:51,929 --> 00:35:00,359
on the survey please feel free to yell

00:34:55,710 --> 00:35:02,190
at now otherwise we can start the next

00:35:00,359 --> 00:35:05,089
presentation so Nicola if you guys can

00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:08,220
get you know sharing your screen so

00:35:05,089 --> 00:35:12,779
Nicolai and Georgie are part of the SAE

00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:16,130
team in Bulgaria and in Sofia Bulgaria

00:35:12,779 --> 00:35:20,450
and they've had this presentation I

00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:22,010
so it at CF CF summit Basel they also

00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:23,510
have a demo mode that I didn't get a

00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:26,000
chance to see but they're gonna make it

00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:27,190
we're gonna do it today it's it's a it's

00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,510
a very interesting it's really

00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:32,480
disruptive a little bit but it's it's

00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:35,990
you know we'll bring more to cloud

00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:39,590
foundry so nicholai you can take it now

00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:40,160
and you have about 20 minutes okay do

00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:42,170
here man

00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:47,540
yes we can hear you very well and we see

00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:50,210
your screen today okay great so yeah I'm

00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:53,330
like while in the koi social Yogi we

00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:57,280
presented this token the CF semi team

00:35:53,330 --> 00:36:00,560
Basel I want to make a very brief

00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:03,290
overview on what we are doing and

00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:06,770
actually spend hopefully most of the

00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:09,020
time on the demo in QA so what we are

00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:12,200
doing for three years now we are

00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:15,500
actually working on lifecycle management

00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:17,870
for cloud foundry apps at ACP called

00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:24,170
platform which uses internally called

00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:29,630
foundry and I'm I'll start with with a

00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:32,420
direct example so I'm using this spring

00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:35,630
music app as kind of a showcase of what

00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:38,180
we are doing so it is kind of extended

00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:41,810
spring spring music app it is like to

00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:44,210
doto by default spring cue music you

00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:48,890
suggest one spring

00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:51,710
boot up with some songs and albums

00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:53,960
functionality but I've extended it to

00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:57,410
provide some some additional music news

00:36:53,960 --> 00:37:01,040
so here we have some internal news

00:36:57,410 --> 00:37:05,690
provider that is developed by by my team

00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:08,510
and some external that is I consume as a

00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:11,450
service on somewhere somewhere else so

00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:14,000
that this distinct here in the box

00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:16,460
actually are the components that my team

00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:20,600
is responsible for so we see this

00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:23,540
pattern at ICP many many apps that we

00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:25,700
develop so we have kind of structure

00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:28,550
different apps that communicate one

00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:29,540
another they also have certain services

00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:32,900
that

00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:35,480
again we say that they went to the same

00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:39,110
lifecycle management unit actually these

00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:40,880
artifacts share a version could be

00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:43,670
packaged etcetera

00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:47,120
so we see certain certain challenges

00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:51,350
with these kind of applications first of

00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:54,260
all how to develop them in in one

00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:57,920
possibly in one environment only one

00:37:54,260 --> 00:38:00,260
concurrent system then how to do these

00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:03,140
deployment specific configurations and

00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:05,750
distinguish between death to probe to

00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:09,890
test environments possibly how to

00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:12,800
package and deliver this because not

00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:16,130
always you just build from source and

00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:19,580
and push from from moko environment then

00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:22,190
how to deploy update of course without

00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:26,090
downtime and then deploy so we came up

00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:29,090
with with the quality of application

00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:34,190
model code multi target application

00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:36,190
actually this is a concept / ACP and it

00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:39,410
is the quality of model where you can

00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:43,310
specify the content of your composite

00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:46,220
application actually your apps and

00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:50,830
services are model modeled as modules

00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:54,700
and resources which have dependencies

00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:58,190
certain provides requires relations etc

00:38:54,700 --> 00:39:02,030
so this is the different model we will

00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:06,560
work with on development to packaging to

00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:09,050
deployment time so for this this

00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:12,520
decorative model actually for this we

00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:15,530
introduced the so-called descriptors

00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:17,960
actually their standard gamma files and

00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:19,940
we have two types of them one of them is

00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:22,190
the so could the polymer descriptor that

00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:25,970
contains the static structure of your

00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:28,160
application your apps services etc there

00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:31,550
are dependencies but we also have this

00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:33,890
the mechanism to provide deployment

00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:37,990
specific configuration and we call it

00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:42,850
the moment I mean external schedules

00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:44,980
just one look on the on the discreet

00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:48,100
two of the of our spring music a petri

00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:51,070
dishes all of it and I would very

00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:53,950
briefly walk you through it continue

00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:58,360
with the the actually the the deployment

00:39:53,950 --> 00:40:00,070
of this composite app what are the main

00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:02,650
things we are introducing some

00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:05,530
additional metadata on top of the quad

00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:09,040
foundry existing one so we are actually

00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:12,580
adding application ID and version four

00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:16,660
for the whole composite set of the apps

00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:19,510
and services here we have the modules

00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:24,940
which are actually translated to to two

00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:27,370
apps we have certain parameters actual

00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:31,080
of the that is available in the in the

00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:34,180
CF app manifest is also supported here

00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:36,760
we could populate certain environment

00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:38,740
variables for the for the apps and we

00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:41,260
have this interesting concept about

00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:43,870
provides requires relations actually

00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:49,540
this way see here we could expose

00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:53,530
configuration from one up and and inject

00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:55,870
it to another app so in this way this

00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:59,230
news application that I've developed

00:40:55,870 --> 00:41:06,820
here it is a node.js app it provides a

00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:09,780
URL and with the extra DAP URL slash

00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:11,860
news and here we also have this

00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:13,930
placeholder which is resolved

00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:16,870
automatically to the application URL

00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:20,010
here so this is kind of substitution

00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:23,170
dynamic by happening from deployment

00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:25,360
once i've provided this from one up I

00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:28,050
then could require it for another app so

00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:31,210
which is kind of this injection from

00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:34,660
provider to consumer and this way we can

00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:38,500
out wire the different apps that

00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:41,020
constitute composed application so here

00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:44,080
I Ricardo news provider the URL etcetera

00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:46,780
so this would be made available as an

00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:50,410
environment for ambo in at runtime in

00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:52,390
Maya then we have resources which are

00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:55,000
actually the the services they could be

00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:57,280
managed like polar SQL database here and

00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:00,490
user provided service

00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:02,440
these are also configured here and this

00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:05,320
is one thing that I know don't know on

00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:07,300
development time so the URL or this user

00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:11,490
provided service it is something dynamic

00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:11,490
that I would specify when I deploy my

00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:15,490
yeah there are also configuration for

00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:17,770
server being sorted by names et cetera

00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:20,080
but that's not that interesting

00:42:17,770 --> 00:42:22,390
what is interesting it this extension

00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:26,590
descriptor actually it contains the

00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:29,020
deponent specifics of my app so I here

00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:33,780
could tune the memory instances I mean

00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:36,580
everything again that is available as up

00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:40,450
parameters but here I'm also providing

00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:45,070
this concrete URL for my user provided

00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:48,910
service this news external you are out

00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:53,080
yeah yeah so these are the the two the

00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:57,130
two manifests and actually the rustic

00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:58,780
that I want to to show before the demo

00:42:57,130 --> 00:43:01,420
is actually we introduced also this

00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:03,850
packaging format once you have the

00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:07,950
decorative model once you have the word

00:43:03,850 --> 00:43:11,860
jar no J's files we introduced the

00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:14,590
distinct code into your hive as a means

00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:18,450
to to actually package and then

00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:22,780
distribute your application so this is a

00:43:18,450 --> 00:43:25,990
jar component archive respect to entire

00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:29,760
hive which contains all the resources

00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:33,160
that I mentioned the the adapts the

00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:35,470
deployment descriptor and we are

00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:40,000
actually using it for the deployment of

00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:42,960
these component applications good so

00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:48,130
what we introduced on top of this model

00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:51,130
we introduced CLI CF CLI plugin which

00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:54,310
accepts actually such kind of an archive

00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:56,770
together with the possible extension

00:43:54,310 --> 00:43:59,680
descriptors containing the common

00:43:56,770 --> 00:44:03,910
specific configuration which is which is

00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:07,390
optional and this plugin then cause

00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:09,610
server style application with the goal

00:44:07,390 --> 00:44:11,109
to bring the application to the to the

00:44:09,610 --> 00:44:13,809
desired State

00:44:11,109 --> 00:44:16,059
expressed in the wind our high fried so

00:44:13,809 --> 00:44:18,489
this server application talks mainly to

00:44:16,059 --> 00:44:21,670
the to the control to read the current

00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:24,130
state and do the minimal step of set of

00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:30,279
operations to actually bring that to the

00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:35,710
to the desert state we are going to the

00:44:30,279 --> 00:44:41,489
devil I would possibly directly show you

00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:45,660
the this just arrived actually me teaser

00:44:41,489 --> 00:44:49,180
this is my packaged CF app it contains

00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:52,359
this break music news this is a non jazz

00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:55,720
up containing some static JavaScript

00:44:52,359 --> 00:44:59,619
files and some Jason's directly returned

00:44:55,720 --> 00:45:01,480
and this is my spring boot kind of

00:44:59,619 --> 00:45:04,329
standard spring music app which are

00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:08,470
going to deploy this is also this and

00:45:04,329 --> 00:45:10,720
the yellow that I showed you so this is

00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:14,319
this is very very similar thing actually

00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:19,630
it is the same and now I'm going to to

00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:25,450
deploy it using this plug-in that I

00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:27,999
mentioned actually here is ICP instance

00:45:25,450 --> 00:45:30,339
of the code foundry what room so here

00:45:27,999 --> 00:45:33,460
I've already installed this MK plugin

00:45:30,339 --> 00:45:38,140
you can see it here when I listed CF

00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:43,569
planets entire would use this comment CF

00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:47,619
deploy which I introduced for the point

00:45:43,569 --> 00:45:50,920
my my file this time he arrived with

00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:53,380
this deployment specific configuration

00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:57,940
and actually what is happening right now

00:45:53,380 --> 00:46:00,849
is that the the comment line plug-in is

00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:05,019
calling the server-side attack upholding

00:46:00,849 --> 00:46:06,400
the our hive and then executing but at

00:46:05,019 --> 00:46:07,930
the server site all the needed

00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:12,130
operations to bring the app to the

00:46:07,930 --> 00:46:14,829
desired state so you can see here there

00:46:12,130 --> 00:46:18,009
is an analysis of the existing services

00:46:14,829 --> 00:46:21,430
the services that needs to be created we

00:46:18,009 --> 00:46:25,749
are creating some user provided services

00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:28,390
some database services then we are

00:46:25,749 --> 00:46:31,089
analyzing applications existing

00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:34,319
constants that are needed to be created

00:46:31,089 --> 00:46:39,069
etc so it is kind of predefined

00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:42,150
deployment workflow with the go to to

00:46:39,069 --> 00:46:47,859
bring that to the to the desert state

00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:50,589
make traditional deployment apart from

00:46:47,859 --> 00:46:53,079
this process we have also several other

00:46:50,589 --> 00:46:56,049
predefined workflows for complete

00:46:53,079 --> 00:46:59,499
removal of the composite application and

00:46:56,049 --> 00:47:04,059
also we have worked for for Bui

00:46:59,499 --> 00:47:07,150
deployment of the whole application with

00:47:04,059 --> 00:47:11,130
certain ideas how to improve it inspired

00:47:07,150 --> 00:47:13,509
by the kubernetes rolling updates and

00:47:11,130 --> 00:47:17,019
actually roll back to two previous

00:47:13,509 --> 00:47:22,839
versions etcetera so these are things on

00:47:17,019 --> 00:47:25,869
our plans okay so I think we're on the

00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:31,420
on the last up this spring boot up it is

00:47:25,869 --> 00:47:37,390
Java based and it takes some more time

00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:42,369
to load up possibly and in the meantime

00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:51,140
I could yeah I think it is staged and it

00:47:42,369 --> 00:47:53,030
is starting right now okay

00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:56,240
meantime I could show you possibly one

00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:58,160
of the other comments that we have as I

00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:02,690
said I used the poi for deployment of

00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:05,690
this MK I could use empty ace to

00:48:02,690 --> 00:48:08,480
actually list the already deployed such

00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:11,600
kind of apps and this is chef sample

00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:18,290
music I could delve deeper into that

00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:21,080
with MTA and listing the ID and this

00:48:18,290 --> 00:48:23,360
would give us the the content in terms

00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:24,770
of apps and different services that are

00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:28,730
actually part of my composite

00:48:24,770 --> 00:48:32,080
application so here we can see - one

00:48:28,730 --> 00:48:39,170
possible service one user provided one

00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:41,120
and two two apps with the concrete

00:48:39,170 --> 00:48:44,990
version with the concrete idea of the

00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:47,690
nth cetera so yeah on this site a poll

00:48:44,990 --> 00:48:50,750
you see that my deployment is is already

00:48:47,690 --> 00:48:53,150
finished so I could directly access the

00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:56,570
link here to the to the sprint to the

00:48:53,150 --> 00:48:59,630
quad view our or from here it doesn't

00:48:56,570 --> 00:49:02,480
matter but when I open it you can see

00:48:59,630 --> 00:49:06,050
this classic sprint music app with this

00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:07,940
additional tab here news and you can see

00:49:06,050 --> 00:49:09,740
here that I have certain internal news

00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:13,040
coming from our internal app and some

00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:16,160
external use coming news coming from the

00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:18,670
issues or provided service that that I'm

00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,670
referring to

00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:30,500
yeah this is the kind of Jim why I

00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:35,030
wanted to show if I list the plugins you

00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:37,280
can see also I show you the deploy as I

00:49:35,030 --> 00:49:40,310
mentioned we have blue green deployment

00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:44,840
workflow for doing the classical blue

00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:47,380
green button on this composite level we

00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:51,560
also have the the comments for listing

00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:56,570
of applications we have this history I

00:49:51,560 --> 00:50:01,000
could for instance list the list of

00:49:56,570 --> 00:50:01,000
operations that I've done here with

00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:05,300
additional for instance could download

00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:10,460
the works for yeast

00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:16,190
Kings etcetera mmm and finally I could

00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:20,110
for instance remove all the apps and

00:50:16,190 --> 00:50:25,630
services of this app using CF on deploy

00:50:20,110 --> 00:50:25,630
and hereby just one comment

00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:34,079
okay this is different

00:50:30,990 --> 00:50:39,059
I play 24 different before game theory

00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:41,490
which is not existing there okay this is

00:50:39,059 --> 00:50:48,119
my life what I have to do is co-found

00:50:41,490 --> 00:50:51,720
deploy my empty name and here I'm using

00:50:48,119 --> 00:50:54,240
for option and using this additional

00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:57,299
flag to delivery services which are by

00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:59,730
default not deleted but what would this

00:50:57,299 --> 00:51:03,539
do remove all the apps and services that

00:50:59,730 --> 00:51:08,299
my app composite up constitutes with

00:51:03,539 --> 00:51:12,329
just one one operation so this is

00:51:08,299 --> 00:51:14,819
actually the two link and the the mod of

00:51:12,329 --> 00:51:18,029
this empty model the thing that we use

00:51:14,819 --> 00:51:20,069
inside a CP to manage our internal apps

00:51:18,029 --> 00:51:23,579
and tap should be right now all through

00:51:20,069 --> 00:51:28,650
pushing it as standard for for our

00:51:23,579 --> 00:51:32,700
customers and coming in terms of some

00:51:28,650 --> 00:51:36,200
some numbers I talked about the

00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:39,180
operations yeah you could keep it but

00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:42,599
some real numbers we have more than a

00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:45,299
thousand deep was per day I mean using

00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:48,450
this tooling it is integrated in

00:51:45,299 --> 00:51:51,779
continuous delivery pipe lines on the SP

00:51:48,450 --> 00:51:55,319
platform we have more than a thousand

00:51:51,779 --> 00:51:58,410
and a half model such kind of composite

00:51:55,319 --> 00:52:02,609
apps including test ones and more than a

00:51:58,410 --> 00:52:06,180
hundred Ryo some of them already in

00:52:02,609 --> 00:52:08,339
production on our platform and yeah we

00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:11,069
presented it on the semi team Buzzle it

00:52:08,339 --> 00:52:14,220
is now open source and we have several

00:52:11,069 --> 00:52:16,650
resources I could share with you first

00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:19,680
of all this MK model that I shared there

00:52:16,650 --> 00:52:22,529
is a complete guide rate which is open

00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:25,710
we have three different repositories

00:52:22,529 --> 00:52:28,980
about the MK parsons because it is kind

00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:30,569
of platform agnostic concept which could

00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:35,039
be applied for instance also to Cooper

00:52:30,569 --> 00:52:38,309
Nettles we have the comment line plugin

00:52:35,039 --> 00:52:39,430
that I showed and this server process

00:52:38,309 --> 00:52:42,280
code

00:52:39,430 --> 00:52:45,670
mkto service which you have to install

00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:50,109
as a prerequisite in order to run these

00:52:45,670 --> 00:52:52,510
operations and again this is the rep of

00:52:50,109 --> 00:52:54,099
the spring music cast application that

00:52:52,510 --> 00:52:59,250
that I showed for the demo

00:52:54,099 --> 00:53:04,690
I took we had some talks with the

00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:09,640
control guys on the one puzzle and they

00:53:04,690 --> 00:53:12,849
actually that have done some work on

00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:14,829
evaluating the plug-in here is the pewte

00:53:12,849 --> 00:53:20,880
o tracker item where you can find

00:53:14,829 --> 00:53:26,050
certain feedback that but we agreed that

00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:28,000
we should push push forward I mean the

00:53:26,050 --> 00:53:32,069
project for for incubation in the

00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:36,640
extensions as kind of most I mean

00:53:32,069 --> 00:53:39,190
appropriate place place to be as dr. Mac

00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:42,760
said it is to some extent kind of

00:53:39,190 --> 00:53:47,010
disrupting but it also our perspective

00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:49,630
it it correlates with the server-side

00:53:47,010 --> 00:53:52,960
manifests that the control is pushing to

00:53:49,630 --> 00:53:55,720
those who did the quality of nature you

00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:58,270
declare your what your app is expected

00:53:55,720 --> 00:54:01,030
to be and our to actually brings it to

00:53:58,270 --> 00:54:03,839
the to the state which is at least from

00:54:01,030 --> 00:54:07,030
our power perspective looking for the

00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:10,240
performance possibility yeah and also

00:54:07,030 --> 00:54:11,619
this this works and there's a lot of

00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:13,900
really good stuff I didn't want to

00:54:11,619 --> 00:54:17,020
mention disruptive as a negative things

00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:18,640
actually positive yeah we don't have a

00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:20,549
lot of time to do you want to try to

00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:24,299
wrap up to see if people have questions

00:54:20,549 --> 00:54:27,339
yeah sure actually this is my last site

00:54:24,299 --> 00:54:31,020
here I'm listing a set of plant features

00:54:27,339 --> 00:54:33,400
like rolling cup dates aerobics etcetera

00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:36,250
parallel materialization but all these

00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:39,910
are kind of showing you our our vision

00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:46,839
and the way we are moving so this is

00:54:39,910 --> 00:54:48,400
already all for my side guys yes we so

00:54:46,839 --> 00:54:51,940
we have a few minutes for questions

00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:52,820
maybe you know like about four or five

00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:54,890
minutes

00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:57,770
if you have questions unmute yourself

00:54:54,890 --> 00:55:01,660
and then ask if or if you shy

00:54:57,770 --> 00:55:01,660
taste it and somebody will ask

00:55:01,710 --> 00:55:09,120
I have one question but I want to see if

00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:12,960
other people have questions first okay

00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:20,670
why is it called empty a horrible name

00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:23,670
in my opinion okay yeah make sure it is

00:55:20,670 --> 00:55:27,240
to some extent historical historical

00:55:23,670 --> 00:55:30,810
just historical reasons the idea was

00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:32,160
that yeah it is composite package for

00:55:30,810 --> 00:55:34,050
applications right and these

00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:41,040
applications could be Hitler Guiness

00:55:34,050 --> 00:55:42,840
right they could actually be located in

00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:45,510
different runtimes hosted by different

00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:46,950
to build parts right what a Zen student

00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:49,710
boy yeah

00:55:46,950 --> 00:55:54,680
what is the system a multi target

00:55:49,710 --> 00:55:58,710
application by target okay yeah slide 18

00:55:54,680 --> 00:56:05,550
yeah yeah any other questions

00:55:58,710 --> 00:56:08,100
Dmitry did you ever follow so my

00:56:05,550 --> 00:56:10,620
question was is there a way because this

00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:13,140
is this is super cool clearly people

00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:15,690
need this stuff as you start building

00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:18,210
your application as multiple you know

00:56:15,690 --> 00:56:21,270
micro-services kind of treating them as

00:56:18,210 --> 00:56:25,830
one all the different pieces is what you

00:56:21,270 --> 00:56:28,440
did here but is there a way for instead

00:56:25,830 --> 00:56:30,480
of having all of this there are pieces

00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:32,820
of it that could be I could

00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:36,330
could we divide and conquer this and and

00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:39,530
and start adding smaller pieces instead

00:56:36,330 --> 00:56:39,530
of trying to add it all together

00:56:40,519 --> 00:56:46,529
yeah actually you can divide it in

00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:48,630
several things first of all is the

00:56:46,529 --> 00:56:51,599
reduce development model this is the

00:56:48,630 --> 00:56:53,849
qualitative model that we introduced it

00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:57,779
contains many things but one of the most

00:56:53,849 --> 00:57:01,380
important is added metadata this overall

00:56:57,779 --> 00:57:03,480
composite app name version etc which if

00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:06,660
we had on the controller side we can

00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:10,230
actually don't introduce it on our side

00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:14,400
right just at this world workflows for

00:57:10,230 --> 00:57:18,359
deployment on on the more you burn level

00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:20,309
if you get me so first of all it is the

00:57:18,359 --> 00:57:25,710
decorative model with added metadata

00:57:20,309 --> 00:57:27,240
then are the workforce and yeah I mean

00:57:25,710 --> 00:57:29,700
based on to the quadratic model we are

00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:31,589
coming with more and more workforce as I

00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:34,440
mentioned initial installation and

00:57:31,589 --> 00:57:38,069
deployment do green rolling updates and

00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:42,029
are also right now working on providing

00:57:38,069 --> 00:57:44,460
configuration sharing mechanism between

00:57:42,029 --> 00:57:46,470
apps so it is also these are things that

00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:51,150
can feel free before if you use the

00:57:46,470 --> 00:57:52,559
model this bills be analogous to I have

00:57:51,150 --> 00:57:57,140
my daughter and then your doctor can

00:57:52,559 --> 00:58:04,499
pose its kind of feel like the dynasty

00:57:57,140 --> 00:58:10,249
like puzzly that's yeah it is similar

00:58:04,499 --> 00:58:13,259
thing and I guess in some extent this is

00:58:10,249 --> 00:58:15,059
good for an extension because you are

00:58:13,259 --> 00:58:18,809
using I assume you're not you didn't

00:58:15,059 --> 00:58:21,269
modify anything in in the core runtime

00:58:18,809 --> 00:58:24,450
of Cloud Foundry just all those just

00:58:21,269 --> 00:58:28,470
deploy to an app right that talks to the

00:58:24,450 --> 00:58:30,720
controller that's it so cool oh one more

00:58:28,470 --> 00:58:37,130
question I have for you do you setting

00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:39,599
up with the new CF I guess network

00:58:37,130 --> 00:58:41,430
container networking or you setting up

00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:42,690
networks between the different apps so

00:58:41,430 --> 00:58:45,720
they can talk to each other through

00:58:42,690 --> 00:58:47,730
those networks versus the regular yeah

00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:51,690
we are right now the operations we did

00:58:47,730 --> 00:58:53,780
we do are actually in the in the same

00:58:51,690 --> 00:58:57,530
space so you

00:58:53,780 --> 00:59:00,410
deployer happened actually this app is

00:58:57,530 --> 00:59:04,070
designed to I mean with the restriction

00:59:00,410 --> 00:59:05,420
to being in one space right so there is

00:59:04,070 --> 00:59:07,850
no cross space

00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:11,720
I mean networking security groups

00:59:07,850 --> 00:59:14,720
installation etc but just using the

00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:17,420
network container networking to set your

00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:19,370
setting that up as part of your deploy

00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:22,400
so that the different pieces can

00:59:19,370 --> 00:59:25,400
actually go to that new network that was

00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:27,890
added right all the rules and everything

00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:30,110
have you seen CF container networking

00:59:27,890 --> 00:59:36,650
right yeah yeah I know about it what

00:59:30,110 --> 00:59:40,010
yeah but but here I mean the Dubs they

00:59:36,650 --> 00:59:44,810
interact directly by their public API so

00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:48,290
so this this pieces I mean not not used

00:59:44,810 --> 00:59:50,420
by API cost no - alright maybe an

00:59:48,290 --> 00:59:52,970
extension I guess or an improvement

00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:55,430
would be as part of the deployment maybe

00:59:52,970 --> 00:59:57,800
in the model you can specify that you

00:59:55,430 --> 00:59:59,660
want to do is to communicate if that if

00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:02,540
there's not enough information and then

00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:07,010
as part of this you and you create you

01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:10,760
use the container networking yes true I

01:00:07,010 --> 01:00:12,650
mean right now we have kind of keeping

01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:15,260
up with the innovation of the platform

01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:19,340
and in support for the quality of

01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:22,300
creation of service key service tax plan

01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:25,130
support for the one-off tasks in v3 so

01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:27,380
the container networking is a thing that

01:00:25,130 --> 01:00:29,920
we are going to add but any any new

01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:32,540
feature in the platform we need to

01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:36,050
support it via this the quality of model

01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:38,150
as well yeah cool okay let's see if

01:00:36,050 --> 01:00:41,030
there are any questions I you know don't

01:00:38,150 --> 01:00:43,010
want to dominate this here I don't see

01:00:41,030 --> 01:00:44,660
any question on the stack so if you have

01:00:43,010 --> 01:00:54,910
a question you're gonna have to unmute

01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:54,910
yourself and ask it and

01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:59,450
I forgot to mention that we already had

01:00:56,450 --> 01:01:01,430
four kind of rough project extension

01:00:59,450 --> 01:01:03,920
proposal which we should kind of

01:01:01,430 --> 01:01:06,650
formalize and probably fold the

01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:08,750
standardized process right max yeah

01:01:06,650 --> 01:01:10,460
absolutely I mean you know let's make

01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:12,890
sure we have a proposal and start

01:01:10,460 --> 01:01:14,720
getting people to digest this there's a

01:01:12,890 --> 01:01:18,380
lot to digest here right and if you

01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:19,960
could click on slide 28 again I think

01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:25,130
this is very important I mean obviously

01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:27,530
SAT is you know fortune 500 company and

01:01:25,130 --> 01:01:29,270
be using it and they are proposing this

01:01:27,530 --> 01:01:32,000
I think people should you should pay

01:01:29,270 --> 01:01:35,240
attention if this is interesting to you

01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:38,150
and hopefully we'll get some kind of a

01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:39,770
proposal share it soon so if you have

01:01:38,150 --> 01:01:41,930
feedback you can send it directly to an

01:01:39,770 --> 01:01:44,059
equal I obviously the cap channel is

01:01:41,930 --> 01:01:47,270
always a good place also for additional

01:01:44,059 --> 01:01:51,589
discussions we look forward to talking

01:01:47,270 --> 01:01:54,440
to you and in February we will have we

01:01:51,589 --> 01:01:56,930
already have to talk scheduled so I will

01:01:54,440 --> 01:02:00,290
announce this soon if you do want to

01:01:56,930 --> 01:02:03,230
have a talk we welcome your suggestions

01:02:00,290 --> 01:02:05,839
do send me an email so that I can start

01:02:03,230 --> 01:02:09,950
planning you for March and in subsequent

01:02:05,839 --> 01:02:13,130
months and register for the summit come

01:02:09,950 --> 01:02:16,520
see us in Boston I hear there's great

01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:19,220
clam chowder in here it's one of my

01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:21,260
favorite things and in in Lobster take

01:02:19,220 --> 01:02:22,670
care everybody

01:02:21,260 --> 01:02:24,710
