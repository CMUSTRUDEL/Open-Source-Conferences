and obviously the PMC's so let's first

00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:29,699
give a chance to Swarna or anybody in

00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:33,180
the CF F to give us an update because we

00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:36,750
have a summit coming in a few weeks so

00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:41,010
this is very exciting yeah I'm here

00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:43,230

lot of updates other than yes we are

00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:50,879
counting down to summit in a few weeks

00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,890
the only thing I wanted to mention or if

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,420
you still are not registered and if you

00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,760
are a current or a past contributor let

00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,230
me know I can share the code again

00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,809
so that you can register as a

00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,250
contributor we have pretty many days

00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:05,939
leader activities with contributor

00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:07,830
summit user day hackathon all the

00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:10,200
efficient of awesome events so please do

00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:12,180
let me know if you're not sure of any of

00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,150
those events the unconference folks are

00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:17,250
looking for drilling two more slots as I

00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:20,909
know as I understand so if you have a

00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:22,350
particular talk or a speaking proposal

00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:24,540
that you would like to propose to the

00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:29,430
unconference please do the unconference

00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:32,909
organizers we also have a project

00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:35,700
specific slide on our online store so if

00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:38,430
you go to the foundry online colette and

00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,650
slide store you will see project

00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:43,409
specific t-shirts and stickers like

00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:46,409
bosch ireenie and quarks so if you are

00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:49,020
interested in ordering any of those and

00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:50,880
get them shipped through the venue to

00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:53,189
the event venue you can do that just

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,470
drop it and drop me a note privately on

00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:57,000
the instructions there's a separate way

00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:59,159
you have to order so that you don't have

00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,240
to pay for shipping if you're getting it

00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:05,159
shipped to the event itself to the

00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,229
netherlands so other than that I don't

00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:09,300
have a whole lot but if any of you have

00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:09,899
any questions on summit in general or

00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,670
anything

00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:13,680
that the foundation folks can help

00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:15,290
answer let me know I'll be here through

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:21,480
the call

00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:22,939
excellent thank you going up yes we have

00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:26,489
[Music]

00:02:22,939 --> 00:02:28,230
as SWANA mentioned there's also the

00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:32,690
hackathon we'll be running this search

00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:32,690
you have ideas and you want to help

00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:38,970
please as you'll see in the arena

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:42,180
extension there's probably tons of

00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:45,120
potential hacks to be done to be on and

00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:49,260
to be worked on there so just seeding

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:53,579
ideas here ok any question for anybody

00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:58,319
community you get a chance to pings

00:02:53,579 --> 00:03:01,250
wanna live no ok that's not fair enough

00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:05,370
so I see you in the Haig's I guess

00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:08,790
alright so for project updates or

00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:10,849
highlights we always start with Eric who

00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:15,690
gives us an update on run time

00:03:10,849 --> 00:03:17,609
hey dr. max thanks see ya so I guess

00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:18,870
it's a little bit quiet but I want to

00:03:17,609 --> 00:03:20,669
point out a few things

00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:22,379
see if deployments released I think a

00:03:20,669 --> 00:03:25,799
couple of major versions since last

00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:30,419
Capcom first 10 and then version 11

00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:33,660
shortly thereafter the CLI they recently

00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:35,190
released version 6 about 46 and they're

00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:37,230
working on a patch release with some

00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:38,310
loggin refactoring changes in there as

00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:42,150
well

00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:45,030
capi has continued work on sidecar

00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:46,470
support and they've been talking also to

00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:48,599
the ireenie team about what it might

00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:50,970
look like to support side by side

00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:54,269
operation of Diego and ireenie in the

00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:56,849
same environment along those lines of

00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:59,669
the networking team has done some

00:03:56,849 --> 00:04:01,500
internal reorganization and they're

00:03:59,669 --> 00:04:04,769
exploring some solutions that would

00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:08,159
support routing for environments that

00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:13,199
have both Bosh and kubernetes deployed

00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:15,690
components so again we'll see where

00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:17,430
folks talk about but if they've lifted

00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:19,530
some of the routing components onto the

00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:21,599
kubernetes cluster itself but for

00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:23,719
looking to evolve existing environments

00:04:21,599 --> 00:04:27,660
they'll have to be some sort of bridge

00:04:23,719 --> 00:04:29,970
and then finally volume services had a

00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:32,580
çf Deb recently were they and as their

00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:35,580
deprecating that ufs blame drivers and

00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:38,430
corresponding broker so they can put

00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:40,800
more weight behind both existing NFS

00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:42,870
broker which has a lot more

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:46,080
sophistication and also so they can

00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:48,450
start focusing on other ways to support

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:51,420
ireenie and kubernetes integrations and

00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:58,650
then finally uh friary stay on the call

00:04:51,420 --> 00:05:02,230
we hear a lot thank you Eric

00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:05,210
any question I guess no no I really for

00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:07,860
[Music]

00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:12,120
monitoring the chat also if you you want

00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:16,530
to push things there you can talk okay

00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:29,490
there's no questions we'll go to do we

00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:34,020
have anybody when it comes to the

00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:38,300
updates I'll try to get some info from

00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:41,520
the first factor we'll get there for

00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:43,950
extensions we have one kind of big

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:49,590
announcement and it's that Stratus

00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:51,780
finally graduated seems like it was a

00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:56,640
late bloomer actually it's just the

00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:58,110
process I think Neal was hesitant to put

00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:00,870
it there and he of course had some

00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:05,160
vacation but it's finally there it's

00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:07,620
graduated us in an email you know if you

00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:10,260
want to know anything about shadows he

00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:13,710
gave an update the last cab the cab

00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:15,720
before this one and it's very

00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:16,919
interesting because now they support or

00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:20,270
at least they are working to support

00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:22,650
kubernetes and he should them with that

00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:30,540
new you're on the call you wanna say

00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:32,180
something finally so we're we're looking

00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:35,460
for to that we're doing a lot of work on

00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:37,320
extensions so making refactoring the way

00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:39,930
that stratosphere is built making it

00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:41,790
easier to people to extend it for the

00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:44,240
kubernetes you mentioned to be

00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:46,979
publishing more using inflows of people

00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,020
we got a few sessions at the upcoming

00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:50,600
summit so if people are interested then

00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:53,910
come along then

00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:55,740
excellent Thank You Neil I think there

00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:59,009
are a few people with background noise

00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:01,770
so if you know it might be good to to go

00:06:59,009 --> 00:07:04,380
on a background a little bit all right

00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:07,650
cool thank you very much alright so and

00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:09,990
then besides that we have I think of few

00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:12,539
other projects that are retiring and

00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:14,340
also I've graduated I listed them so

00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:16,610
check those out

00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:22,680
so let's give as much time as we can for

00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:24,600
ireenie let me first ask Jules my

00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:27,780
colleague from IBM if he wants to say

00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:28,530
anything he spearheaded this all here

00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,020
anything

00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:33,449
so maybe Jules you do you have anything

00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:39,810
you want to say before we pass it to the

00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:47,070
team's presenting you know I'm always

00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:50,310
really actually on this occasion I'm not

00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:54,380
gonna talk hey Jules Oh Mario I think

00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:57,150
will do a much better job than me

00:07:54,380 --> 00:08:00,419
I'll take responsibility for the others

00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:03,560
world idea if it's bad and they can take

00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:07,050
responsibility but it's good about that

00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:11,430
excellent thank you all right so okay

00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:12,659

nitty-gritty details on Irina and

00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:25,830
they'll give an update on essentially

00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:28,050
here in itself and where it's going

00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:31,320
where it's at and what to expect and so

00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:34,289
on and then we'll have a talk by Vlad

00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:37,190

colleague Mario and we'll first start

00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:27,010
with a recap just to let you know what

00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:31,630
do you mean e is what it does what we

00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:33,580
did before the last arena update then we

00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:36,010
will talk about all the things we did in

00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:39,940
the last few months since the last bring

00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:42,730
the update till today and finally what's

00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:46,480
up next and what will come up next

00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:49,540
all right so Mary we'll start with a

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:52,150
wicked now right so I'm gonna keep this

00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:54,550
free quick basically I'm gonna tell you

00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:56,770
what I really look like looked like up

00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:59,620
till the previous summit in Philadelphia

00:09:56,770 --> 00:10:01,210
and if you happen to be completely

00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,830
oblivious to what everything isn't more

00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:06,190
like what it does it's basically

00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:08,530
bringing the CF Bush experience to Cadiz

00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:11,650
and how do we do this well this is how

00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:14,650
CF kind of looks like today you have

00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:16,390
Diego on the right the big goof bit and

00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:18,960
what we want to do what every knee is

00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:21,910
basically this just but kubernetes

00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:24,340
instead of Diego and have IV knee be a

00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:27,220
small little mapping layer between tile

00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:30,790
controller and kubernetes so what did we

00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:33,850
actually do up to that point well if you

00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:36,010
do a CF Bush then IV knee will create a

00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:38,170
stateful set in kubernetes which is

00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:40,570
gonna represent your app and then

00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:45,340
communities will actually schedule a

00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:48,310
instance of of that app if you see F

00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:50,080
scale the same thing we just changed

00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:51,870
replicas of that stateful set and

00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:55,570
communities will bring up all the

00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:57,700
instances that you want and if one of

00:10:55,570 --> 00:11:01,930
that those instances happens do you

00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:03,880
crash then it open it back up so how do

00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:05,770
we actually do the transition from

00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,360
droplets to images well the truth is

00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:09,430
that we actually have

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,380
everything whether to drop that's

00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:13,060
exactly the same so staging is the same

00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:15,850
and the differences that we have bit

00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:17,620
service serving as a registry which uses

00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:21,580
the droplets to actually serve images to

00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:24,250
Granny's so how do we do this well you

00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:26,140
do the cs Bush I mean guess the staging

00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:28,180
request and what it does is use that

00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:30,790
staging for us to create a job in

00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:32,320
communities which will create a pod and

00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:35,800
that board is actually running the

00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:38,350
staging process so it will produce

00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:40,810
droplets and when it's done it will put

00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:42,910
it back in control or so but service can

00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:45,310
have access to it but how this actually

00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:48,550
with service use the droplets you play

00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:51,100
the image well we just use the droplet

00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:53,200
as a the topmost layer of the image and

00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:55,360
the rest of the image is what we call

00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:59,980
tearing FS which is a small little

00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:02,470
wrapper of CF Linux FS 3 this time

00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:06,550
around it was to back at Summit but we

00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:08,800
upgrade it and this will also contain a

00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:10,960
little binary which will actually show

00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,850
later which will actually run the

00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:14,710
droplets the same way that Diego does it

00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:17,020
so it's the same absolutely same code

00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:20,020
and how does communities actually

00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:22,150
reference this image well it gets URL

00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:24,460
and it's running two-bit serviced so

00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:28,450
it's it will actually treated there's

00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:32,860
any other duck registry out there cool

00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:35,260
so next we the logs we used flew in D

00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:37,090
which was data collection to we deploy

00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:39,760
it on every single node and in the

00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:42,280
kubernetes cluster it's actually look at

00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,290
the container logs from the runtime and

00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:47,500
send them over to logger Gators so when

00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:52,020
you do see if logs it's you get logs of

00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:56,230
the applications we did routing using

00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:58,990
events based API in renée's which will

00:12:56,230 --> 00:13:01,600
actually send over an events to things

00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:04,750
that we call emitters and for example if

00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,970
you have an app instance up and running

00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:08,410
that will generate an event will get

00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:11,490
that event in the router manner and

00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:14,980
using the apps IP will construct a

00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:16,570
register new route message in a girl

00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:20,950
router so you can actually route to your

00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:23,170
app and if that app dies

00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:24,760
that also generates an event and the

00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:29,589
barometer well do you register that

00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:31,839
route so it's to go rather doesn't route

00:13:29,589 --> 00:13:33,190
traffic to apps that are that can't

00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:37,959
handle it

00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:40,720
we did events I mean crash events the in

00:13:37,959 --> 00:13:43,149
a very similar way again if an app

00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,490
crashes it will generate an event and

00:13:43,149 --> 00:13:48,399
using that event we create and a crash

00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:51,010
event in cloud controller we do this

00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:53,500
because when you do CF app Dora for

00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:54,880
example it lists instances and this will

00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,250
tell you which instances actually

00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:00,070
crashed

00:13:56,250 --> 00:14:04,149
lastly we did metrics and we used to use

00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:07,269
heap store service for this but that got

00:14:04,149 --> 00:14:11,290
deprecated so now use metrics server it

00:14:07,269 --> 00:14:13,089
works similarly you just get the metrics

00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:15,459
from that server and emit them to

00:14:13,089 --> 00:14:18,339
Doppler so when you do CF African you

00:14:15,459 --> 00:14:21,250
can see how much your application is

00:14:18,339 --> 00:14:25,380
consuming and I think that was pretty

00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:30,459
fast so let's move on to new things

00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:33,130
alright so a big topic and what we

00:14:30,459 --> 00:14:35,320
focused on was security in the last

00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:38,079
month since the less updates so let's

00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:41,380
take a look what we did there first

00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:43,360
thing was connections so basically

00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:45,760
having secure connections to all the

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,320
components you really communicates to

00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,740
you so this is basically the cloud

00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:53,740
controller and the bit service the

00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:55,779
registry part in that case so we had a

00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:58,690
TLS from the cloud controller - araignee

00:14:55,779 --> 00:15:01,360
and also the other way around and also

00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:03,899
we had a TLS to the bit service registry

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,190
and we also added basic authentication

00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:09,910
so you need a user and a password to

00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:13,600
actually pull images from the bit

00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:18,490
service registry part but we also

00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:21,660
focused on the CF application side so

00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:23,889
previously we're able to reach other

00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:27,310
applications within the arena namespace

00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:29,680
directly from your application that you

00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:31,660
pushed and also you were able to reach

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:34,670
the kubernetes master and API and

00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:37,100
everything and we just

00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:39,020
don't allow that anymore so you cannot

00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:41,570
reach any other application nor the

00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:43,280
kubernetes master or the API or anything

00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:46,160
anymore

00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:48,010
of course you can still reach other

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:51,170
applications through the internet but

00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:55,310
Tyra Texas is not possible until we

00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:58,130
don't apply the container to container

00:15:55,310 --> 00:16:02,810
networking which will be a feature in

00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:08,740
the future all right next thing we

00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:12,440
focused on was secure staging we had one

00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:14,570
staging job and which was performing the

00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:17,120
whole staging process which is download

00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:18,920
builds so download the app it's built a

00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,050
droplet and upload the droplet back to

00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:24,200
the blobstore and that happened all in

00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:28,940
one pot and a problem was that this pot

00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:34,850
had all the secrets and so what we did

00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:38,390
to improve that we split up the the

00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:40,370
staging in in three different steps each

00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:42,830
step is happening in a separate

00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:45,920
container so first container downloads

00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:48,620
the app it's from the blobstore it

00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:50,660
provides it to the next container which

00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:52,940
is performing the build of the droplet

00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:56,260
and this is them handing over the

00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:59,840
droplets to the next container which is

00:16:56,260 --> 00:17:01,850
uploading it to back to the blobstore so

00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:05,860
that way the build step doesn't have any

00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:05,860
access anymore to any secrets

00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:12,920
next part is the root of s patching now

00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:15,350
you're able to dynamically patch the

00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:18,290
root of s let's say you're the operator

00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:21,020
of your Cloud Foundry and Irina

00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:24,319
kubernetes cluster and you want to use a

00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:26,140
specific with the best version and what

00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:28,940
you would do as an operator you would

00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:31,160
update your home chart with the for the

00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:33,590
best version of your choice and you

00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:36,050
would perform the helm upgrades and helm

00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:39,740
would up would update the rooted best

00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:43,850
version label on rainy and the bit

00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:46,220
service which will cause a restart of

00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:48,680
these components and now all

00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:51,020
applications that are newly pushed to

00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:54,020
kubernetes will have to knew where the

00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:56,210
desperation but there of course also the

00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:59,630
applications that are already scheduled

00:17:56,210 --> 00:18:01,460
by Rini and there's the third component

00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:05,470
that comes in here that's the route as

00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:07,880
patcher so it waits till on upgrade till

00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:14,960
till the bit service is back up again

00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:16,460
and then it updates all the applications

00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,620
with the right word the best version and

00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:20,780
make sure to restart them so that all

00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:22,610
applications pull the right image from

00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:25,210
the bit service and this is something

00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:30,460
that will all demo quickly and this will

00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:34,820
marry perform on his computer rights so

00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:37,400
here we have Cloud Foundry deployed with

00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:39,350
the CF and emini on the left and on the

00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:42,650
right we actually have some applications

00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:44,150
already pushed and what I'm gonna do now

00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:46,790
is show you the route fast that's

00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:49,430
actually being deployed when I get all

00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:54,710
the zoom things out of the way so if we

00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:59,990
edit this spot or I mean we can see that

00:18:54,710 --> 00:19:05,170
in in the labels we have the first

00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:09,230
version which is version 80 1.00 and

00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:12,410
just so we can compare the actual route

00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:16,460
fast when we swap it I'm gonna say to

00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:19,530
that container I'm gonna do sha-256 some

00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:23,880
on this file

00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:25,230
and we can see that it's one CC 159

00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,540
something something something this is

00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:30,870
actually the launcher which launches the

00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:33,660
droplet so let's say we're an operator

00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:35,970
and we decide that version 81 is

00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:38,280
insecure now it has some phone but if T

00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:41,220
and we want to actually change that

00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:43,260
version so how do we do that well we're

00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:46,320
gonna open up the values file that we

00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:49,260
use for helm for deploying irony and

00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:51,960
I've put here the root first version up

00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:55,140
top so this 81 is now insecure let's

00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:58,860
change it with 84 which we know is a

00:19:55,140 --> 00:20:01,740
good version so if I helm upgrades my

00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:06,900
deployment it will actually do the

00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:09,330
things that you said if it works today

00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:10,950
it does so it's gonna restart that

00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:13,350
service we can see it's restarting it's

00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:15,180
restarting ireenie and you can also

00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:17,970
notice this root fast but your job over

00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:21,350
here virtually for which we started our

00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:26,910
containers on the right so they already

00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:29,990
started so if I go into door again we

00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:36,320
can see that version is version 84 and

00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:40,050
if is SH that Dora and do sha-256 some

00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:43,380
lifecycle launch you can see that now

00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:46,250
the Shah is be 177 something something

00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:47,550
something so it actually does apply the

00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:50,400
FS

00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:53,060
now there is a small bug that we

00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:57,000
actually caught two hours ago before

00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:58,830
before this kepco and you actually need

00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,670
to get you actually need to manually

00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:05,610
restart the applications to get director

00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:08,610
Rufus bonus points if you actually spot

00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:11,840
the bug we all go into it but yeah we're

00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:14,840
working on fixing that so back to the

00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,840
presentation

00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:26,240
okay next part is Container security

00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:28,050
what we wanted to do is to have the same

00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,240
security container security

00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:37,220
configuration as garden has today in

00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:41,370
Diego and so that's we had a table with

00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:44,580
parameters that garden already compared

00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:48,570
to kubernetes and based on that we had

00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:50,640
to applied for a meet you and we had

00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:52,380
like three parameters we had to focused

00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:56,100
on so the first one was the second

00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:57,560
filtering enable it which is basically a

00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:59,850
white listing for syscalls

00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:02,940
the next thing we had to enable in

00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:05,970
kubernetes was that a container cannot

00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:08,970
get any new privileges and finally we

00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:13,190
also had to enable disk quotas so that

00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:13,190
we can set this quotas for containers

00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:21,809
then the next part I want to talk about

00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:27,059
is the resource limits we just mentioned

00:22:21,809 --> 00:22:30,330
the disk quotas so far we hard-coded to

00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:34,200
disk quota to 2 gigabytes but we just

00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:38,190
today started the story to make that

00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:41,700
configurable we are CFC Li and CPU and

00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:44,190
memory is already configured by the CFC

00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:46,860
Li so you can set it however you want

00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:52,460
previously we had kubernetes default

00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:54,720
which is limitless so next part

00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:57,950
scalability we did some scalability

00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:01,350
testing and actually we had free

00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:03,509
deployment scenarios two of them were

00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:07,559
performed by us the arena team and the

00:23:03,509 --> 00:23:11,570
third one was performed by a guy from sa

00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:16,529
P and he actually did the biggest

00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:19,490
environments with 250 nodes and 40,000

00:23:16,529 --> 00:23:22,230
app that he perhaps that he pushed on

00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:27,419
SCF based deployment with vallini

00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:30,179
on gke and we had one scenario where the

00:23:27,419 --> 00:23:32,490
both deployed CF that was pointing to an

00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:35,039
external kubernetes cluster on gke and

00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:38,340
we also did some performance testing

00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:41,730
with a SEF based deployment with Iranian

00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:43,590
Ike yes for the boss deployed scenario

00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:48,000
we had thousand apps that we pushed on

00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:52,799
21 nodes and for the IKS scenario we had

00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:56,070
200 apps that we pushed on 10 nodes so

00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:59,909
of course we had some issues we expected

00:23:56,070 --> 00:24:04,529
that and some issues we fixed right away

00:23:59,909 --> 00:24:07,889
was routing we had problems that the

00:24:04,529 --> 00:24:09,570
routing was scaling and many routes were

00:24:07,889 --> 00:24:12,299
dropped you were not able to reach your

00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:15,750
apps anymore also metrics did not show

00:24:12,299 --> 00:24:18,179
up and the lock related kept crashing so

00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:21,299
that no locks showed up

00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:23,190
but this three problems were fixed and

00:24:21,299 --> 00:24:27,150
the remainings in the remaining issues

00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:29,970
you basically have how upgrades or up

00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:32,990
grades on community communities itself

00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:36,660
if you update master or worker notes so

00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:40,290
you have some larger downtime on your

00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:42,540
applications and also the routing for

00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:44,510
some apps might be gone so we have to

00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:47,400
investigate there a little bit more

00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:51,570
second one which was actually fixed this

00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:57,000
week I think yesterday we had a short

00:24:51,570 --> 00:25:00,330
period of 500 two's on upgrades so when

00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:02,760
you try to reach up you saw a 502 for a

00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:04,920
few seconds and then you were able to

00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:06,630
reach up again and that was because of

00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:10,190
the asynchronous update that with the

00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:13,950
that do we need us with the routes then

00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:16,500
I'm not arena related issue we had but

00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:20,790
it's a community's issue that you cannot

00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:22,950
push more than 14-thousand stateful sets

00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:24,270
to a Goodwin 8's cluster so kubernetes

00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:28,470
prevents you from doing that

00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:31,550
and finally we discovered this that bit

00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:34,020
service was the weakest part in

00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:35,760
performance testing so it has this high

00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:39,740
load it has to deal with all the blobs

00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:44,970
and also it needs to turn all the

00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:48,080
droplets into OCI images so it's very

00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:51,030
square was there was a bottleneck there

00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:54,570
all right that's what we have about

00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:57,780
scalability and updates so what's next

00:25:54,570 --> 00:26:02,220
Mario right so ireenie

00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:04,140
recently had its first inception and one

00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:07,350
of the things that we decided we wanted

00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:10,559
to move forward to is migration so

00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:13,350
getting people migrated from Diego to I

00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:16,650
mean II and this is something that we

00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:19,050
haven't done yet we like Eric said

00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:21,630
previously that we have been in talks

00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:24,660
with Cappy to make this a smooth

00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:27,150
transition and we have several ideas on

00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:31,380
how this could happen for example using

00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:33,510
a flag in in the CF CLI to tell traffic

00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:36,540
controller this app is for I mean this

00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:39,090
app is for Diego or using isolation

00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:40,860
segments for ebony but again this is

00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:42,600
something that we are

00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:46,019
towards and something that you would

00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:48,419
have to look forward to another thing

00:26:46,019 --> 00:26:51,510
that we're working on is making Bosch

00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:55,110
and I we work together more nicely now

00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:57,929
there is a community maintain

00:26:55,110 --> 00:27:01,440
bas-reliefs for every knee we rather

00:26:57,929 --> 00:27:04,980
better make a really kind of independent

00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:08,220
from how you deploy CF so just plug in

00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:10,350
into your kubernetes cluster and it

00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:13,159
wouldn't matter if it's abortion Floyd

00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:15,659
or containerized CF it would just work

00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:20,669
but this is something we're still

00:27:15,659 --> 00:27:22,799
spiking and working towards and that's

00:27:20,669 --> 00:27:25,980
pretty much it I just wanted to mention

00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:31,830
that we have regular releases on our

00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:36,690
Irene release github repo they they're

00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:38,130
mostly weekly but not always so that's a

00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:40,049
place where you should go if you want to

00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:43,529
actually try out the Rini and there's of

00:27:40,049 --> 00:27:46,200
course instructions on how to do that

00:27:43,529 --> 00:27:49,830
we have also office hours happening

00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:54,720
every first Monday of the month at 10:30

00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:56,309
a.m. Eastern Time I'll post a link to

00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,220
this blog post so you can get the zoom

00:27:56,309 --> 00:28:01,950
link or you can just go over to I mean

00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:04,200
def in the cloud control Cloud Foundry

00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:07,620
stack so you can get that link from

00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:08,700
there so if you have any questions you

00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:10,860
want to tell us how much you like a

00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:13,409
weenie or hate it or you just want to

00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:16,110
chat with the team but we have to have

00:28:13,409 --> 00:28:18,450
you and that's the of course it's not

00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:21,240
just us this is the entire enemy team in

00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:26,039
which to reach them on Twitter and of

00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:28,440
course the air we have stack channel so

00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:30,419
that should be it

00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:34,679
thanks for sticking with us and if you

00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:39,019
have any questions those the time yeah

00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:42,210
thank you very much more you and Jules

00:28:39,019 --> 00:28:45,750
if you have questions speak now taste it

00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:47,870
and chat and we'll try to repeat it for

00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,870
you

00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:54,710
Mario essential a private message asking

00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:57,350
a question about one of your slides

00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:59,740
just looked like was by old information

00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:59,740
in it

00:29:00,349 --> 00:29:04,979
Your Honor I repeat the question then

00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:13,080
the question was showed there was gold

00:29:04,979 --> 00:29:16,559
1.7 and tunnel 14 yeah I mean it's an

00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:18,989
old slide it's a no I think it's just an

00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:21,599
arbitrary version even I think the main

00:29:18,989 --> 00:29:25,019
point is that it's just CF Linux of s3

00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:28,190
and whatever is in there it's but we'll

00:29:25,019 --> 00:29:34,039
update it for the photo summit Thanks

00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:36,629
cool any other questions this is all

00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:40,679
extracting news and developments thanks

00:29:36,629 --> 00:29:43,799
everybody this is awesome Thank You

00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:46,609
Smith all right any anything else

00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:50,729
because we have a we have a good agenda

00:29:46,609 --> 00:29:54,179
other things to get to but I want to

00:29:50,729 --> 00:29:56,159
thank you again Mario and Jules for a

00:29:54,179 --> 00:29:57,779
great update I really like the first few

00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:58,829
slides where you kind of showed how it

00:29:57,779 --> 00:30:01,469
actually works

00:29:58,829 --> 00:30:06,269
but with pictures so that's kind of nice

00:30:01,469 --> 00:30:09,029
for everybody and and good update so I

00:30:06,269 --> 00:30:12,389
guess you guys as you mentioned you will

00:30:09,029 --> 00:30:14,359
have an even deeper dive at summit so if

00:30:12,389 --> 00:30:16,829
you want one more reason to go to summit

00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:18,599
this is it and in that way you can

00:30:16,829 --> 00:30:19,739
actually spend some time and talk to

00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:24,269
them and see them in person

00:30:19,739 --> 00:30:28,349
so more opportunities ok so last call

00:30:24,269 --> 00:30:29,429
for questions okay excellent so thank

00:30:28,349 --> 00:30:32,190
you guys

00:30:29,429 --> 00:30:35,399
let me pass it to Morgan he actually

00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:37,859
joined a little bit late but he pasted

00:30:35,399 --> 00:30:39,989
some updates on what's going on in Bosh

00:30:37,859 --> 00:30:42,959
let's give him maybe two or three

00:30:39,989 --> 00:30:47,450
minutes to to give those highlights and

00:30:42,959 --> 00:30:51,839
maybe field some questions hey Morgan

00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:54,690
sure sorry good morning I think the most

00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:56,339
interesting thing is we've cut a new

00:30:54,690 --> 00:31:01,169
director so to 70.5

00:30:56,339 --> 00:31:02,669
and CEO I version six one of the big

00:31:01,169 --> 00:31:04,739
things which we heard a lot is folks

00:31:02,669 --> 00:31:06,329
have a deployment and then they try to

00:31:04,739 --> 00:31:08,309
upgrade that deployment and something

00:31:06,329 --> 00:31:10,739
fails and then they want to do recreate

00:31:08,309 --> 00:31:13,019
or start or stop and then their entire

00:31:10,739 --> 00:31:14,130
deployment gets rolled back and then

00:31:13,019 --> 00:31:16,169
they're like hey bashed

00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:20,250
what the hell would she just undo all

00:31:16,169 --> 00:31:23,220
the stuff I did so as of those versions

00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:26,400
there's a new flag on the CLI which is

00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:28,410
no conversion and if you add that it

00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:30,299
will actually only touch the thing

00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:33,000
you're trying to touch and not roll back

00:31:30,299 --> 00:31:34,140
to the entire deployment so we really

00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,270
want to get a lot of feedback on that

00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:37,830
and see where it breaks and where it

00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:41,010
doesn't break and if it's working for

00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:42,510
folks we expect it to help a lot but I'm

00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:48,870
trying to get folks to know about it and

00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:52,740
use it well thank you yeah it's been a

00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:55,409
long requested one the other interesting

00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:57,990
one is a lot of development teams will

00:31:55,409 --> 00:32:00,720
upload bosch DNS or something in a

00:31:57,990 --> 00:32:03,000
runtime config and then their pipelines

00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,950
will run clean up - - all and then the

00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,010
next time they run they will break

00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:10,470
because we cleaned up releases that were

00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:13,080
specified in a runtime configuration at

00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:15,030
appointment so as of that release

00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:17,280
releases that are included in a runtime

00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:19,950
config but might not be included in a

00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:21,990
deployment will be marked as in use so

00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:24,000
you won't actually delete them when

00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:27,630
you're cleaning up all your old blobs

00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:30,120
and then the last kind of exciting one

00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:31,890
that folks have been asking for is being

00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:34,380
able to configure the length of your

00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:36,360
certificate expiration when you're

00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:39,570
setting Bosch create ends so in the

00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:42,000
directors manifest then there's a few

00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:44,940
other notes the doc if people want to

00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,500
read it but I think those are the

00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:50,760
highlights I know there's a packed

00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:53,039
agenda excellent Thank You Morgan and

00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:56,120
Wayne for the entertainment I guess

00:32:53,039 --> 00:33:02,940
there's some Bush fanatics out there

00:32:56,120 --> 00:33:04,320
good to know smart ones so if you have

00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:06,360
any question for Morgan this is your

00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:10,169
chance otherwise we're gonna pass it -

00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:13,289
glad let me see if there's anything on

00:33:10,169 --> 00:33:16,140
the chat okay nothing on the chat

00:33:13,289 --> 00:33:19,470
thank you again Morgan all right so the

00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:23,549
next and the last call the last talk I

00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:25,049
guess but on the beast is vlad yuna i'm

00:33:23,549 --> 00:33:28,529
gonna mispronounce your last name so

00:33:25,049 --> 00:33:30,900
sorry about that but Vlad is from Essie

00:33:28,529 --> 00:33:33,440
he does a lot of things if you've never

00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:39,150
met him he's a fantastic person to meet

00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:41,789
just and he is gonna talk about Irina

00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:45,720
axe latest project tell us about it flat

00:33:41,789 --> 00:33:49,490
what's going on okay thank dr. mark just

00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:51,870
a correction I'm from Susan another city

00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:55,529
I'm so sorry about that

00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:57,779
no we're just going to quickly talk

00:33:55,529 --> 00:34:02,340
about irony X I'm sorry I don't have a

00:33:57,779 --> 00:34:04,169
demo at or who works much more on irony

00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:07,230
X than I do

00:34:04,169 --> 00:34:09,359
you had a laptop emergency something

00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:14,040
died with the thing and now you need to

00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:15,929
fix it so I'm just going to quickly tell

00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:17,429
you what I really X is and then point

00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:20,330
you in the right direction if you want

00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:22,619
to start building stuff or contribute to

00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:29,190
to the extensions that we've already

00:34:22,619 --> 00:34:32,339
built so we wanted a way to extend what

00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:35,639
I really does without putting more load

00:34:32,339 --> 00:34:38,220
on the irony core team they have a lot

00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:42,270
on their plate and we wanted to support

00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:44,510
some some other features that really

00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:49,800
don't need to be inside of the core

00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:51,899
ireenie project examples include percy

00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:56,520
support so the ability to mount

00:34:51,899 --> 00:35:01,140
persistent volumes in an application so

00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:04,980
you can imagine PVCs being created and

00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:09,210
then being mounted in the containers of

00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:12,540
application bots created by ireenie we

00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:18,000
also wanted to have application ssh OCFS

00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:20,550
ssh to an app and we also discovered

00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:25,440
that we could improve the way that we do

00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:28,050
logging with these extensions so if

00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:30,119
you're building I'm sure there's some

00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:31,970
background noise I hope everyone can

00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:36,320
tell me hear me okay

00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:40,080
yeah it's pretty good okay

00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:41,880
so while trying to build these

00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:43,980
extensions we realized that there's a

00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:46,860
lot of common functionality that we

00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:50,520
could put inside of a library a go

00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:52,910
package so this is what irony exits it's

00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:55,500
a bunch of code that helps you write

00:35:52,910 --> 00:36:02,160
extensions specifically for irony

00:35:55,500 --> 00:36:05,070
by by writing a lot of the code that

00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:07,710
you'd have to repeat so the main

00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:14,100
mechanism we use to extend what I really

00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:16,860
does are kubernetes web hooks they use

00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:20,820
these to mutate the pods that I really

00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:24,060
create creates and we also have Watchers

00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:27,420
so you get notified when an application

00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:29,850
is being created or deleted so this

00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:32,850
common functionality is very useful when

00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:36,840
you're trying to extend right so for

00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:42,690
example the admission web hooks we use

00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:47,910
them for Percy support so what happens

00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:50,990
as mario and jules describe Cloud

00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:53,370
Foundry the controller and all of the

00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:55,170
internals will tell Irena to create an

00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:57,390
application I really will go to

00:36:55,170 --> 00:37:00,800
kubernetes it'll create a pixel set and

00:36:57,390 --> 00:37:03,440
then a pod will be created in kubernetes

00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:06,360
what happens with the extension is that

00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:09,480
we tell kubernetes that we want to

00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:12,020
register a web hook so that whenever a

00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:15,930
pod in a specific name space is created

00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:18,330
we want to be notified so well not just

00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:19,230
notified we actually want to mutate that

00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:24,240
definition

00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:26,210
so once the pod wants to be created but

00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:29,790
before any containers are created

00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:32,490
kubernetes will call the extension first

00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:36,480
and we have a chance to mutate the pause

00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:40,860
before any container gets created so in

00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:46,020
the case of Percy the mutation is that

00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:49,110
we add volume mounts to the pot so we

00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:51,630
have this I really

00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:56,700
the broker that actually worked with

00:37:51,630 --> 00:38:00,570
kubernetes storage classes so ucf create

00:37:56,700 --> 00:38:03,780
a service which results in a BBC being

00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:07,110
created for you you bind that to the

00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:10,050
application and then this extension will

00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:14,970
mutate the application pods and add

00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:17,790
volume mounts so this is this is how it

00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:21,390
worked and the library kind of does

00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:25,140
everything for you it sets up an HTTP

00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:27,390
server generates certificates it creates

00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:31,470
those certificates as secrets in

00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:33,150
kubernetes it creates the web the

00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:35,970
mutation web hook configuration that

00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:39,300
kubernetes needs all of that it also

00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:42,780
sets up watchers if you need that so all

00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:46,230
you need to do is just start a main you

00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:49,290
know may not go and then import this

00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:52,470
this package write a few lines and then

00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:54,680
you're ready to extend what i really

00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:54,680
does

00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:04,750
okay so I think I can move on from how

00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:08,620
does it work and just point you to more

00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:12,490
resources the library can be found that

00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:16,870
to the slash I really X on github we

00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:19,840
have three extensions so far Percy and

00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:22,450
logging they are already done so you

00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:26,770
could actually cut them out

00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:29,440
Percy like I said is for supporting with

00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:31,810
persistent storage in your apps

00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:35,140
it worked hand in hand with I really

00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:38,730
Percy broker then we have an extension

00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:43,870
for logging this replaces the fluency

00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:47,860
solution that's in irony core what we do

00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:51,910
here is we watch for the application

00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:54,580
pods that get created by a greeny and

00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:56,920
then we use the coordinating API that

00:39:54,580 --> 00:40:00,610
stream logs and then forward them

00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:02,950
directly to to the logger Gator so we

00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:05,650
kind of act like the Alegre Gator agent

00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:08,830
that specifically understands how to

00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:12,610
read ordinary spots from from

00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:14,620
coordinates and then finally we're

00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:18,010
working on at the page this is in

00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:19,870
progress right now so you know if you

00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:24,580
want to help out we'd love that

00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:28,690
and two more things there's a blog post

00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:29,620
that Ettore wrote which takes you you

00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:32,050
know top to bottom

00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:34,900
it explains every step that you need to

00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:37,690
do to write your own extension starting

00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:42,010
from romaine and finishing with a helmet

00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:45,460
so entering you can follow that that

00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:50,290
tutorial and build your own of your own

00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:53,980
extension finally we have a target from

00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:57,550
it at the Europe summit Ettore will be

00:40:53,980 --> 00:41:03,130
there will demo all of these things that

00:40:57,550 --> 00:41:07,330
I've talked about and yeah if you want

00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:13,020
to learn more please join us there

00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:13,020
and that's all I have yeah sorry right

00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:19,630
Thank You Vlad and uh pronounce your

00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:23,260
last name you've an of exclusive that's

00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:24,700
perfect apologies again alright so let's

00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:25,960
see if you haven't you have any question

00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:27,490
I have one question for you but let's

00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:32,430
see if other people have questions for

00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:35,680
you any questions for glad

00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:39,340
so Simon murdered you you can't speak or

00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:41,770
do you want me to say for you didn't you

00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:43,810
hear me yeah we can hear you Simon go

00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:46,630
for it I I was trying to speak earlier

00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:47,920
to by the sounding what's broken okay so

00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:50,500
the question for flood that I'm having

00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:52,840
is so this is great I mean certainly

00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:55,780
super helps to speed up you know all the

00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:58,710
features into the Irene that we need but

00:41:55,780 --> 00:42:00,940
do you guys have any kind of plans to

00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:03,280
eventually move that back to mainland

00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:05,320
ireenie at one point in time or is this

00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:09,790
going to become a permanent solution as

00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:12,160
you see fit so I think Jules can also

00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:14,440
chime in here I've had a bunch of talks

00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:18,070
with him about this we do want to do

00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:21,880
that at some point want to move I really

00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:24,700
X over but we do acknowledge that it's

00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:26,530
going to take some time we want to make

00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:30,160
sure that these extensions work

00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:33,370
correctly first and then you know after

00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:36,850
they get some mileage we can move pieces

00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:39,700
over so I think the long-term vision is

00:42:36,850 --> 00:42:44,410
that yes I at least I really X would

00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:47,680
become part of core and then the all of

00:42:44,410 --> 00:42:50,530
these side projects can stay as side

00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:54,270
projects for example Percy and SSH

00:42:50,530 --> 00:43:01,300
perhaps logging can actually replace

00:42:54,270 --> 00:43:03,160
fluency in core okay the other thing I'd

00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:06,790
add to that I think that's a perfect

00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:08,380
answer one thing one of the reasons it

00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:10,840
weenie X I think is really really good

00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:13,150
and important is it means all the

00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:15,790
different teams potentially in compounds

00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:17,800
you can ship their things in a way that

00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:19,720
actually even though it's called arena X

00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:21,370
nothing really to do with the really way

00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:24,040
it's like it will work with any

00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:26,290
application however you push it whether

00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:29,470
it was a weenie or not so if you use

00:43:26,290 --> 00:43:32,110
like the percy broker that they have you

00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:34,240
now have the percy functionality whether

00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:37,320
or not you use your weenie so now Percy

00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:40,330
can be in front of deep cut hold useful

00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:42,220
component so I think I think what we're

00:43:40,330 --> 00:43:43,420
hoping is all these lay at the moment

00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:45,880
we've got these projects to fill the

00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:47,920
gaps I'm hoping that all the various

00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:49,990
kind of foundry teams over time will

00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:51,910
start to ship kind of on top of

00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:55,750
something like in really X and probably

00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:58,840
iridium I think this is like super cool

00:43:55,750 --> 00:44:00,640
and we we definitely want to have it be

00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:04,930
supported in core eventually when it

00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:06,520
stabilizes I was I was more the only

00:44:04,930 --> 00:44:09,070
other thing that I was worried Emma's

00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:11,770
questioning is so for example as its age

00:44:09,070 --> 00:44:14,800
to me today is kind of like a core

00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:17,230
functionality of right hungry in order

00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:19,030
to do that now going forward I have to

00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:21,460
get you know I really need a stress

00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:23,470
ireenie x plus the ssh extension so i

00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:25,780
have to do before you 3 think instead of

00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:27,820
one as i do today which is from an

00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:28,600
operator perspective more complicated

00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:31,390
than that

00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:33,610
that's my main concern right so yeah

00:44:31,390 --> 00:44:36,360
this is exactly what I mean at the

00:44:33,610 --> 00:44:39,220
moment before it really SSA just a

00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:40,450
separate project while I'm hoping will

00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:42,700
happen and we've started some

00:44:40,450 --> 00:44:47,020
discussions about this is that Diego

00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:49,510
will ship an arene e ssh right and so

00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:52,540
will be the core teams will expose the

00:44:49,510 --> 00:44:55,450
core features in this way and then

00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:57,910
hopefully what will happen is we'll have

00:44:55,450 --> 00:45:01,120
basically a CF deployment like thing

00:44:57,910 --> 00:45:03,270
which will give you the tested set of

00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:06,640
extensions that all work together in one

00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:08,920
package so - rather than idea really

00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:10,140
repo has to have everything in the same

00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:12,329
way is right now in

00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:14,549
found you but all these different bosch

00:45:12,329 --> 00:45:17,779
releases the work together hopefully

00:45:14,549 --> 00:45:20,119
you'll have all these different 3d acts

00:45:17,779 --> 00:45:24,510
together

00:45:20,119 --> 00:45:28,470
one more thing I think that's perfect

00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:30,750
and I think yet the goal is we don't

00:45:28,470 --> 00:45:32,490
want to keep you know we want we want

00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:35,910
eventually all of these to move to the

00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:38,329
cloud foundry org you know and it just I

00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:40,740
just thought maybe we could have a

00:45:38,329 --> 00:45:44,660
meeting of sorts and summit to discuss

00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:44,660
specifically this maybe

00:45:45,319 --> 00:45:52,219
cup everyone yeah so I I think I think

00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:55,670
this is this is interesting I think it's

00:45:52,219 --> 00:45:58,449
big dreams but there's only a an aspect

00:45:55,670 --> 00:46:01,609
of it that could probably move fast

00:45:58,449 --> 00:46:05,719
these are extensions to the run time so

00:46:01,609 --> 00:46:09,140
maybe you know people like you know Eric

00:46:05,719 --> 00:46:10,880
and Yui or the right person to talk to

00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:13,759
but some of those that could be

00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:15,709
extensions outside of the run time I'd

00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:18,729
be happy to consider them and PMC

00:46:15,709 --> 00:46:21,499
extensions especially if they can be

00:46:18,729 --> 00:46:24,769
self-contained and we can maybe move

00:46:21,499 --> 00:46:26,239
them to incubator and so on so there's

00:46:24,769 --> 00:46:27,499
lots of discussion there but this is

00:46:26,239 --> 00:46:30,170
this is great

00:46:27,499 --> 00:46:32,449
I don't know Eric you wonder called you

00:46:30,170 --> 00:46:35,680
do you want to chime in in this in terms

00:46:32,449 --> 00:46:35,680
of how to move forward

00:46:36,519 --> 00:46:42,319
he might have dropped to so I don't know

00:46:39,039 --> 00:46:44,479
let's see yeah he might have dropped all

00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:46,759
right but I guess summit is gonna be a

00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:50,420
good place to figure out how to move

00:46:46,759 --> 00:46:52,670
forward on this any other questions I

00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:54,949
have I have a one question that's more

00:46:52,670 --> 00:46:56,779
that's a little bit different than the

00:46:54,949 --> 00:46:58,549
discussion having here but any question

00:46:56,779 --> 00:47:01,670
or comment on this particular discussion

00:46:58,549 --> 00:47:07,699
about extensions and how to organize

00:47:01,670 --> 00:47:10,309
them and move forward no okay cool so my

00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:12,529
question I guess Vlad and Jules is with

00:47:10,309 --> 00:47:14,959
this extension mechanism is there any

00:47:12,529 --> 00:47:17,119
part of you Eenie that would not be

00:47:14,959 --> 00:47:20,059
extension because it seemed very generic

00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:21,789
where you could essentially enter like

00:47:20,059 --> 00:47:25,849
you could put your extension in between

00:47:21,789 --> 00:47:27,380
kubernetes and uranium jam things so

00:47:25,849 --> 00:47:29,979
what are the kind of things that you

00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:32,390
would not want to have extensions for I

00:47:29,979 --> 00:47:33,979
think that's a really good I said an

00:47:32,390 --> 00:47:35,269
important question and we're figuring

00:47:33,979 --> 00:47:38,119
out that line

00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:41,569
I won't go an example of that the

00:47:38,119 --> 00:47:44,839
logging the you see that we started

00:47:41,569 --> 00:47:46,849
discussing merging that into the core

00:47:44,839 --> 00:47:49,699
emini because we currently have a

00:47:46,849 --> 00:47:52,729
logging approach in the court arena it's

00:47:49,699 --> 00:47:54,739
not as good as this extension so we're

00:47:52,729 --> 00:47:56,869
hoping to replace it and I think like

00:47:54,739 --> 00:47:58,910
then there's like a core set of things

00:47:56,869 --> 00:48:01,970
and that we just think

00:47:58,910 --> 00:48:07,339
should be in the core and we want to

00:48:01,970 --> 00:48:08,960
with with the extensions approach and

00:48:07,339 --> 00:48:13,099
then and then things that you add on I

00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:16,369
think I think part of it will be kind of

00:48:13,099 --> 00:48:18,859
Conway's law if there's if we can form a

00:48:16,369 --> 00:48:20,690
team around the faith then if that team

00:48:18,859 --> 00:48:24,230
ships as an extension we don't have to

00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:25,990
be PR in one mono repo or something but

00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:28,309
I think I think it's kind of probably

00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:32,720
that honest answer is is it's gonna

00:48:28,309 --> 00:48:34,190
mostly you know if it's one of the main

00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:35,690
reasons essentially is so that we can

00:48:34,190 --> 00:48:38,000
scale right the number of people that

00:48:35,690 --> 00:48:39,619
can contribute when we all have like

00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:44,240
these small teams that we like in

00:48:39,619 --> 00:48:45,770
clarity so I think that's gonna be part

00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:47,630
of the line if there's already a team

00:48:45,770 --> 00:48:49,579
around it and already contacts that we

00:48:47,630 --> 00:48:51,410
don't want to have on the core team then

00:48:49,579 --> 00:48:53,720
it should be an extension but then

00:48:51,410 --> 00:48:57,049
something like logging that's something

00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:58,039
that feels like part of the core I don't

00:48:57,049 --> 00:49:00,140
know if that makes sense

00:48:58,039 --> 00:49:04,539
I'm also complete answer but at least

00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:07,789
that's that's the rough thinking yeah

00:49:04,539 --> 00:49:11,510
you know the mechanism for testing and

00:49:07,789 --> 00:49:15,319
and CI and all this good stuff that is

00:49:11,510 --> 00:49:16,819
right and I think I think this is one of

00:49:15,319 --> 00:49:18,950
the things I think I've actually has

00:49:16,819 --> 00:49:23,150
done really well like with the rel in

00:49:18,950 --> 00:49:24,770
being in CS deployment we had to kind of

00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:26,930
all these different things that are

00:49:24,770 --> 00:49:29,930
developed independently and like garden

00:49:26,930 --> 00:49:33,349
for example we don't run camps in our CI

00:49:29,930 --> 00:49:34,789
at all we just have tests for garden but

00:49:33,349 --> 00:49:36,650
then every time you push your new garden

00:49:34,789 --> 00:49:39,020
release it gets picked up by

00:49:36,650 --> 00:49:40,900
Relan makes its way into new CF

00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:43,339
employment as being its tested together

00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:46,730
so yeah I think there's lots to talk

00:49:43,339 --> 00:49:48,589
about there and I want one thing that's

00:49:46,730 --> 00:49:50,450
one thing we're trying not to do in

00:49:48,589 --> 00:49:52,819
arena it's kind of owed all of

00:49:50,450 --> 00:49:54,529
transparency but on kubernetes cuz I we

00:49:52,819 --> 00:49:56,869
can't buy it it's too big we can't do

00:49:54,529 --> 00:49:59,690
that and so we want to just own like a

00:49:56,869 --> 00:50:02,690
core thing kind of like bein Alec the

00:49:59,690 --> 00:50:05,029
analogy is DFO a gaggle doesn't test all

00:50:02,690 --> 00:50:07,760
the different releases just as the AVO

00:50:05,029 --> 00:50:10,100
and then r ellen has small together so

00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:12,470
I'm hoping that melons

00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:14,710
we'll be able to step up and take on

00:50:12,470 --> 00:50:16,240
some of that kind of cross component

00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:18,800
testing

00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:20,840
yeah maybe start small with the tools

00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:23,210
like the SSH and stuff like that and

00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:25,520
then eventually in a flight war and then

00:50:23,210 --> 00:50:29,930
eventually you can see how to just scale

00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:32,810
it right right okay cool any other

00:50:29,930 --> 00:50:36,020
questions - Vlad or Jules or the arena

00:50:32,810 --> 00:50:38,630
team I mean we have I think about six

00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:42,370
minutes left so this is your chance to

00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:45,320
ask some questions to the team otherwise

00:50:42,370 --> 00:50:49,540
planned to come to summit as most of

00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:49,540
these folks are gonna be there

00:50:50,410 --> 00:50:56,060
no questions going once twice alright

00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:58,700
thank you everybody

00:50:56,060 --> 00:51:01,150
thanks for the update and we will see

00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:04,370
you in The Hague and the Netherlands

00:51:01,150 --> 00:51:07,160
thank you cheers and we'll have a cab

00:51:04,370 --> 00:51:10,300
there okay so life would be even more

00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:10,300
fun bye

00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,540
