hello welcome everyone to this month's

00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:10,469
Cloud Foundry community advisory board

00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:12,780
cab meeting a the 18th of March I hope

00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:14,639
everyone is safe and healthy and has

00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:19,949
everything you need as we hunker down

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:23,609
for Koh mid-nineteen let's get started I

00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:26,730
just blew my surprise there again let's

00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:29,550
start with Swarna who's gonna tell us a

00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:31,189
little bit about what the Cloud Foundry

00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:35,250
Foundation has going right now

00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:37,980
I'm sure ship is also here so I will let

00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:41,670
him add anything you would like to add

00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:46,140
but we just wanted to make everyone

00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:48,239
aware that we understand these are truly

00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,370
like when we say these are uncharted

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:54,270
territories and unchartered waters these

00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:56,820
are literally those so we are at least

00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:59,250
as of now we are continuing as planned

00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:03,690
for a Cloud Foundry summit in Austin

00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:06,119
however we also realize that the City of

00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:10,170
Austin has a lot of restrictions at

00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:11,880
least until for the next five or six

00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,070
weeks which still puts us out of that

00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:17,280
window but we will be monitoring the

00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:19,979
situation and making updates on that

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,259
page that I added a link to the notes

00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:24,750
here in the notes here but also we will

00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:27,810
send out notifications to the community

00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:30,360
as and when things as and when we get to

00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:33,630
no more updates or things as well so

00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:35,600
please do stay tuned please do take a

00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:39,450
look at the emails whenever we send out

00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:41,369
but in the meantime we understand again

00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:43,200
things a lot of things are going and

00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:45,780
it's really hard for us to focus as well

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:49,079
so we extended the deadline until the

00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:51,450
3rd of April it was supposed to end this

00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:54,000
week I think this weekend but yeah we

00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:56,520
accelerated until the April 3rd so that

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,189
folks will have a lot more time to think

00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:01,619
about all your abstracts and proposals

00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:05,250
and submissions if you have any kind of

00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:07,200
questions or even concerns with anything

00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:09,170
related to summit please do not hesitate

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,480
either oppose the question on this

00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:15,390
summit slack channel or

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,040
drop us an out either dead Giles who's

00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:19,560
our events late or any of us a

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,080
foundation you can even post it on CFS

00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:25,200
forum which is the newly-minted select

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,349
channel ask any kind of persons for the

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:32,599
foundation so please don't hesitate but

00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:32,599
yeah please stay healthy and stay safe

00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:40,049
I'm sorry about I want to add a couple

00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:41,670
things tree me too - maybe reinforce

00:02:40,049 --> 00:02:42,269
what Sarna was saying so first there was

00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:46,019
a question

00:02:42,269 --> 00:02:49,319
we hold the and ask me anything call for

00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:51,560
our member contacts and there was a

00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:53,579
great question that was asked yesterday

00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:56,549
you know what what's the risk of

00:02:53,579 --> 00:02:58,680
canceling right the the choice that we

00:02:56,549 --> 00:03:01,109
made to attach a CF summit to the

00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,049
open-source summit in North America and

00:03:01,109 --> 00:03:06,440
then similarly for later in the year and

00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:08,220
in in Dublin means that our

00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:10,079
organizationally we have a very very

00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:12,660
limited financial exposure there so

00:03:10,079 --> 00:03:18,049
we're not we're not approaching this as

00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:20,880
a financial question at all we are today

00:03:18,049 --> 00:03:23,459
relying on the Linux Foundation to make

00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:26,989
choices for kind of a larger event that

00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:29,930
we're attached to they have an

00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:32,040
epidemiologist X CDC person who's

00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:35,190
consulting with them in addition to work

00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:37,049
very very closely with the with both the

00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:41,069
venue as well as the the City of Austin

00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:43,349
to make calls on this so that's that's

00:03:41,069 --> 00:03:44,459
some of the context about the event

00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:48,150
right like we're gonna think about

00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:50,669
people community safety and you know if

00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:52,440
it seems like it is safe maybe people

00:03:50,669 --> 00:03:55,669
are gonna want to get out right so we're

00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:59,010
trying to just play that loose right now

00:03:55,669 --> 00:04:01,680
however think about submitting talks

00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:02,730
even though there's there's a likelihood

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,769
that we're not going to hold an

00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:08,819
in-person event because we are

00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:10,940
absolutely going to if necessary pivot

00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:13,799
to some type of virtual format and

00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:16,410
there's a ton of amazing technical

00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:18,840
content it won't be like you know

00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:20,519
staring at a video feed all day we're

00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:23,789
gonna find ways to break it up and

00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:26,370
spread it out over a course of days so

00:04:23,789 --> 00:04:28,290
your your talk submission ideas are

00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:29,729
just as valuable irregardless of the

00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:32,940
format that we end up getting the

00:04:29,729 --> 00:04:35,639
community together in so don't don't let

00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:38,250
you know possibility of delay delay your

00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:40,320
own efforts to you know get a good talk

00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:41,880
submission pull together does that make

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,290
sense to anybody and are there any

00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:49,620
questions about you know what we're

00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:52,169
doing about that that's great chip um

00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:56,340
one of the things I value most about the

00:04:52,169 --> 00:04:59,940
CF summit is the contributor summit so

00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:02,639
maybe we could organize also if we end

00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:08,789
up going virtual some some topic

00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:11,100
specific contributor meetings just to

00:05:08,789 --> 00:05:13,410
get this the lay of the land as well so

00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:16,789
not just hasn't patience but actual

00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:20,310
discussions yeah that's really helpful

00:05:16,789 --> 00:05:22,110
absolutely true that's that's one of the

00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:24,660
things that's sort of in the in the mix

00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:27,810
that I would say is probably a higher

00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:29,580
priority than talks you know depending

00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:31,800
on who you are whether you're an end

00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:34,260
user or whether you're you know deeply

00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,610
involved in the development there's kind

00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:37,500
of a different angle but take it you

00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:41,310
know what's the values so I hear you

00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:44,280
there as contributors active

00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:46,250
collaboration happens all the time right

00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:48,229
but to get together in person is

00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:51,510
extremely valuable

00:05:48,229 --> 00:05:53,039
so yeah will will actually be reaching

00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:56,580
out to the community once we understand

00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:59,160
the the kind of the tool chain options

00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:00,570
that are being presented to us and what

00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,310
their capabilities are then we'll be

00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:04,949
able to talk about you know different

00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:08,520
formats different different schedule

00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:11,970
ideas how we can craft this into a

00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:13,830
period of time where each audience gets

00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:16,430
the gets the most benefit from it it's a

00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:16,430
good point

00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:22,230
cool thanks very much Anna thanks very

00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:25,200
much for extending that deadline I know

00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:27,810
I was swamped with other things and I'm

00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:31,080
I'm grateful for a little bit more time

00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:34,260
to prepare stuff if that's all from the

00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:38,730
foundation and let's hear from the PMC

00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:41,340
thanks Eric for getting some notes in it

00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:45,150
if somebody wants to share the actual

00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:46,620
agenda document to add things to or if

00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:49,260
it's changed since I've taken the

00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:50,940
snapshot but I'll hand it over to you

00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:53,160
Eric for runtime PMC

00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:54,750
yeah thanks Trey happy to cover a few

00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,060
highlights over the last month or so I

00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:58,680
think one of the major ones is we

00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:01,380
accepted the incubation proposal for

00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:04,740
coop CF and that team is now released

00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:08,100
version 1.0 so congratulations to all of

00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:09,120
you and you know give it a spin looks

00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,710
like it's got a lot of great

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,240
capabilities I think it's a great

00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:15,450
solution right now for getting CF

00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,810
running on topic AIDS among the other

00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:18,690
teams

00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:20,310
I know relevant is doing some planning

00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:24,840
for the next major version of CF

00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:26,670
deployment and they have a few notes I

00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:29,190
think of the PMC notes if not on the

00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:31,080
mailing list yet about some of the

00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:32,400
changes that are upcoming there and then

00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,600
they're also focusing a lot of energy on

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,150
CF frigates

00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:39,150
and integrating a lot of the other

00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:42,030
component teams changes into that

00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:44,250
project and Cappy in particular has been

00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:46,230
working with relevant to get their

00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:49,110
integration with kpac for cloud native

00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:52,730
build pack staging into that to hit a

00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:55,410
few communication snags but otherwise is

00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:58,020
proceeding pretty smoothly and we're all

00:07:55,410 --> 00:08:00,780
excited to get that first integration of

00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:03,710
collecting to build packs into this

00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:07,320
other kate's focused distribution of CF

00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:10,200
uaa is also continuing to advance with

00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:12,150
their kubernetes packaging a few AAA and

00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,830
I think they're right now focused on

00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:16,800
refining some of the secret management

00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:20,180
in terms of the configuration so beyond

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:22,860
doing that initial lift of some of the

00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:26,000
BAS roley's properties into kubernetes

00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:29,870
configuration network

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,670
is also integrating in CCF rockets and

00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:34,099
they've been making more progress in

00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:37,039
terms of offloading some of the

00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:40,010
network-wide responsibilities to sto and

00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:42,620
at sidecars and so I shan't even

00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:43,969
recommending to you the other component

00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:47,000
team is that they started switching back

00:08:43,969 --> 00:08:49,100
to plain HTTP communication as one mode

00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,050
so that they can let the sto service

00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:53,120
measure take over transparent mutual TLS

00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:55,880
on the container network for those

00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:58,070
components and then we're also getting

00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:00,770
more telemetry integrated into CF

00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:05,350
frigates alligator's proceeding with

00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:11,420
some of their plan changes for the log

00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:13,370
transport consolidation components mcf

00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:15,590
frigates and so we're getting a flogs

00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:17,300
plumbed out and they're also working on

00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:21,650
container metrics getting those exposed

00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:23,210
and last but not least diego is doing

00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:27,620
some pretty deep evaluation of a really

00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:30,050
fascinating PR from the community that

00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:33,380
is tweaking how the auctioneer does

00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:37,580
placement of containers to more heavily

00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:42,200
weight or favor Diego cells that have a

00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:44,930
lower Bosch index so that the company

00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:46,940
that has contributed this has found that

00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:50,270
they're able to get some significant

00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:53,900
space saving by trying to fit containers

00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:57,320
on those lower index cells and so that

00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:58,640
leaves the higher index cells more open

00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:01,220
for bigger workloads and then they can

00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,720
scale those down a little bit so again

00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:04,940
this is it's going to be an optional

00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,680
change to Diego but assuming that it

00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:08,600
works out really well it could be a very

00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:12,080
interesting optimisation for that kind

00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:13,940
of placement especially for operators

00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:18,350
that are managing a wide range of

00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:19,370
container sizes anyway I think those are

00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:22,640
some of the major highlights for the

00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:24,260
past month and I think I see some

00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:28,080
updates for the extensions PMC coming

00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:35,790
into the Google Doc right now

00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:38,029
okay have we got Fache BMC represented

00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:38,029
today

00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:47,399
don't think so yeah I don't I don't see

00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:47,399
Marco or Morgan on the line

00:10:50,070 --> 00:11:00,370
all right then max if you could yes so

00:10:56,279 --> 00:11:03,150
thank you thank you Troy so the update

00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:09,220
is a easy update is that I don't have

00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:13,270
any update and maybe it's because last

00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:17,140
month I had some personal time off the

00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:18,820
passing of family member but that mean

00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:22,720
that meant that I took a couple weeks

00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:25,570
off and I had to cancel our much fee

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,310
meeting but the meeting this month is

00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:29,200
coming up next week so it's always

00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:31,089
scheduled at the end of the month so

00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,910
that I can give you the update for the

00:11:31,089 --> 00:11:36,160
next month so that means in April I

00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:39,540
should have some update for you okay and

00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:41,350
for those who want to attend the

00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:43,660
extensions meeting is that an open

00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:47,470
meeting yes it is an open meeting I'll

00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:49,089
put a link on the agenda all sense that

00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:53,290
way people can just click on it

00:11:49,089 --> 00:11:55,089
Thank You Troy okay okay thanks so

00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:58,480
that's that's all we got from project

00:11:55,089 --> 00:12:00,940
highlights this month let's move on to

00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:04,959
something I'm super excited about which

00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:09,480
is the CF 4k eights demo so those of us

00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:12,339
have been in the kubernetes sync meeting

00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:14,589
know all about this and I've just

00:12:12,339 --> 00:12:17,470
written a blog post which hopefully will

00:12:14,589 --> 00:12:19,600
come out soon sort of describing the the

00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:22,930
different tracks were on as a community

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:25,270
to deliver not only kubernetes native

00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:27,339
components but also kubernetes what

00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:30,040
we're calling kubernetes idiomatic

00:12:27,339 --> 00:12:32,350
distributions of Cloud Foundry and most

00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:34,450
of the work from the upstreams teams is

00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:37,930
integrating into this project called CF

00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:41,200
4k AIDS which SCI is in charge of as

00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:44,190
head of the the relevant team would you

00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,190
like to take it over

00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:56,410
you'll be on a unshare so I could share

00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:59,060
my screen you got it awesome so

00:12:56,410 --> 00:13:01,610
hopefully all can see my screen I I

00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:04,580
created a small deck to give more

00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:07,430
structure to the demo so one

00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:09,020
recommendation I have is to ask

00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:11,840
questions as you go through the demo

00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:13,730
alright the soom chatroom once I walk

00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:16,580
through the demo I'll answer the

00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:18,560
questions as long as I have time

00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:20,870
if not I'll copy/paste the questions

00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,850
from chat into a word doc and a nonce

00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:24,650
all answer the unanswered questions and

00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:29,990
shared that widely in this year for

00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:35,150
Kay's channel so awesome alright so we

00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:36,860
want to put on present mode so we we

00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:39,200
started the journey around November of

00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:41,240
last year when teams reached out to us

00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:45,440
for help with their integration efforts

00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:47,780
for four cf1 gates as they were building

00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,420
capabilities on Kate's components we

00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:52,160
were using some hybrid Bosh and Kate's

00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:55,130
deployments and it got increasingly

00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:58,670
difficult for them to build and ship

00:13:55,130 --> 00:14:01,750
their components after our research we

00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:04,130
had an inception in December and on

00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:07,280
identifying one of the urgent versus non

00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:09,680
urgent needs we submitted a proposal in

00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:13,280
January 2019 we got some great feedback

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:17,450
and we had our first repository created

00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:21,410
in Feb 2009 teen the first commit if you

00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:24,140
may and we released the first release

00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:27,950
that we had some for users to try

00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:31,400
because CF push darker app only and here

00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:34,130
here we are in March with with CF push

00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:35,930
bill paxton mo so it is phenomenal to

00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:37,760
see the progress we made in just two to

00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:40,180
three months so I'm pretty proud of

00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:45,260
proud to be part of this journey and and

00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:47,630
bring you all this demo yes I just you

00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:49,460
for the latter January February and

00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:52,900
March those are actually twenty twenty

00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:56,600
day trade sorry that's right oh yeah

00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:58,370
yeah yeah well writing 2019 on all my

00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:01,320
slides yeah

00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:06,810
sorry 2019 this is what happens when you

00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:08,610
copy paste things 2010-2020 cannot

00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:09,570
actually go to hell now so yeah that's

00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:15,150
really fine

00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:19,380
I'll use that excuse 2008 2020 we go we

00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:22,410
go back in time all right cool so I'm

00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:24,390
going to the next slide so what is c4

00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:27,270
Cades was this made of so I just thought

00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:29,340
maybe I'll give a lay of the land here

00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:32,940
here's sort of a high level hundred the

00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:35,460
hood for safer gates the the green boxes

00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:38,330
designate the coercive components and

00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:45,090
the yellow box boxes designate the

00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:48,060
dependencies all right so the the are

00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:50,970
two sort of namespaces if you may one is

00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:53,310
the app namespace which is where the CF

00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:56,280
apps are deployed and the system

00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:58,430
namespace generally contains the Cloud

00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:01,020
Foundry components and the dependencies

00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:03,900
few notable things to i would like to

00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:07,070
highlight we are using k pack to sage

00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:11,880
apps as Eric mentioned in the previous

00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:16,950
and and in the the updates that are

00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:18,870
using k pack which uses utilizes native

00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:22,220
cloud native bill packs to build images

00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:25,590
in a consistent and reproducible way

00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:27,090
kpac requires a registry to store these

00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:29,820
app images

00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:33,650
hence we also need to provide an

00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:37,890
absolute story which you see down here

00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:40,170
we are using is tio to manage inter

00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:44,100
component communications security policy

00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:47,330
enforcement and so on and from a

00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:50,580
lifecycle standpoint of managing CF

00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:53,100
itself we are using cap to manage the

00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:56,460
Cloud Foundry lifecycle the best analog

00:16:53,100 --> 00:17:00,060
is these are the boss CLI deploy command

00:16:56,460 --> 00:17:04,680
that we used to doing and we're using

00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:07,290
ytt for our for our templating needs so

00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:08,850
more documentation is forthcoming on all

00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:11,250
the different parts and the role they

00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:12,060
play in providing the CF experience but

00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,860
I just thought maybe

00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:17,870
it's a good time to just show you all

00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:21,860
the other parts that we have today the

00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:21,860
makeups here for sale for Kate

00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:30,559
awesome I got a question from Ono if

00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:32,270
you've got time for it do I understand

00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,980
correctly that all apps from all orgs

00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:37,820
and spaces would be put in one big

00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:40,760
namespace I believe yes that is that is

00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:43,820
how it is today it may change in the

00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:46,039
future but it will be in the in the same

00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:48,230
namespace that currently I believe

00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:50,720
that's because that's how I really does

00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:55,789
it and it could do it differently in the

00:17:50,720 --> 00:18:00,380
future awesome alright so I'll jump into

00:17:55,789 --> 00:18:02,240
a demo some disclaimer the I'm using a

00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:04,520
branch that is yet to be merged to

00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:07,880
master which is very close we are

00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:10,460
updating documentation adding some known

00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:12,980
issues so folks are aware when when we

00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:15,590
actually do merge it I expect this to be

00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:18,130
merged in the next day or two but for

00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:22,159
this demo I'm just playing off of that

00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:23,779
bright the branch and so it's a it's

00:18:22,159 --> 00:18:30,820
gonna be a wild west so let's see how it

00:18:23,779 --> 00:18:30,820
goes awesome so I'll switch to my

00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:39,960
I turn

00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:44,490
see my yep awesome so I got just to

00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:52,170
where if I have Q cuddle cat namespaces

00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:55,640
just to show you that this is a Q Kate

00:18:52,170 --> 00:19:00,210
install that has no CF on it

00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:04,560
and then on here I am in CFO gates as i

00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:07,920
mentioned i'm using i'm using the branch

00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:09,570
right now so i'm gonna go ahead and run

00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:11,310
through steps so a few things I've

00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:13,680
written down the steps here which is

00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:16,860
very similar to the steps that are on

00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:19,980
our documentation on the repository so

00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:22,920
the first one is the domain name so this

00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:24,300
is your CF system domain be probably

00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:29,940
only aware of that so I'm gonna go ahead

00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:34,170
and apply that and then I mentioned to

00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:38,460
you all the the kpac requires a registry

00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:43,140
to go to to host the CF apps so I'm

00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:45,810
using the Google container registry for

00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:48,090
this demo you could use any publicly

00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:52,880
known resister eat like docker hub comm

00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:56,760
if you want to but I'm using that great

00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:58,650
so we have the script called a hack

00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:02,190
generate what this does really is

00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:04,320
generate an install file and what this

00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:07,350
is doing is taking in those parameters

00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:10,680
and creating an install yeah mole with

00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:11,970
values again this should be in the

00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:14,390
documentation so I'm going to create a

00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:14,390
brand new

00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:27,560
and if I open that up in invest

00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:30,920
investigate as ap 15 as you can see it

00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:35,810
generates the password and view

00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:37,940
certificates for four for communication

00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:39,470
intercom intercom ponent communication

00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:42,500
so these are some of the series and the

00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:44,660
keys it generates it uses bash CLI and

00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:48,020
that's the only dependency that we have

00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:51,080
for bosch CLI because Pasha's is a nice

00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:52,550
little tool to generate search but you

00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:55,150
can use other tools if you want if you

00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:58,430
are if you don't want to use power CLI

00:20:55,150 --> 00:21:02,800
great and then I think I've made a check

00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:08,930
so I'm gonna go ahead and install the

00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:11,180
sweep so all I'm gonna do is 15 click on

00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:17,720
it and then I'm gonna put a watch on

00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:23,000
this to see how how the pots are created

00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:26,360
so so there are no resources found as

00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:29,240
you can see cap which I mentioned a

00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:32,660
moment ago tells you that all of the

00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:36,260
resources it is about to install similar

00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:38,150
to the Bosch the plug tells you what

00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:42,110
what resources are what PM's it's gonna

00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:45,050
install as you can see it it'll tell you

00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:50,150
that it is about to install 241 new

00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:54,430
objects this will take few minutes like

00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:57,500
potentially see get cap thank you sorry

00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:59,600
it the wait I believe it installs it

00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:02,060
starts with the cluster level resources

00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,310
so like you see it's installing role

00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:08,690
bindings and namespaces and then it

00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:11,390
starts creating the actual CRTs the next

00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:13,220
up and then after that it says creating

00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:14,980
paths and so on and so forth so there

00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:17,180
are certain certain order it tries to do

00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:20,420
and you can also actually add

00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:25,580
conditional ordering if in cap through

00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:27,350
annotations that's the if there are any

00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:29,620
specific use cases of ordering that you

00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:29,620
may have

00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:47,440
let's I just so that I'm sure I

00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:49,179
understand that that means if you you

00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,549
know you need to deploy certain

00:22:49,179 --> 00:22:53,260
resources before others and they have to

00:22:51,549 --> 00:22:56,080
be ready you can do that with cap I

00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:58,990
believe so yes we are at this stage

00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:01,330
right now we are not adding any specific

00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:05,169
ordering other than I believe cap has

00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:07,059
implicit ordering of CR DS first but you

00:23:05,169 --> 00:23:11,559
could potentially do that for example

00:23:07,059 --> 00:23:13,480
you could have the UA be the first one

00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:15,399
and then cap e be the second because

00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,840
Cappy depends on you a you could you

00:23:15,399 --> 00:23:18,940
could actually order that that way

00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:22,360
ideally we don't want to do that at

00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:25,630
least and see if in case what it is it's

00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:29,279
you know things eventually converge to

00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:34,350
working so but it is it is a possibility

00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:34,350
there they come up yep they are

00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:58,100
I'm only watching the CF system if I did

00:23:54,530 --> 00:24:04,850
come out of this and washed let's say

00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:07,559
just other you should see for example

00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:09,870
there is now a steer system and if I did

00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:14,100
cube card will get pods and provide a

00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:24,440
namespace you should see that that

00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:26,730
already created is do part in there and

00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:29,220
one thing that you may have noticed is

00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:33,750
cap actually waits till all of the

00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:36,419
resources are available for it to run

00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:39,390
so unlike cue card I'll apply it will

00:24:36,419 --> 00:24:41,100
just apply and exit right away so very

00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:43,679
much like how you do Bosh deployed on

00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:46,490
exit till it actually has all the known

00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,490
resources running

00:25:12,539 --> 00:25:20,950
and speaking of someone who's used qcf a

00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:24,539
lot these crash loop backups are kind of

00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:28,509
normal as something crashes to consensus

00:25:24,539 --> 00:25:30,700
and you know this is where the ordering

00:25:28,509 --> 00:25:33,039
can help but shouldn't be relied on

00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:34,809
because every component that's launched

00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:36,369
to kubernetes should be able to recover

00:25:34,809 --> 00:25:40,840
and connect to the other components

00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:42,700
about this right yeah I think maybe this

00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:44,679
is some some of those efficiencies we

00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:45,159
can gain about talking to the component

00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:47,409
teams

00:25:45,159 --> 00:25:51,100
what are your init requirements what are

00:25:47,409 --> 00:25:55,330
you looking at and so on and so forth

00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:57,399
okay so cap is finished so we can see

00:25:55,330 --> 00:26:02,350
that it has installed all of the

00:25:57,399 --> 00:26:05,859
components we should have now two names

00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:07,029
multiple namespaces but it should be one

00:26:05,859 --> 00:26:09,460
thing I want to call out as I see it

00:26:07,029 --> 00:26:11,799
workload names as I mentioned we have CF

00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:15,220
system but we also have these tio system

00:26:11,799 --> 00:26:19,480
as a separate namespace we also have K

00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:23,889
pack running great so I need to

00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:26,379
configure the load balancer IP so I

00:26:23,889 --> 00:26:31,259
could connect using a well known address

00:26:26,379 --> 00:26:31,259
so let me just check out the IP address

00:26:31,769 --> 00:26:46,620
so I'm gonna go ahead and update the DNS

00:26:36,899 --> 00:26:50,580
let me just share my whole screen so we

00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:54,059
using gke right now as for our cube

00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:56,640
analysis it needs but we're planning to

00:26:54,059 --> 00:27:01,280
think more around using other distros as

00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:06,660
well so here's my sort of domain address

00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:09,360
and I'm gonna go ahead and paste that so

00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:15,600
I could use that to connect to CFC Li

00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:33,720
and then I can just watch and see it

00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:35,790
propagate so give it a few seconds - now

00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:38,370
this is just standard upstream Sto

00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:40,880
you're running for the gate ring for

00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:40,880
that yes

00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:50,850
feel free others to ask questions I

00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:52,110
don't want to I don't want to hog size

00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:58,110
time this is the first time I've seen

00:27:52,110 --> 00:28:02,400
this demo yeah so belief if I did get

00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:11,850
fed pods from missed your namespace or

00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:13,320
services able to see other services and

00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:22,620
think Estill is the one of the load

00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:25,770
balancer that I'm interested in I'm

00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:26,730
sorry it has been applied now Oh yep yep

00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:29,790
it did awesome

00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:32,309
yeah I believe it takes some time for

00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:37,140
Appa gates oh okay so we can now go

00:28:32,309 --> 00:28:39,330
ahead and attach connector CF CLI so

00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:41,010
that should be able to do it I have to

00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:43,950
look up the password so I can quickly

00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:55,620
take a look at the install values that I

00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:57,370
used which was 15 which is here and then

00:28:55,620 --> 00:29:05,500
I can type in

00:28:57,370 --> 00:29:09,790
çf art admin and then paste the great

00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:12,370
then I'll try to create the in one line

00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:15,550
just the the org and the space and

00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:25,540
target to that organ space so this

00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:27,640
should be pretty familiar to you all so

00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:31,059
there's one caveat here we have to

00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:33,700
enable this feature flag copy is working

00:29:31,059 --> 00:29:35,650
to remove this requirement but we'll add

00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:37,780
this to as a known issue they have a

00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:42,309
story working on doing this that this

00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:45,700
enables us for us to internally for for

00:29:42,309 --> 00:29:49,330
copy to use the the image that kpac

00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:53,380
produces and and and to schedule that

00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:55,870
using irony okay yeah so there's some

00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:57,550
technical details but just for this demo

00:29:55,870 --> 00:30:00,150
we just have to use this but this will

00:29:57,550 --> 00:30:00,150
go in the future

00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:10,150
and finally I'm gonna push an app so I'm

00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:15,030
using an app from the CF acceptance test

00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:19,450
called catnip if I just did

00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:21,700
oops that's not what I meant just see

00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:26,440
under the hood what that app is as you

00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:28,000
can see it's a go app and now I'm gonna

00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:32,679
go ahead and see it push that and

00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:42,940
hopefully this should just work I'm

00:30:32,679 --> 00:30:46,020
gonna watch the get work loads see if it

00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:48,550
actually you're gonna see some of these

00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:51,070
error messages failed to retrieve as we

00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:52,770
are still integrating today so this is

00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:55,690
gonna be one of those loan issues

00:30:52,770 --> 00:31:00,490
belongs to the no one issues list but

00:30:55,690 --> 00:31:01,960
should not impact your see a push can

00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:05,760
you actually get those logs from the

00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:08,980
kubernetes pod directly you could yes

00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:10,930
ability so yes you can use capo you can

00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:14,180
directly use cube kernel to

00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:19,310
apply to get the logs from that pod with

00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:21,140
cap you can do something like wildcard

00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:23,090
characters so you don't have to know the

00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:25,460
pod name you can just simply say Cappy

00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:28,640
star and follow and it will get all the

00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:32,540
logs from burst through all of those

00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:35,570
pods into one stream yeah there's

00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:38,420
similar tools like k-9s there's also a

00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:40,160
really good cursors all of k-9s it's fun

00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:42,410
yeah I would just got introduced to

00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:48,860
yesterday and I was fascinated by how

00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:50,960
awesome it is just taking a longer than

00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:53,110
I would have anticipated but I'm hoping

00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,110
it

00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:10,720
I can tell you all it worked yesterday

00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:16,600
so you can always think of the like you

00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:18,910
can trust me on this I am actually super

00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:21,670
impressed by how fast all of this came

00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:23,500
up if those of you have poked at cube CF

00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:26,530
there's a lot of pre-start it's a lot

00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:28,990
more going on but would be familiar with

00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:32,590
and we can see the the pod is coming up

00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:34,870
now yeah so alright so we can see it

00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:36,520
took about some time but the pod is

00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:41,410
running and then I'm gonna go ahead and

00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:43,870
curl it which is the catnip dot the

00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:46,090
domain that told me so I'm gonna go and

00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:49,660
do that and that should return catnip

00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:56,650
Yeow alright so we got our CF push with

00:32:49,660 --> 00:33:00,600
bill packs working awesome how long are

00:32:56,650 --> 00:33:05,680
we from the like cage needed enabled

00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:07,150
like it's doing very small application

00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:08,050
workload it's like how far are we from

00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:13,330
my theme

00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:14,950
what's a production-ready idea yeah so

00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:19,390
let's talk about that I'm gonna go

00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:22,930
switch to my and I got another question

00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:24,850
that may be related yeah ask that one as

00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:27,280
well and but can you explain the

00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:27,880
relationship between this cube CF

00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:36,990
ireenie

00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:39,130
so that everybody is aware this yeah so

00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:41,260
pinpin that question of once again let

00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:44,200
me answer the first one which is where

00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:47,370
are we and how long towards 1.0 I think

00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:53,310
that's the question right the first one

00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:55,870
yeah yep so just a quick note on that so

00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:57,190
what is the integration set up today and

00:33:55,870 --> 00:34:00,010
what is the contribution contribution

00:33:57,190 --> 00:34:04,810
flow workload look like so on the Left

00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:07,720
what you see is is it's it's it's the

00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:10,000
workflow that we are using today for the

00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:12,730
the core component teams to contribute

00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,589
to CF or Gades first it's very manual

00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:16,839
and we have seen in

00:34:14,589 --> 00:34:19,989
efficiencies when it works and gets us

00:34:16,839 --> 00:34:23,889
closer to the alpha release that we plan

00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:25,899
to cut as soon as we have the CF herbal

00:34:23,889 --> 00:34:29,440
packs fully merged into master and

00:34:25,899 --> 00:34:32,679
tested so the contributing teams are

00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:35,529
using CF for Cades artifact both in

00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:37,839
their local and and and there CI

00:34:35,529 --> 00:34:40,450
environments once they are ready they

00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:43,929
build the docker images and submit a PR

00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:46,239
to CF or gates repository which can

00:34:43,929 --> 00:34:47,919
contain config changes and image digests

00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:50,169
changes and then we run through our own

00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:52,389
integration and if it's successful we

00:34:50,169 --> 00:34:55,539
merge it to master so if you pull from

00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:59,829
master you should have a stable safe

00:34:55,539 --> 00:35:02,229
okay it's install and a high-level peek

00:34:59,829 --> 00:35:04,749
into on the right how our integration

00:35:02,229 --> 00:35:07,390
setup is in general so we are at the

00:35:04,749 --> 00:35:10,569
moment we are testing this on gke only

00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:13,719
but we plan to expand that in the future

00:35:10,569 --> 00:35:18,339
to one hour to more case distribution

00:35:13,719 --> 00:35:21,309
and perhaps a KS or g KS up until now we

00:35:18,339 --> 00:35:24,430
were just using one test which is CF

00:35:21,309 --> 00:35:26,650
push docker app but again we we plan to

00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:28,269
change that as we incorporate new

00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:31,839
capabilities especially with new bill

00:35:28,269 --> 00:35:33,579
packs we may start using the smoke test

00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:37,180
that we package to it as a way to

00:35:33,579 --> 00:35:40,299
validate the new changes and then move

00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:44,650
to cats as new capable Pig capabilities

00:35:40,299 --> 00:35:49,619
get at it and then looking forward so

00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:54,789
this answers the question towards oops

00:35:49,619 --> 00:35:56,619
looking forward in terms of 1.0 so first

00:35:54,789 --> 00:35:59,829
what you're seeing here is the release

00:35:56,619 --> 00:36:01,690
integration roadmap the component teams

00:35:59,829 --> 00:36:06,099
have their own roadmaps and timelines

00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:08,259
for CF capabilities so as in component

00:36:06,099 --> 00:36:10,569
teams make them available we will

00:36:08,259 --> 00:36:12,910
integrate and ship them throughout the

00:36:10,569 --> 00:36:15,489
tour throughout this journey so what you

00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:17,650
see here is not exhaustive but it's very

00:36:15,489 --> 00:36:20,529
much focused around all these

00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:23,349
integrations sort of roadmap if you may

00:36:20,529 --> 00:36:25,839
so you saw talked about the off coming

00:36:23,349 --> 00:36:27,190
off alpha release which will have the

00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:28,150
see a push with bill packs available

00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:30,640
there's

00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:34,000
caveat switch we will and known issues

00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:36,520
that will add in the release notes you

00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,890
can you will be able to HTTP route that

00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:44,140
app and then you can hook your external

00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:45,910
app registry to host your CF apps next

00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:48,579
up as soon as we're done with that we

00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:50,710
will start thinking about running cats

00:36:48,579 --> 00:36:52,990
in our pipeline see which ones we can

00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:55,329
run and the ones we cannot we'll have to

00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:59,230
wait and see as new capabilities get

00:36:55,329 --> 00:37:00,700
added we will unlock each test and then

00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:04,480
we want to validate as I mentioned

00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:06,160
another distro the the another big sort

00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:08,609
of initiative we want to build is the

00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:12,549
contribution model so we can consume

00:37:08,609 --> 00:37:16,539
component releases so this is where we

00:37:12,549 --> 00:37:19,000
want to consume their releases from from

00:37:16,539 --> 00:37:22,299
contributing teams integrate validate

00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,339
and ship very similar to what do you

00:37:22,299 --> 00:37:29,410
what do you expect from CFD safe

00:37:24,339 --> 00:37:33,279
deployment and then the future is where

00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:35,619
we want to go more towards operator

00:37:33,279 --> 00:37:37,900
concerns for example what are their

00:37:35,619 --> 00:37:40,359
house upgrade look like for n minus 1 to

00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:42,279
n how do we package smoke tests so that

00:37:40,359 --> 00:37:44,430
they can validate these upgrades well

00:37:42,279 --> 00:37:47,260
what would the world look like with

00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:50,020
setting up ingress certificates how do

00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:52,150
we rotate those and then so on and so

00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:55,779
forth so so we are not there yet but

00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:59,289
that's our our hope is that as we march

00:37:55,779 --> 00:38:00,910
towards the in the next coming months we

00:37:59,289 --> 00:38:04,809
will address some of the enterprise

00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:08,010
readiness capabilities so for now it's

00:38:04,809 --> 00:38:11,529
gonna be an alpha I will love you all to

00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:13,859
take us take a take a swipe at it take

00:38:11,529 --> 00:38:13,859
it for a spin

00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:22,160
yeah so I'm gonna move to the next so

00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:24,620
how do you get started it's available at

00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:27,050
this depository their docks to deploy to

00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:30,830
a hosted Cades cluster and also to

00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:32,840
deploy to a local cluster so please go

00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:36,320
take a moment try it out love to get

00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:38,510
your feedback as I mentioned you can

00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:40,970
reach out to cf4 gaze channel with bugs

00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:43,850
or feedback you can submit p issues at

00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:45,530
PRS to the CF four gates repository or

00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:48,560
you can even sign up for direct feedback

00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:50,480
a plan to send out a Google Form if you

00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:54,020
all interested in crime of providing

00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:56,720
your feedback you know especially if you

00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:58,970
have kids you're using Kate's and

00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:00,140
capacity I would love to hear your

00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:08,330
feedback on how you're thinking about

00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:09,380
running CF on that yeah so and that's

00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:11,480
about it

00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:14,210
and I can take questions and one

00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:18,080
question was about Cube CF can you

00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:19,850
repeat that question again sure just for

00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:22,580
the audience in general can you explain

00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:24,620
the differences in this effort versus

00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:28,390
cube CF are they related to they tie in

00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:32,990
and how does reading tie in as well

00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:35,510
so I have Troy here who you know in that

00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:37,850
project but I could you want to take a

00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:40,400
swipe at it I totally want to take a

00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:42,320
swipe at it because this subject it's

00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,750
the partial subject of the blog post I

00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:46,850
wrote about the incubation of cube CF

00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:48,320
which will come out pretty soon and it's

00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:51,140
it's something we've been talking a lot

00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:54,200
about in CF fer fer case where the the

00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:56,720
kubernetes sig meetings I should say so

00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:58,940
when we met in Philadelphia we had

00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:01,100
conversations about because of course

00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:03,950
Sousa and IBM and s AP have been working

00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:07,100
on sort of containerized cloud foundry

00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:10,010
in a different stream for a while about

00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:12,230
how to get the optimal get to the

00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:14,000
optimal goal of a really truly not only

00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:16,910
kubernetes native but a kubernetes

00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:20,390
idiomatic place for cloud foundry so

00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:23,110
that cloud foundry is seen as a

00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:26,180
necessary part of a kubernetes cluster

00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:28,280
for for making it into a platform and

00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:30,350
and so we had two different ways of

00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:33,560
going about this one was that

00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:35,990
the component teams upstream that are

00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:38,660
making the parts of Cloud Foundry have

00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:41,390
to understand kubernetes deeply and have

00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:43,700
to make kubernetes native components

00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:45,500
from the start and and make them what

00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:47,390
we're starting to call them kubernetes

00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:50,930
idiomatic using the parts of kubernetes

00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:54,380
that are really good at delivering cloud

00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:56,960
native applications parallel to this

00:40:54,380 --> 00:41:00,080
especially for souza because we've got a

00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:02,060
distribution that is running on on on

00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:05,090
kubernetes that is based on bosch

00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:08,780
releases we have to have continuity with

00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:11,780
the extensive Bosch community so our

00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:14,090
team has been the QCF team has been

00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:15,860
pursuing this way of consuming the Bosch

00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:18,940
releases that relevant already puts out

00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:21,380
and combining them into a certifiable

00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:24,890
foundation certifiable release that you

00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:26,480
can actually run in production so what

00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:28,940
the plan is for kube CF so they're

00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:31,730
parallel projects over time the plan

00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:35,870
with cube CF is to replace the bashed

00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:38,360
releases with kubernetes native

00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:41,810
artifacts from the upstream component

00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:44,600
teams and gradually make that more what

00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:46,880
like what you're seeing with with CF for

00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:49,880
k-8 on the other side you're going to

00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:51,470
see CF for K eights complete more of the

00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:53,780
functionality that you would see out of

00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:55,490
the box right now in cube CF so we're

00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:58,400
both going to the same place which is a

00:41:55,490 --> 00:42:01,340
distribution of Cloud Foundry on

00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:03,200
communities or maybe two distributions

00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:05,180
of Cloud Foundry for community might

00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,830
have some slight differences and how

00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:09,680
they are deployed but the components

00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:11,900
will be the same so you might always

00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:14,540
install cube CF with helm

00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:15,890
you might always install what I don't

00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:22,030
know if it's decided yet but it looks

00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:28,460
like the K 14s toolchain like cap and

00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:32,180
ytt for CF for Cades did that summarize

00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:35,630
it for you so is that kind of your view

00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:37,370
on the world yeah I think so

00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:39,110
I think long-term it remains to be seen

00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:40,640
I hope that they will converge or they

00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:43,010
will remain different and that's

00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:46,310
something we will have to see how it

00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:53,660
plays out yeah so other notable

00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:54,820
architectural right now there are right

00:42:53,660 --> 00:43:00,200
now

00:42:54,820 --> 00:43:03,260
keeps EF consumes bosch releases and has

00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:06,290
the CF operator or the the works that

00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:10,130
quarks team has done to manage it in

00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:12,500
place on the kubernetes cluster it also

00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:14,900
ships Diego as an optional thing which I

00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:18,080
don't think SIA 4k its ever will

00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:19,610
we ship alternatively ireenie but that

00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:21,740
we're pulling in the same ireenie code

00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:24,140
and ultimately will pull in the same

00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:26,120
stagers and the same version of Kathy

00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:30,170
and the kubernetes native version of UAA

00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:32,270
so the architectures will converge Ament

00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:35,830
not be exactly the same but they should

00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:38,540
both be certifiable they should both be

00:43:35,830 --> 00:43:41,510
from an end users perspective an

00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:44,420
identical CF experience is absolutely

00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:47,390
fantastic to hear just like that I also

00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:48,650
AM certifiable I know the answers I

00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:52,300
appreciate it it helps a lot with

00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:52,300
context cool

00:43:55,220 --> 00:44:02,819
any other questions

00:43:58,559 --> 00:44:04,589
yeah this is this is Julian I'm just

00:44:02,819 --> 00:44:08,579
wondering about on a logging front so

00:44:04,589 --> 00:44:14,309
see if loves isn't working yet

00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:16,950
is CF tail working for you yeah so

00:44:14,309 --> 00:44:18,690
logging in log logging in general B we

00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:23,640
are working with the logging and team

00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:25,019
right now so last I checked we were the

00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:28,170
logging was not working

00:44:25,019 --> 00:44:31,559
did you some Lokesh complexities but

00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:33,809
really hope to once the CF bill pack

00:44:31,559 --> 00:44:35,999
apps go in we hope to have the logs

00:44:33,809 --> 00:44:37,799
focus on the logs and see ways we can

00:44:35,999 --> 00:44:42,980
resolve those any issues any pending

00:44:37,799 --> 00:44:47,759
issues it only looks right

00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:50,569
it's just not at the moment that's what

00:44:47,759 --> 00:44:50,569
I wrapped in day shoe

00:44:51,589 --> 00:44:57,089
yeah sorry go ahead

00:44:54,089 --> 00:44:58,259
heck yeah I was gonna have a little bit

00:44:57,089 --> 00:45:01,499
of context on this because I've been

00:44:58,259 --> 00:45:04,589
trying to get this also to work and how

00:45:01,499 --> 00:45:04,950
I've been trying it out so right CF

00:45:04,589 --> 00:45:08,519
Achatz

00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:12,690
is including only log cache as the blog

00:45:08,519 --> 00:45:14,279
address API and I believe that the

00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:16,170
latest version of the CF CLI will

00:45:14,279 --> 00:45:19,410
connect to that correctly there's a

00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:22,079
minor bug in the Cappy artifacts are

00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:24,599
currently in CF for Kate's where they

00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:26,579
are providing the wrong URL for log

00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:30,869
cache doesn't have the GGBS scheme in

00:45:26,579 --> 00:45:33,299
front and so depending on what relevant

00:45:30,869 --> 00:45:35,160
pulls in from the Cappy team in terms of

00:45:33,299 --> 00:45:36,539
their artifacts as part of the K pack

00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:41,160
integration they may end up picking up

00:45:36,539 --> 00:45:44,819
the correction to that that was recently

00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:46,170
just merged so I would hope in a few

00:45:44,819 --> 00:45:47,999
days or a week or something that all got

00:45:46,170 --> 00:45:54,509
resolved in the latest version of the CF

00:45:47,999 --> 00:45:57,420
CLI will get logs from la cache explain

00:45:54,509 --> 00:46:00,420
why you get that blank protocol error

00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:04,499
when when pushing with the latest CLI

00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:07,320
but my impression was that the like the

00:46:04,499 --> 00:46:13,350
CF tail plugin for the CSPI

00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:15,120
is a chi to work around that only when I

00:46:13,350 --> 00:46:17,400
tried it myself I didn't get any log

00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:19,980
messages out when I was sitting with big

00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:22,440
Walter looking in his screen he was

00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:24,360
getting too many lot of messages because

00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:28,020
it was also pulling in the sto stuff but

00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:34,170
I was kind of wondering what the what

00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:36,900
normal state of play is for that yeah I

00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:39,720
think CF tale will work maybe maybe I

00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:43,550
lost picky about the URL those respects

00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:45,480
and I think there is a lot of noise from

00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:48,090
the sto sidecars

00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:51,450
and in particular I think a lot of that

00:46:48,090 --> 00:46:54,300
is coming from the Envoy sidecar on the

00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:56,640
app side and on traffic and and managing

00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:58,620
configuration so I know one thing that

00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:01,080
the networking team has is on the

00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:03,360
roadmap is reducing the amount of noise

00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:05,250
that that thing generates because it is

00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:06,630
perhaps helpful if you want to

00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:07,950
understand what that envoy is doing but

00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:11,430
a little excessive concurrence in

00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:13,890
wanting to get your f mics yeah I was

00:47:11,430 --> 00:47:15,090
just about to say that and it C F tail

00:47:13,890 --> 00:47:16,800
works but yeah

00:47:15,090 --> 00:47:23,990
and as definitely as a lot of noise from

00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:23,990
my very good thank you

00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:31,380
Stefan speaking let's assume safe for

00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:33,120
kids majors and get see cuts working etc

00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:35,400
and comes into a regular release cycle

00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:38,310
which would be somehow coordinated with

00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:40,110
the releases of CF deployment especially

00:47:38,310 --> 00:47:42,030
when it comes to software like lock

00:47:40,110 --> 00:47:44,430
controller where there's a lot of

00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:46,740
development and with that comes some

00:47:44,430 --> 00:47:49,170
regressions will be at least finds the

00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:53,810
same problems on both sides of the world

00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:53,810
or what's the idea here

00:47:54,800 --> 00:48:02,120
speak to the lease integration part of

00:47:57,050 --> 00:48:03,260
it so the do understand your question

00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:05,330
you're saying are we going is

00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:07,400
synchronized it releases between CF

00:48:05,330 --> 00:48:10,250
deployment and CF okay it's together for

00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:14,270
every cloud for every release is that

00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:15,800
right yeah so that you at least ship the

00:48:14,270 --> 00:48:18,230
same version of the cloud controller

00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:26,000
software at the same version of the copy

00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:28,490
API yeah it's to be determined yet we

00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,380
have to see how we have to talk to the

00:48:28,490 --> 00:48:31,490
teams and how and understand as I

00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:34,310
mentioned we're looking towards the

00:48:31,490 --> 00:48:36,620
contribution of workflow and during that

00:48:34,310 --> 00:48:39,410
workflow we will we will try to figure

00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:41,240
out how how that how will the releases

00:48:39,410 --> 00:48:44,060
be consumed whether and whether they'll

00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:46,520
be consumed by both CFD or CF or case or

00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:51,070
both so so I don't have the answer that

00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:51,070
to that question you have okay thanks

00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:55,609
question now

00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:02,310
any other questions

00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:11,570
why is that completely so awesome great

00:49:07,550 --> 00:49:14,420
I'm I'm really impressed I am totally

00:49:11,570 --> 00:49:16,160
hats off for a great demo and I was

00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:18,920
especially impressed with how fast those

00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:20,750
pods come up so the packaging work that

00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:23,150
the upstream teams are doing on these

00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:26,690
new kubernetes native components is is

00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:29,060
great yeah I just I just had the

00:49:26,690 --> 00:49:30,920
privilege to show it it was really the

00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:33,230
team work and the community and all the

00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:35,060
contributing teams just been in

00:49:33,230 --> 00:49:38,030
phenomenal in terms of trying to get

00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:39,859
this working with one motive so I've

00:49:38,030 --> 00:49:42,290
never like I said before pretty proud of

00:49:39,859 --> 00:49:47,660
this journey with the singular focus of

00:49:42,290 --> 00:49:48,890
getting this working you know okay

00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:52,760
that's all we have on the agenda for

00:49:48,890 --> 00:49:54,770
today I just wanted to close with what

00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:58,430
is becoming a new Cloud Foundry mantra

00:49:54,770 --> 00:50:00,800
for me and a sort of a life thing thanks
