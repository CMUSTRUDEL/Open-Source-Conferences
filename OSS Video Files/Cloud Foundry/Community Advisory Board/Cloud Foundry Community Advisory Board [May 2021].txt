um we've got a

00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,360
uh it should be a a very interesting

00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,720
presentation later from stark and wayne

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,439
on

00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,960
carousel which is a cool uh credit hub

00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,720
credential rotation tool

00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,720
um but in the meantime

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,080
i guess we'll kick things off with cff

00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,320
highlights and updates

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,679
and we've got chip here to to give those

00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,280
today

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,960
i'm giving one then you're talking about

00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,280
the summit so uh okay

00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,960
sounds good get yourself prepped chris

00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,079
tfc elections

00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,440
yeah yeah so so the the main one that i

00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,640
actually wanted to make sure that uh

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,520
that we

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,200
reminded people about today um not just

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,640
for those that are online but those that

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,120
tend to watch these things uh

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,280
asynchronously later

00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,559
is that we're in the midst of the

00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,840
nomination cycle

00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:03,600
for the first ever technical

00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:05,360
oversight committee election we have

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,720
there's been a group that's the context

00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,360
here there's been a group that's been

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,360
working through

00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,280
setting up new governance structure for

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,560
the

00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:19,200
the project um

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,320
that will be a little bit more let's say

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,520
in line with

00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:25,360
um similar projects in this space

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,360
um a technical oversight committee is

00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,759
essentially the the group of

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,200
elected uh leaders that can make

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,880
decisions about how we're gonna

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,840
structure working groups around the code

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,400
base

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,159
um and then their whole job is to

00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,000
essentially find ways to delegate

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,759
responsibility of course down as

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,399
as far as possible to the people with

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:47,200
hands-on keyboards writing code and

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,320
and you know designing specs for new

00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,680
features but

00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:53,759
it's a very very important role that

00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,960
that we need good qualified candidates

00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,280
for

00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,240
there's two things that i'll ask anyone

00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,520
who has

00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:04,000
contributed any code or any support of

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,240
end users or really if you just

00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,039
contributed to the open source community

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,520
essentially in any way in the last year

00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:12,720
um

00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,879
you you should be eligible to vote

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,040
for the purpose of not spamming everyone

00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:19,680
that may not have enough interest

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,680
um we did uh we you know we did a bit of

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,400
an automated report to try to identify

00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,319
people that have

00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:28,319
contributed i think it was at least 25

00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:30,400
times and you know plus or minus a few

00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,080
and so there's a voter's file that has a

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,120
bunch of names listed

00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,400
and your employer or your affiliation so

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,879
if everyone can take a moment

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,680
and check to make sure that uh if you

00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,599
feel that you've

00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,720
contributed in any way over the last

00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,400
year

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,319
you'd like to vote make sure you're in

00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,160
that file if you're not

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,440
follow the link that i put in the the

00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:53,120
cab agenda

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:55,840
to open an issue um we're

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,680
it's a it's a really low bar to entry to

00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,319
to get to vote just fill out that

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,200
issue and you'll probably be at it the

00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,239
second thing though

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:07,200
related to the the tdc election is that

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:09,120
we're looking for of course nominations

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,360
um

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,959
the member companies at the cff for this

00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,280
very first

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,080
election and only for this very first

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,879
election

00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,560
um all of the primary contacts that

00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,159
every member

00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,000
have been given an opportunity to say

00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,519
hey as a member here's the name of a

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,200
person that

00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:31,440
may be non-obvious today

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,640
but really has been very involved in the

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,400
community and so we

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:38,239
want to nominate him but what's what's

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,080
supposed to be the majority of the the

00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:43,200
focus for the nomination cycle

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,920
and the way that it will work for every

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,239
future

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,159
annual election is that the community

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,040
members themselves and yourselves need

00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,799
to nominate

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,040
either yourself if you're you know

00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:55,439
qualified um

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,959
or nominate your peers or your your

00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,319
co-workers or

00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,200
the you know the people that you've

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:03,760
worked with in the community

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,480
that you think would be a great person

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:09,599
to to be on the the tse

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,560
and so there's a simple issue the type

00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:14,879
that you can use

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,479
to make that nomination both the

00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,680
go check to see if you're an eligible

00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:19,440
voter or you're going to receive a

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:23,440
ballot because you're in the voter list

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:26,320
as well as the actual nominees

00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,440
for for the election need to be

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,479
completed by the

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:33,520
28th right so we've got nine

00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:36,240
calendar days until that whole cycle

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,240
closes out

00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:43,840
any questions about that before we move

00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,840
on

00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,560
i'm gonna take dead silence as everybody

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,600
gets it awesome

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:56,560
cool chris off to you

00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,600
all right well thank you so much chip um

00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,000
only other one

00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,639
major point from uh from cff and that is

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,240
that

00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:07,520
uh cf summit cfp closes this friday

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,440
at end of day pacific time um and

00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,800
and in some previous cycles we've

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,039
extended that

00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,639
there won't be extensions this time so

00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:18,000
this this is effectively

00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:21,360
a very last call for for proposals so if

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,800
you or any of your

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:28,320
peers or folks on your project teams

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,320
have started a proposal uh

00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,440
make sure to wrap that up and if you've

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,919
got something you've been thinking about

00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,919
doing

00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,840
um you know you've got a couple days you

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,479
can try and try and put that together

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,360
and get it in

00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,320
um so yeah try and get um try and sound

00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,120
the alarms and get

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,080
people to uh to put in their proposals

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,600
as soon as possible

00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:51,280
if they can and um that's about that

00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:55,600
um we did have a fun uh live stream

00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:58,160
uh ram shedrack and i and all of the um

00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,720
the co-chairs the six co-chairs for the

00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,560
three

00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,319
uh summer tracks at a live stream

00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,840
yesterday uh that was a lot of fun

00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:07,039
obviously i'll drop that

00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,600
youtube in this slack i'm in the um zoom

00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,280
meeting

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,639
just for anyone that might want to check

00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,240
that out um

00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:15,919
so yeah after uh after cfp closes um

00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,600
all the co-chairs will meet next week

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,120
and put together the schedule so

00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,600
uh definitely excited to see what they

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,520
put together

00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,720
but yeah cfp closes friday so let

00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,639
everyone know

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:32,720
and that's all i've really got from cff

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,720
so with that i'll

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,280
ask eric if he wants to run through some

00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,800
uh app runtime pmc updates

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,360
yeah i'll give a few highlights over the

00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,280
past month or so um we've had a few

00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,440
updates from the integration projects

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,080
uh new version minor version of cf

00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,840
deployment uh v16.14.

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,599
uh and then i think maybe even a new

00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,960
major version of cf for kate's uh with

00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:54,800
some istio upgrades

00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,000
um those have to be able to sequenced

00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,160
correctly so

00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,080
uh watch out for those if uh if you're

00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,960
upgraded to those versions

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,240
um and then uh qcf um i think they

00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,360
recently uncovered that there'd been

00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,080
some issues

00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,080
with uh drain scripts not working

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,000
correctly but they think they have that

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,280
resolved now with some updates to the

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,039
quarkx operator

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,479
and uh the last i've heard from jan is

00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,919
that they've been facing some woes with

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,360
their ci system i think some accounts

00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:22,639
got reaped or something

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:25,599
so that may have unexpectedly uh removed

00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,599
some of their pipelines

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,520
and then with some of the more component

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,880
projects i know the cli has been working

00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,319
on resolving

00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,400
a log cache interaction issue with the

00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,199
v7 cli i think if there are some apps

00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,960
that have

00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,560
zero instances running then the cli can

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,759
really hammer the log cache endpoints if

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,560
it's trying to get data for apps that

00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,080
aren't there

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,199
but they're expecting to have a release

00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,720
out to fix that pretty soon

00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,720
and the happy folks have been continuing

00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,720
to work on some of the manifest diff

00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,240
uh work that i've mentioned before

00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,800
they're also starting work in earnest

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,680
on some additional roles related to app

00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,199
management

00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,639
i know there's been some proposals that

00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,520
have been circulated about that recently

00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,639
but i think they're

00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,120
starting to build those out on the irene

00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,560
side

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,720
they're continuing to do work on

00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:10,879
refining the crd versions

00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:13,199
of their rest api endpoints

00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:15,120
they've also recently been looking at uh

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,520
in more detail at the feasibility of

00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,680
using a kubernetes deployment uh to back

00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,400
an app and uh what what the consequences

00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,759
of that

00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,520
with some of the different indexing

00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,520
might be

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,840
a couple other updates i know networking

00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,680
has fixed some port collision issues on

00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,879
the tcp router bosch job

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,039
uh where it would occasionally collide

00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,560
with some other deployed jobs uh they're

00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,080
also looking more seriously at upgrading

00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,000
to nats 2.x apparently there's some

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,120
really good performance benefits

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,159
that we would get from upgrading to

00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,920
that version of the nat system uh and

00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,399
then finally uh the logging metrics

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,600
folks

00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,839
they've been working on improving some

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,560
pipelines to handle pr contributions and

00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,839
making that a lot smoother

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,839
anyway so those are just some of the

00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:58,480
highlights happy to answer any questions

00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,480
if people have them

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,440
a couple other things i wanted to

00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,800
mention i know cappies started running

00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,320
monthly office hours that should be on

00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,760
the cff calendar

00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,959
uh i think logging and metrics might be

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,640
doing that too although i'd have to

00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:17,440
check the calendar

00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,959
um and then fridays i forget which

00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,680
friday of the month but uh yeah

00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,160
it's friday logging metrics fun yeah and

00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,080
then

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,720
i think i mentioned this previously but

00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:29,760
um uh we recently had

00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:33,200
um uh in the past month or so a document

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,839
um uh trying to set out uh the future

00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,480
vision

00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,440
of what all the cf on cape's activity

00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,600
should really look like

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,800
and we've been having some really active

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,360
discussions

00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,399
in the cfa kate's sig meeting um every

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,440
other tuesday morning

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,959
um pacific time uh evening european time

00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,399
so i think we're expecting that to

00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,440
continue we started talking a little bit

00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,000
more about

00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,279
the potential technical architecture uh

00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,399
that would underlie that

00:09:55,279 --> 00:10:01,040
um and and how it might mesh with um

00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,760
both uh supporting the cf-api on top of

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,880
that

00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,600
but introducing some more native crd

00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,519
resources

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,720
in the kubernetes api that would

00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,920
correspond to some of the cloud

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,519
controller entities

00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:15,440
so again uh really um uh ask if you're

00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,839
interested feel free to drop into that

00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,959
and join those discussions because

00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:20,720
that's something that

00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,240
you know we we know is a super important

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,480
direction for the community

00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,839
and uh you know we we want to make sure

00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,680
that we have a clear pathway forward

00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,680
that everyone is aligned on

00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,920
great uh thank you eric um do we have

00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:40,480
anyone from the bosch

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,480
pmc i don't believe so um

00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,480
okay um well there is one big news out

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,519
of the bosch world and that's that

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,079
bionic stem

00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,880
cell hit v 1.1 which is the official ga

00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:51,680
release

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:53,440
and i know that um was big news for a

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,720
lot of folks who are relying on that so

00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,800
that's great news a lot of work went

00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,519
into that um so congrats

00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,000
um on wrapping that up um i don't have

00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,839
any

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,760
um big updates from extensions um per se

00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,360
i will say if anyone's interested the

00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,279
last cab call last

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,839
month uh for folks that weren't there

00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:14,480
it's a really great presentation from um

00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,680
keto cloud native build pack folks um on

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,600
basically everything you could want to

00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:21,360
know about

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:23,680
you know buildbacks v2 and

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,560
newer cloud native bill packs and vocato

00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,839
so

00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,160
you can watch that video at your leisure

00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:30,560
um

00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,240
so yeah uh take a look at that if you

00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,200
want to get a more of a deep dive into

00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,760
picado

00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,959
um where that video is posted it's in

00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,399
the cab call um

00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,240
so it's on our youtube channel but it's

00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,440
also in the cab channel on slack just

00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,839
scroll up a little bit and you'll see it

00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,839
there

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,040
um and with that does it well before we

00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,680
move on to our presentation today does

00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,279
anyone have

00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:57,839
anyone else have any other topics they

00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:57,839
want to bring up

00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,320
okay uh and with that we've got uh

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,600
michael ferriss of stark and wayne

00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:11,600
uh talking about carousel

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,040
thanks chris all right so i'll keep this

00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,560
uh

00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,000
presentation pretty quick but i'm pretty

00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,160
excited about this like you mentioned

00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,720
carousel is for rotating credits

00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,399
uh within credit hub which is enough to

00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,680
be excited in the first place i'm also

00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,120
really excited about it because i'm

00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,920
someone who's spent like

00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,680
anyone who's uh done any deploying you

00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,079
spend a lot of time debugging why isn't

00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,720
this

00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:34,320
uh deploying based on and you need to go

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,600
poking around in cred hub

00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,519
and you end up with a lot of stuff in

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,000
cred hub and you're not exactly sure

00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,440
of what's being used uh which deployment

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,959
is using which credit hub and so

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:47,839
basically carousel

00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:49,680
provides a bosch aware uh interface

00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,040
into credit help to show you exactly

00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,240
what is being used so i'm going to share

00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:56,000
my screen here

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:58,160
and show you what i'm talking about so

00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,079
let me exit over here let me go back one

00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:04,200
step and show you how we got here

00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:06,560
all right so carousel just takes in

00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:09,200
a couple of environment variables to

00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:12,079
talk to credit hub and bosch obviously

00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,360
and so the first uh first aspect that

00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,639
i'm talking about here is the browse

00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,959
feature that's what i'm talking about

00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,120
with

00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:18,560
being able to see what's going on in

00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,600
your credit hub

00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,440
and being able to jump around in a way

00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,399
that's a little easier than just doing

00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,160
uh

00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:30,959
credit hub gets and continuously

00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,680
typing in those keys and everything and

00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,200
so

00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,360
you can basically just walk through your

00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,440
entire credit like a tree

00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,399
uh and see information on the sides

00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,519
about

00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,839
what's going on with each of your

00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:45,199
certificates so for example

00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:47,040
we end up with this nice view of our

00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,000
certificate information about when it

00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,839
expires

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,519
what deployment is using it that's

00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,880
something that i find very

00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:56,480
useful as opposed to coming into credit

00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,160
hub and not necessarily knowing like

00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,720
with these that they're not being used

00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,720
by anything

00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:05,360
um

00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,279
so yeah i find that useful and from

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,040
within here you can do

00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,399
uh you could delete if you had a bunch

00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,639
of unused stuff

00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,480
it does as it should give you a

00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,519
recommendation not to do this

00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,959
manually it could lead to an

00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:21,839
inconsistent state um

00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:23,920
and you can toggle transitional from

00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:27,040
here

00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,639
and this is a the whole tool is a work

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,720
in progress we've got a couple of

00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,320
to do's you'll see if you download this

00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,399
right now you'll see a couple of uh

00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,920
obvious to do's but we're excited about

00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:38,560
it i wanted to show it off

00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,040
um so if we so that's the browse one of

00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,959
the four

00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:46,639
uh commands then we obviously also have

00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:48,160
carousel rotate which so if i do that

00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,800
i'll show you kind of the options we've

00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:53,839
got here you can do something like

00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:57,360
carousel rotate anything that expires

00:14:53,839 --> 00:15:00,480
within uh two weeks

00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:03,360
and just filter based on stuff like that

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:06,240
based on the name let's do a carousel

00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,240
rotate of everything

00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,959
and what it's going to do is show that

00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,720
we've got

00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:14,240
a couple of things to rotate but mostly

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:18,320
we have a lot to clean up that's not

00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,320
being used and so we will continue

00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:23,600
and it starts cleaning that up for us

00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,600
and then it will start rotating

00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,440
and then the uh so there are four

00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,240
commands that carousel provides

00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,560
currently the

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,680
third is carousel diff which once this

00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,920
completes

00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:36,000
it will show us the fact that these have

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,680
been changed but that they're not being

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,360
used by the bosch

00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,720
uh it'll show us basically what's going

00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:44,000
to happen when we do a

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,000
subsequent bosch deploy

00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,240
which again is just useful to wash

00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:51,279
awareness being being aware of

00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:54,240
which credits are being used by uh which

00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:55,759
deployment is something that

00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,759
i find useful and would have found

00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,440
useful many times in the past

00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,880
so i'm very happy about this too mr

00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,800
ferris quick question

00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,480
uh does this just work against the

00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,279
certificates that are in cred hub or is

00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:09,199
there anything for the passwords as well

00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,320
uh my understanding is that it works for

00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:15,839
everything

00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:15,839
gotcha also for passwords

00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,040
and um yeah we can just do any more

00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,880
questions we don't have to sit here and

00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,940
watch this in silence

00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,940
[Music]

00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,240
the other good feature about this is

00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,680
that when you have a

00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,440
your security team that wants to know

00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,720
what's going on with certificates and

00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,720
stuff like that

00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,320
you you actually will browse it and show

00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,320
them the information and

00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,880
you don't have to keep you know going

00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,800
back and forth you just literally just

00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,720
give them the tool and do do what they

00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,240
want and

00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,759
they shouldn't really cause very much

00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,399
damage as long as they

00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:56,320
you know don't run other commands so

00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:59,199
that is also helpful to

00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,199
some of our clients

00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,839
um there are currently there is nothing

00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,280
deployed

00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:10,480
in the probably in your setup

00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,400
yeah it seems like i might be pointing

00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,280
at the wrong bosch but that's okay i

00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,199
didn't intend on

00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,199
uh watching making everybody sit through

00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:20,160
a bosch deploy anyway

00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:22,799
um yeah we can conclude there anybody

00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,799
have any questions

00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:32,400
can you talk about the the three-step uh

00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:35,120
rotation oh yeah so from here

00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,919
um maybe ramon might be better to talk

00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,039
about this but

00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:39,200
my understanding is that from here

00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:41,840
you'll have uh

00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,280
you'll end up with transitionary uh

00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,360
certificates and then after

00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,440
you do your deploy you can rotate again

00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:50,400
and redeploy to get your final

00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,400
rotated certificates

00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:57,120
so yeah there are two uh you need to

00:17:54,240 --> 00:18:00,799
basically need to do two deployments now

00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:04,400
two instead of the three

00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:09,120
but it will create um so the bosch

00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:12,880
uh cred hop will um create a certificate

00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:15,440
with the old certificate um

00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,320
attached to it and then you will do and

00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,679
then you will do a

00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,600
wash deployment and then your next

00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,520
rotate will basically clean up

00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,240
and remove the old certificate then it

00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:27,280
will create a new version in credo

00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:29,120
with only the new certificate and then

00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:33,280
you can deploy

00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:33,280
uh your deployment again

00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,960
so this is just yeah

00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,840
thanks

00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:59,039
anything else

00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:00,960
would it be nice maybe to just i've

00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,320
created a small deployment and then you

00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:07,039
know do an actual rotate

00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:07,039
but i wasn't

00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,400
sure how much time we were going to have

00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:13,840
here

00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,840
keep it quick um

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:20,320
yeah i was going to one second but

00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:22,559
yeah here you can see if you select on

00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,880
that you will see that bosh is using

00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:26,720
that

00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:29,360
so you could you enter again on this

00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:31,600
entry oh yes then you will see the

00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:34,400
deployment is using by

00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:37,039
that current deployment strongly

00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,039
mislabeled

00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,600
and it's not carousel that's mislabeled

00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:44,880
it but it's uh what the deploy

00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,880
the bosch deployment is called

00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:54,559
i think that's a cfd now the dns

00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:58,080
healthcheck tls and dns

00:19:54,559 --> 00:20:01,280
api tlsca are specifically used by

00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:04,880
by polish itself so

00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:09,360
if you call your bosch now labs yes

00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:11,520
then it's a bit misleading

00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:14,159
we played too much with the demo

00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,159
beforehand

00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,840
you can try and see what

00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:36,080
yeah so mostly so all it did was clean

00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,080
up then so

00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,360
yeah i could have made a better demo

00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,080
state

00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,080
starting state

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:47,520
so the the div command shows you what

00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,880
you need to deploy

00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:52,400
so once what affects that certificate

00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,080
or passwords whatever else you have to

00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:57,520
do so what you can do

00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:58,400
is uh like i said you can do carousel

00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:03,190
rotate

00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:05,840
and then you can do uh older than

00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:10,960
[Music]

00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:10,960
older then and then just one day

00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,400
basically

00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,919
oh yeah because it defaults to 12 weeks

00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:31,200
okay thanks so now

00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:35,120
all these will regenerate it yeah

00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:38,159
okay so yeah so what what happens here

00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:40,240
is we prevent uh uh

00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:42,400
passwords this is a good showcase by the

00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,640
way we prevent that password that has

00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:47,580
been manually set and not generated

00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,640
by credit hub we are

00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:52,240
[Music]

00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:54,159
not rotating that password

00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,400
it's probably you did it for a reason

00:21:54,159 --> 00:22:01,039
that you didn't generate a password and

00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:01,039
you put in a password here manually

00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:08,880
so then you can do like minus name with

00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:13,200
string and then you can do like the

00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:16,400
default encryption like i don't know

00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,400
yeah okay

00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,880
yeah let's call anything we'd call like

00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,880
dns

00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:41,840
no you just need to name the dns health

00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:41,840
check c8

00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:55,840
oops it did not copy well

00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:12,400
yeah and then you still need to do uh

00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:15,520
older than because

00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:17,440
by default it will check for a

00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:23,840
certain amount of weeks i think 12 weeks

00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:23,840
now probably yeah you're right

00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:38,960
this is also deployed today

00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,440
you probably rotated during testing yeah

00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,760
right

00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:46,320
okay yeah yeah sorry

00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,760
can you try uh because it tries to

00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:50,799
regenerate the ua

00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:52,880
uh default decryption passphrase

00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:55,679
that is generated but it's not a

00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,679
certificate but

00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:01,440
no it's not in there anymore because you

00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:04,320
cleaned everything up

00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,960
if you now do a diff it will say there

00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,960
is something wrong

00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,840
we should have better prepared this demo

00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,840
yeah yeah

00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:27,919
all right well we can uh

00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,919
end it there

00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,760
well this is the excitement of live

00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,159
demos and

00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,960
we get the super cool tool pretty

00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:40,640
powerful

00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,640
um no worries

00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,000
for me the thing that excites me about

00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:49,520
it is that it solves a very common

00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,559
challenge at client sites

00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,120
uh yeah a lot of manual time is reduced

00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:55,360
greatly

00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:57,360
that's that's the biggest like win right

00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,799
there yeah for sure

00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,640
the other big win you're able to see the

00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:02,559
whole thing at once you don't you don't

00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,799
see one things at a time you actually

00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:06,559
see the whole tree and figure it all out

00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:08,159
that usually helps a lot

00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:09,919
when you're trying to you know work

00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,559
through some of these relationships

00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:13,840
where

00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:16,400
something breaks because of the

00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,200
are broken so you can actually see the

00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,679
chaining that

00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,679
goes on

00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:29,440
yeah development on that is going to

00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:30,799
continue

00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,120
flush out some of those to do's i

00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:33,120
mentioned

00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,400
very cool um well thank you very much

00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,880
michael

00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,799
and ramon and everyone else starting

00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,520
waiting um

00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:48,799
and i guess uh is there anything else

00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:55,919
we're missing anything else

00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:57,279
last minute topics and wants to bring up

00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:00,559
okay well with that

00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:03,679
uh thank you all for joining um

00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:04,720
we will see you on the third wednesday

00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:06,320
of june

00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,000
don't know what day that is exactly off

00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,880
the top of my head but uh looking

00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,200
forward to that

00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,240
and uh yeah thanks all for joining and
