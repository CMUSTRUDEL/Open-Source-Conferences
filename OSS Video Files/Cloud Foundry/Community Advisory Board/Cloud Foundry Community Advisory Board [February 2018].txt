be my back I need to let somebody in

00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:30,090
alright exactly it's stacking up folks a

00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:43,979
here Lou thing going on a pivotal here

00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:45,780
I'm hoping it's not a pyro long it might

00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,619
be fire wrong but you're not asking us

00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:50,420
to be yourself

00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:50,420
maybe it's it's far away

00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:58,410
okay

00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:00,390
let's give people maybe a few more

00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:02,200
minutes to join I can see we got a nice

00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:04,290
book

00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:08,210
[Music]

00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:12,680
I know there are some people coming down

00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:12,680
so we should be able to get started soon

00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:17,950
you

00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:27,560
by the way anybody that knows how to

00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:31,200
figure out how why Google Calendar keeps

00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:33,480
sending a new invite when you make a

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,670
chain to like public calendar because I

00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:38,610
think in my calendar person founder I

00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:41,489
have something like six version of the

00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:44,310
CF cap month people and I should really

00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:46,500
have to and the reason is because I keep

00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:49,470
making some small chain that somebody

00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:53,250
says invite me so I invite them in add

00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:56,209
one more so if you know how to fix this

00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,209
I'd be very grateful

00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:04,360
[Music]

00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:14,760
hey Eric all right we got a crowd I see

00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:16,739
on the property of 801 so that's 40 more

00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:23,459
minutes and it will get started the two

00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:23,880
speakers over here actually doing good

00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:27,750
Eric

00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:34,350
yeah long nights hope not as long as

00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:38,810
yours we have a little party at after

00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:41,810
index CFD I went to a little dinner

00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:46,549
representing new south and myself too

00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:50,519
but I was able to say hey how I'm good

00:03:46,549 --> 00:03:53,100
so there we go in image it was an image

00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:55,760
from idea alright so a couple more

00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,760
minutes and we get

00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:31,410
all right so actually you can probably

00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:35,190
start recording if you want to start

00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:40,850
that it will start in about 30 seconds

00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:40,850
at 8:03 then like to anything

00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:50,010
okay that fire alarm stopped a little

00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,370
happy yeah I just think it's a fire oh

00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:58,080
my

00:04:50,370 --> 00:05:03,930
no it's the stairwell alarm all right so

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:10,890
they don't you know I'm sure people

00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:15,680
would start okay so thank you for coming

00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:20,010
to the cat ball second one of the year

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:22,730
there is we have two speakers so been

00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:27,390
throwing up from Peduto will be

00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:31,350
discussing the CF Docs so Anna and I had

00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:33,570
a chat with him and and you'll see it's

00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:36,420
really good it's a short meeting short

00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:38,220
discussion about CF Doc's attorney you

00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:40,890
know make sure you try to listen to this

00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:43,740
because we need help so so then we'll

00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:46,080
talk about that the other part of the

00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:52,190
presentation it's going to be here still

00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:55,700
from SAT this is the team in Sofia and

00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:57,990
they actually have a lot to discuss so

00:05:55,700 --> 00:06:00,270
we'll try to give them as much time as

00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:05,070
possible I told about 20 to 25 minutes

00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:08,040
hey juice on my VM so we usually get

00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:10,590
started with kind of overview of the

00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:13,320
different PMC's so this try could be

00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:15,330
short but obviously give us much you

00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:17,400
know updates that you want I'll just

00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:20,550
kind of time it so that we can make sure

00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:22,410
the speakers are some time so maybe

00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:25,340
we'll start with Shana you can tell us

00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:27,300
what's happening with cff coming busting

00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:28,610
registration count all this good stuff

00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:31,500
we'll be ready

00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:35,190
sure I don't have the registration

00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:37,440
numbers quite on hand but I think we are

00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:40,350
definitely on track similar to what we

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,540
were in the in terms of the registration

00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:45,510
numbers as it pertains to North America

00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:47,280
last year I do have one quick

00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:50,940
announcement in terms of Cloud Foundry

00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:53,100
days we just announced or we just watch

00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:55,380
the website live but we are gonna have a

00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:58,680
Cloud Foundry day at cloud native con

00:06:55,380 --> 00:07:01,770
Cuba in Copenhagen so I will drop the

00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:04,920
link in the cab called meeting notes and

00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:10,080
also here in the zoo Channel but the

00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:11,910
event is on May 1st so the Cloud Foundry

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,340
day which will be run by the foundation

00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:16,710
is on May 1st in Copenhagen the call for

00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:19,950
papers is now open the one thing that

00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:21,900
the events team wanted us to emphasize

00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:23,850
to the community is that this time there

00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,500
will not be an extension for the CFP

00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:29,220
deadline because we just don't have the

00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:31,830
time to manage that extension leading up

00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:34,080
to the event so the CFP hard deadline

00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:36,360
close date is March 16th

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:39,630
we still have abundant time but I just

00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:41,310
wanted this crew to know that there will

00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:44,280
not be an extension for the call for

00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:46,590
papers we are taking in the seeking

00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:49,950
proposals starting I mean it started

00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:52,919
last week but it will close Mar 16 the

00:07:49,950 --> 00:08:00,240
event is on May 1st in Copenhagen

00:07:52,919 --> 00:08:02,520
alongside Q calm the the schedule for

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,580
Cloud Foundry summit is coming through

00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:09,240
well we will have several events on day

00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:11,970
0 like the hackathon user day we are

00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:14,370
also looking at one other technical

00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:16,290
project hours project Alcazar's kind of

00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:18,510
a day that's still in the works we will

00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:20,760
announce we will announce that shortly

00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:23,910
as well and I think that most of the

00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:24,930
agenda is on the website already on the

00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:28,650
website already if you have any

00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:31,590
questions or any other kind of concerns

00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:41,430
or feedback in terms of summit Boston

00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:46,730
drop us a note we said me March 15th is

00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:46,730
the deadline right or the 16th yes

00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:55,450
any question for I guess data or the

00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:57,670
team I see Chris Klug is here

00:08:55,450 --> 00:09:00,730
you don't know Chris anything you need

00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:02,770
done he's actually the guy into does it

00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:05,980
in terms of like all the get up and so

00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:08,040
on some good person you know places on

00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:10,630
them

00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:16,350
alright thank you guys for coming

00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:16,350
yesterday both crates in the corner of a

00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:22,960
thank you that was fun thank you for

00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:24,760
having us and it was definitely a strong

00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:28,030
agenda that you put together

00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:29,830
not much yeah people just sure when I

00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:31,090
sent him an email so I'm kind of happy

00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:35,140
about that I don't know how long that's

00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:39,670
gonna last point since there's acquired

00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:41,560
two people we had Megan on Google so

00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:43,360
that was great and then both of these

00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:46,690
guys they're Eric and Jules where it's

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:49,330
part of it so thank you for though so

00:09:46,690 --> 00:10:02,440
anyway I'll try to put some video when I

00:09:49,330 --> 00:10:04,570
get a chance okay so you II just walked

00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:13,000
in just some time so maybe you can tell

00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:16,660
us what's going on we we have notes on

00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,910
on the PMC notes repo I should have

00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:21,930
haven't been sending them out bi-weekly

00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:25,780
as I intended to I cannot even put

00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:30,640
there's a bunch of updates there leading

00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:38,589
to high vacuum it's either they have

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:41,410
envoys in containers but the first use

00:10:38,589 --> 00:10:46,440
case where that is improving route

00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:53,770
integrity for HD he based apps so that

00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:56,020
containers can reject connections that

00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:58,270
aren't intended for it taking advantage

00:10:56,020 --> 00:11:01,379
of the instance identity certificates

00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:04,199
but Diego has

00:11:01,379 --> 00:11:08,939
so that's really exciting service

00:11:04,199 --> 00:11:14,549
discovery so for internal routes is also

00:11:08,939 --> 00:11:16,739
now there and looking for feedback so so

00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:18,329
you can now create a kind of internal

00:11:16,739 --> 00:11:21,779
route but it doesn't have to go out and

00:11:18,329 --> 00:11:26,009
around you do still need to like allow

00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:30,749
network access and whatnot but but there

00:11:26,009 --> 00:11:35,879
is an internal route that can be

00:11:30,749 --> 00:11:41,069
assigned to your app sir let's see Jules

00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:43,920
has updates this so I guess the the two

00:11:41,069 --> 00:11:46,439
things big quite tiny thing is on Monday

00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:49,110
we're incepting on putting in container

00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:51,089
D and so you have a kind of consistent

00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:54,629
operator experience hopefully actually

00:11:51,089 --> 00:11:57,360
used to container be show time some nice

00:11:54,629 --> 00:12:00,119
deployment scenarios and we've also hope

00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,619
to release in the next couple of days as

00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:04,110
soon as I push the button and finish

00:12:01,619 --> 00:12:06,389
accepting things we think we've improved

00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:08,519
the garbage collection China has been a

00:12:06,389 --> 00:12:10,799
pain point for a lot of people for a

00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:12,959
long time I think we finally figured out

00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:16,079
a low-hanging fruits way of doing the

00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:17,699
garbage collection that that should tide

00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,669
us over for a little while and so we can

00:12:17,699 --> 00:12:22,589
do something much better

00:12:19,669 --> 00:12:25,019
but basically look out for the release

00:12:22,589 --> 00:12:27,110
notes on the next garden because that'd

00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:29,819
be some opting that you'll have to do

00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:32,579
but hopefully the upshot should be that

00:12:29,819 --> 00:12:36,239
we can take care of all the sizing of

00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:38,730
the cache that we have and operators

00:12:36,239 --> 00:12:40,860
will no longer have to guess fairly

00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:43,379
unguessable values which was the old

00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:47,519
situation this is my garden collection

00:12:43,379 --> 00:12:49,139
and go run time writer in right so

00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,299
garbage collection of their of the

00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:52,679
docker image layers and and the roots

00:12:51,299 --> 00:12:54,509
are actually things like that which

00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:57,149
before was a bit of a black heart that

00:12:54,509 --> 00:12:59,089
confused a lot of people including me so

00:12:57,149 --> 00:13:02,910
we missing needs may be a bit better

00:12:59,089 --> 00:13:04,589
do you know for kubernetes creo is using

00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:06,389
container D or did they just read

00:13:04,589 --> 00:13:11,189
something else themselves just using

00:13:06,389 --> 00:13:13,130
color yeah so so crea so so CRI is the

00:13:11,189 --> 00:13:16,220
equipment of garden really

00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:17,840
in kubernetes so CRI is the container

00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:20,690
own climbing today so it's their API

00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:22,910
that the Kubla uses to abstract it from

00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:24,680
container and finds in the same way that

00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:28,220
garden abstracts the a go from container

00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:30,770
Empire so CRI is like the clue specific

00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:33,430
glue and then there are two

00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:37,580
implementations of that and there's one

00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:40,370
called Creole which is very similar to

00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:43,760
our current garden run see it directly

00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:47,750
spins up grunty so I just blues run see

00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:51,080
into Ruben Enys I mean there's also one

00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:54,230
called CRI container team which uses

00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:57,680
container D to glue run C into

00:13:54,230 --> 00:14:00,200
kubernetes so we're kind of moving

00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:02,390
within garden from approach one which is

00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:04,760
Korean to approach to which you see all

00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:06,800
right container B and one of the big

00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:08,210
advantages that is you then whether

00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,890
you're in dock or a human aliens or

00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:11,750
Cloud Foundry you're going to have

00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:14,210
container D at the bottom level so it

00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:16,000
just to me it was just share a bit more

00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:18,290
stuff between all the different runtimes

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,910
this is where the cube community is

00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:22,190
moving as well they switching to

00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:24,020
container D based implementation so I

00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:26,810
mean I don't want to talk to me Cuban

00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:28,190
Andes community but it's only seems like

00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:30,830
there's a fair bit of momentum behind

00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:32,690
container B I think decays asking didn't

00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:34,850
meet that the same the same dishes I

00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:36,950
think at the moment they're kind of

00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:38,510
letting all flowers clue and then they

00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:40,100
put the co in the same way that we look

00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:41,360
on it so we can have lots of runtimes at

00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:44,720
the back and you don't really care that

00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:46,910
much they have CRI so you've got C all

00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,770
right doctor I just seem like it's going

00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:51,770
away and then cRIO

00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:53,540
and see how I container D and maybe

00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:55,430
eventually people standardized of one of

00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:57,020
the other obviously in Cloud Foundry

00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:59,630
we've got a bit of a more curated

00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:01,280
situation so our team a garden theme has

00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:04,460
decided that we kind of like that

00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:05,390
contain of the approach so provisional

00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,950
Ealing something we haven't done yet

00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:08,990
we've looked them you think it's the

00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:10,310
right approach for us let's share a bit

00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:12,680
more code and if you could pull the

00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:14,720
stories that we like we're gonna try and

00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:16,310
go down that path if it turns out

00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,390
doesn't work we'll back out and go back

00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:22,339
to something that looks a lot more like

00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:24,650
creo Inception is to is to start the

00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:27,020
investigation yeah so we've done some

00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:29,540
investigation already we despite for a

00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:32,000
so we have pocs that look like they work

00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:33,710
a look pretty promising so we we feel

00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,750
fairly confident the moment us it's

00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:38,060
going to be a promising direction

00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:39,560
obviously we're agile and you know if it

00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,370
says that we hit a roadblock we'll back

00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,230
up

00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:45,380
we don't think it's a massive amount of

00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:46,760
work for us to pull it in because I

00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:49,190
actually match this kind of a component

00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:50,900
we already have that pre-exists because

00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:53,360
we really could garner one seat before

00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:55,850
container the existed sure so we have

00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,860
some components that's very similar but

00:15:55,850 --> 00:16:01,010
actually we took a very similar approach

00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:03,170
to container B so it look quite similar

00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:06,100
so it's quite easy for us to pull in we

00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:11,120
think so it feels like the right move

00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:12,800
but I don't think it will be everything

00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,720
operators already notice much in the

00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,360
same way that one day we switched on

00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,190
gardener and see for everyone and God

00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,260
Linux went away and it was mostly

00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:23,210
visible to people who are using CF

00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:25,270
release this should be mostly you'll

00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:28,300
just get it for free

00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:31,910
Dimitri any other conference oh come now

00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:36,500
I was just curious what you know the

00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:38,000
other community is is is doing a in a

00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:41,450
sense that if they're just gonna stick

00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,870
with the non container D version you

00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:46,910
know why bother for us to go there I

00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:50,330
will say so

00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:52,040
our current plan at least to begin with

00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:53,180
is if you will have the options opposed

00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:55,940
so the idea is we're going to maintain

00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:57,470
our own thing to begin with especially

00:16:55,940 --> 00:17:00,110
because containment he doesn't have

00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:01,820
window supports and then if you put a

00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:04,880
bot property with the container these

00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:06,560
sockets on to garden then will delegate

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,870
to container B so the task that

00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:10,880
container B does so it's going to be

00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:14,870
opting to begin with and you can use

00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:17,000
container B and then if it plays out and

00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:19,550
does everything we need then we might as

00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,920
well get rid of our runner thing and use

00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:25,160
the shed component okay let's move on

00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:27,410
from this but I think dog Davis was part

00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:29,420
of IBM in part of the coop he's

00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:31,070
mentioning that coop is officially not

00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:33,920
trying to do if take a winner right

00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:36,850
let's make sure saying okay cool next I

00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,850
guess the attention to this

00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:43,350
David study in the release integration

00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:47,400
team Lucy f release into the Attic the

00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:48,150
last release path lens much celebration

00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:52,130
around here

00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:57,420
I know big congrats to David and it's me

00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:59,309
alright let's see it's kind of moved to

00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:00,990
Bosh on this Eric you have something

00:17:59,309 --> 00:18:02,460
quick to mention I know you mentioned

00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:04,170
there are interior work which is the

00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:07,470
main thing that Diego and revering have

00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:11,160
been shipping so Shannon sent out a post

00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:12,570
yep death about that Friday and we're

00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:15,590
definitely interested in feedback about

00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:19,350
it if you're interested in trying it out

00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:21,540
yeah so we're gonna cut a breaking

00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:23,250
change version of jagger release but if

00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:27,860
you're using CF deployment shouldn't

00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:30,120
thank you alright thanks thanks a lot

00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:31,890
I'm trying to move a little bit fast

00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:35,100
because we get to sleepers and I promise

00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:38,670
and some time but Dimitri we'd love to

00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:41,580
hear any updates highlights I guess from

00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:44,160
watch I know Danny's also Nicole you

00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:48,059
guys can jump in

00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:49,800
I got nothing too interesting we're

00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:54,059
continuing to work on our existing

00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:57,809
long-running items related to faster

00:18:54,059 --> 00:19:00,150
deploys and updates and just some

00:18:57,809 --> 00:19:04,200
miscellaneous work and stem cells and

00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:07,319
whatnot nothing to excite it this time

00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,319
[Music]

00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:18,330
you're more excited about some things

00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:20,610
and Danny gave a really nice talk

00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:24,000
yesterday on some of the new stuff

00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:27,020
happening on Bosh I'm hoping he gets a

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,640
chance to give it oh yeah summit so

00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:33,770
otherwise you can pay him I thought it

00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:37,559
was really good thank you for that Benny

00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:41,970
alright so maybe Matt Matt meaning he's

00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:44,010
the new West PMC chair for open

00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:45,570
serviceworker and Rochelle Davis was

00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:49,320
co-chair

00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:51,200
so any things you guys wanna mention

00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:54,820
dawg

00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,820
might actually mess Connecticut

00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:04,550
I'm just hiding somewhere yeah so with

00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:06,590
Alex lay changing roles Doug and I and

00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:08,720
our taking on his own responsibilities

00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:11,480
chairing the open service broker API

00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:14,870
group no major updates really on that

00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:15,950
we're still targeting the 214 hoping to

00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:18,980
get out in the next couple of weeks

00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:21,350
really there's a few new interesting

00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:23,360
features in there to do with a fetching

00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:25,250
service instances and bindings so you

00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,660
can do things like fetch any config

00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:29,420
parameters you use to configure those

00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:31,910
things and also supporting asynchronous

00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:35,240
bindings which is going to be useful for

00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:37,460
a few broad crosses there's a new kind

00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:40,160
of major initiative going on is to do

00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:43,370
with service instance actions so how a

00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:45,110
broker could in like a programmatic way

00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:46,640
using an opening key I don't expose the

00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:48,500
actions you can perform on a service

00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,570
instance and you guys can kind of build

00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:52,340
things around that to do is common life

00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:55,700
cycle stuff like backup and restore and

00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:57,050
starting and stopping instances so

00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:59,750
there's a whole lot of information on

00:20:57,050 --> 00:21:01,010
that on the and you get her group if you

00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:03,740
want to find out more or give us some

00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:11,420
feedback I think that's about it all

00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:13,790
right so just you move along I guess if

00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:15,410
you guys have question interweb menu or

00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:19,910
just put something in the chat and I'll

00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:22,040
read it for the two previous TMC's but I

00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:26,840
mentioned for extensions there's a

00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:28,640
couple of highlights so first you're

00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:30,500
gonna hear about the package I think

00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,690
there's quite a bit going on there so

00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:39,440
you're doing the team I'm gonna discuss

00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:42,170
this Stephen from pivotal has various

00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:44,270
updates so you can see from our release

00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:47,060
notes that our suspension quickly he has

00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:53,450
a bookshelf so the local project is

00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:54,950
moving strong and then also he has yes

00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:57,110
bill pack so I thought it was really

00:21:54,950 --> 00:22:01,340
cool like we have some experimental real

00:21:57,110 --> 00:22:04,430
time for act and then nginx and or or I

00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:07,260
guess the language or is

00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:10,830
exactly or even say statistics with yeah

00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:12,630
you're absolutely right and then another

00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:14,100
quick thing to mention so of course you

00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:16,140
can go to the notes and get all the

00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:18,990
updates there's quite a bit so don't

00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:20,520
just assume that I'm just highlighting

00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:22,800
with you

00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:24,960
the of course the Kubo projects moving

00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:27,180
along quite well and George has been

00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,160
very good at giving very detailed

00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:32,610
feedback on what's going on there so

00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:34,740
they've been you know cutting releases

00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:36,480
you know constant periods so if you're

00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:38,310
interested in that project make sure and

00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:43,740
and then final thing I wanna mention is

00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:45,840
that service fabric they have washed it

00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:48,420
all those support so basically they all

00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,950
sort of modernized for a Bosch so if you

00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:53,490
were interested in that project in order

00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:55,020
to dry definitely check it out okay and

00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:55,950
then there are a couple things coming

00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:59,070
down the pipeline

00:22:55,950 --> 00:23:01,350
hopefully emerge we'll see who we get to

00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:03,450
schedule it it's getting to a point now

00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:07,260
where we can only really do two talks

00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:08,970
for cattle but there is more than two at

00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:11,040
a time so we'll have to figure it out

00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:12,720
what we go in the future but that's

00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:18,390
that's about it for extensions alibied

00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:21,630
here so let's go to the I guess the main

00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:23,280
item for the week so we have been torn

00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:26,840
off from digital and then after that

00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:30,570
Mitchell then has a shorter presentation

00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:32,430
if you have questions obviously just put

00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:34,200
it on the slack on the chat and then

00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:36,060
we'll ask like well we should have a

00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,620
little bit of time even after then to

00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:40,200
ask some questions so Ben I think you on

00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:43,050
you mute so if you want you can okay you

00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:45,450
can share your screen also or perfect

00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:47,310
yeah so thanks so much for having me I'm

00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:48,780
Ben I'm on the pivotal Doc's team

00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:50,670
I've just got a very brief presentation

00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:52,830
want to give people a little bit more

00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:55,380
context on how the Cloud Foundry Doc's

00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:57,150
are made some of the challenges we're

00:23:55,380 --> 00:24:00,330
currently facing with those and

00:23:57,150 --> 00:24:03,350
hopefully how you all can can help so

00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:03,350
I'm gonna share my screen

00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:12,430
all right can you all see that

00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:14,380
yes brilliant all right so this is a

00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:16,480
very short presentation we can kind of

00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:18,640
run through it pretty quickly there's a

00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,990
very brief demo portion and that I'd

00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:24,250
love to hear any questions you might

00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:27,280
have all right so here is the state of

00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:29,580
the world to kick things off as I'm sure

00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:31,930
all of you know the Cloud Foundry Doc's

00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:35,680
currently live at Doc's Cloud Foundry

00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:39,340
org you haven't seen them recently this

00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:40,750
is what they look like who reads the

00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:43,540
Cloud Foundry Doc's just kind of

00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:45,880
understanding who our audiences are as

00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:48,010
far as we understand it we're looking at

00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:50,350
three audiences we're looking at

00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:53,110
operators obviously they need to know

00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:55,930
how to install configure and manage CF

00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:58,330
we're looking at developers who need to

00:24:55,930 --> 00:25:01,180
know how to run and manage their apps on

00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:02,980
Cloud Foundry and then we're looking at

00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:06,010
a third category that you could call

00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:08,260
tire kickers and others who want to know

00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:10,840
how Cloud Foundry works so these are the

00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:12,670
folks who consume our concept Docs who

00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:17,560
want to go a little bit deeper into the

00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:19,720
technology so without Doc's Cloud

00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:22,120
Foundry is unusable right all of these

00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:24,340
folks really rely on the docs to figure

00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:26,830
out how to deploy Cloud Foundry how to

00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:31,270
manage it how to get logs off it how to

00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:33,820
push their apps to it and so on now who

00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:35,920
writes the Cloud Foundry Doc's so the

00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:39,970
team I'm on pivotal Doc's team we

00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:42,340
oversee the documentation effort but we

00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:44,860
welcome contributions from other member

00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:46,750
companies of the foundation and from the

00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:49,120
community as a whole right so the

00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:51,010
community anyone who uses Cloud Foundry

00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,870
they sign the contributor License

00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:56,980
Agreement they can contribute to the

00:25:52,870 --> 00:26:02,490
documentation but in practice right now

00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:06,220
pivots right about 90% of the docs and

00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:08,290
you might ask why is that a problem so

00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:09,760
what we've discovered this is coming out

00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:12,520
of conversations that we've been having

00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:14,020
on the pivotal Doc's team is this is

00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:15,960
what we're worried about which is that

00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:18,460
when the Cloud Foundry Doc's depend

00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:20,710
overwhelmingly are primarily on pivotal

00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:22,540
we're worrying that the accuracy and

00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:25,600
completeness of the dachshund

00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:27,220
suffer as a result and it's not because

00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,630
we don't enjoy writing those dogs it's

00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:30,820
not because we're not passionate about

00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:33,340
Cloud Foundry but it's because we don't

00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:35,500
have as much time as we like to devote

00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:37,990
to the Cloud Foundry Doc's right we're

00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:42,220
spending a lot of time on PCF on PKS on

00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:45,490
these new commercial products and what

00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:47,920
we're worried about is less usable Doc's

00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:50,200
right that don't have that accuracy and

00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:52,450
completeness which may lead to fewer

00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:57,490
people using Cloud Foundry being

00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:59,980
successful with Cloud Foundry and again

00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:01,180
without those Doc's people can't use CF

00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:04,680
so that's what we're worried about

00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:04,680
from the pivotal Doc's team perspective

00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:09,700
so all member companies of the

00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:11,440
foundation have a stake right and the

00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:13,390
success of the Cloud Foundry project

00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:16,800
this is a conversation we're starting to

00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:19,420
develop with folks and other companies

00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:21,070
we want to make Cloud Foundry successful

00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:23,020
by ensuring the Doc's are giving

00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:26,530
operators and developers everything they

00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:30,010
would need to succeed so here's the call

00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:31,960
to action contribute to the Cloud

00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:33,610
Foundry Doc's now I know there are a lot

00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:35,620
of pivots on the call who are already

00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:37,780
contributing and non pivots that are

00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:39,130
already contributing so we thank you for

00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:43,360
those efforts but we really want to

00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:46,000
expand the pool of contributors how can

00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:48,070
you contribute so we've written a new

00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,410
guide to try to jumpstart this process

00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:52,030
called contributing documentation it's

00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:53,740
now the first topic in the Cloud Foundry

00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:56,470
Docs and we're going to look at it in a

00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:57,790
minute and you can see it here so it's

00:27:56,470 --> 00:28:02,620
at the very top of the southern Ave on

00:27:57,790 --> 00:28:04,750
the left there are various ways to

00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:06,310
contribute the easiest way and we've

00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:08,910
tried to streamline this process as much

00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:11,620
as possible is to use a pull request

00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:14,680
right so every topic and the Cloud

00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:17,740
Foundry Doc's lives on github as a

00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:19,780
markdown file and at the bottom of every

00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:22,000
topic you can actually find a link that

00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:24,850
will take you to the corresponding topic

00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,680
in the corresponding github repo and you

00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:30,910
can do a pull request right through

00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:32,890
there the thing I would emphasize here

00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:34,120
we're going to do a demo briefly but I

00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:35,750
think what we're trying to emphasize as

00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:37,400
much as possible is for folks

00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:39,740
not to worry too much about style and

00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:41,930
structure in the language you can just

00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:44,150
throw the raw data at us over the wall

00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:47,870
we just want it to be correct and

00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:51,440
complete as much as possible all right

00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:53,930
so I'm sure many of you have done pull

00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,160
requests on our Docs before we thought

00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:58,460
it would be useful just to do a very

00:28:55,160 --> 00:29:00,020
brief demo of how you might do this so

00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:03,140
this is the contributing documentation

00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:04,640
topic as you see there's actually a ton

00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:06,170
of information in here you can kind of

00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,940
go as deep as you want we wanted to

00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:12,980
provide as many resources as possible

00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:13,960
for people but at the very bottom like

00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:17,210
all the topics

00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:19,010
it has create a pull request or raise an

00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:21,890
issue on the source for this page and

00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:23,150
github right so let's say we were

00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:25,190
reading this topic we found something

00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:31,570
that was incorrect we click at the

00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:31,570
bottom and we can edit this in github

00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:43,100
can be a very small change right thanks

00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:49,270
typo and you won't be able to commit

00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:52,690
directly so it'll look like that and

00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:55,160
then we can create our pull request and

00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:56,900
we'll immediately be notified of that

00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,940
because that populates directly to our

00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:00,350
tracker and I have a link for that tract

00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:03,200
if you like to look at it later in the

00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:10,960
presentation the CF Docs public tracker

00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:10,960
so we'll get that right away all right

00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:17,300
so that's a pull request pretty simple

00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:19,550
process when does it make sense to

00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:22,030
update the docs so we basically have two

00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:24,020
scenarios right we have maintenance

00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:26,750
ensuring existing Doc's

00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:29,000
are accurate and complete this might be

00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:31,340
a good onboarding activity particularly

00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,590
if folks are coming in maybe two points

00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:34,910
yep for the first time pushing an app to

00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:36,470
see it for the first time doing

00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:37,970
something for the first time they might

00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:40,010
be looking at the docs and kind of

00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:42,050
reading them more closely that might be

00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:43,760
an opportunity if they see something

00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:46,250
that's inaccurate see something that's

00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:48,560
confusing or incomplete that could be an

00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:49,510
opportunity to submit a PR or even just

00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:53,170
raise an issue

00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:55,270
on that github repo second category of

00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:56,950
course is development right ensuring new

00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:59,950
Docs are written when new features are

00:30:56,950 --> 00:31:01,390
developed and the idea here of course is

00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:04,300
that the team that owns the feature owns

00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:06,460
the docs right so as sabeti was putting

00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:08,440
together the plan for CF deployment how

00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:10,810
they're gonna roll that out he reached

00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:12,460
out to me and we talked about how those

00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:16,900
Doc's are going to get developed what

00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:18,880
the operator needed to know so that's

00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:20,620
another option right for something like

00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:23,680
CF deployment that's obviously a lot

00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:25,540
bigger than just a PR so we're here and

00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:28,000
we want to hear from you if you're

00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:31,420
developing a new feature a new product

00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,650
something a little bit bigger there's a

00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:36,310
lot of ways to get in touch with us

00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:38,170
we're at CF - Doc's at pivotal i/o we're

00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:41,800
also in the CF Doc's Channel the Cloud

00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:44,470
Foundry slack and I will paste this link

00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:46,660
in this is our tracker the Cloud Foundry

00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:51,930
Doc's this is where all that github

00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:55,750
activity populates - as well we're also

00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:59,170
slowly starting to cultivate CF Doc's

00:31:55,750 --> 00:32:01,660
evangelists in member companies so I'm

00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:03,790
the point person for this again if

00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:07,660
you're at a company that's not pivotal

00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:10,000
and you want to push documentation

00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:11,740
practices within your organization drop

00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,860
me a line we can talk about what we're

00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:18,160
thinking right now and how we might

00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:20,830
widen the contributor pool for docs all

00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:23,500
right so I think that's the presentation

00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:27,820
I think we have a little time for

00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:33,790
questions like I think has something I

00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:36,850
can stop sharing yeah let's see if

00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:38,740
anybody puts it on the chat or if you

00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:44,310
want ask question remember you might be

00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:47,530
unused are you guys still using a

00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:49,120
bookbinder you guys decided to switch to

00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:51,910
something else I think what time I was

00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:55,200
chatting I forgive us who they were

00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:59,020
saying that you might be switching to

00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:00,580
make something to get the name yeah so

00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:03,590
MK docks is something we're actually

00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:05,120
using for the the CFC our Kubo

00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:08,270
so if you've looked at that site it's

00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:10,900
like a standalone dioxide so the answer

00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:14,750
is we are you still using bookbinder for

00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:19,460
most of our docs just one case of the

00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:21,320
CFC our Docs we're using MK Docs so it's

00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:23,120
an ongoing conversation I think we're

00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:24,830
actually trying to get the pub tools

00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:28,070
team which was the team that built the

00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:29,990
binder originally spun back up

00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:32,270
so hopefully book binder can be improved

00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:33,710
but I think that we do feel a little

00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:34,640
pain around the tools so that's

00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:38,570
hopefully something that will get

00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:42,650
improved in the future do think the new

00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:44,990
tool I keep on forgetting its name make

00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:47,500
dots will be something that ultimately

00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:49,940
will be used for all of the docs or I

00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:53,210
think it's possible I mean the services

00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:55,280
folks really like it the struggle with

00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:57,230
us with MK Doc's is that there's a few

00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:58,820
things that it doesn't seem to support

00:33:57,230 --> 00:34:00,230
natively that we would need a

00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:04,010
development team to build it out for us

00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:07,160
so support for multiple versions of the

00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:09,590
docs content sharing right in terms of

00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:13,159
how you would do single sourcing of

00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:14,690
material partials template variables so

00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:16,909
there's a few things we'd probably want

00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:18,950
to cross off the list before we can roll

00:34:16,909 --> 00:34:20,270
out MK Doc's more generally but

00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:24,190
hopefully those are the things that a

00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:29,450
new pub tools team could look at for us

00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:31,119
good maybe also putting something in in

00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:33,619
in the header

00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:37,310
please contribute or something and I'm

00:34:33,619 --> 00:34:39,109
with the link of pull request not

00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:41,780
everyone is crawling down to the page

00:34:39,109 --> 00:34:44,780
because they're lazy you means put the

00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:49,580
PR stuff up front contributor yeah yeah

00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:52,399
yeah it's a good idea I can do that yeah

00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:53,480
let me put I'll just put the link to the

00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:57,260
contributor guide in the chat for

00:34:53,480 --> 00:35:05,590
everybody cool we can still do another

00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:09,680
question okay well thank you Ben and

00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:11,650
I'll say one thing again not to try to

00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:14,869
compare ourselves to other communities

00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:16,920
but maybe I've been looking at you know

00:35:14,869 --> 00:35:18,840
communities and during the kubernetes

00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:20,370
their documentation is very extensive

00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:22,920
and it doesn't seem to be coming from

00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:24,180
one particular company so I think that's

00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:26,220
a good thing my coincidence even

00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:27,920
recently I saw it some books lady I'm

00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:30,390
talking about how we can increase

00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,430
contribution to their documentation so

00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:34,620
obviously that's why Ben is asking here

00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:37,050
alright let's do as a concerted

00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:39,630
community and effort concerted effort to

00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:42,090
to help so that pivotal doesn't have to

00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:43,980
carry the brunt of developing food so

00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:48,690
thank you for that then appreciate it

00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:51,170
ok so we're doing good on time so if you

00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:56,100
guys have questions for the previous

00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:59,070
discussions so as we set up let me kind

00:35:56,100 --> 00:36:00,870
of introduce the next one I wanted to

00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:02,700
have a lot of time for him because I

00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:04,920
started talking there's quite a bit he's

00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:08,460
gonna cover and there's also live demos

00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:10,950
so here's to you can take over and you

00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:14,970
can start sharing your screen I'll just

00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:18,480
briefly mention that the project abacus

00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:21,330
is is you're gonna hear about is a

00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:24,450
metering engine both on foundry

00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:27,420
it started at IBM but SAT sort of took

00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:30,240
it over and what you're gonna hear is

00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:33,090
not only version one and what's going on

00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:35,220
there but also exciting what's going on

00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:40,400
with version two and I think you might

00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:42,500
definitely want to hear about that and

00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:45,090
hear stories part of the team in

00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:50,310
Bulgaria so he has an entire team of

00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:57,620
them here stove yep yep online yes can

00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:57,620
you cure your screen yeah sure that's it

00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:06,780
yeah okay so let me start the

00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:07,500
presentation I want to talk about as

00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:10,620
Mark said

00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:12,900
Ilocos the current state the problems we

00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:17,490
have and why we actually want to start

00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:21,180
version two and I'm going to talk about

00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:23,220
why at all using something like a vocals

00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:26,310
while we need it what is the current

00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:28,290
architecture a short demonstration about

00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:31,080
what we have now

00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:35,150
then the broker project why we started

00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:39,060
it demonstration on one of our systems

00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:42,720
then as I said problem sent version to

00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:46,950
how we basically want to approach these

00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:50,100
problems so let's start with the first

00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:52,890
thing why abacus well because when you

00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:56,370
use your applications on desktop or

00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:59,550
mobile you basically consume our

00:37:56,370 --> 00:38:03,000
computer storage services and resources

00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:06,930
in the code being that Cloud Foundry

00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:08,880
kubernetes or yes whatever and you need

00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:13,940
basically to meter how much these

00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:16,950
resources are and what are the resources

00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:19,680
so you should be able to feed some

00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:24,270
billing engine and Indian get an invoice

00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:29,880
and monetize all these resources so you

00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:32,630
can benefit from this and abacus is

00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:37,200
actually the metering part of this

00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:39,120
pipeline so we what we do is basically

00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:41,580
meter how much resources you are using

00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:44,250
and we are doing some accumulation

00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:48,890
accumulation and aggregation so let's

00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:53,240
move to some short architecture sites

00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:57,360
there are a lot of components in abacus

00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:59,460
because we use pipeline so there are a

00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:03,960
lot of documents flowing into our

00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:07,700
pipeline and they're basically accepted

00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:10,800
then we do some modification we apply

00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:13,290
normalization for example if you want to

00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:16,710
say to us that there are new database

00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:18,870
that is 10 gigabytes and someone

00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:21,050
actually created an instance you post a

00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:23,970
small document I'll show it in a minute

00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:26,010
then we basically can convert either

00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:28,820
from gigabytes to bytes or from bus to

00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:34,190
gigabytes this is the metering component

00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:37,500
then we accumulate across organizations

00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:40,500
we basically accumulate across different

00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:42,450
documents and get you the current state

00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:45,119
of the database you

00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:48,020
probably you already had another thank

00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:51,450
you thank you goodbye database so we

00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:55,740
most probably will sum this up and we'll

00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:58,460
get current state of 20 gigabytes and

00:39:55,740 --> 00:40:01,200
then we basically aggregate the growth

00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:04,079
organization and spaces so in the end

00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:10,230
what you get out of abacus is basically

00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:12,050
a report that says how much resources

00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:16,260
you've been using in terms of

00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:19,140
organizations basis brakes breakdowns we

00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:22,859
also care for services breakdowns and

00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:24,599
things like that and since this is quite

00:40:22,859 --> 00:40:27,680
complex structure you can think

00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:30,930
favicon.ico blackbox and it's basically

00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:33,930
fitted with usage by different

00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:35,700
components that can be something quite

00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:36,960
current and providers we have two of

00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:39,060
these

00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:41,099
we bicycle Futaba coos with data about

00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:43,290
cloud foundry applications and

00:40:41,099 --> 00:40:46,700
co-founder services this is somehow

00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:51,540
generic and comes with the project but

00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:54,630
there can be service providers that want

00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:56,400
some more complex data and more complex

00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:59,190
calculations so they have their own

00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:03,560
logic or probably run time providers you

00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:06,359
can probably measure your own stuff with

00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:12,119
have a goose and get some reports in the

00:41:06,359 --> 00:41:14,900
end so this is the use user document we

00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:19,200
have and tit can be basically split into

00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:21,240
several parts when the resource

00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:25,410
consumption happened who is actually

00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:27,690
using the resources what we are using we

00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:30,180
have three fields about that basically

00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:33,900
that can be database we can have the

00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:38,099
plan and the service name and how much

00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:40,740
so this thing here then can be birds can

00:41:38,099 --> 00:41:42,329
be gigabytes and you're defining what

00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:44,910
this measure actually is and how to

00:41:42,329 --> 00:41:48,260
convert it from one unit to the other

00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:48,260
with the metering and

00:41:50,930 --> 00:42:03,099
yeah probably a short demonstration so

00:41:54,140 --> 00:42:03,099
let me show you how all this works okay

00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:11,809
so let me start a because the things you

00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:14,059
see here are all these small boxes we

00:42:11,809 --> 00:42:17,390
started locally of course you can push

00:42:14,059 --> 00:42:19,430
it to Cloud Foundry some applications or

00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:24,440
you can build ball deployments out of

00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:25,970
this and we have our demonstration

00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:27,500
application just to be sure that

00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:32,420
everything works we also use it for

00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:36,200
tests and what we see here is a lot of

00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:38,869
stuff but I want to show you these three

00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:44,630
lines basically we submitted 10

00:42:38,869 --> 00:42:46,400
gigabytes usage 1080i calls and 102

00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:50,690
heavy vehicles so you can submit

00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:51,380
multiple measures and build report out

00:42:50,690 --> 00:42:54,589
of these things

00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:57,829
and this long conk JSON file is actually

00:42:54,589 --> 00:43:01,819
the report with breakdowns of the

00:42:57,829 --> 00:43:03,920
different plants abacus plants the

00:43:01,819 --> 00:43:07,640
different spaces different consumers

00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:10,750
which is basically the applications and

00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:14,109
tindy and we have some numbers that

00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:18,740
aggregated for all these three documents

00:43:14,109 --> 00:43:20,720
so this is basically how abacus works

00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:26,349
using me to document and India and you

00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:29,569
get report out of it so this is nice but

00:43:26,349 --> 00:43:34,250
we recognize that we need a bit more

00:43:29,569 --> 00:43:39,170
because let's see why because we had to

00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:41,630
create our client and plan basically

00:43:39,170 --> 00:43:45,410
saying how this document should be

00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:46,970
processed how to convert from one unit

00:43:45,410 --> 00:43:52,400
to the other how to make the

00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:54,559
accumulation aggregation and either you

00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:57,049
do it manually which is not very nice

00:43:54,559 --> 00:44:00,230
especially if you careful out of these

00:43:57,049 --> 00:44:02,960
ones here the resource providers code or

00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:04,760
you'll do some automation so we decided

00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:07,670
to create a broker the

00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:11,750
basically automates these tasks for for

00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:15,320
us and lets directly go to the

00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:20,810
demonstration I'll show you later what

00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:25,370
actually we've done so I have yeah

00:44:20,810 --> 00:44:28,160
hopefully quandary okay and I have test

00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:36,260
application so I'm going to push this

00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:38,120
test application with now start just

00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:40,100
because it's pretty dummy and while it's

00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:42,830
pushing let me show you what we are

00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:46,760
actually doing so this is no

00:44:42,830 --> 00:44:51,890
justification that basically gets a

00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:55,130
token with the credentials we read from

00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:58,690
the environment and we have several end

00:44:55,130 --> 00:45:01,640
points like getting back the credentials

00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:04,720
getting this report out favicons with

00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:08,360
this end point and posting usage and

00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:17,150
we'll use just this end point here for

00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:22,790
getting the report let's go back to my

00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:26,690
console so we have metering service

00:45:22,790 --> 00:45:29,330
which is a Baku sent our broker I'll

00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:36,980
name it debacles so let's create this

00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:40,540
service point our application by the

00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:40,540
service to our application

00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:55,030
and start the application and well it's

00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:59,630
starting probably we can take a look at

00:45:55,030 --> 00:46:08,240
the service because there's interesting

00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:14,050
part here so we have this have a service

00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:14,050
and we provide dartboard

00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:33,800
so because we already bonded let's go to

00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:38,030
the third port and log in so it's a bit

00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:41,030
raw still but we intend to improve it a

00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:45,200
lot in the next version and what we

00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:48,230
actually have is simple measure and so

00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:53,330
you can change the measure you can

00:46:48,230 --> 00:46:57,550
change the metric names you can change

00:46:53,330 --> 00:47:02,510
actually the formulas we have for

00:46:57,550 --> 00:47:04,640
calculating and we have three formulas

00:47:02,510 --> 00:47:07,190
like metering accumulation aggregation

00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:10,100
and summarize I will not go into details

00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:15,470
probably that would be too much what I

00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:20,750
wanted basically to show is that we now

00:47:15,470 --> 00:47:23,690
have environment to our application and

00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:27,770
you can directly access your account

00:47:23,690 --> 00:47:29,600
with this credential and password you

00:47:27,770 --> 00:47:31,580
also have the endpoint where you should

00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:32,350
post your usage and that should be

00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:41,980
enough

00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:41,980
so let's actually access our application

00:47:49,790 --> 00:47:57,740
just verify it's working

00:47:54,350 --> 00:47:57,740
yeah probably

00:47:58,370 --> 00:48:05,100
yep okay so we have it working and from

00:48:03,210 --> 00:48:07,350
the report you can basically do a

00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:09,690
development like change these formulas

00:48:07,350 --> 00:48:11,190
try out different things and the one

00:48:09,690 --> 00:48:15,840
thing we are going to try is basically

00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:18,210
to submit document and see if we can

00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:20,880
read it with our application so I'm

00:48:18,210 --> 00:48:23,910
going to submit it's automatically

00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:26,220
generated it knows what the name sir if

00:48:23,910 --> 00:48:30,170
change something it will be changed as

00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:37,920
well here so we're going to submit 100

00:48:30,170 --> 00:48:39,930
API calls so and I will set that it

00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:53,340
accepted the usage and done some

00:48:39,930 --> 00:49:02,010
calculations if we now go back okay let

00:48:53,340 --> 00:49:04,530
me get tidy from here if you go oh if we

00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:07,650
go back and request the report form for

00:49:04,530 --> 00:49:11,490
our organization or in ICP we use

00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:15,540
identity zones from UA we get a lot of

00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:20,640
things again but the interesting part is

00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:31,860
that we should get this number we posted

00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:35,390
so let's try it out again okay so going

00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:35,390
back to

00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:49,109
the dashboard and I want to post one

00:49:43,299 --> 00:49:52,349
more time okay everything's working

00:49:49,109 --> 00:49:55,569
getting back the report we should have

00:49:52,349 --> 00:49:58,240
200 and that's because we have default

00:49:55,569 --> 00:50:00,809
for most that simply do some but there's

00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:04,000
nothing stopping you from defining or

00:50:00,809 --> 00:50:07,329
complex like multiplications minimum

00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:10,270
maximum whatever you basically want so

00:50:07,329 --> 00:50:14,500
you can do pretty complex stuff with

00:50:10,270 --> 00:50:18,569
abacus so getting back to the

00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:18,569
presentation and

00:50:21,530 --> 00:50:29,010
why I said because we want to automate

00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:31,860
how do we ultimate we you saw that we've

00:50:29,010 --> 00:50:33,600
done create and bounty instance through

00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:37,560
the service broker standard for but

00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:40,110
behind that we reach you a and create

00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:42,660
all quant so you can get a token and

00:50:40,110 --> 00:50:48,750
thought authenticate before have occurs

00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:51,600
and we also create a sample plan in

00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:54,930
abacus when you do some changes in this

00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:59,100
UI we update the plan so we automate

00:50:54,930 --> 00:51:02,010
everything so you simply can submit your

00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:05,790
usage that's why we want to have this

00:51:02,010 --> 00:51:08,610
service broker and also we have a lot of

00:51:05,790 --> 00:51:12,290
internal usage we don't want to take

00:51:08,610 --> 00:51:15,360
care about manual steps or dealing with

00:51:12,290 --> 00:51:17,220
guys that simply want to deploy their

00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:20,150
solution and start measuring it so

00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:25,980
that's why we have this service broker

00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:28,970
and I know should we leave time for

00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:36,180
questions here or should we continue

00:51:28,970 --> 00:51:40,410
probably you know we saw the point

00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:42,780
service and we are having problems with

00:51:40,410 --> 00:51:44,520
version one that's why we basically want

00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:48,740
to start version - let's see what

00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:51,420
problems we have well we currently use

00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:54,450
 and coach and they're working

00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:58,560
transactions and somehow we miss

00:51:54,450 --> 00:52:01,380
consistency we have problems with our

00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:04,640
databases because we have really a lot

00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:07,920
fuse each like but minimum

00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:09,300
400 requests per second with a small

00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:11,790
document so we need to aggregate

00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:15,420
accumulate them so the database gets

00:52:11,790 --> 00:52:19,830
pretty huge we also have problem with

00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:22,680
our model and our database document is

00:52:19,830 --> 00:52:24,840
getting too big because we keep a

00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:27,930
document with aggregation accumulations

00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:29,520
the report can grow tremendously you

00:52:27,930 --> 00:52:33,530
already saw that for only three

00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:38,130
documents it's to be quick to screens

00:52:33,530 --> 00:52:41,130
so I said that we were consistency

00:52:38,130 --> 00:52:46,850
that's why we somehow come up with the

00:52:41,130 --> 00:52:46,850
solution to chart the Oh

00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:55,470
not only the data but also the execution

00:52:49,950 --> 00:52:57,810
and son guarantee by this transaction

00:52:55,470 --> 00:53:01,680
like support and so this somehow

00:52:57,810 --> 00:53:04,920
prevents abacus from scaling well it we

00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:07,170
also have to take care of this custom

00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:09,090
application level charting so it's

00:53:07,170 --> 00:53:12,630
pretty hard to implement a highly

00:53:09,090 --> 00:53:17,940
available system and boogly grain deploy

00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:20,700
not impossible but hurt and that's why

00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:26,370
we are having hard times operating the

00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:28,290
solution and the use it one well we have

00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:32,400
multiple metrics which basically means

00:53:28,290 --> 00:53:34,080
that we can't really validate that the

00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:36,900
document you're sending is really

00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:39,780
consistent you might be missing one or

00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:43,560
two measures and we have no way to tell

00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:47,370
if this is or if this is intentional or

00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:50,240
you just made a mistake and so we are

00:53:47,370 --> 00:53:53,040
using a JavaScript code to basically

00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:56,940
enable great flexibility but this comes

00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:59,640
with a price we have kind of sandbox but

00:53:56,940 --> 00:54:02,700
no real sandbox in JavaScript so we are

00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:05,580
currently prone to do now services we

00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:09,120
are running if we are running untrusted

00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:12,030
code this sandbox we currently have is

00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:15,840
all simply because you are writing

00:54:12,030 --> 00:54:19,500
actual code we somehow need to test this

00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:22,560
to validate it and this means also that

00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:25,980
it's pretty complex and sometimes

00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:28,230
unpredictable and we have the salt

00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:30,150
called time-based metrics which are too

00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:35,180
complex and we don't really recommend

00:54:30,150 --> 00:54:39,510
them using it so that's another of our

00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:43,950
big problems and that's why we basically

00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:45,600
want to start version 2 somehow to solve

00:54:43,950 --> 00:54:49,970
all of these problems

00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:54,260
let's basically see what we want to do

00:54:49,970 --> 00:54:57,990
we want to move to our DBMS let's start

00:54:54,260 --> 00:55:00,930
this will give us transactions of course

00:54:57,990 --> 00:55:04,440
consistency we won't have a single

00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:06,770
document with everything we accumulated

00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:10,040
aggregated probably we'll have a lot of

00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:12,900
rolls and we'll have to do curious but

00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:16,290
from our experiments that looks pretty

00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:19,200
promising and so we want to move to a

00:55:16,290 --> 00:55:23,010
single metric per document and this will

00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:26,070
make it predictable also will allow us

00:55:23,010 --> 00:55:27,870
to scale better and we want to have

00:55:26,070 --> 00:55:31,310
predefined functions to guarantee that

00:55:27,870 --> 00:55:36,750
things are simple and so more secure

00:55:31,310 --> 00:55:39,720
also most of our users customers they

00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:44,990
don't really want more than maximum sum

00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:48,330
or division multiplications and we

00:55:44,990 --> 00:55:54,660
created poking go lonk two reasons for

00:55:48,330 --> 00:55:56,790
that we want to gather all of our small

00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:59,280
applications into one to be able to call

00:55:56,790 --> 00:56:00,990
co-locate them and the other reason is

00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:03,900
basically that we want to start

00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:05,760
supporting Cuba Knights as well and that

00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:10,860
goes pretty well with the open service

00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:13,800
broker where we can get no longer only

00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:16,440
organizations based but given identities

00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:21,810
so we started thinking in this direction

00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:24,210
and we have a proof of concept for all

00:56:21,810 --> 00:56:30,870
this it's created by my colleague module

00:56:24,210 --> 00:56:33,060
so let's get to that we are working

00:56:30,870 --> 00:56:35,070
internally with docker compose simply

00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:36,960
because it's convenient but there's

00:56:35,070 --> 00:56:39,540
nothing stopping us pushing these to

00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:42,150
either cloud foundry or kubernetes and

00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:47,460
that's basically the idea to be able to

00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:51,290
move to different either infrastructure

00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:53,700
or paths so what we have is three abacus

00:56:51,290 --> 00:56:55,860
applications the collector that accept

00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:58,020
the usage document service that

00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:59,279
obstructs the database so we can change

00:56:58,020 --> 00:57:01,529
form our DBM

00:56:59,279 --> 00:57:04,890
- probably something else oh if we need

00:57:01,529 --> 00:57:11,069
it and a single worker that basically

00:57:04,890 --> 00:57:16,049
does all the work currently and all of

00:57:11,069 --> 00:57:17,849
this basically looks like this we have

00:57:16,049 --> 00:57:20,459
some clients submitting kills each

00:57:17,849 --> 00:57:22,199
collector accepts it puts it into the

00:57:20,459 --> 00:57:26,689
document service and stores it in the

00:57:22,199 --> 00:57:31,619
database then we are using crabbit mq to

00:57:26,689 --> 00:57:33,749
transfer the document to the next in the

00:57:31,619 --> 00:57:36,209
pipeline the worker when the worker

00:57:33,749 --> 00:57:40,380
finishes the jobs it saves it in the

00:57:36,209 --> 00:57:44,699
document service it can however do

00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:48,089
multiple calculations by returning the

00:57:44,699 --> 00:57:53,209
document into the queue and getting back

00:57:48,089 --> 00:57:56,699
to process it multiple times like

00:57:53,209 --> 00:57:58,619
process the day then processing the

00:57:56,699 --> 00:58:01,469
monthly accumulation aggregation

00:57:58,619 --> 00:58:08,400
probably even yearly or things like that

00:58:01,469 --> 00:58:10,979
and let's see if all these works we have

00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:17,749
common plan to basically interact easier

00:58:10,979 --> 00:58:26,489
with our proof concept and we have

00:58:17,749 --> 00:58:28,709
several commands and I'm first going to

00:58:26,489 --> 00:58:33,719
create an analogue of what we saw

00:58:28,709 --> 00:58:36,929
earlier like I'm going to create a

00:58:33,719 --> 00:58:39,659
transform as we call it this is

00:58:36,929 --> 00:58:41,369
basically instructing this proof concept

00:58:39,659 --> 00:58:43,819
how to process the documents were

00:58:41,369 --> 00:58:43,819
sending

00:58:44,859 --> 00:58:54,039
and I want to posts so it automatically

00:58:51,009 --> 00:58:55,930
created the dummy transform that does

00:58:54,039 --> 00:59:00,369
some for accumulation

00:58:55,930 --> 00:59:05,019
it has usage measure pretty dummy name

00:59:00,369 --> 00:59:08,739
but it is okay for testing and so for

00:59:05,019 --> 00:59:12,369
month accumulation it also sums what we

00:59:08,739 --> 00:59:21,969
are going to send and I'm going to need

00:59:12,369 --> 00:59:28,479
this ID so when I say collector then use

00:59:21,969 --> 00:59:32,140
each post and the idea of the transform

00:59:28,479 --> 00:59:35,109
we are posting this usage with the dummy

00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:38,799
value and all we have to do is basically

00:59:35,109 --> 00:59:44,499
get a report out of our system I'm going

00:59:38,799 --> 00:59:49,449
to use this sheet here and I think we

00:59:44,499 --> 00:59:57,569
better go and check this out in the

00:59:49,449 --> 00:59:57,569
browser would be easier and the current

00:59:57,930 --> 01:00:11,890
yeah we are 21st for 21st we have one

01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:16,539
post it that's okay and we if we post a

01:00:11,890 --> 01:00:20,229
second time we should get to so simple

01:00:16,539 --> 01:00:22,900
some not in Korea fancy and what is

01:00:20,229 --> 01:00:30,160
actually different is that so we can now

01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:33,430
do colocation we are now from because we

01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:36,670
use a lot of techniques to get rid of

01:00:33,430 --> 01:00:39,400
our problems we are at least six times

01:00:36,670 --> 01:00:44,949
faster that's the initial measurements

01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:46,900
we use really less database we almost

01:00:44,949 --> 01:00:48,910
managed to solve all of the problems

01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:52,359
except the reporting because the

01:00:48,910 --> 01:00:54,369
reporting is modeled against the

01:00:52,359 --> 01:00:58,089
previous version of a box version 1 and

01:00:54,369 --> 01:01:00,029
we want to start capturing this problem

01:00:58,089 --> 01:01:04,960
as well

01:01:00,029 --> 01:01:07,569
and the timelines well we want still to

01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:09,609
continue supporting version 1 because we

01:01:07,569 --> 01:01:11,710
are productive with it so we need at

01:01:09,609 --> 01:01:16,059
least to fix the some of the current

01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:19,839
problems and that's why we won at least

01:01:16,059 --> 01:01:24,460
to our lives in version 1 but we want to

01:01:19,839 --> 01:01:29,710
start inception on version 2 and we want

01:01:24,460 --> 01:01:32,289
also to have another proof concept just

01:01:29,710 --> 01:01:34,779
to see if Hadoop and Kafka can help us

01:01:32,289 --> 01:01:37,989
with our big data requirements because

01:01:34,779 --> 01:01:43,180
at the moment we are having close to 1

01:01:37,989 --> 01:01:48,880
petabyte of data and a DBMS has its

01:01:43,180 --> 01:01:50,859
limitations and even with this first

01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:55,359
proof concept we are hitting a lot of

01:01:50,859 --> 01:01:58,890
futures with this amount of data and we

01:01:55,359 --> 01:02:04,089
intend to start implementation September

01:01:58,890 --> 01:02:07,140
this year so if anyone wants to join or

01:02:04,089 --> 01:02:10,660
hear some ideas some comments on that

01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:13,329
feel free to contact me we'll be very

01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:17,410
glad to to get some feedback on what we

01:02:13,329 --> 01:02:21,099
intend to do I think that's that's all

01:02:17,410 --> 01:02:23,769
from me from my site any questions yeah

01:02:21,099 --> 01:02:26,769
perfectly on time so maybe we can take a

01:02:23,769 --> 01:02:28,539
few more minutes for questions let me

01:02:26,769 --> 01:02:31,239
say as we prepare questions this is

01:02:28,539 --> 01:02:33,269
massive for people that don't understand

01:02:31,239 --> 01:02:37,059
there's literally pilla bytes of data

01:02:33,269 --> 01:02:40,539
that has to be processed and I know that

01:02:37,059 --> 01:02:42,369
in the IBM cloud I can speak for that it

01:02:40,539 --> 01:02:44,739
sits in that level we have to back up

01:02:42,369 --> 01:02:46,809
the old video obviously but if you're

01:02:44,739 --> 01:02:48,849
gonna church people you gotta have the

01:02:46,809 --> 01:02:50,529
data also a way to retrieve it because

01:02:48,849 --> 01:02:52,539
people complain and we need to be able

01:02:50,529 --> 01:02:56,619
to prove it so there are lots of

01:02:52,539 --> 01:02:59,289
regulations around that just quickly as

01:02:56,619 --> 01:03:01,420
here's to mention v2 inceptions can

01:02:59,289 --> 01:03:04,329
happen soon last time I chatted with yes

01:03:01,420 --> 01:03:07,119
- I think they wanted to do it for March

01:03:04,329 --> 01:03:08,200
so you should see this coming you know

01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:11,410
March or April

01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:13,180
the team at ICP is sort of distributed

01:03:11,410 --> 01:03:16,000
but we'll figure out a good time so if

01:03:13,180 --> 01:03:17,440
you want to be part of it

01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:24,009
any other questions in the other

01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:26,500
comments no all right well I guess it's

01:03:24,009 --> 01:03:28,029
recorded thank you here so this is this

01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:31,150
is this is big

01:03:28,029 --> 01:03:34,210
and I appreciate your time and of course

01:03:31,150 --> 01:03:36,910
then thank you for this all for

01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:40,470
documentation try to submit a full

01:03:36,910 --> 01:03:44,710
request that's always a good thing about

01:03:40,470 --> 01:03:46,859
let's be better than the rest all right

01:03:44,710 --> 01:03:50,410
so I'll talk to everybody again in March

01:03:46,859 --> 01:03:55,380
thank you for joining have a good idea

01:03:50,410 --> 01:03:55,380
