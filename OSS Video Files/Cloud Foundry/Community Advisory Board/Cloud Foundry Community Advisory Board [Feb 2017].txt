okay

00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:11,210
so three hours I guess yeah it's almost

00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:11,210
afternoon here what do you mean so I

00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:16,980

deserve a picture when when this board

00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:28,850
is filled

00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,580
actually if we have no hiccup hey Dan

00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:42,590
alright if you have no hiccup by the end

00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:45,680

gonna sell some to IBM this is this is

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,720
too good

00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,190
hope you want to pretend there's a hip

00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:52,310
up and kick you off and then you'll be

00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:54,680
like oh the connection dropped yeah well

00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:56,270
I mean part of the reason is I mean I'm

00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,770
impressed that people are joining and

00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:59,630
they are actually removing themselves

00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:05,000
from video but I can still see the video

00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:07,940
that time so I saw you exactly that's

00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,280
pretty good all right yeah we have one

00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:12,739
801 so we'll start in two more minutes

00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,750
but we get more actually there is a

00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:18,950
number so I don't know who that is

00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:20,600
that's a violin okay oh I see so people

00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:23,569
can also dial in that's pretty sweet

00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:25,700
yep same as the conference call in those

00:03:23,569 --> 00:03:45,799
the conjoining video and audio and video

00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:48,079
audio almost muted I was I just click

00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:48,950
the refunds meet myself and like it

00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:51,709
unmuted me

00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:59,420
this is so I'll click not a double click

00:03:51,709 --> 00:04:01,820
no I'm alright so we get Alex also

00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:04,940
alright so one more minute guys we'll

00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:08,500
get started I don't see chip yet but I

00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:12,200
guess he's real chipper this morning

00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:15,440
yeah yeah this video did I do any he'll

00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:18,440
feel confident so uh you got the whole

00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:20,150
like I mean what's the deal here you're

00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:22,310
all by yourself in this wonderfully

00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:27,470
gorgeous big room with whiteboard walls

00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:29,840
I know I and I'm at pivotal to so I

00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:32,180
think people focused on pivotal they

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:37,280
joined they do they do come we should

00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:40,660
get Hughie and and Eric it was too lazy

00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,660
to go into the office this morning

00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:46,210
I'll see you later

00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:47,830
all right okay

00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:50,350
so it would be let's get started this

00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:53,590
this is first time trying to zoom and

00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:56,050
I'm so happy when suggested this I think

00:04:53,590 --> 00:05:00,130
this is gonna change the way we do these

00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:05,759
calls so I don't like it just just

00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:10,240
remove yourself from you duplicate but

00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:12,460
looking grumpy the rest the cool well

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,259
somebody's gotta fill that role were the

00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:17,949
other twelve dwarves or seven what was

00:05:14,259 --> 00:05:20,440
it again yeah well oh yeah you might be

00:05:17,949 --> 00:05:21,729
right seven that's maybe be docked I

00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:27,699
specify the kidiots

00:05:21,729 --> 00:05:31,300
I need to write that be done it actually

00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:34,750
okay so this is working out hey we got

00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:37,300
area care so anyway this is fantastic I

00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:42,099
think one thing Wade and I were chatting

00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:44,520
about this before that we have a

00:05:42,099 --> 00:05:47,500
representative from from zoom that

00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:49,539
basically increased capacity to a

00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:53,289
hundred so maybe when you can introduce

00:05:49,539 --> 00:05:56,789
it and briefly mention it but I don't

00:05:53,289 --> 00:05:59,190
see him actually Brian is he coming or

00:05:56,789 --> 00:06:03,130
no I don't think he's joining the call I

00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:06,729
see okay I who's intimidated by us well

00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:08,949
that's fair so everybody this is a tool

00:06:06,729 --> 00:06:11,080
we use so a lot for remote work remote

00:06:08,949 --> 00:06:13,210
pairing it's very high bandwidth very

00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:18,789
nice obviously it works well with a lot

00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:20,080
of people and it's called zoom a lot of

00:06:18,789 --> 00:06:22,120
you probably figured out by clicking on

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,770
the URL in order to mute and unmute

00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,150
yourself on the bottom left hand corner

00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:27,009
the screen is usually a little

00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:29,229
microphone icon that's also where you

00:06:27,009 --> 00:06:30,729
can adjust your settings there's usually

00:06:29,229 --> 00:06:31,990
a little up arrow next to them you can

00:06:30,729 --> 00:06:33,580
choose different speakers and

00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:35,530
microphones and things like that same

00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:38,380
thing for the video in that location and

00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:40,630
if you're on a Mac it's there's there's

00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:42,849
also hotkeys on Windows as well but the

00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:44,440
Mac one is a command shift a to mute and

00:06:42,849 --> 00:06:49,419
unmute yourself very quickly and easily

00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:54,370
and welcome to the first inaugural zoom

00:06:49,419 --> 00:06:58,510
gab call yes indeed Thank You Wayne any

00:06:54,370 --> 00:07:00,060
question for the zoom no I think this is

00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:02,810
gonna work out well so if you have

00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:07,380
commenters question I guess let us know

00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:10,380
so we have an agenda so if you go to the

00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:12,690
link for the agenda there's a little bit

00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:17,310
I think I was hoping chip would be here

00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:19,470
to cover anything on CSF but I mentioned

00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:22,710
a few things as you know I don't know if

00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:25,889
he's gonna join first thing is the

00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:29,880
summit is coming of course is June 13 to

00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:33,830
15 and Seneca so it's gonna be similar

00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:36,690
to what we had before the key important

00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:39,810
information is that the proposal the top

00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:43,470
proposal deadline is coming up on the

00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:47,160
17th so basically a few days from here

00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:48,750
so I think Friday at midnight so if you

00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:51,750
have something that you're trying to

00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:55,530
submit or your team make sure to remind

00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:57,540
them I think you can not only just

00:07:55,530 --> 00:08:00,870
proposed talks but you can also propose

00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:02,910
panels and other things so if you go to

00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:06,150
the link that I that I have in the

00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:07,610
agenda for the CFP that you can see the

00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:10,710
kind of things that are being requested

00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:12,690
that include drum and guitar jam

00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:18,750
sessions I mean is that like legit as

00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:20,070
well well our only ukulele sessions if

00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:21,780
you submitted something like this

00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:24,660
especially if you get out of like a CFM

00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:29,970
that I think few people would join so

00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:31,320
yeah all right so don't forget to submit

00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:33,539
I mean I think I think at the end of the

00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:35,940
day it's it's really about you know

00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:38,219
community so you got to propose your

00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:40,860
talk all right

00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:42,630
so usually what we do is to see if there

00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:47,430
are any project highlights

00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:52,170
I know Demetri is on the call decay you

00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:55,020
hear I saw you join no you have to

00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:56,670
unmute yourself though can't escape yeah

00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:59,610
me alright thank you

00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:03,540
I've actually joined Dimitri's team so

00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:06,779
I'm working for him as usual so I asked

00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:09,150
them as a condition you have to join

00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:10,620
those calls and tell people what cool

00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:13,260
things are pending on board because I

00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:23,160
can't do it I can't do it better than

00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:29,000
so maybe like Sharia course team has

00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:31,770
been working a lot on implementing

00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:37,170
closing down the config server

00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:41,880
integration which will allow us to use

00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:44,370
the director with upcoming open source

00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:47,880
Crudup to manage all the credentials for

00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:50,780
board deployments and I'll automatically

00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:55,430
generate them so that's very very close

00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:58,130
to being computed we have an upcoming

00:09:55,430 --> 00:10:03,480
boss release two six one that will

00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:08,910
include majority of it then after that

00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:17,420
we'll do some additional polishing we've

00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:20,070
been also working on adding multi CPI

00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:26,250
integration thanks to some contributions

00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:27,960
from Swisscom and IBM and that's also

00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:31,710
going to be in the upcoming release but

00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:33,750
with the beginning carry at that right

00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:36,510
now you'll be able to use it only again

00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:38,940
the same type of CPI and then the next

00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:42,990
release will allow us to use any

00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:45,840
combination of CGI's so that would help

00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:48,320
us you know customers who are trying to

00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:51,890
let's say run a single cloud foundry

00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:54,420
across multiple open stacks let's say

00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:58,560
because they don't necessarily want to

00:10:54,420 --> 00:11:00,060
use OpenStack easy concept or maybe you

00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,920
know if you have multiple vSphere

00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:03,990
installations you want to connect the

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:08,160
two data centers together that kind of

00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:09,570
stuff so that's quite exciting and of

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:13,290
course eventually it will allow us to

00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:17,930
for example combined you know usage of

00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:21,180
let's say you know any ayahs like AWS

00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:23,490
and wash light for example if you want

00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:26,940
to be easy running your errands or maybe

00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:30,450
doing some calculation of Bosch light

00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:33,450
figuration and you know actually play

00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:38,100
the workload onto a different set of

00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:41,130
machines say that's that's kind of a -

00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:43,020
to highlight that have been come along

00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:46,190
for some time we've been of course

00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:49,830
working on a variety of other fixes and

00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:53,000
you know features actually one more

00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:59,160
that's really kind of a big one is

00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:02,310
upcoming general availability of cyb - I

00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:05,790
was being trialing at fourth with a lot

00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:10,710
of people a lot of teams so it's more or

00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:14,130
less complete in terms of you know any

00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:18,780
kind of missing features that were

00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:20,610
present in OT light but we haven't

00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:23,730
released it yet because I haven't had

00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:26,870
the chance to really complete all of the

00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:31,260
documentation on Bush I afford initially

00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:32,910
but that's all coming is well in fact

00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:38,790
that's probably more or less blocked on

00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:44,510
me finishing out the documentation was

00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:44,510
that worth mentioning wasn't me

00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:51,690
there's probably uh you know I don't

00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:56,490
know how many people are kind of keeping

00:12:51,690 --> 00:13:01,230
up with the CEO IV to work but we see

00:12:56,490 --> 00:13:03,900
live it - it you know kind of subsumes

00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:07,880
the boss in its functionality into two

00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:11,580
commands create and then delete an and

00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:13,920
with those two commands we actually

00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:17,040
pulled out this new repo

00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:19,620
out of I guess main boss resource that's

00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:23,130
called Borge deployment and boards

00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:27,330
deployment is the repo that really

00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:29,540
contains all of the llamo configurations

00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:32,520
that are typically documented on bojayá

00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:34,890
but we used to expect that you know

00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:36,600
people would kind of change them and

00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:38,580
maybe drop them off somewhere and their

00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,760
configuration folders so on and so forth

00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:45,450
but instead of doing that

00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:47,460
nowadays wisdom you see why we are you

00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:50,779
know having all these configurations

00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:53,100
recorded in the bush deployment repo and

00:13:50,779 --> 00:13:56,450
we've made it such that it's very easy

00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:58,740
to you know let's say enable you a

00:13:56,450 --> 00:14:04,770
functionality on your director or maybe

00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:08,490
enable a fixer of so you know that

00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:11,339
that's that repo is a kind of a or

00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:13,410
master copy for you know what is the

00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:15,240
recommended way to configure the

00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:18,270
director and configure all the stuff

00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:22,800
around the director like you a

00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:25,290
integration so I expect that majority of

00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:27,900
both i/o documentation that will be

00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:30,029
updated to use CLI the two would

00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:34,650
actually be referencing both deployment

00:14:30,029 --> 00:14:38,610
people to you know to effect we say run

00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:40,440
this one command to enable UA and if you

00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:44,330
want more details on what exactly is

00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:47,250
being dropped in looking into the UA

00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:48,900
operations file that describes you know

00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:53,780
what exactly are we turning on and

00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:58,110
turning off so that's been kind of a

00:14:53,780 --> 00:15:00,270
side side effect of switching over to

00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:02,730
seal IV to for sound the team is there

00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:05,790
now not have to you know think about

00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:07,620
maintaining there you know you used to

00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:09,290
be borscht in it manifests they just

00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:12,750
pull down the board's deployment repo

00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:15,839
and obtain into the features that they

00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:17,550
did care about further environment and

00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,470
of course all the you know passwords and

00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:20,970
certificates now that get generated so

00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:24,770
users don't have to think about this as

00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:31,920
well so I don't think I have any other

00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:33,750
bigger updates thank you when you

00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:43,529
Americans could control Russians thank

00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:47,510
you just kidding that escalated Thank

00:15:43,529 --> 00:15:47,510
You Dimitri any questions

00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:55,500
so you said you're working on

00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:57,000
documentation assuming that's like also

00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:59,670
going to include like here is how you

00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:03,150
transition from working with v1 CLI to

00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:04,560
the p2 CLI and I think you had a little

00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:07,500
bit of that but as that could be fleshed

00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:10,350
out more and is that what I was hearing

00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:13,020
was that's the kind of focus yeah

00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:15,570
whatever the commentation existed for C

00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:18,630
lightly to up to now was really just

00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:22,500
some notes that you know written down

00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:25,530
before just to not forget mention it but

00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:27,270
yeah there's a there is no there has not

00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:29,700
been any official documentation for

00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:32,660
saliva to has been published so that's

00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:41,130
that's definitely one of their first

00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:43,350
before the release because there are

00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:46,760
some little quirks here and there that

00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:46,760
you need to learn but once you get that

00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:59,970
as well doc right wing and it link to it

00:16:55,290 --> 00:17:03,020
here in the zoom car yeah that's the

00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:05,750
document that's really not the vinyl

00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:09,150
documentation so get the let Ledbetter

00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:12,780
so I just already knows please use slack

00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:15,540
for all chats not bazooms jet so that we

00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:16,890
all have a public record of the you know

00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:20,689
we're gonna keep using slack for that

00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:23,910
one thanks yeah loves that thanks yeah

00:17:20,689 --> 00:17:24,750
all right Thank You Dimitri that was

00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:27,329
really good

00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:29,250
cool a bit so maybe we can do the other

00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:30,630
mean projects if you have highlights I

00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:32,940
mean you don't have to give a you drop

00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:35,640
date like Dimitri did if you want to

00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:38,640
just highlight something I guess Erich

00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:41,610
Segal yeah sure I think I had mentioned

00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,680
on previous calls efforts to reduce our

00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:47,820
dependency on console so we've been

00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:50,010
doing a lot of work around that the most

00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:52,200
mature of those is running the route

00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:55,320
emitter component in a cell local mode

00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:57,810
and we think that's pretty much done we

00:17:55,320 --> 00:18:00,990
look forward to exercising it more rigor

00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:02,340
in production environments since we're

00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:03,600
not aware of any outstanding bugs with

00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:06,990
it and then we're also

00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:08,820
exploring moving the locks that

00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:11,039
components such as say the BBS and the

00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:13,110
auctioneer and the cells maintain for

00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:14,760
their presences out of constable in

00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:16,679
something that's just backed by the BBS

00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,720
this relational database so there's more

00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:20,820
experimental work going on there trying

00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,830
to meet the kind of responsiveness that

00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:26,880
we've had from consular walks in terms

00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:30,390
of fast failover and recovery from more

00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:33,450
drastic failures of those components

00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:35,450
that are active and then we've we've

00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:38,640
also started doing some initial work on

00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:42,030
an effort to start providing a notion of

00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,890
current for instance identity so

00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:45,480
generating a certificate key pair for

00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:48,900
instances to use that are signed by the

00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:52,890
platform so again that's that's pretty

00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:54,210
early we we have a few cases in mind for

00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:56,370
how this can be useful on the platform

00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:57,990
and there's a rose Alliance a notice you

00:18:56,370 --> 00:19:00,360
have to have a few weeks ago so if you

00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:01,919
have thoughts or commentary around that

00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:03,960
but certainly appreciated this is an

00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:08,400
integration week right out so this is

00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:10,590
one thing that this will allow so one

00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:13,919
one idea that we have in mind one use

00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:15,659
case for this is services storing their

00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:18,330
sensitive service credentials directly

00:19:15,659 --> 00:19:20,850
incredible applications being authorized

00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:23,840
so you get this credentials out of

00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:26,880
credible directly using these schedules

00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:29,730
when you say instance you actually mean

00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:32,190
that means that not the cells but she

00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:34,559
left yeah right so each each instance of

00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:36,870
an app or of a staging task or one-off

00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:43,830
app tasks will have a unique set of

00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:47,370
credentials that identifies it alright

00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:48,450
any other question for Erich Segal yes I

00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:51,450
got one

00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:54,179
I mean doesn't that guy ever shut up

00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:58,679
anyways so Erik a quick question on the

00:19:54,179 --> 00:20:01,710
Diego docker story stuff so I was aware

00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:04,710
that you guys were currently actively as

00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:07,049
of January working on the private like

00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:09,320
the authentication for docker images and

00:20:07,049 --> 00:20:13,679
stuff like that against repositories

00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:15,210
where is all that stuff at so I think

00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,890
it's still kind of down at the garden

00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:17,720
level at this point I think it looks

00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:18,710
like Jules is on

00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:23,900
he might be able to provide a little

00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:27,260
more detail so effectively all of the

00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:28,970
action there has to happen when garden

00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:31,700
order the new Goethe fest component

00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:34,490
actually pulls the image from a docker

00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:37,400
registry repository that requires

00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:39,040
authentication so we're expecting the

00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:41,690
bulk of the work to happen down there

00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:45,770
and then effectively the rest of it is

00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:48,260
just wiring there's one additional piece

00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:50,600
to that where when when we're doing a

00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:52,250
staging task for a doctor image based

00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:54,170
app we also need to have those

00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,340
credentials available so we have to

00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:59,630
change something in the docker app

00:20:55,340 --> 00:21:03,200
lifecycle builder but I think there's a

00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:07,160
proposal document that has been

00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:09,770
circulated to some extent soliciting

00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:11,780
feedback on the api's that we'll have to

00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:15,050
run through at the Diego and garden

00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:17,270
layer to fist flow the docker registry

00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:20,690
credentials through the system down to

00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:22,940
the garden site that hosts the image if

00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:24,800
you want to comment on that you might

00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:27,410
want to get in quick because our second

00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:32,200
story implementing that and just

00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:36,040
today so we're pretty far down the track

00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:38,600
what was that word you said just what

00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:45,550
you can have to give me more context

00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:48,800
we're down the track Cory just okay

00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:52,070
so wait wait two stories in on the

00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:59,870
garden side so if that gives you an idea

00:21:52,070 --> 00:22:02,420
of how it's coming awesome I see a few

00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:05,090
questions on for Diego did or do is all

00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:08,120
insert because there's one also the

00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:10,820
garden and new good FS component those

00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:13,790
are notes based on what he knows I see

00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:16,790
okay all right so maybe move move the

00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:18,290
notes to the section I guess you know we

00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:20,780
can do this after for these but like

00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:22,460
let's leave this part for questions yeah

00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:24,980
perfect thank you well that was Quinn's

00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:27,150
question so the question is the answer

00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:30,420
of the question all right yeah

00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:34,650
let's go okay any other questions on

00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:39,600
Diigo or I guess go ahead and run C Go

00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:42,180
Diego Go know it actually at IBM we've

00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:45,240
pretty much transition even the apps

00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:48,480
also a customer apps I think there were

00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:57,990
a few left but you know you can't force

00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:58,470
people you can't and that's how it's

00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:04,980
done

00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:08,100
yeah exactly just use the admin

00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:11,970
credentials max I don't control these

00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:14,160
things oh I believe it was almost

00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:15,690
completely transition I don't know Jose

00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:18,570
if you have more information on that but

00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:21,179
I can't remember the exact numbers were

00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:24,360
I died soon the other day it's there's

00:23:21,179 --> 00:23:26,760
almost no apps to run it on the old one

00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:29,850
it's default too so if you push it up

00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:31,170
now it's pretty much okay it's basically

00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:33,090
oh you ones are running the other ones

00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:36,780
that they try to migrate and failed and

00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:38,160
then Pat Nixon rollback right number so

00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:40,290
this is all the news of course for

00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:44,640
everybody else but new news for us

00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:46,679
anyway okay so an S here any questions

00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:50,390
we'll move on to see if there is an

00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:57,690
update on Kathy that's worth mentioning

00:23:50,390 --> 00:24:00,870
yeah everyone I'm Zak I'm the new p.m.

00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:02,850
for the capi team I was previously an

00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:04,920
engineer on the Cappy team ever since it

00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:09,300
existed so been around for a little

00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:11,550
while um let's do a quick update we sort

00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:13,650
of have two main tracks of work one is

00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:16,110
finished enough compute isolation

00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:18,179
segments the functionality was done

00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:20,309
probably around this call last month but

00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:22,800
we got some feedback from the CLI had

00:24:20,309 --> 00:24:25,710
asked for some updates to the API we

00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:28,850
also solicited some users to try and

00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:31,559
move some absent in isolation segments

00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:34,350
that it was difficult to do since we

00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:37,110
were requiring people to have a new

00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:39,150
space to move apps into so people with

00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:39,840
existing apps were a little sad that you

00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:42,330
know their service

00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:45,450
and routes and stuff might disappear so

00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:47,100
we relaxed that restriction and so now

00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:50,190
you can apply isolation segments to

00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:52,020
spaces with existing maps and then if

00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:53,940
you perform like a Bluegreen and deploy

00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:56,880
you'll get your app will go over into an

00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:58,950
isolation segment so that works pretty

00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,750
close to being done and we're thinking

00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:04,919
CLI we'll start building out commands

00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:07,679
probably in the next week or two so

00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:09,120
hopefully by this call next month we'll

00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:12,809
be able to say that compute isolation is

00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:15,809
live and done so that's good going good

00:25:12,809 --> 00:25:18,059
our other main track of work is securing

00:25:15,809 --> 00:25:21,059
our communication path to other

00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:24,230
components that has essentially meant

00:25:21,059 --> 00:25:27,649
that most of the CCC bridge components

00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:30,929
are being removed and instead sort of

00:25:27,649 --> 00:25:32,460
pulled it into the cloud controller so

00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:33,809
that we just talked directly to Diego to

00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:37,470
components and we're doing that over

00:25:33,809 --> 00:25:39,179
mutual TLS that works in flight there's

00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:41,549
there's quite a few components we've

00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:43,559
we've probably got through you know

00:25:41,549 --> 00:25:45,570
roughly half of them being consumed by

00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:47,940
the CC now we've got another little ways

00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:48,899
to go and then we'll get some Doc's out

00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:53,340
and start telling people how to

00:25:48,899 --> 00:25:59,309
transition that that pretty much covers

00:25:53,340 --> 00:26:01,679
what we've been up to like very small

00:25:59,309 --> 00:26:06,200
items I'd like to highlight as well

00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:09,590
recent functionalities is we now have

00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:13,260
support for a global of Auditors scope

00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:15,419
so this is more or less like an auditor

00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:18,210
the the permissions that you'd have

00:26:15,419 --> 00:26:20,159
access that you'd have as an auditor but

00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:24,299
without actually having to be explicitly

00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:26,039
added to those faces orgs so you can

00:26:24,299 --> 00:26:28,470
have an auditor that doesn't have access

00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:31,770
to unique app services for all of the

00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:34,409
apps for example which has been somewhat

00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:36,960
long and requested so that's one one

00:26:34,409 --> 00:26:42,270
nice thing to check out in the latest CF

00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:44,640
release and the other one small life

00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:48,090
improvement is that we added support for

00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:49,260
an HTTP health check and CLIA added

00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:52,220
support for this with their latest

00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:54,409
release and so if you

00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:57,710
an app that wants to signal more

00:26:54,409 --> 00:27:04,510
explicitly whether it's ready to receive

00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:07,250
a request it just needs to implement a

00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:14,809
health tracking and point and return

00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:17,450
into 100 cool okay thank you Yui any

00:27:14,809 --> 00:27:21,370
questions for Kathy I guess was that a

00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:30,140
QE or anybody else I think they're happy

00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:33,080
yeah okay I don't hear anything so let

00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:36,890
me give a quick update on CF extensions

00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:39,039
so you guys saw that we had a process

00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:42,440
proposal part of the idea there is to

00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:45,530
make sure that people go into this with

00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:46,820
your eyes wide open and understanding

00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:51,169
what's gonna happen next

00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:53,179
it's a commitment for us working in the

00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:55,309
community but also it's a commitment

00:27:53,179 --> 00:27:58,400
from you if you submitted something that

00:27:55,309 --> 00:27:59,990
you want to be an extension and what I

00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,970
want to try to do is to make sure that

00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:05,900
every project that submitted it actually

00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:07,880
goes to who all gets put it out so that

00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:09,740
we can have a stream of extension but

00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:12,530
also we bet them and they go through the

00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:15,710
whole process so I think generally it's

00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:18,380
a not controversial process so if you

00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:21,049
get a chance make some comment otherwise

00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:23,659
that's pretty much gonna be couldn't put

00:28:21,049 --> 00:28:27,710
the law right so one example of this is

00:28:23,659 --> 00:28:30,830
that the back your service worker that

00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:32,840
SAT submitted is actually going to a

00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:35,360
little bit of it because it came after

00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:38,780
we had the first test but essentially

00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:42,289
it's incubating right now so I created

00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:45,919
project space for them and there's

00:28:42,289 --> 00:28:48,500
actually a team and SAT that's started

00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:49,610
when that another good example of this

00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:51,530
is a credible

00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:54,530
so when Demetri was talking he talked

00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:56,900
about the fact that config server is an

00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:58,970
API and there is an implementation that

00:28:56,900 --> 00:29:02,149
the Boche team did but there's also a

00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:06,170
more complete implementation that also

00:29:02,149 --> 00:29:08,990
they turtle did call cred hub and then

00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:13,250
he's on a call right now and presented I

00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:16,190
think maybe two two tabs ago is an

00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:20,570
implementation of this API that is more

00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:24,050
complete and the turtle has submitted it

00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:25,820
to the extensions group and right now I

00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:29,360
think it's at a point where do you want

00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:31,940
to move it to a vote so after this call

00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:33,650
I will send an email and asking if there

00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:35,840
are any comments that's your last chance

00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:37,900
otherwise we are just gonna do a vote

00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:42,340
and hopefully if it goes through then

00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:44,930
you'll see next time a CF incubating

00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:47,900
project where then and his team will

00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:53,420
have everything and you can just go and

00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:56,240
check it out okay there's a series of

00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:57,470
other proposals in extensions one of the

00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,090
things I've been trying to do is to

00:29:57,470 --> 00:30:04,340
collect them because I'm creating a

00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:07,580
little Club I've actually took both URIs

00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:08,870
advice and dimitris where the database

00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:10,820
is actually gonna be github

00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:15,590
so there's a few rules I'm gonna have to

00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:17,300
put on you know how you tag your

00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:19,160
projects and so on because I'm just

00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:21,920
pulling that information from github so

00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:25,610
we can talk about that once I went I'm

00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:28,370
ready to make that public but for now I

00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:30,110
have a doc that's collecting those

00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:33,080
projects there's actually a couple of

00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:35,510
them that are often often sorry so I'm

00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:38,360
just gonna assume by the time I send an

00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:40,040
XML like no answers that I just get rid

00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:41,900
of them so basically we'll only have

00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:46,910
projects that are active and that are

00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:50,060
you know valid I'll put the link of the

00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:53,570
corrected project URL so that way people

00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:58,790
can can go check it out so any questions

00:30:53,570 --> 00:31:03,080
for extensions we have a call it's the

00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:06,620
last Monday of the month so easy it

00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:07,820
should be coming I guess next week so if

00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:09,440
you're interested in drawing there's a

00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:17,600
few people that join but it's turning on

00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:19,760
LSD as well okay oh yeah actually do you

00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:25,340
wanna give us a quick update you have

00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:26,300
something a highlight of you a hey yes

00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:32,120
we can here

00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:34,810
awesome he got the 3dr he's out the

00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:39,320
release notes are up as well and it is

00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:40,790
part of CF release 252 there are there

00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:42,500
are some breaking changes in this

00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:44,960
release so please read the release notes

00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:50,300
to get an understanding of what those

00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:53,390
are and apart from this the next major

00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:55,870
version of UA is going to be for dot oh

00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:58,690
and we have plans to do some

00:31:55,870 --> 00:32:03,020
consolidation around configuration

00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:05,420
properties you AAA has you know like a

00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:08,090
legacy login dot Hamill that is from the

00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:10,280
hadees' when organ server and UA were

00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:12,980
separate so we have plans to consolidate

00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:13,340
it for ease of use and documentation as

00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:15,770
well

00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:16,940
so that is one major change that is

00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:18,860
going to be coming for OH

00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:21,680
apart from that there will be some other

00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:25,730
changes as well I have plans to

00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:28,190
basically send out a note on the three

00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:34,670
of them list with the plan for full

00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:36,440
bottle nothing else from me all right

00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:40,700
thank you tree

00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:46,430
any questions on so far I guess gave

00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:51,560
everybody a chance about the previous

00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:54,830
point about credit there's a link to

00:32:51,560 --> 00:33:02,990
kind of push release is that but then I

00:32:54,830 --> 00:33:05,750
can afford for yeah right now that the

00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:07,700
bas-reliefs is still proud of it because

00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:10,330
we're working through some licensing

00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:13,910
issues with the clients that we pull in

00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:15,430
as soon as we finish that off we will

00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:17,990
open that as well

00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:20,780
yeah because it makes it easier to death

00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:23,900
right when there's a boat yeah you

00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:25,370
didn't certainly run it locally with one

00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:27,740
of the convenience scripts that's in

00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:31,180
there but yeah it's much easier to test

00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:31,180
if you kibosh the play

00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:37,480
but we're regarding that I guess when

00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:40,230
cada becomes available in a borscht

00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:42,730
deployment repository there is a

00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:45,820
credible llamo that Dan and his team

00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:51,220
contributed to obtain into using

00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:52,600
credible is board director yeah so for

00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:55,059
the but for the community in general

00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:58,690
beef maybe make sense before the phone

00:33:55,059 --> 00:34:06,970
to have it that part something people

00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:09,899
can use it before voting okay yeah I

00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:12,159
think you should you should make a I

00:34:09,899 --> 00:34:15,820
mean I can make a note of that in my

00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:17,679
email but if you feel strongly about

00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:20,560
this you can just comment on the on

00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:27,520
Ben's proposal saying that you know that

00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:32,050
you want to see it okay I do know

00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:35,280
they've been working on it to get access

00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:40,210
to everything for the past two weeks to

00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:42,760
hopefully things will open up soon all

00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:44,560
right cool Thank You Reuben any other

00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:46,899
questions on anything so far because

00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:53,169
we're going to move to the next part of

00:34:46,899 --> 00:34:55,480
the cap call request I don't think we've

00:34:53,169 --> 00:35:03,520
ever for any of the projects and the

00:34:55,480 --> 00:35:07,230
other we've never required an explosive

00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:10,290
release before accepting a project

00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:12,310
yeah that's not I don't know if it's a

00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:14,500
requirement to accept it but it's a

00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:16,150
question to say hey you know I'd like to

00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:18,369
try it I can't even try it so I think

00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:19,930
that's there yeah the point it was

00:35:18,369 --> 00:35:21,880
because there was a brush release

00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:24,339
management in the readme and then I

00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:26,680
followed the link and I saw the 404 that

00:35:24,339 --> 00:35:28,839
was more like the reason it's not yes

00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:34,510
that needs to be worked but I saw that

00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:38,609
was one oh I guess you can't work with

00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:38,609
there and also to get access to it yeah

00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,910
okay

00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:44,490
but I think

00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:48,569
part of it also is to I guess the

00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:51,030
overarching goal of the process is to

00:35:48,569 --> 00:35:55,170
move things forward fast so we want to

00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:57,660
remove you know hurdles but I also want

00:35:55,170 --> 00:36:00,569
the community to be able to chime in on

00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:03,240
any point in time and invoice the

00:36:00,569 --> 00:36:06,960
opinion so we'll figure it out I guess

00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:13,799
for this particular case any other

00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:15,329
questions comments is brightening or

00:36:13,799 --> 00:36:17,460
having a scheme

00:36:15,329 --> 00:36:20,130
oh no okay he's just yeah he skis every

00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:22,289
morning to intention hey I was gonna be

00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:31,130
like heaven jealous you're looking down

00:36:22,289 --> 00:36:31,130
at us I wanted to ask there's a few

00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:41,490
recently and appreciate a digital

00:36:37,349 --> 00:36:44,460
feedback if you get time even if you you

00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:46,589
know like it hate it that's great

00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:52,170
in particular there's the multi build

00:36:46,589 --> 00:36:55,740
proposal on the longer data team has a

00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:58,170
couple of proposals about independently

00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:59,849
scalable syslog I think their most

00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:04,470
recent one was loving a turn tells check

00:36:59,849 --> 00:37:07,789
console so so if you get a chance please

00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:10,789
take a look at those proposals and

00:37:07,789 --> 00:37:15,270
comment and providing provide your input

00:37:10,789 --> 00:37:16,770
yeah I mean it's a big part of what

00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:18,599
we're trying to do I guess for this year

00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:21,240
is to get a handle of all these

00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:23,339
proposals deployed or doing work so the

00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:24,839
community needs to chime in and we're

00:37:23,339 --> 00:37:32,059
going to assume that if you don't chime

00:37:24,839 --> 00:37:34,740
in that you're happy so chime in please

00:37:32,059 --> 00:37:36,740
okay let's see if there are any

00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:39,480
questions that were posted on the agenda

00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:41,880
I don't see anything that wasn't

00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:44,339
answered yet so if you don't have any

00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:47,240
questions these this is I get the first

00:37:44,339 --> 00:37:49,400
part of the program where we just cover

00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:53,190
projects PMC's

00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:54,760
basic stuff you know highlights and then

00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:57,520
now we're going to move to

00:37:54,760 --> 00:38:00,640
community projects and as I mentioned

00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:02,500
our friends from Stockton Wayne super

00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:05,200
busy or guess they've been busy for

00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:08,109
years so they have a list of projects I

00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:10,450
know and Wayne has been very good at you

00:38:08,109 --> 00:38:14,230
know getting me in contact with a bunch

00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:14,650
of different teams so pretty much every

00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:15,850
month

00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:18,760
you're gonna see something from him

00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:21,400
stuck in line unless somebody else has a

00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:24,580
project and we're gonna try to do two of

00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:27,880
those right so that we can go deep into

00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:31,240
each and last time we covered shield but

00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:34,570
there was no demo and and because it's

00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:36,040
such a I guess it's a big project and

00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:39,869
it's pretty nice

00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:44,290
what we are gonna do now is to do a demo

00:38:39,869 --> 00:38:46,780
so I think when you can take over the

00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:53,710
screen and you know I guess maximize it

00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:54,600
that your colleague can do cool all

00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:58,450
right

00:38:54,600 --> 00:39:00,960
yeah yeah I'm ready hurry everybody's

00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:03,190
watching me

00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:07,960
everyone's watching their laptops and

00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:09,910
reading slacks no so yes they're all my

00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:13,359
name's John if you can't tell from the

00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:15,190
name on my zoom Tyler I'm a carve

00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:16,510
engineer it's dark and moving which is

00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:18,520
fine when I tell people that aren't

00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:20,230
technical related because we say cloud

00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:21,970
engineer I think they just imagine we

00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:27,250
like boil water or something I don't

00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:30,369
know but anyways yes so I'm gonna be

00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:32,170
talking about a shield specifically I'm

00:39:30,369 --> 00:39:35,830
just gonna be giving like an overview of

00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:39,100
the project so can you guys all see my

00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:40,750
screen yeah yep okay probably everyone's

00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:42,670
muted so they all said yes and I can't

00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:49,540
hear you so I heard one yes so it's good

00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:51,100
enough for me yes so this is the repo

00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:54,640
that it's in it's under Stark and Wayne

00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:57,630
and shield is basically used to backup

00:39:54,640 --> 00:40:00,220
and restore a bunch of different systems

00:39:57,630 --> 00:40:02,890
we've designed it in such a way to where

00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:04,630
we have a plugin system where what

00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:07,510
you're actually backing up we call it

00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:08,590
target and then the way that we actually

00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:12,910
save these

00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:14,410
cups use a plugin called a store so if I

00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:17,730
scroll down here a little bit we have

00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:21,490
this nice table where you can see all

00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:23,470
the different things that we can backup

00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:25,000
which would be under this target and the

00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:27,760
things that where we can actually save

00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:31,510
our backups to so you just click on any

00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:35,380
of these you get this documentation that

00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:37,000
shows you how to configure it so the

00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:38,830
cool thing is this is an open source

00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,780
project if you see something on here

00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:44,200
that you say hey this would be really

00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:47,040
cool to add in like by all means you

00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:50,170
know make it submit a pull request

00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:53,950
they're actually not overwhelmingly

00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:56,170
complicated here so this is the Postgres

00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:59,080
one in the first 80 lines is

00:40:56,170 --> 00:41:02,620
documentation but the entire go file is

00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:05,710
300 lines you know - 80 lines for

00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:07,870
comments so it's actually not as crazy

00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:09,580
as you might think so you can look at

00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:12,330
any of these different plugins to be

00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:17,050
able to implement one

00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:20,110
so anyways about like a few weeks ago I

00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:21,820
was working with a client and I had to

00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:25,510
get familiar with shield so what I did

00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:28,570
is normally we just deployed this using

00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:30,790
a Bosch release but what I went through

00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:34,060
and did is create a local version that

00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:36,910
you can run inside docker compose so if

00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:38,770
we so this is a new edition just a few

00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:42,160
days ago so if we go to the dev folder

00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:44,560
inside shield you can just set up docker

00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:46,570
compose and I have a bunch of directions

00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:48,850
in this directory and the readme on how

00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:51,820
to set it up it's pretty pretty

00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:54,490
straightforward and what it will do is

00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:58,330
it will actually spin up web UI so you

00:41:54,490 --> 00:42:02,050
can actually go through your browser to

00:41:58,330 --> 00:42:04,840
do backups restores target all those

00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:08,020
different features that we have she'll

00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:09,550
also has a CLI the CLI has more features

00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:12,040
and that's kind of like where we

00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:16,270
implements things first and then they

00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:17,830
kind of trickle into the web UI yes so

00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:20,950
this this particular evening has

00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:22,170
examples on how to use the CI and it

00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:24,480
doesn't show every

00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:26,460
command but it gives you like a good run

00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,740
through on how to use it but what I'm

00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:30,420
going to do is show the web UI and then

00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:32,640
if anyone wants to go through and kind

00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:34,920
of play around with the COI he can look

00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:37,769
through this readme and you can run it

00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:40,700
in docker compose setup or you can do it

00:42:37,769 --> 00:42:46,920
on a Bosch release or you can do it

00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:52,710
however you want to set up shield this

00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:57,150
is that like something like god yeah

00:42:52,710 --> 00:43:02,670
yeah it's yeah it's yes it's it's a

00:42:57,150 --> 00:43:05,250
subset of gardening yes yes yeah yeah

00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:08,670
you might have you might its the non

00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:12,450
production version of garden right yeah

00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:16,289
I I do have to admit I I liked docker

00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:17,670
for local development stuff so yeah I

00:43:16,289 --> 00:43:20,309
have to fill it out there some a little

00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:22,619
bias but I can tell I think I can tell

00:43:20,309 --> 00:43:28,230
you're not biased at all so let's let it

00:43:22,619 --> 00:43:30,450
be case is great no no it's good I'm

00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:32,039
glad you you broke the isolate now more

00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:34,890
people are paying attention now so let's

00:43:32,039 --> 00:43:43,410
go death or humor in there once in oil

00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:45,269
right so what was i so basically you can

00:43:43,410 --> 00:43:49,200
just clone the repo and then you can

00:43:45,269 --> 00:43:52,200
just run stackert or compose up and that

00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:53,250
will this is like Baker nut so I I don't

00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:55,710
know if I really need to go into this

00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:59,849
much detail so I apologize if everyone's

00:43:55,710 --> 00:44:01,619
like yeah yeah yeah we know so so what

00:43:59,849 --> 00:44:04,470
I'm going to do over here my terminal

00:44:01,619 --> 00:44:10,230
I'm just going to run the command docker

00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:12,660
compose oh yeah so I just use docker

00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:14,119
compose because I wanted to just see

00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:17,430
what it was like to use docker compose

00:44:14,119 --> 00:44:19,980
but so I didn't have any real particular

00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:22,019
reason but it's got several different

00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:23,819
services in here and what I did is I

00:44:22,019 --> 00:44:26,700
went through the shield box release and

00:44:23,819 --> 00:44:29,970
then kind of copied that to make this

00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:32,670
docker compose you know set up so anyway

00:44:29,970 --> 00:44:35,480
so we have killed running here I'm gonna

00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:38,600
go over to the web UI

00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:40,010
so without how it connects to CFO still

00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:43,190
that would be good

00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:44,240
okay yeah I think I might you know ask

00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:45,380
one of the other people would start

00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:48,140
going to do that because they have more

00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:50,240
experience with that than me but I think

00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:52,550
we have quite a few start grooming

00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:54,650
people so someone in the collective

00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:56,360
knowledge can uh can pull it up I'm sure

00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:59,450
so I know yeah I will definitely bring

00:44:56,360 --> 00:45:02,090
that up thanks for asking so if you just

00:44:59,450 --> 00:45:04,970
go to HTTPS and then it's configured to

00:45:02,090 --> 00:45:06,890
do localhost it's using a self-signed

00:45:04,970 --> 00:45:08,750
cert so your browser will complain at

00:45:06,890 --> 00:45:12,560
you or whatever the first time you you

00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:15,440
know run on the setup but so if you look

00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:20,770
here on the web UI we have this idea of

00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:23,480
retention policies so you can create one

00:45:20,770 --> 00:45:25,370
basically I already created one for ten

00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:29,120
days so but I could click this button

00:45:25,370 --> 00:45:31,670
and I fill out this form so basically

00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:34,640
what that is is like how long all your

00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:37,370
backups going to stay around so you know

00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:40,430
in this particular case I just did ten

00:45:37,370 --> 00:45:42,860
days you know just for the demo here but

00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:44,480
maybe you have a lot longer one I think

00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:46,340
on some of our clients we've done ones

00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:48,770
where we'll maybe do like an hourly one

00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:50,120
but then those only stay around for like

00:45:48,770 --> 00:45:51,530
maybe four days or something like that

00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:53,060
and then they start clearing out and

00:45:51,530 --> 00:45:55,010
then you know if one's there maybe daily

00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:57,020
and those wants to stay for longer so

00:45:55,010 --> 00:46:01,100
you can kind of mix and match how you do

00:45:57,020 --> 00:46:03,170
backups with with how long you retain in

00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:07,520
how often you schedule so you can have

00:46:03,170 --> 00:46:09,440
that flexibility so schedule is probably

00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:14,990
sort of someone gonna ask a question or

00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:16,700
no okay so the schedule is just what you

00:46:14,990 --> 00:46:18,530
would think you could say I want to do

00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:21,230
daily at 10:00 a.m. I want to do it

00:46:18,530 --> 00:46:22,610
hourly at you know every you know at

00:46:21,230 --> 00:46:27,620
when the clock starts

00:46:22,610 --> 00:46:29,630
whatever 15 20 30 whatever so I set one

00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:32,300
up for a daily backup at 10 a.m. and

00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:34,910
then your targets are going to be the

00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:37,970
services that you want to backup and

00:46:34,910 --> 00:46:40,790
this is where shield like I mentioned it

00:46:37,970 --> 00:46:43,940
earlier has abstracted targets and

00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:45,440
stores in such a way that makes it

00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:48,020
really easy to implement but then

00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:48,859
obviously every service has its own

00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:50,809
unique config

00:46:48,859 --> 00:46:52,789
duration so that's where we have this

00:46:50,809 --> 00:46:55,220
configuration field where you can drop

00:46:52,789 --> 00:46:57,619
in information that's specific to that

00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:59,869
service and that's determined by whoever

00:46:57,619 --> 00:47:02,869
writes the plug-in so however the

00:46:59,869 --> 00:47:06,079
plug-in wants to do it that's how you

00:47:02,869 --> 00:47:08,180
get your configuration for that so right

00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:10,369
now it's just a JSON blob that we drop

00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:12,440
in but in the future we'll probably make

00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:14,029
it a way where the plugins will actually

00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:17,180
say what fields they need and then you

00:47:14,029 --> 00:47:18,710
have a slightly better user interaction

00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:22,880
here rather than disrupting in a JSON

00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:25,849
blob one over one other thing of note

00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:28,690
here where it says remote IP port that's

00:47:25,849 --> 00:47:31,400
gonna be the shield agent that's running

00:47:28,690 --> 00:47:34,970
I'm not going to get into too much crazy

00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:36,200
detail here but you have a shield daemon

00:47:34,970 --> 00:47:38,509
that's the actual server that's

00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:40,700
accepting API requests then you have a

00:47:38,509 --> 00:47:42,999
separate in this case it's a docker

00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:46,730
container but it would be its own via

00:47:42,999 --> 00:47:49,130
typically and this is where you would

00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:51,170
enter it the IP address or hostname and

00:47:49,130 --> 00:47:53,720
port for that shield agent that's

00:47:51,170 --> 00:47:55,690
configured it that that's the thing that

00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:59,329
will go and actually directly talk to

00:47:55,690 --> 00:48:01,910
Postgres to my sequel to ever service

00:47:59,329 --> 00:48:04,640
you're backing up so just make sure that

00:48:01,910 --> 00:48:08,900
that box can talk to that source and

00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:11,630
that's good and then the shield Damon

00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:13,369
needs to know how to talk to that so you

00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:16,579
just put the IP address in for the field

00:48:13,369 --> 00:48:18,589
agent in its port and that's that's how

00:48:16,579 --> 00:48:22,190
it works

00:48:18,589 --> 00:48:25,519
so I already created one for Postgres

00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:28,430
and where we're actually storing it I'm

00:48:25,519 --> 00:48:30,589
just using the file system for tagging

00:48:28,430 --> 00:48:35,299
but if we go back to the documentation

00:48:30,589 --> 00:48:39,680
here you can see that we also support s3

00:48:35,299 --> 00:48:42,140
and Scalla T for storing backups so

00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:44,809
that's your current options like I said

00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:46,039
you're welcome to shameless plug

00:48:44,809 --> 00:48:48,200
you always welcome to write a plug-in

00:48:46,039 --> 00:48:52,749
and submit a pull request those are

00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:55,339
always greatly appreciated so this is

00:48:52,749 --> 00:48:57,680
the configuration is pretty simple here

00:48:55,339 --> 00:49:01,460
I'm just setting where I want to store

00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:02,570
that but there's also other fields that

00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:04,730
you may

00:49:02,570 --> 00:49:08,030
think of that you may use but those are

00:49:04,730 --> 00:49:10,160
all documented if you go into the readme

00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:12,560
here and we just go to like file system

00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:14,510
and we'll see up here where it says

00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:16,070
plugging configuration all the plugins

00:49:14,510 --> 00:49:18,650
have a section like this where it will

00:49:16,070 --> 00:49:20,330
show you the fields that are optional

00:49:18,650 --> 00:49:23,140
the fields that are required and then

00:49:20,330 --> 00:49:25,730
maybe what the default configuration is

00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:27,530
she'll go out of the box just assumes

00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:29,840
that it's going to be running in the

00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:31,580
Bosch release so there's a few fields

00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:34,300
that you may need to like override if

00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:36,590
you're running it not inside Bosch but

00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:41,150
who do we do that

00:49:36,590 --> 00:49:43,160
right everyone uses Bosch so yeah and

00:49:41,150 --> 00:49:45,410
then the last little piece here is a job

00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:47,840
which actually pulls in all the

00:49:45,410 --> 00:49:49,670
different pieces that we've just made so

00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:51,170
you give it a name and all these

00:49:49,670 --> 00:49:53,870
different fields have a summary field

00:49:51,170 --> 00:49:55,460
where the summary is kind of just used

00:49:53,870 --> 00:49:58,730
for whatever information you want to

00:49:55,460 --> 00:50:01,010
fill in there so it's not actually used

00:49:58,730 --> 00:50:07,250
by the system it's more by the humans

00:50:01,010 --> 00:50:12,380
that are looking at it so so for this

00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:16,040
particular setup I made like a just like

00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:18,230
I have a Postgres database running and I

00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:22,310
have and just some dummy data all it is

00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:25,880
is just a table called people and then

00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:28,190
it has three entries that I'm showing

00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:30,440
here so I just said dummy data and then

00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:32,770
I call the table people so I'm not

00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:38,690
calling these people dummies but anyways

00:50:32,770 --> 00:50:41,990
realize that so if we go to I'm going to

00:50:38,690 --> 00:50:46,120
use PG admin and I'm going to connect to

00:50:41,990 --> 00:50:48,740
that docker Postgres that's running and

00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:50,960
then what I'm going to do is to show we

00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:53,000
have this people table I'm going to make

00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:54,680
a backup and then I'm going to drop the

00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,660
table table and then I'm going to

00:50:54,680 --> 00:51:00,710
restore it just so you kind of see how

00:50:56,660 --> 00:51:03,560
it all works together and then after

00:51:00,710 --> 00:51:08,630
that we'll do some questions and answers

00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:10,820
and stuff like that so all right so like

00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:13,570
this job is scheduled to run daily at

00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:15,460
10:00 a.m. but

00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:17,380
I click this little button here this

00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:19,680
will go out and manually run the job for

00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:23,490
us so now if I go over to the dashboard

00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:25,300
now this was a really quick backup so

00:51:23,490 --> 00:51:27,880
normally you'd see it under running

00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:30,220
tasks here and in this particular case

00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:33,940
I'm just going to click here and what's

00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:36,070
really cool is it shows you all the

00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:39,400
output that you actually got from the

00:51:36,070 --> 00:51:41,530
system and this is really helpful for

00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:43,240
debugging purposes so if you see

00:51:41,530 --> 00:51:45,420
something like a backup fail maybe

00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:47,530
things aren't communicating properly or

00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:51,670
whatever you can imagine this gives you

00:51:47,530 --> 00:51:55,480
a nice output for that and then I'm just

00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:58,390
gonna go through and yeah just for

00:51:55,480 --> 00:52:03,220
posterity I'll just drop the table it's

00:51:58,390 --> 00:52:09,480
fun dropping tables or right now if I go

00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:11,980
up to would you say said ok Bobby yes

00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:13,810
and I'm going to click restore here so

00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:15,790
this is a backup I took earlier this

00:52:13,810 --> 00:52:19,270
morning it's on here I'm going to click

00:52:15,790 --> 00:52:23,580
the most recent one and then it's

00:52:19,270 --> 00:52:26,590
confirming and then we'll hit OK and

00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:34,810
that's us your tables probably I need to

00:52:26,590 --> 00:52:38,950
reconnect I go to our shield database

00:52:34,810 --> 00:52:41,110
that I made and then basically what

00:52:38,950 --> 00:52:44,050
we're really gonna be looking at here is

00:52:41,110 --> 00:52:47,170
the tables back so I dropped the table

00:52:44,050 --> 00:52:49,420
and then I restored it so that's kind of

00:52:47,170 --> 00:52:53,170
just a super basic workflow and then a

00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:55,780
different concept so apologize if

00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:58,480
everybody already knows all this but you

00:52:55,780 --> 00:53:00,910
can do all this and more with the CLI

00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:02,500
and that readme and that dev folder in

00:53:00,910 --> 00:53:05,310
our project will show you how to go

00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:09,250
through I'm using the CLI for a bunch of

00:53:05,310 --> 00:53:11,560
search with that so with this you you

00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:13,870
guys are able to connect to it like ACF

00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:17,500
environment and back up the entire Cappy

00:53:13,870 --> 00:53:20,200
database the disk and store it John

00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:22,360
so we for our customers a lot of times

00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:25,600
what we do is we will actually do

00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:27,000
exactly that we backup the CCD be the

00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:31,150
Diego DB

00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:33,520
and please call the core databases we

00:53:31,150 --> 00:53:36,370
usually use this to back them up

00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:38,320
whether it's unfortunately on Pola minus

00:53:36,370 --> 00:53:42,820
QL or if it's actually fortunately on

00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:45,310
Postgres no bias there we have plug-ins

00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:47,470
for those databases for example in

00:53:45,310 --> 00:53:49,720
whatever the customer happens running

00:53:47,470 --> 00:53:51,790
uses to back up the systems itself we

00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:54,730
also had shield also has a special mode

00:53:51,790 --> 00:53:57,580
for complete it actually is first class

00:53:54,730 --> 00:54:00,280
concept for recovery from disaster for

00:53:57,580 --> 00:54:02,080
the entire Cloud Foundry itself and then

00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:04,600
cluding washed databases and stuff like

00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:07,510
that and so we also use this to backup

00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:09,160
like the core Bosch databases and all of

00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:11,170
those things so that yeah this is a true

00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:16,120
disaster recovery solution for Cloud

00:54:11,170 --> 00:54:17,860
Foundry whether it's OSS or PCF the

00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:21,040
matter of you know instrumenting into

00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:25,750
the particular environment of the client

00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:30,010
essentially customer yeah and I saw that

00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:32,620
it was MIT license is it also for the UI

00:54:30,010 --> 00:54:37,330
or is it just for the course it also

00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:39,340
Madeline it's all in one okay okay I

00:54:37,330 --> 00:54:42,210
don't know if anybody a lot of questions

00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:42,210
we have about seven minutes

00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:58,060
there is nothing preventing a plug-in to

00:54:56,290 --> 00:54:59,700
be written to backup the blob stores if

00:54:58,060 --> 00:55:02,320
that's something that somebody desires

00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:05,200
okay it would literally just be another

00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:07,030
agent plug-in there it does what a

00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:08,530
backup the blobstore means and what

00:55:07,030 --> 00:55:11,560
restoring it means and it probably

00:55:08,530 --> 00:55:13,180
wouldn't be a terrific work in Wayne

00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:15,220
what we're doing right now for one of my

00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:16,870
clients is we're actually using it to

00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:18,940
backup the Boche pop stores for the

00:55:16,870 --> 00:55:23,740
recent packages and good stuff and we're

00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:34,450
using the hardest to ship it local

00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:37,240
blobster non-st version on Prem yes the

00:55:34,450 --> 00:55:38,590
answer is yes yes it does it's not short

00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:40,120
by any means it takes a while obviously

00:55:38,590 --> 00:55:43,900
you're constraint there is

00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:45,880
there's no network but we can get the

00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:48,220
bulb Bosch blobstore backed up in the

00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:50,380
store in about an hour and a half okay

00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:53,740
and cloud controllers blobstore kind of

00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:55,510
similar elements as long as we know

00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:59,920
where it is file system we can back to

00:55:55,510 --> 00:56:04,900
them okay they just might be

00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:12,730
inconsistent a little bit depending on

00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:15,520
the activity right very cool yeah any

00:56:12,730 --> 00:56:17,710
other questions folks if you like he

00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:19,300
showed the basically the schedules and

00:56:17,710 --> 00:56:22,570
stuff like that if you have some an

00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:25,420
agent backs up the core databases at a

00:56:22,570 --> 00:56:28,330
certain time as well another agent backs

00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:29,860
up the blob storage at that same time

00:56:28,330 --> 00:56:32,020
then you could actually have all the

00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:34,540
things snapshot at around the same time

00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:37,480
right and then you would minimize you or

00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:40,720
inconsistency surface but yeah it's

00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:48,430
better than nothing so it's not faster

00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:50,550
than manually resurrecting yeah so we

00:56:48,430 --> 00:56:53,650
have only about a few more minutes left

00:56:50,550 --> 00:56:56,740
let me remind folks of a few things so

00:56:53,650 --> 00:57:01,420
of course if you want if you have a

00:56:56,740 --> 00:57:03,130
project and you want to present you are

00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:06,670
more than welcome right I mean part of

00:57:03,130 --> 00:57:08,620
the idea is to use this call to present

00:57:06,670 --> 00:57:12,400
what the community is doing that you

00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:14,950
know you may not know about and as I

00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:16,810
said our friend from stuck in Wayne have

00:57:14,950 --> 00:57:18,700
a lot of projects but you know we also

00:57:16,810 --> 00:57:22,360
want to make sure that people have their

00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:24,160
projects and with this zoom revelation

00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:26,380
now we'll be able to see what you're

00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:29,580
doing and do a really cool demo like

00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:32,680
John and Wayne just did for so please

00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:35,290
make sure you line up your projects that

00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:38,200
us know the other thing is I'm looking

00:57:35,290 --> 00:57:40,900
for feedback on this call so if you have

00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:44,020
feedback you know feel free to ping me

00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:46,390
or you we or anybody I'll chip directly

00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:48,610
if you if you have feedback on me right

00:57:46,390 --> 00:57:52,810
whatever you have feedback on just make

00:57:48,610 --> 00:57:55,170
sure you provide that and we can collect

00:57:52,810 --> 00:57:55,170
it

00:57:55,979 --> 00:58:03,489
if there are no questions I would I want

00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:05,829
to thank Wayne again for introducing us

00:58:03,489 --> 00:58:08,079
to zoom and for stopping Wayne for this

00:58:05,829 --> 00:58:11,430
presentation thank you

00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:14,289
that was really good Oh your beer and

00:58:11,430 --> 00:58:16,630
talk to max I just want to jump in and

00:58:14,289 --> 00:58:18,849
say that part of the great part of zoom

00:58:16,630 --> 00:58:20,920
is video like to encourage next time

00:58:18,849 --> 00:58:24,430
hopefully people install their video

00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:25,779
cameras ryan metallicy oh let's start

00:58:24,430 --> 00:58:28,809
from whence you know this person is

00:58:25,779 --> 00:58:30,339
talking and if you guys want to know

00:58:28,809 --> 00:58:33,160
more about zoom we use it all the time

00:58:30,339 --> 00:58:34,960
this is our tool for pairing and for you

00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:36,130
know we're all cloud companies here so

00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:38,979
we all probably have people remote

00:58:36,130 --> 00:58:41,140
locations and this is our tool of choice

00:58:38,979 --> 00:58:43,359
which is why we wanted to offer it up to

00:58:41,140 --> 00:58:45,670
do this call and they'll be on other

00:58:43,359 --> 00:58:47,229
types of calls in the future too because

00:58:45,670 --> 00:58:48,700
we think it's a real great tool but we

00:58:47,229 --> 00:58:50,529
also like to see people's faces so when

00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:51,910
we run into you at shows or you know at

00:58:50,529 --> 00:58:53,829
the coffee shop down the street

00:58:51,910 --> 00:58:55,749
we know who we're seeing it's not just a

00:58:53,829 --> 00:58:57,579
voice is actually a face so people will

00:58:55,749 --> 00:59:02,559
use this to its fullest

00:58:57,579 --> 00:59:09,969
thank you yeah yes tools that includes

00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:12,460
pants and ear sorry I want to interject

00:59:09,969 --> 00:59:14,979
one more quick thing for shield there is

00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:17,680
a select channel under the Cloud Foundry

00:59:14,979 --> 00:59:18,999
slack so if there's any you know if you

00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:20,710
have any questions or anything like that

00:59:18,999 --> 00:59:21,969
you can direct it there and someone with

00:59:20,710 --> 00:59:25,390
them that the community can help you out

00:59:21,969 --> 00:59:27,759
so yeah and again guys this is MIT

00:59:25,390 --> 00:59:30,400
license so nothing's preventing you from

00:59:27,759 --> 00:59:32,739
trying it really so thank you stop

00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:36,339
anyway all right everybody I guess we'll

00:59:32,739 --> 00:59:38,259
talk again in March I will send the

00:59:36,339 --> 00:59:40,809
notes I appreciate everybody joining

00:59:38,259 --> 00:59:42,039
will chat again Cheers

00:59:40,809 --> 00:59:45,700
