00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:06,500
count as a quorum

00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:23,400

Foundry community advisory board meeting

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,269
it's going to be a short one I think but

00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:42,059
we'll cover some some updates as we

00:00:39,269 --> 00:00:45,750
always do I posted a link to the cab

00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:49,019
agenda in the chat it's the normal

00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:51,329
Google Doc link that that rolls up all

00:00:49,019 --> 00:00:55,589
the all the notes from all of the

00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:58,409
meetings so for July 15 I want to kick

00:00:55,589 --> 00:01:00,930
it off with cff highlights and updates

00:00:58,409 --> 00:01:05,129
and I want to extend a warm welcome to

00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:07,310
our new developer evangelists I don't

00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:08,970
know if I've got the title right

00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:10,590
Shedrick akin tayo

00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:12,689
I hope I've got that pronunciation right

00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:18,240
and RAM do you want to introduce

00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:24,780
yourself Ram yeah sure thanks Troy hello

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:29,010
everyone I have been doing some fun

00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:32,150
stuff around DevOps folks particularly

00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:35,310
with a performance monitoring tool and

00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:44,150
open shift in the past couple of years

00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:47,870
so conversations with chip led to this

00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:52,370
opportunity where the idea is to sort of

00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:55,080
spread the cheer among people who are

00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:57,080
not just enterprise developers and

00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:59,250
people who are not just in like

00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:02,280
companies that have over a thousand

00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:05,450
employees so I think the idea is to

00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:13,290
focus on Cloud Foundry for smaller teams

00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:16,709
and startups and things like that yeah I

00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:19,170
have some background in in teaching

00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:21,239
computer science at college and it being

00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:24,659
a software engineer for a few years in

00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:26,569
different places so hopefully I'm able

00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:30,830
to bring all of that share and

00:02:26,569 --> 00:02:34,370
experience into the efforts

00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:39,740
cool we're about three based like Namib

00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:44,660
a sort of thing yeah yeah so the time is

00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:47,450
is really yeah yeah this is difficult

00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:53,630
yeah this is my post dinner Netflix

00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:56,720
thing okay and when did you start with

00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:58,760
with the foundation just a week ago okay

00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:02,150
well welcome welcome welcome aboard

00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:04,400
more than merrier always I'm really

00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:07,090
excited to hear that smaller

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,770
organizations are gonna be a focus for

00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:12,320
Cloud Foundry evangelism efforts I've

00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:14,180
always long felt that small footprint

00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:17,600
cloud foundry was something we should

00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:19,700
pursue and that it shouldn't just be for

00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:23,959
the big teams that anyone can use this

00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:25,490
this platform so it's one of my favorite

00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:26,959
use cases to put it in a smaller

00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:30,590
organization and help that organization

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:32,660
grow so I'm really glad that's part of a

00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:38,000
focus that we've got and hopefully we'll

00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:39,620
have have Shedrick available for the

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,300
next call yeah you don't think you could

00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:43,459

your earlier tweets that you're just

00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:06,650
finding your footing with Cloud Foundry

00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:08,660
and learning about it as you go what are

00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:13,280

00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:22,790
a pistol you want an engineer it's it's

00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:26,360

00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:30,020
thing break into the to the cloud needs

00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:31,940
if technology sector so it was really

00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:34,850
easy for me and so far the Millennial

00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:36,770
person quite it's like food I mean I be

00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:39,410

00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:51,680
later but very warm welcome aboard

00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:53,450
to the foundation into the community

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,060
yeah thank you

00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:59,260
welcome Sheriff I think the fact

00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:59,260
increase sorry

00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:07,980
okay I see there's a lot of excellent

00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:11,700
PMC highlights and updates so I'd love

00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:14,550
to hand it over I guess to Eric to go

00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:16,350
over them yeah thanks Trey yeah thought

00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:17,760
I'd just do a quick rundown of some of

00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:20,010
the project updates within the app

00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:23,580
runtime BMC I think the biggest news is

00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:26,670
that the CLI team finally released the

00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:26,940
first GA of the v7 CI so that's great

00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:28,590
news

00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:32,010
no that was imminent in our last call

00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:33,840
and we had a lot of discussion about

00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:37,550
that at Summit so again correct

00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:40,050
congratulations to them and to main

00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:43,370
integration projects are continuing to

00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:45,570
move forward relevant released another

00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:47,670
minor version of CF rockets

00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:49,620
that's how integrating the potato build

00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:52,710
pack work that the Cappy team was doing

00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:54,450
also integrating the route CRD work that

00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:56,370
the networking team has been doing over

00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:58,920
the past few months and they're also now

00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:03,080
focused on doing more careful management

00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:05,610
of this address that CF or gates is

00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:07,650
incorporating and they're starting to

00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:09,690
use corks secret for that to do the auto

00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:12,690
generation yeah so that's it's great

00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:15,630
great cross collaboration across the CF

00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:17,520
projects there and then some updates

00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:18,770
from cube CF under they've been refining

00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:22,050
some of the multi clusterer

00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:26,640
Diego cell configurations that they were

00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:28,080
exploring previously and vided also

00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,520
mentioned that they're working on some

00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,790
smoother integration of alternative

00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:35,820
stacks for I reading some of the

00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:37,590
component teams capi is another they've

00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:39,930
done that decomposition of the

00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:41,820
monolithic a pack builder into the

00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:43,710
custom builder with a separate stack and

00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:46,680
store bill packs they're working on

00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:49,890
getting the automatic rule out of stack

00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:53,520
updates in that kpac set of resources to

00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:54,720
application instances and let's see I

00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,940
know some things that networking is

00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:01,820
working on they're working on getting

00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:04,260
more deliberate reporting of access logs

00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:06,540
associated to a route into app log

00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:09,120
streams and I've also been doing some

00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:13,280
things to tighten down the system

00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:14,690
component network security in CF rotates

00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:17,470
I know Irene he's still working on

00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:19,760
application tasks I think there's a

00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:20,150
looks like they're nearly at the end of

00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,610
that

00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:23,960
Jules should be coming back this weekend

00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:26,720
it looks like he's got a fair amount of

00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:29,330
acceptance to clear out as his welcome

00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:32,210
back present for paternity leave and

00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:35,000
they're also continuing to work on some

00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:37,340
more internal CRD representations of the

00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,820
resources that are in the Irene API so

00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:45,950
as moving deeper into the kubernetes api

00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:48,970
machinery for their workflows a couple

00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:51,470
other highlights UA now has Prometheus

00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:52,640
available metrics exposed on its gate

00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:55,580
deployments artifact so they've

00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:58,580
incorporated the stats the exporter see

00:10:55,580 --> 00:11:00,170
you translate the stats D metrics they

00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:02,630
were emitting previously and then they

00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:04,190
put the annotations on so Prometheus can

00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:08,360
scrape those in a kubernetes environment

00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:10,300
and like neon metrics I know they've I

00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:14,840
mentioned they're resolving a few of

00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:17,120
issues they've seen in CF deployment 13

00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,410
around this Aslaug agent and then

00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,560
they're also starting to explore whether

00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:24,740
it would make sense for them to be able

00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:27,920
to use some of the metadata that Kathy

00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:30,440
has been exposing in the API so labels

00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,270
and annotations to translate into

00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:35,060
annotations that would make their way on

00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:36,470
to log messages for applications so

00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,940
certainly if you if you have any

00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:44,720
thoughts about that I'm sure they'd

00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:45,800
appreciate feedback that's I think about

00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,620
it for the app runtime

00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:50,270
EMC over the last month I don't know if

00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:52,670
we have any Bosch or extensions

00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:55,130
highlights to mention I didn't get my

00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:56,990
extension highlights together so I would

00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:59,150
be the person to provide that so I'm

00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:02,570
gonna have to go back and fill in the

00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:05,240
blanks later Stratos continues apace

00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:09,440
that's actually the most active project

00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:13,250
in extensions in terms of commits volume

00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:16,670
and change so I don't have an update

00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:20,600
there other than we I think we had any a

00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:22,780
point release of Stratos if you don't

00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:27,240
mind Erik I wouldn't mind going back and

00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:29,970
talking about first of all briefly

00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:33,390
when does Jules get back from parental

00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:38,610
leave I had heard he might be back this

00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:39,930
week oh and of course dr. Jules ahead of

00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:42,709
the ireenie project is now for our

00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:46,140
father of a daughter named Zoey which is

00:12:42,709 --> 00:12:50,190
congratulations to him very happy for

00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:52,380
him and he we need him we need him back

00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:58,890
but we also need him to enjoy that time

00:12:52,380 --> 00:13:00,450
as well Susan might be able to we looks

00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:02,670
like we're able to contribute someone to

00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:04,589
that team but we'll talk with with the

00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:07,440
members of that team about that I wanted

00:13:04,589 --> 00:13:13,160
to go back to the discussion that

00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:17,640
happened about the v7 CLI specifically

00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:20,160
about the fact that there is not in this

00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:22,709
in the release announcement and the

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:25,320
notes about it it looked like there was

00:13:22,709 --> 00:13:27,480
zero overlap between supported versions

00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:29,310
of Cathy so a release would come out

00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,680
everything up to a certain release and I

00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:35,730
can't remember which one it was

00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:38,910
was v6 is supported and then the next

00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:42,089
one only the seven is supported that

00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:45,180
scared some people and Steve Greenberg

00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:46,050
and I chatted with with the CLI team to

00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:49,680
get a little bit more clarification

00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:52,200
about that and it's really about the API

00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:56,339
endpoints which are supported so as long

00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:58,709
as the v2 API endpoint is still exposed

00:13:56,339 --> 00:14:02,160
by by Cloud Foundry and by Cathy it's

00:13:58,709 --> 00:14:06,300
not going to break with visa so you can

00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:08,130
actually use the v6 client until that

00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:10,560
and the v2 endpoint is removed is that

00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:12,240
your understanding as well yeah that

00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,970
sounds right to me that there's there's

00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:17,730
some decoupling there between the

00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:20,790
controller API versions and those CLI

00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:22,890
versions yeah and so since the the v2

00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:25,770
API is are on a separate deprecation and

00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:27,660
removal schedule then you know older C

00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:30,360
lies will continue to interoperate with

00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:32,520
those yeah and and that's that was

00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:35,370
comforting to hear that because the

00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:36,990
language in in the release notes was a

00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:38,760
little alarming to some of us who

00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:41,150
thought well how you know we're gonna

00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:43,010
have to plan a migration where everybody

00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:44,360
no and all of our build pipelines and

00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:50,690
everything are going to have to shift

00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:53,240
from v6 to b7 when we upgrade Cloud

00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:55,520
Foundry to the next CF deployment that's

00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:57,680
not strictly the case it's the wording

00:14:55,520 --> 00:15:01,640
of the release so so we'll talk about

00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:03,110
maybe change maybe expanding that a

00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,370
little bit to describe that there's

00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:07,160
going to be some overlap there because

00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:08,900
that that worried some of us yeah that

00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,190
definitely sounds confusing I think it

00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:13,280
certainly makes sense to provide a

00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:16,730
little more clarity on the compatibility

00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:19,910
between CLI versions and CF server-side

00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:22,460
versions now I just see norm joined us

00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:26,690
from Stark and Wayne welcome norm

00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:31,220
and since we're on the topic of v3 API

00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:33,110
and the V said the CF 7 client something

00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:36,200
that that we talked about during the

00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:40,220
summit when it hit us in a lab was the

00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:42,350
higher load put on the clock controller

00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:45,020
because a certain amount of processing

00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:48,200
is happening now server side rather than

00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:49,340
client side right norm could you just

00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,980
talk a little bit about the concern

00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:55,730
there and and what you've observed what

00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:58,310
I observed is is that the when you're

00:15:55,730 --> 00:16:01,430
doing the individual calls because I do

00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:05,450
so many extra calls back to the back end

00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:08,870
I see that the operation of basic calls

00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:13,940
like CF apps running about two to three

00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:17,240
times slower than the CF CLI for version

00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:21,410
6 what's interesting to me is is when

00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:23,950
you use the CF curl command that doesn't

00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:28,130
exist at all I don't see the slowdown I

00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:30,260
mean it makes a major difference one of

00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:33,130
the things I saw that was in the channel

00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:35,420
of this CF CLI people as they were

00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:37,580
reworking how they're doing some of the

00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:41,270
logging in and it looks like they're

00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:43,670
going to in version 1.8 change how they

00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:46,700
do things so more things will be cached

00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:50,030
on the client side which should resolve

00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:52,250
that issue of that slowness but they're

00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:54,769
not planning to put that out into 1.8

00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:57,170
fine Frank okay

00:16:54,769 --> 00:16:59,869
we'll keep an eye on that but it's it

00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:01,369
reinforces the the message that we

00:16:59,869 --> 00:17:04,039
should be performance testing this stuff

00:17:01,369 --> 00:17:07,370
to spot things like this I reported it

00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:09,829
back six to eight months ago but because

00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:12,020
they were so underwater they didn't want

00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:14,569
to look at that issue at all and say

00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:16,370
they actually took my issue and closed

00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:19,850
it says we can't we're not going to

00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:20,990
resolve this and so just leaving it open

00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:22,250
and say this is going to be resolved

00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:24,589
sometime in the future when you look at

00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:26,390
it I gave them timing estimates and

00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:28,779
everything else along with it show why

00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:31,940
is this true thanks for doing that

00:17:28,779 --> 00:17:34,700
- speaking from sa P we've done same

00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:37,520
observations and also reported that the

00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:40,880
copy team so in one particular setup was

00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:43,220
easy f7 CLI and some beta versions we

00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:47,059
observed some performance degradations

00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:49,730
from about five minutes was C of six in

00:17:47,059 --> 00:17:51,409
a space was lots of applications I think

00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:53,480
it was 70 applications or something like

00:17:51,409 --> 00:17:57,309
that which was rather big okay and -

00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:59,450
took two hours and ten minutes was yeah

00:17:57,309 --> 00:18:01,580
that's why we said okay this is

00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:03,200
something we cannot we don't have to

00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:05,240
talk about that and with the part of the

00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:09,770
pack and their improvement so we don't

00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:12,529
have yet see you have certain dot five

00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:15,830
and our big landscapes due to some other

00:18:12,529 --> 00:18:19,340
reasons so we cannot do this comparison

00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:20,360
with the GA version and we got some

00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:24,580
feedbacks that there are improvements

00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:24,580
but I think it's a long way to go until

00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:32,480
they actually build a full set up up

00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:35,720
front or v6 was actually doing aging

00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,850
pulling in the data as needed so that so

00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:39,230
that's so even though it took you five

00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:40,630
minutes in the old one because you were

00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:45,529
doing page by page by page and

00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:48,200
restricted your request on the CFC lie

00:18:45,529 --> 00:18:52,220
it would be the full request and get all

00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:54,320
the data and then aged out so the time

00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:57,230
to get all that data was because it was

00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:59,389
doing a full table scans instead of you

00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:01,460
know index scans it was a great deal

00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:03,470
slower what's going on there

00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:05,570
I also reported that issue to them as

00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:08,799
well I don't know what the outcome of

00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:12,200
that one was yeah but I'm pretty sure

00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:14,240
that would be more so once we have our

00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,620
landscape updated we will also do some

00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,510
performance investigations and there

00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:19,400
will be lots of feedback I'm afraid but

00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:22,370
anyway yes it has to be addressed in

00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:24,470
sand right if we look into the specific

00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:26,419
cases I'm sure that this can be improved

00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:30,020
quite a lot I mean there were some ideas

00:19:26,419 --> 00:19:32,179
was in the two API you have the

00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:34,460
possibility with summary end points and

00:19:32,179 --> 00:19:38,900
with includes especially on the object

00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:41,000
and similar stuff probably some gaps and

00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:45,470
the v3 API still there are some includes

00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:49,250
but it's not yet so elaborated as it was

00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:50,870
in in the v2 but yeah I guess it can be

00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:53,330
improved that's not something I would

00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:56,120
have seen and as a point regarding the

00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:59,390
versions that I want to bring so I

00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:02,650
tested actually is a ga version against

00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:05,299
our landscapes which are not yet on

00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:09,830
working dot five so it's supposed not to

00:20:05,299 --> 00:20:11,630
work unfortunately well there's an error

00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:12,890
message missing that explains you why it

00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:15,620
doesn't work so that's also something

00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:18,049
that would put to worse just to print

00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:20,240
out okay is this CF version is obviously

00:20:18,049 --> 00:20:21,860
- oh it and what you get is here you get

00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,660
a feedback SEPA certain endpoint is

00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:24,980
simply not implemented or that the

00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:27,470
parameter was missing one see of

00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:29,720
upsizing that's also something which

00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:36,049
which can help to make it a little bit

00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:38,960
nicer for the users one other bumps in

00:20:36,049 --> 00:20:43,250
the road and I've seen is if you attempt

00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:46,429
to use of these seven CLI against the v6

00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:49,640
you lie and Hades involve because the

00:20:46,429 --> 00:20:52,309
ageing parameter names have changed

00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:54,320
they will error out saying you can't

00:20:52,309 --> 00:20:56,230
find it but these seven stuff will air

00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:59,059
it out saying can't find its parameters

00:20:56,230 --> 00:21:01,130
page side look let's say it's pages

00:20:59,059 --> 00:21:02,720
instead of page size you know get

00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:04,250
through words you could write at least

00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,110
it tells you what's going on the

00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:07,820
recognized port if you recognize what

00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:09,290
the API is actually doing you could

00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:12,320
realize that what's going on is

00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:14,929
something that two or three people ran

00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,850
into in the when they were trying to do

00:21:14,929 --> 00:21:19,580
the beta release are the

00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:20,510
CF silly and I was able to point them in

00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:22,110
the right direction

00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:25,380
you got to use the right

00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:29,700
I call my only concern is is but trying

00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:33,929
to I don't I wish it would continue

00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:36,030
updating the CLI from version 6 because

00:21:33,929 --> 00:21:38,520
until everything moves over the version

00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:39,690
7 you got to support both and are not

00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,250
doing that at this point they're just

00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:44,370
they're trying to avoid doing any

00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:45,780
updates to the version 6 stuff and I

00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:48,690
think that's I think that's also an

00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:50,700
issue because at least for the next six

00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:52,860
months I think they're in a frame

00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:55,710
transition period then he didn't support

00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:57,960
both not just one this is why it's it's

00:21:55,710 --> 00:22:00,840
good to have this discussion here with

00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:02,460
Eric here but also we did get a little

00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:04,380
bit of clarity from the CLI team that

00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:05,549
they you know for an urgent security

00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:08,070
issue

00:22:05,549 --> 00:22:10,590
with v6 they would they would go ahead

00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:13,080
and patch that so I think with this

00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:15,450
feedback that we're getting that I mean

00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:18,419
very excited about having cf7

00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:20,010
I like that we got the the v3 API but

00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:21,330
it's got some teething problems and

00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:24,090
we're gonna need a bit of overlap there

00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:25,710
I think is the consensus from from

00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:29,370
people who are testing this at scale

00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:31,110
that we're gonna need that v2 API

00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:35,370
endpoint to stick around for a while I

00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:39,450
know for instance cube CF has is just

00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:42,870
gonna be because cat cats the the tests

00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:45,720
are going to move over to C f7 soon and

00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:49,860
so we're we're bumping a cube CF is not

00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:51,150
yet on the version which works with CF 7

00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:53,820
so we're gonna have to bump that and

00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:54,929
change the tests over and so we'll be

00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:59,070
able to contribute

00:22:54,929 --> 00:23:02,820
metrics on on the performance of API

00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:06,720
calls as well as they already any plans

00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:09,780
about the deprecation p4 the two api so

00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:13,200
with ABI announcement soon just to get

00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:16,200
an idea when the application starts and

00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:18,480
how long it takes and it's not supported

00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:20,730
anymore I think there's been some

00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,190
previous announcements about duplication

00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:26,040
schedules but as far as I understand

00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:28,679
that the v3 acceleration team is still

00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:31,320
working through a lot of the transitions

00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:33,630
and replacements of v2 endpoints to v3

00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:35,190
and so we're not even at a point right

00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:35,879
now where we could say ok we're starting

00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:38,759
that Deptford

00:23:35,879 --> 00:23:41,369
window for the entirety of the v2 API so

00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:43,499
I think that's that's they've still got

00:23:41,369 --> 00:23:45,029
that to complete and then we definitely

00:23:43,499 --> 00:23:48,199
won't have long enough transition

00:23:45,029 --> 00:23:51,779
periods away from those old end points

00:23:48,199 --> 00:23:53,579
even once they're done so okay the seven

00:23:51,779 --> 00:24:00,149
is actually calling a number of v2 end

00:23:53,579 --> 00:24:01,799
points for those okay I'm glad we had

00:24:00,149 --> 00:24:05,299
this little talk it's almost good that

00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:07,829
we we have time when this in this call

00:24:05,299 --> 00:24:11,249
because we didn't get the presentations

00:24:07,829 --> 00:24:13,349
so we had that chat and uh because they

00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:17,759
don't have some extensions updates

00:24:13,349 --> 00:24:20,009
really e to share we do have a

00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:23,009
discussion point unless somebody wants

00:24:20,009 --> 00:24:27,629
to I want to congratulate does sue say

00:24:23,009 --> 00:24:29,129
for buying Rancher I would I'd like to

00:24:27,629 --> 00:24:31,229
to but I can say absolutely nothing

00:24:29,129 --> 00:24:32,999
about it of course there's all sorts of

00:24:31,229 --> 00:24:35,190
antitrust things and like so I have to

00:24:32,999 --> 00:24:38,849
wait for a while before I can really

00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:41,009
talk about that at all it's been

00:24:38,849 --> 00:24:47,429
announced it's been announced and that

00:24:41,009 --> 00:24:49,589
was a surprise to me so yeah it's fun

00:24:47,429 --> 00:24:53,249
we're gonna have some potentially have

00:24:49,589 --> 00:24:55,589
some people from that that team or that

00:24:53,249 --> 00:24:58,169
community that would would come and

00:24:55,589 --> 00:25:01,889
participate here let's I hope some some

00:24:58,169 --> 00:25:03,690
really smart people that would have a

00:25:01,889 --> 00:25:09,179
lot to contribute to this community as

00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:11,729
well we do have a proposal that's out

00:25:09,179 --> 00:25:16,589
there on CF dev that Yui wanted to talk

00:25:11,729 --> 00:25:18,449
about and I want to support this is the

00:25:16,589 --> 00:25:21,149
proposal to change the default branch

00:25:18,449 --> 00:25:24,089
names of cloud foundry projects from

00:25:21,149 --> 00:25:25,649
master to main as I think the

00:25:24,089 --> 00:25:27,719
front-runner at this point you want to

00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:33,269
talk a little bit about about what you

00:25:27,719 --> 00:25:36,690
posted yeah I posted that I'm hoping we

00:25:33,269 --> 00:25:41,549
can get to the point where all the the

00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:44,639
PM CDs have have bought in and agreed to

00:25:41,549 --> 00:25:47,129
to make this particular change I think

00:25:44,639 --> 00:25:49,049
since then I've noticed a number of

00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:54,600
other foundations are

00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:58,860
so adopting policies around other

00:25:54,600 --> 00:26:01,529
language and preferring terms like allow

00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:04,379
and deny and things like that of our

00:26:01,529 --> 00:26:07,889
blacklist whitelist so I think that

00:26:04,379 --> 00:26:11,789
that's worth considering some of those

00:26:07,889 --> 00:26:17,129
terms I believe in the networking area

00:26:11,789 --> 00:26:19,139
for example shannon has long where you

00:26:17,129 --> 00:26:22,049
would expect the term like blacklist or

00:26:19,139 --> 00:26:23,789
whitelist shannon has like work to avoid

00:26:22,049 --> 00:26:25,730
that so I don't actually know that we

00:26:23,789 --> 00:26:28,499
have too many instances of those terms

00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:30,809
in Cloud Foundry but I think it's worth

00:26:28,499 --> 00:26:36,299
having all of the the PNC s considering

00:26:30,809 --> 00:26:41,429
auditing the the language that we choose

00:26:36,299 --> 00:26:44,340
to use and I've shared it with the

00:26:41,429 --> 00:26:45,960
extensions pmc recommending that at

00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:47,879
their ease easiest convenience I don't

00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:51,389
want to introduce a lot of mandatory

00:26:47,879 --> 00:26:53,369
churn but at their earliest convenience

00:26:51,389 --> 00:26:57,210
to make that change

00:26:53,369 --> 00:27:01,499
certainly Stratus is on board I know

00:26:57,210 --> 00:27:03,419
from from my cube CF contacts that that

00:27:01,499 --> 00:27:06,570
they are on board with this it's just

00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:08,190
you know pipelines have to change stuff

00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:12,029
has to change so it might be a while

00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:14,850
there's no I haven't seen any objections

00:27:12,029 --> 00:27:16,409
in principle to this it's mostly just

00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:18,419
you know it's going to take time to

00:27:16,409 --> 00:27:20,850
figure out when when to do it and how to

00:27:18,419 --> 00:27:23,789
do it I would say to the community if

00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:25,950
anyone has a particular issue with this

00:27:23,789 --> 00:27:28,499
or if you don't feel comfortable talking

00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:30,539
about it in the wider group and it's

00:27:28,499 --> 00:27:33,389
like you have an objection or a concern

00:27:30,539 --> 00:27:35,850
or you have a particular favorite branch

00:27:33,389 --> 00:27:39,629
name that you'd like to change to and

00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:42,179
you don't feel comfortable you can you

00:27:39,629 --> 00:27:46,590
can approach myself and you a maybe you

00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:48,690
as well directly on on slack to raise

00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:52,499
those concerns this is a sensitive issue

00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:53,850
for some people and and you know you

00:27:52,499 --> 00:27:55,499
don't want to get batted down for

00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:58,350
expressing an opinion so you feel free

00:27:55,499 --> 00:27:58,769
to contact myself or Yui and we talked

00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:02,220
through it

00:27:58,769 --> 00:28:02,710
I believe Eric is putting together a

00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:06,040
proposed

00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:08,260
for the runtime pmc yeah that's that's

00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:10,750
on my plate we had discussed it with the

00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:12,190
attendees at the time PMC meeting last

00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:15,280
week and people were generally

00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:19,860
supportive of both branch renaming we

00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:22,600
may settle on some different patterns as

00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:24,040
as is appropriate for the development

00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:27,220
lifecycle I know somebody posts are

00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:29,710
already doing a develop and then release

00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:33,450
promotion branch workflow anyway and so

00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:36,250
it may just be that that more stable

00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:38,680
release branch gets renamed to something

00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:43,570
other than master yeah we also discussed

00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:45,280
the renaming what few exclusionary

00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:48,610
language bas-reliefs properties exist

00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:50,140
but also doing so in a way that doesn't

00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:52,980
introduce breaking changes

00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:56,500
unintentionally to those interfaces yes

00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:58,180
yeah it's good that change is good but

00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:59,530
it's really nice if the change doesn't

00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:01,300
doesn't break things yeah and I don't

00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:05,020
think that there are many instances of

00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:06,490
those at all across the after a time pmc

00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:11,110
releases in part because we've already

00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:14,440
been sensitive to not introducing that

00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:16,240
language from the start a list of all

00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:19,510
the different terms that you're looking

00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:23,080
to change i think things around like

00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:24,640
whitelist and blacklist those are the

00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:26,680
most likely candidates that would

00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,330
actually show up in bash releases being

00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:31,330
probably good to just take a pass over

00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:34,440
all of those properties to see if

00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:37,300
there's anything else that stands out

00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:41,080
the word server or service and stuff

00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:45,460
like that oh that's deep that that would

00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:47,800
be fairly I just asked any question I

00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:53,110
just don't know because I don't know

00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:55,360
what is level yeah I don't and I hadn't

00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:58,510
heard that as an objection before I

00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:02,830
think that's to me that's a very neutral

00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:05,260
term but I know we sucked to us right

00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:07,450
like so right exactly that's why I was

00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:09,910
curious what what terms are you going

00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:12,250
after and then well the first one was

00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:14,590
was master as the default branch that

00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:16,039
was that was the original proposal there

00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:18,320
has been we

00:30:16,039 --> 00:30:20,720
generally speaking to to avoid blacklist

00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:24,950
whitelist as terminology that's

00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:26,720
exclusionary and/or I'm assuming when

00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:29,269
you say master you also mean slave so

00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:31,970
yeah I don't know to outside of

00:30:29,269 --> 00:30:35,149
databases which are consumed by Cloud

00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:36,830
Foundry if that's something we control I

00:30:35,149 --> 00:30:39,470
mean remember we we are going to be

00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:41,600
consuming a lot of other projects which

00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:45,019
will have different role naming

00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:46,909
conventions so to the extent I mean we

00:30:45,019 --> 00:30:53,570
wouldn't go I don't think to the extent

00:30:46,909 --> 00:30:57,470
of like changing forking things from a

00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:58,940
from an upstream dead database to change

00:30:57,470 --> 00:31:01,190
that terminology just things under our

00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:03,349
purview that is our responsibility we

00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:07,099
would change so I don't think there's

00:31:03,349 --> 00:31:08,989
their slave terminology anywhere in in

00:31:07,099 --> 00:31:12,409
our code in networking you use a lot

00:31:08,989 --> 00:31:14,149
right we got you got the master node and

00:31:12,409 --> 00:31:15,529
got your slave nodes there's a lot of

00:31:14,149 --> 00:31:17,479
different stuff that people talk about

00:31:15,529 --> 00:31:20,239
that I think we need we need to change

00:31:17,479 --> 00:31:23,690
our terminology yeah I don't

00:31:20,239 --> 00:31:25,519
there it is in CF I can't think of any

00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:28,099
instances of that terminology at least

00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:30,169
within a front i'm pmc project okay we

00:31:28,099 --> 00:31:34,460
do inherit it from databases I know that

00:31:30,169 --> 00:31:39,710
from from some of them but but not in

00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:41,210
code that we're responsible for I want

00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:43,099
to if unless there's any further

00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:46,399
comments on that I wanted to open it up

00:31:43,099 --> 00:31:48,799
for potential free for all items of

00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:52,009
concern things we want to talk about you

00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:55,039
know what you had for breakfast today do

00:31:52,009 --> 00:31:57,739
we want to do social time we have 25

00:31:55,039 --> 00:32:00,019
luxurious minutes to share our thoughts

00:31:57,739 --> 00:32:04,129
on Cloud Foundry so I'm gonna open the

00:32:00,019 --> 00:32:07,039
floor for questions comments etc all

00:32:04,129 --> 00:32:10,159
right Roy I'm actually on the Bosch team

00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:15,440
now so I'm just going to make a brief

00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:19,190
update because I noticed we didn't have

00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:20,749
someone joined last call and just you

00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:23,779
know we are think they're still chugging

00:32:20,749 --> 00:32:29,029
along we'd be making more quality of

00:32:23,779 --> 00:32:29,840
life fixes to Bosch like the logging

00:32:29,029 --> 00:32:30,740
that goes out

00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,169
while you're actually watching your

00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:35,179
deploy is now more for both so you can

00:32:33,169 --> 00:32:40,100
see when think a big drain but think

00:32:35,179 --> 00:32:42,490
that being you know processed we now

00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:48,289
show things like the hypervisor and the

00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:50,240
inspections so and we also just to chime

00:32:48,289 --> 00:32:51,500
in on the last topic we also have the

00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,620
conversation and we're making the

00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:56,510
changes in the Bosch team where we have

00:32:54,620 --> 00:33:00,470
to work on the pipelines to change the

00:32:56,510 --> 00:33:02,690
naming anyone else well I decided chime

00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:06,169
in and so you know the box team is still

00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:08,750
attending and still happy ok cool if you

00:33:06,169 --> 00:33:10,789
want to add any detail into the the

00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:12,409
agenda doc becomes basically the meeting

00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:13,820
minute so if you want to jot anything

00:33:12,409 --> 00:33:15,590
down other than what I what I wrote

00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:18,580
there I'm gonna go retro actively and

00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:23,840
fill in extensions p.m. ste stuff too so

00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:26,260
okay how's Port Alberni it's beautiful

00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:28,850
weather now nice nice and hot and

00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:32,390
looking forward to the weekend doing a

00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:37,669
hike Kevin and I are out in British

00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:41,870
Columbia so yeah not far well far but

00:33:37,669 --> 00:33:44,419
yeah yeah we're enjoying small heat

00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:45,919
waves with intermittent rain so it you

00:33:44,419 --> 00:33:49,429
know everything's nice and green out

00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:50,809
here and thanks for contributing the

00:33:49,429 --> 00:33:55,179
stuff about gosh it's good to know that

00:33:50,809 --> 00:33:55,179
you're on that team for future reference

00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:10,889
anyone we have lots of CF peeps to talk

00:34:06,539 --> 00:34:13,440
CF stuff about if you want parent how's

00:34:10,889 --> 00:34:15,330
the early experimentation with or not so

00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:23,990
early experimentation with CF for Kate's

00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:27,179
going for you yeah so what can I say so

00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:29,550
basically we have a team looking into CF

00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:33,300
for Kate so we have been looking also

00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:35,970
into it YouTube CF recently or for quite

00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:38,730
some time and recently we've decided to

00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:41,419
kind of fit the focus a bit to to look

00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:45,149
in to see if okayed so we have a TV

00:34:41,419 --> 00:34:48,260
looking into it and also starting to I

00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:50,820
would say contribute some first

00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:53,700
enhancements there so things like being

00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:55,980
able to specify an external database was

00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:58,260
something that that the team was was

00:34:55,980 --> 00:35:01,109
actually working on simply because

00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:04,500
that's how we kind of traditionally set

00:35:01,109 --> 00:35:07,320
up our Cloud Foundry system so I would

00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:09,780
say moving along quite quite nicely also

00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:13,050
could you see that like this is regular

00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:20,880
cadence of CF for for case releases are

00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:23,540
coming out yeah going going on so far as

00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:26,520
you mentioned it was really nice to see

00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:29,820
see for Kate's adopt quark secrets as

00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:31,290
the secret management mechanism showing

00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:33,690
that there's good communication

00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:35,910
happening between those teams I know a

00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:37,290
lot of us were concerned I was very

00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:41,609
concerned that we would have two

00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:43,950
parallel and non interacting branches of

00:35:41,609 --> 00:35:47,820
cloud foundry or kubernetes development

00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:51,210
I think we've we've normalized that in a

00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:53,400
way that makes sense of course cube CF

00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:56,250
s-- plan is to adopt the components as

00:35:53,400 --> 00:36:01,170
they as they as they mature in CF for

00:35:56,250 --> 00:36:03,060
Cades I think UAA is next on their list

00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:05,490
of things that they're gonna pull in

00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:08,190
from the the new kubernetes idiomatic

00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:10,530
releases from upstream and then there's

00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:12,030
some more major stuff they will have to

00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:14,670
come in all at once

00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:18,690
I think routing is something that has to

00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:20,910
come in all at once and the move of

00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:23,970
course the kpac eventually will be a

00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:25,020
similar sort of big big shift but

00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:29,840
otherwise it's going to be an

00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:33,620
incremental moving of things

00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:37,640
yes the bill text topic is still so

00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:42,060
poquito are kind of comparing that to

00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:45,150
the existing mas space Cloud Foundry in

00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:47,370
Texas is probably another area on that

00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:47,970
we at least need you to look into in

00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:51,150
more detail

00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:54,300
I think we now have a complete set of

00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:56,670
poquito bill packs is that right rubies

00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:57,810
in now so we've got parody for

00:36:56,670 --> 00:37:00,690
everything maybe it doesn't work exactly

00:36:57,810 --> 00:37:03,060
the same but it's not like I believe

00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:07,350
they're still they don't forget motor

00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:09,150
affairs I think there was one of the

00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:11,400
standard language is missing if I'm not

00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:14,790
mistaken but but like an hour and it's

00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:18,450
more I would say things inside the belt

00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:20,460
back that have slightly changed for for

00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:23,520
some of the stuff so one thing that I

00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:27,330
recall is that I believe there has been

00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:30,870
a change with bringing in JDBC drivers

00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:40,920
and how that works compared to the

00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:43,620
existing thanks so I guess yeah I'm not

00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:47,850
sure but I I guess compatibility and

00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:50,490
like a migration path will probably be a

00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:52,530
topic that like after people getting

00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:55,560
things to run for the very first time

00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:59,460
will also kind of take some time to

00:37:55,560 --> 00:38:01,770
actually figure that I thought about

00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:04,710
something that we could talk about I

00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:08,280
don't know if we've got any one from OSP

00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:11,310
API on the call but I've noticed that

00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:14,730
the cloud providers are deprecating our

00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:15,720
end of life in OSP API brokers for their

00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:19,470
platforms

00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:23,540
most recently I sure as stopped

00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:26,310
supporting their oh s be API broker and

00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:28,560
it's something that is a bit of a

00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:30,210
concern I understand the move for cloud

00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:32,700
I understand the motivation for cloud

00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:34,410
providers to expose their own operator

00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:36,780
force controlling service provisioning

00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:40,500
that seems to be a model it's popular in

00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:42,390
kubernetes to get that unfortunately

00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:43,170
this means that every cloud provider or

00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:45,420
every service

00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:47,700
bihter will expose its own operator in

00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:51,809
its own CR DS and there will be no

00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:53,730
common functions for platforms to plug

00:38:51,809 --> 00:38:56,369
into this is gonna if this trend

00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:58,230
continues which once you have the three

00:38:56,369 --> 00:39:03,990
cloud providers off of us Bobby that's

00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:06,059
that's a significant move it introduces

00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:07,500
more complexity because we previously

00:39:06,059 --> 00:39:09,480
had a single interface that we could

00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:10,950
agree upon when we want to ask for a

00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:13,470
service in Cloud Foundry this is what we

00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:16,470
call we call AHS baffi ozb appease

00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:18,119
broker implementation will call whatever

00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:23,640
it needs to call to provision of service

00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:28,890
and return connection credentials we now

00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:32,250
have to have a broker between the

00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:35,910
operator and an Cloud Foundry Sue's is

00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:38,640
doing some work on this related sort of

00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:43,260
speculative work based on our mini

00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:45,359
broker that's in the community SIG's but

00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:48,990
I think it's something we could keep an

00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:50,760
eye on maybe I'll get to liova cease or

00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:52,140
somebody from Suzhou or maybe convince

00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:54,930
somebody from the house back B team to

00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:56,099
talk about it in the next community

00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:58,910
advisory board because I think it's an

00:39:56,099 --> 00:40:02,549
important thing it's an underrated

00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:06,119
method for connecting platforms to

00:40:02,549 --> 00:40:07,920
services it works very well it just it

00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:09,839
sort of got overshadowed by people

00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:13,079
talking about service mesh and talking

00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:15,059
about operators and they sort of I think

00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:19,470
people are forgetting the the core

00:40:15,059 --> 00:40:22,559
utility of AWS bappy I as a community we

00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:28,640
got to remind remind people how useful

00:40:22,559 --> 00:40:28,640
it is any thoughts on that

00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:32,480
Wayne's awfully quiet

00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:48,300
okay if anyone else has anything speak

00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:51,080
now otherwise I guess actually we could

00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:51,080
