	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:09,780
a call with two presentations we have

00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:13,410
the team from pivotal and Microsoft will

00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:16,470
be presenting the MS sequel Booker and

00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:19,740
then we ask if and the vine from pivotal

00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:24,960
who's gonna be presenting CF Depp very

00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:29,039
exciting and then during the extensions

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:32,369
rundown we have Nicolai Marshall messy

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,920
beef who already presented the multi

00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:37,050
apps now for multi apps they had a weird

00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:40,500
name to it but now it's really cool

00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:45,149
multi absolute he kind of mentioned some

00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:48,420
details about it since he just sent your

00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:49,710
proposal yesterday so with that let's

00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,140
get started with Shauna

00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:54,300
I know she's on the phone so maybe so

00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:57,059
Anna you can give us an update on cff

00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:02,000
and kind of like where we're going

00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:05,309
especially with CF summit coming soon

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,100
yeah and I did join on my phone can you

00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:12,420
guys hear me yeah we can hear you go for

00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:14,640
it okay so as we speak and for as Max is

00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:17,549
out there partying and holidaying I'm

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,100
here at the pink conference IBM think

00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:23,930
conference here so it's ironic that I'm

00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,930
here as an IBM event and you're not back

00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:31,350
for from a foundation perspective I

00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:33,060
think summit is definitely the focus the

00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:36,079
major focus for pretty much from all of

00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:39,930
us here at the foundation we have about

00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:42,150
775 registrations so far slightly

00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:43,920
trailing by the numbers that we can

00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:46,140
compare to the last year's registration

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,170
but it is definitely picking up and we

00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:52,290
are kind of getting closer to being at

00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:53,880
the same trajectory as we were last year

00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:57,000
in terms of registration membership that

00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,969
is good the agenda is pretty much fine

00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,790
less with probably one or two

00:01:58,969 --> 00:02:06,110
last-minute changes but the final agenda

00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:10,129
I think should be closed and buttoned up

00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:13,050
barring any other changes we have

00:02:10,129 --> 00:02:13,920
several things at Summit we have an

00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,410
unconference

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,500
on Tuesday evening the day before day

00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:23,250
zero so de negative one again so we have

00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:25,890
an unconference hosted by a few folks in

00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:29,040
the community if you're interested in

00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:30,959
more information or even helping out due

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:35,310
to each other either Dave Nielsen or

00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:37,650
Steve Greenberg we have several events

00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:39,480
on day zero as well numbers are picking

00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:42,030
up pretty well even for that I think the

00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:44,040
user day and hackathon are receiving

00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:45,870
pretty good traction at the moment at

00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,570
least as far as I can see from the

00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:52,230
numbers we have we a lot of folks

00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:55,190
registered for hacksaw but then we had

00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:59,550
at least anticipated so that is a great

00:02:55,190 --> 00:03:01,620
great formation that it's a it's a great

00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:05,430
initiative the Chris is pretty excited

00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:08,430
about it we also have a Cloud Foundry

00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:10,680
day a cube cond as a day zero activity

00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:13,709
at cube con on May first we close the

00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:16,019
call for papers last week on Friday we

00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:18,470
got again I think three or four times

00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:21,269
more submissions than we had expected

00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:23,940
that is also a great thing

00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:26,220
we will probably consider doing the

00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:30,060
similar Cloud Foundry day at other cube

00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:32,519
cons as well in Shanghai and in Seattle

00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:34,829
later this year information and even the

00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:36,360
final decisions have not been made for

00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:38,280
that one yet we are still waiting for

00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,530
information from the CN CF and the

00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:43,530
broader Ellis team from the for those

00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:47,280
days but 508 Copenhagen is definitely

00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:48,840
coming along pretty well if you have any

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,079
questions about any of these events

00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:54,299
please do let me know and regarding the

00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:57,269
proposals and the blog posts that are

00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:59,160
coming up I think it's all the community

00:03:57,269 --> 00:04:01,820
work anyway so there's nothing for me to

00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,820
report there

00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:06,079
excellent I think Thank You Shauna I

00:04:04,849 --> 00:04:09,709
think there's one more thing which is

00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:11,989
that people if you in this call or you

00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:15,890
contribute to cough laundry you get a

00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:19,850
pass to come to summit that's been

00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:21,949
usually the case and I believe we have

00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:24,770
one again this year

00:04:21,949 --> 00:04:27,680
I know tip usually sends it out Swarna

00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:30,380
you might have done it this year and of

00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:34,550
course if anybody has not registered and

00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:40,130
you need to pass ping SWANA myself or if

00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:42,380
you go back in I think the CA B chat

00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:43,880
spat channel you probably see it there I

00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:46,789
don't remember exactly what it is but

00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:50,810
there is a code that you can use yeah

00:04:46,789 --> 00:04:53,030
yeah there is that the mailing list also

00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:55,430
posted on slack but if you if anyone of

00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:59,479
you need to drop me and out I will send

00:04:55,430 --> 00:05:02,389
out the code again I will also sit here

00:04:59,479 --> 00:05:03,979
in the flack for the caption yeah thank

00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:06,500
you thank you one more thing

00:05:03,979 --> 00:05:11,120
Indian did you mention about the

00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:13,340
hackathon that we have also okay because

00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:17,210
that that's an option when you register

00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:19,570
but I guess the thing to tell people is

00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:22,340
that if you did not check the hackathon

00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:24,800
option and you still want to participate

00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:26,660
you have a team and so on just come the

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,639
first day claims would come the first

00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:31,460
day and take part of it right so

00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:38,449
definitely that's something that that's

00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:40,010
going on yeah No thank you for reminding

00:05:38,449 --> 00:05:42,050
about that you can always go back to

00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:44,030
your registration and edit it or you can

00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:48,260
even just walk in and sign up on the day

00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:51,199
of hackathons we also added one other

00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:55,880
thing as part of the summit plan so we

00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:59,360
are we built up an IFV day on on day

00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:01,159
zero for all of our this remembers to

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,070
bring their ecosystem partners like

00:06:01,159 --> 00:06:06,080
there is be partners for a quick intro

00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:07,699
in the beginning like they will open

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,520
with a quick view presentation from the

00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:13,250
numbers and then we will kind of open it

00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:15,590
up for one-on-one signups for engineers

00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:18,470
at the IFA partners to

00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:20,240
schedule some time with engineers from

00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:21,680
these different projects we have listed

00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,660
all the information the eye every day so

00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,540
if you go back to your registration you

00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:27,620
should be able to add it onto your

00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:29,240
registration as well but if you're not

00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:32,270
sure how to do this just drop me a note

00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:34,460
I will get you all set up either very

00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:37,850
interested in bringing your IC partner

00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:40,250
or if you would like to sign up for that

00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:42,170
and just schedule some time I mean if

00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:44,840
you are at an IT partner and if you

00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:47,390
would like to sign up for a time slot

00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:49,490
with one of these engineers on these

00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:51,860
projects so drop me a note I will again

00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:54,410
add this information as well into the

00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:56,720
meeting notes or in the cap channel here

00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:59,920
but yeah do drop me a note if you're

00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,920
interested about that as well

00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:06,290
excellent thank you Swarna so no excuses

00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:10,610
everybody you have many ways to attend

00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:12,380
and to join will see you in Boston okay

00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:16,280
so the next thing unless there any

00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:20,660
questions is to kind of go very quickly

00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:23,300
over any highlights on the PMC's so we

00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:24,949
usually start with the runtime chem see

00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:27,710
I don't see Yui

00:07:24,949 --> 00:07:30,410
online but I'm not at pivotal this time

00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:34,700
so I don't know if she may be join some

00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:37,690
other ways I believe he has a jury duty

00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:40,100
conflict so she is not joining today

00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:42,710
Eric can can give us an update I guess

00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:45,139
thank you I can mention a few things I

00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:47,450
know that the Cappy team has been doing

00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:49,340
a lot of exploration around how they'd

00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:52,100
like to better support zero downtime

00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:53,210
deploys natively in their API and I

00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,740
think they just finished up the spike

00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:58,340
and they're getting ready to incept on

00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:59,960
that so that's very exciting and the

00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:02,180
routing team has been doing a lot of

00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:05,240
work with their experiments around

00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:07,820
integrating envoy and sto as the

00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:09,110
next-generation routing tier in code

00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,810
foundry and I think they just hit a

00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:14,030
milestone around having a steel thread

00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:15,919
for each D to be traffic going through

00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:19,190
an envoy and routing to application

00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:23,180
instances so also great signs of

00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:25,610
progress there and speaking of envoy

00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:30,139
continued networking is about to start

00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:32,089
some work around using the envoys that

00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:34,099
can now run inside application instance

00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:36,469
containers to route traffic on the

00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:40,580
container network as well so as the

00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:42,909
start of using those to apply various

00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:46,010
kinds of micro service policy patterns

00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:52,820
from app instances to each other maybe

00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:53,420
to external services sweet thank you

00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:57,740
Eric

00:08:53,420 --> 00:09:02,300
I know speaking of container the routing

00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:04,610
team sort of adopting issue we had some

00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:06,830
question about how the transition will

00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:10,550
happen and so on and and I think Shannon

00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:12,290
added some text on the proposal I'd

00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:14,030
recommend people to take a look at it

00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:15,950
I'm super excited

00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:17,420
this I think I think it's a great

00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:20,990
direction but of course you know it's

00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:23,810
gonna be a nice challenge but it's a

00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:25,970
good stuff if you haven't if you haven't

00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:28,730
spent some time looking at what Shannon

00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:32,390
is proposing proposing I would say now

00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:39,440
is the time to do it any questions

00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:41,810
anybody has for Eric or comments no all

00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,910
right thank you Eric I saw that

00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:48,490
Dimitri's here maybe he can give us an

00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:54,680
update on what's going on in Bosch DK

00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:57,260
you meant yo mute hey we we don't really

00:09:54,680 --> 00:10:01,910
have anything new going on the existing

00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:04,700
sets of tracks of work are pretty large

00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:06,320
so they're continuing to happen probably

00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:09,680
the most things I saw is the hot-swap

00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,920
which is really arranging a few

00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:15,620
different things inside the director

00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:20,720
recently shipped some new release that

00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:23,720
introduces team scoped configs so a team

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:26,090
can specify a cloud config or portions

00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:31,400
of cloud config that there aren't going

00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:33,950
to get picked up by another teams and we

00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:37,460
also shipped some stem cells these stem

00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:40,310
cells includes some hardening as usual

00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:42,410
to harden some of permissions on the

00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:50,330
file system for jobs and thank you so

00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:52,040
much yeah that's a spiritual I got cool

00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:59,840
Thank You GK so one thing I'll mention

00:10:52,040 --> 00:11:01,250
is at CFD for index we hosted a set of

00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:03,980
speakers and one of the speaker's was

00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:07,190
Danny from the Bosch teams he's the

00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:11,270
anchor and he gave a really nice talk

00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:12,890
that gives strategies on how to use

00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:15,140
Bosch especially if you have multiple

00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:18,170
teams and some of the new features I

00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:21,670
guess we relatively new features that

00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:26,210
help make that easier and to help out

00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:27,769
Dimitri and I would a blog post on on

00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:29,600
Danny's talk

00:11:27,769 --> 00:11:32,899
and there's also reference to Danny

00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:35,839
stock the blog post is scheduled to be

00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:38,779
published but what I'm going to do is I

00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:42,619
have a preview of it so what I'll do is

00:11:38,779 --> 00:11:44,660
up on the cap stock channel I'll post it

00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:46,999
there so that way people can can take a

00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:48,110
look especially people that are

00:11:46,999 --> 00:11:50,959
interested in Bosch I think you

00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:52,730
definitely want to look at some of the

00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:54,679
new features or at least if you if you

00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:57,049
didn't spend time looking at those you

00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:58,790
you wanna take a look at them so I'll

00:11:57,049 --> 00:12:03,019
post it because it kind of gives a

00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:06,649
summary of them okay I don't know if

00:12:03,019 --> 00:12:11,660
anybody has a question for TK or just

00:12:06,649 --> 00:12:15,529
generally about Bosch nope all right

00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:17,720
cool all right so now it's extensions so

00:12:15,529 --> 00:12:21,799
for extensions what I'll do is I'm gonna

00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:23,689
give some time to the SCP team to

00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:26,119
discuss their multi apps because it's

00:12:23,689 --> 00:12:28,749
one of the new proposal that just came

00:12:26,119 --> 00:12:32,209
out and then also you'll hear from

00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:35,540
Stephen Devine who is submitting the CF

00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:38,749
dev proposal there's a few more things

00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:41,929
happening as you know we have a site

00:12:38,749 --> 00:12:46,069
where you can see the latest proposed

00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:49,999
projects as well as the latest status so

00:12:46,069 --> 00:12:52,009
I won't spend too much time you know

00:12:49,999 --> 00:12:53,209
discussing them I would tell you just go

00:12:52,009 --> 00:12:55,129
there and then you can see the summer

00:12:53,209 --> 00:12:57,199
and just like every PMC also sort of

00:12:55,129 --> 00:13:00,889
have that the run time as something

00:12:57,199 --> 00:13:03,920
similar so with that let me see if if

00:13:00,889 --> 00:13:06,649
Levi wants to give us kind of like a

00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:09,819
quick overview he submitted his proposal

00:13:06,649 --> 00:13:13,189
I think yesterday he gave a talk on this

00:13:09,819 --> 00:13:15,919
in the cap for I think to cap calls ago

00:13:13,189 --> 00:13:17,779
so you know after you hear him if you

00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:19,879
wanna see the cap the cap presentation

00:13:17,779 --> 00:13:22,910
that he did you can go and fetch that

00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:25,730
out so nicholai you wanna kind of give

00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:29,629
us an overview of your multi app sure

00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:34,759
sure do human yes we can hear okay great

00:13:29,629 --> 00:13:40,309
so yeah yesterday I make made public our

00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:41,660
proposal from SVP for proposing this new

00:13:40,309 --> 00:13:43,249
her live

00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:45,350
application lifecycle management

00:13:43,249 --> 00:13:50,149
capabilities that we right now are

00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:53,660
running ASAP so we are currently a team

00:13:50,149 --> 00:13:57,740
of nine people actually develop

00:13:53,660 --> 00:14:00,170
pink.this service which actually what

00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:04,459
provides it provides you the quality of

00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:07,699
model where you can describe a composite

00:14:04,459 --> 00:14:11,779
distributed higher level I mean

00:14:07,699 --> 00:14:13,970
application containing several possibly

00:14:11,779 --> 00:14:16,220
up services and other technical

00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:20,360
artifacts so we provide this high level

00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:23,600
entity in CF to manage solutions

00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:26,089
applications or higher level services so

00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,149
first of all we provide the model then

00:14:26,089 --> 00:14:31,069
we provide additional tooling for

00:14:28,149 --> 00:14:34,999
initial deployment updates even between

00:14:31,069 --> 00:14:38,769
updates on deployments et cetera of such

00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:40,999
kind of apps and we provide additional

00:14:38,769 --> 00:14:44,509
mechanisms how you can declare

00:14:40,999 --> 00:14:47,420
configuration variables distinguish

00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:49,910
between different deployments of your

00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:52,509
app etc but all of this is in the

00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:57,379
proposal so the important stuff is that

00:14:52,509 --> 00:15:00,079
we already a good team here at SVP

00:14:57,379 --> 00:15:02,959
working conduct for three years right

00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:08,480
now there are more than a two thousands

00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:11,179
of apps on our cloud platform running

00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:14,209
such kind of apps so we are developing

00:15:11,179 --> 00:15:16,850
it operating it etc and right now would

00:15:14,209 --> 00:15:21,279
like to see whether the community sees

00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:23,980
it at something good to have

00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:27,439
standardized in the industry of come

00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:30,350
foundation so to say so as I said the

00:15:27,439 --> 00:15:33,499
proposal is public there are several

00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:35,749
videos you can check from the cup Co I

00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:39,259
also gave a presentation on the CF

00:15:35,749 --> 00:15:43,399
summit in uh in in Basel you can check

00:15:39,259 --> 00:15:45,860
this more detailed session there so yeah

00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:48,559
I'll be happy to receive any feedback

00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:50,980
and move the project forward in the

00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:50,980
community

00:15:52,680 --> 00:16:00,340
thank you all right thank you Nicola I

00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:02,830
think you know for people if you didn't

00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:06,550
get a chance to look at this I would say

00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:08,680
again another thing to look at which you

00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:10,930
know has interesting consequences

00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:13,600
because it's solving a real problem and

00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:17,260
I know that the Cappy team that

00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:19,480
responded on this you know there's

00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:21,700
there's a lot to be done but at least

00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:24,390
the SVP team is proposing something

00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:27,880
that's there it's working so I would say

00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:31,660
maybe it's worth you know looking at it

00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:40,530
giving some feedback and let's see what

00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:43,600
goes any questions somebody who says no

00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:46,090
all right so go to the C of their

00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:49,240
mailing this and you'll see it all right

00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:50,380
so for extensions the only other thing I

00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:53,590
guess a couple more thing I want to

00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:56,110
mention is that you know the CFC are

00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:58,600
sort of container runtime used to be

00:16:56,110 --> 00:17:01,870
called kugel you're making a lot of

00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:05,290
progress in moving very very fast so if

00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:07,839
you go to the to the drum beat you'll

00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:11,410
see some of the updates that George is

00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:14,740
putting and it seemed UK and then I also

00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:16,959
know that the auto scaling team has had

00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:19,689
a major milestone recently studios in

00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:22,030
his team so if you're interested on all

00:17:19,689 --> 00:17:23,350
the scaling definitely take a look at

00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:25,780
this I'm going to try to see if I can

00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:27,760
convince them to maybe perhaps give a

00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:31,600
demo at one of those kept calls upcoming

00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:33,100
so you know pay attention grab so one

00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,780
last thing I want to mention before we

00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,550
go to the two presentations and we just

00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:41,370
finish with those is that the Clapp call

00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:44,950
for April happens to be exactly during

00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:50,320
summit so what that means is we'll do it

00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:55,000
live and if you remember when we did it

00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:59,440
live last time it was a lot of fun dr.

00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:03,220
Nick was there Jules was there and I was

00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,240
there and it was was a blast so I would

00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:07,150
say if you if you

00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:09,850
gonna come to summit you know make make

00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:12,670
a point to attend this else and exact

00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:15,760
room SWANA is trying to get new room so

00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:18,880
that way you can you can be there with

00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:22,420
us and we can discuss it we tend to be a

00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:26,230
lot more open I take them a call like

00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:28,150
this and Nick is there too so I would

00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:30,730
say make sure you attend this if you can

00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:32,679
alright so so with that unless there are

00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:36,280
any questions we're gonna go to the two

00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:38,770
presentations I think we'll have about

00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:40,750
20 minutes for each if you need to go

00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:42,790
over a little bit that's fine but 20

00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:45,280
minutes try to keep it at that so first

00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:48,309
is that team it's a combination between

00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:50,500
pivotal and Microsoft Zack will

00:18:48,309 --> 00:18:55,090
introduce and then the team will present

00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:58,000
the MS sequel worker so exactly maybe

00:18:55,090 --> 00:19:03,190
you can mention who's gonna talk but

00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:04,570
sure hey folks so we're you know broadly

00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:06,820
in the Cloud Foundry community we're

00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:10,120
getting more and more developers who are

00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:12,040
coming from the Microsoft ecosystem the

00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:14,920
by and large the biggest thing they

00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:17,320
asked for is some sort of a sequel

00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:20,250
server service broker or some other

00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:22,390
solution for sequel server database and

00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:25,330
there there's a broker that was out

00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:26,800
there that was submitted by some some

00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:30,400
folks who used to be members of the

00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:33,790
foundation but it hasn't had any commits

00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:35,650
in several years to two years two and a

00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:37,120
half years so we wanted to have

00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:39,460
something that we could put out there

00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:43,300
that that's actively maintained and that

00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:46,360
we could wholeheartedly recommend and so

00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:49,030
pivotal some folks at pivotal put

00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:50,620
together a new broker for sequel server

00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:53,380
and to be clear this is for an

00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:54,670
on-premise Microsoft sequel server that

00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:56,710
already exists somewhere in the

00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:58,390
enterprise this is not a Bosh deploy at

00:19:56,710 --> 00:20:01,000
Microsoft sequel server or anything like

00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:07,390
that it's just a broker that will carve

00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:10,900
out no databases users etc so Mike Lloyd

00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:14,559
from our pivotal Microsoft alliances

00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:16,330
team is here and he's he's going to

00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:18,100
present it one other thing that I should

00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:21,130
mention before we go is that

00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:22,780
we we have little built this broker

00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:24,580
and we've been working closely with

00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:26,679
Microsoft and Microsoft has agreed that

00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:29,039
they're going to be participate in the

00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:32,559
maintenance of it going forward and

00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:34,900
eventually own it completely so our goal

00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:38,559
is to get it into the into the incubator

00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:40,840
so that you know it can be out there and

00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:42,850
this can maybe replace the broker that's

00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:44,260
out there to be the official sort of

00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:44,860
sequel server broker endorsed by the

00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:47,470
community

00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:52,210
all right well all that said take it

00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:54,190
away Mike awesome thanks Zach yeah I

00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:56,220
mean Zach touch on the I'd say probably

00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:58,990
the biggest points you know we'd like to

00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:01,330
provide a newer more recent broker

00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:03,549
that's designed for full-blown single

00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:07,330
server instances some of the things that

00:21:03,549 --> 00:21:08,740
we wanted to focus on or multi-tenant

00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:11,679
schemas and user creation right so

00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:14,049
multiple apps can use the same signal so

00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:17,169
for instance with differing databases we

00:21:14,049 --> 00:21:18,490
wanted to make sure that credentials

00:21:17,169 --> 00:21:20,500
could be shared with other applications

00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:22,570
things like that some of the stuff that

00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:24,909
we wanted to stay away with or

00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:27,490
provisioning database engines rights of

00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:31,890
the serviceworker kz4 fusion sorry buddy

00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:31,890
do you want to share your screen or yeah

00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:41,350
there we go

00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:45,250
can you guys yes yeah awesome

00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:49,600
so originally was it was by Jerry Gordon

00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:51,820
he and Malika I also at the little wrote

00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:54,490
the initial the initial implementation

00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:58,270
and then Microsoft just committed three

00:21:54,490 --> 00:22:02,500
maintainer x' bin Ranji and Thomas as

00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:04,720
maintainer moving forward so the nice

00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:06,100
part about this is we've our focus has

00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,510
been on making sure this is an actively

00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:11,200
maintaining project because the previous

00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:12,850
project by the is no one that maintained

00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,630
a lot of customers felt that sequel

00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:18,100
server wasn't getting an appropriate

00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:20,620
kind of priority within the community so

00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:22,360
we wanted to make sure that we focus

00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:24,340
very heavily on the fact that this is

00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:25,750
not only currently maintained but it

00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:27,880
will be maintained in the future and we

00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:31,020
have that commitment from Microsoft that

00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:31,020
they will maintain it

00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:37,300
so some of the ante goals that we have

00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:39,520
for this project are you know we don't

00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:41,500
want to dynamically provisioned sequel

00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:44,320
server instances great we can provision

00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:46,110
databases and users for those databases

00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,400
but we don't want to be trying to manage

00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:51,940
single server deployments that's it's a

00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:53,850
little out of scope for this you know we

00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:56,800
also don't want to make sure that we

00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:58,690
redeploy or heal existing employments if

00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:01,450
something goes bad just leave it create

00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:04,570
a new one maybe for version two but not

00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:06,370
for right now the reason we want to

00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:09,040
submit this to the Cloud Foundry

00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:10,630
community as a whole is that this has

00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:13,090
been a collaboration between both

00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:15,820
Microsoft and pivotal and we felt that

00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:18,430
it was gain Community Trust by having it

00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:21,190
be open sourced and owned by the

00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:26,560
foundation has a lot of legitimacy to

00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:30,880
the broker as a whole the implementation

00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:34,840
was written in spring boot currently it

00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,380
does not support pivotal Cloud Foundry

00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,820
toe

00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:38,560
however Garrett Gordon pushed a new

00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:41,560
branch this morning which adds new

00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:43,690
features right now there is a dependency

00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:46,090
on Redis however that will be going away

00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:48,040
in the next couple days so it can be a

00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:51,190
fully independent service worker let's

00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:54,130
no other dependencies just to interject

00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:57,070
real quick I think you met spring boot

00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:58,390
2.0 so now he's in his grants pretty

00:23:57,070 --> 00:24:03,040
good yes

00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:06,040
sorry spring bootie this is circa last

00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:07,720
question the removing of Rhenish that

00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,260
comes from that simple service broker

00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:11,520
Maya

00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:14,410
you gotta rewrite the whole broker or

00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:18,850
that is a question for Jared who

00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:21,070
unfortunately isn't on the call I asked

00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:22,990
cuz I've noticed that Redis thing across

00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:25,360
a range of those spring boot broke

00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:26,770
exhaust this one right my understanding

00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,200
is that it's a feature of spring boot

00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:31,270
2.0 that doesn't require that but I

00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:34,930
can't speak definitively about it sorry

00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:36,310
cool whenever you solve that's

00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:39,700
interesting to share that because that

00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:40,490
was a yeah I can I can definitely pass

00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:45,770
that feedback

00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:48,920
and we'll publicize the workflow for the

00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:52,130
service broker is very standard create

00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:54,380
the service Berger application and then

00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:56,030
you can bind it to an application you

00:24:54,380 --> 00:25:02,030
can unbind it you can delete the service

00:24:56,030 --> 00:25:03,830
that you've created Microsoft as far as

00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:06,340
future work goes Microsoft will very

00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:09,530
likely have their own roadmap for this

00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:13,040
pivotal incubated it with collaboration

00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:14,540
from Microsoft but the plan far for us

00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:16,700
at the little is not to maintain this

00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:22,090
it's for Microsoft in the greater

00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:24,410
community the repository under this

00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:27,320
proposal story does come with a client

00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:28,190
example that works if you wanted to play

00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,290
it you can go ahead and do it

00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:32,570
unfortunately I didn't get a chance to

00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:36,260
deploy it ahead of fun I just didn't

00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:37,880
have time otherwise it'd be a demo but

00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:40,370
you can find the client example here as

00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:47,630
well as instructions on how to test the

00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:49,820
broker for yourself I want to add

00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:52,150
something there there are some samples

00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:55,070
as well that that leveraged the broker

00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:57,020
in the steel-toe project so you may have

00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:59,840
heard of a steel to open-source project

00:25:57,020 --> 00:26:02,240
it's basically if the dotnet SDK for

00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:06,440
Cloud Foundry and includes access to all

00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:10,070
those bring cloud services tools from

00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:11,809
dotnet clients there's a connector for

00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:13,790
it effectively the same thing as a

00:26:11,809 --> 00:26:16,790
spring boot connector but for a dead app

00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:18,920
that leverages this sequel server broker

00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:25,040
and and there are samples for that out

00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:28,160
in steel-toe io as well one more thing

00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:30,050
is I think Brett from cloud gov was

00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,700
asking a question on the chat about

00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:34,480
whether or not credentials get

00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:34,480
regenerated

00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:41,230
my understanding is currently

00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:43,630
credentials are not generated for each

00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:45,700
body what that is a question for Jared

00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:47,380
and I can unfortunately yeah yeah

00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:48,940
they're on that I thought that they are

00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:51,940
so when you bind it to an app that you

00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:53,830
get new they very well might be but I

00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:55,900
can't speak different it available okay

00:26:53,830 --> 00:27:00,429
I guess I'm probably stuff is key right

00:26:55,900 --> 00:27:03,220
like you you get when you get when you

00:27:00,429 --> 00:27:08,169
create a key it will create a credential

00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:10,840
for you I believe so max so every

00:27:08,169 --> 00:27:12,580
database that you get is your own user

00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,450
for that database right at your own user

00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:19,660
ID and password

00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:23,500
I see and then on top of that we

00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:26,260
actually host the servers burger on the

00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:28,809
pivotal ecosystem network as you can see

00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:31,299
here so we have a couple customers that

00:27:28,809 --> 00:27:32,290
have given this a test run they really

00:27:31,299 --> 00:27:34,780
love it they've had some good feedback

00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:36,850
for us and stuff like that so it's

00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:39,250
definitely been tested out in the wild

00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:40,450
and we have a customer that is hoping to

00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:48,190
go into production with this at some

00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:49,900
point soon yeah I think Brett made

00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:51,010
another comment on the chat you may want

00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:52,809
to check it take a look at it he's

00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:53,250
giving you that advice so that's a good

00:27:52,809 --> 00:27:56,460
thing

00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:56,460
inside mic

00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:07,410
so you gonna give us a demo of it or are

00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:09,630
you to answer Brett's question I don't

00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:11,940
know about the new credentials as far as

00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:13,350
marketing to new instances I just wants

00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:16,220
me unfortunately questions for Jared

00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:18,360
I'm just feeling impotent be here I

00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:20,250
would I did want to give a demo

00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:21,809
unfortunately I don't have a single

00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:23,460
server instance stood up I couldn't get

00:28:21,809 --> 00:28:29,970
one set up in time because I was

00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:31,860
travelling yesterday sorry okay I guess

00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:33,929
this is it or do you have more that

00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:37,140
you're gonna show us this is it

00:28:33,929 --> 00:28:38,480
unless Ock has further comments just

00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:42,440
wondering if there any other questions

00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,440
around the broker that we can answer

00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:54,880
nope alright well I'll take this these

00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:59,530
two seconds to plug that we've got where

00:28:54,880 --> 00:29:01,210
I yell and also nothing happens from

00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:03,010
your understanding of the broker you

00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:06,100
know as you went through the the Craig

00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:08,740
divined etc do you see any limitations

00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:10,810
on that that features or functions or

00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:16,420
expectations of sequel server users

00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:18,400
won't be supportable I'm I'm not sure

00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:20,080
what you're asking what the question dr.

00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:22,000
Nate can you ask a different light if

00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:25,090
I'm a knowledgeable sequel server user

00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,860
and I come to Cloud Foundry and and you

00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:29,050
know I start to try to bring sequel

00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:31,750
server into my life is there going to be

00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:34,690
a feature or a behavior that I want BR

00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:37,990
to ever achieve because there was

00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:42,820
fictions around the open serviceworker

00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:46,990
API sequence there's nothing that we

00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:50,170
know logically me as a you know at least

00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:52,960
former extensive sequel server user it

00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:56,320
behaves as I would expect and gives me

00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:58,390
what I think I need but obviously the

00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:01,540
ultimate test for that is to get a lot

00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:03,940
of people to use it and hopefully a lot

00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:07,570
of people contributing to it so the user

00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:09,010
model of Jesus being created shamed

00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:12,100
within a space I guess we now have

00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:13,560
shared service instances that solves

00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:15,550
that problem if they didn't share it

00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:19,120
goes not a smart idea

00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:21,670
yeah any I don't know the ways in which

00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:24,220
people have grown used to claim the

00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:25,600
sequel server and then a big shaped the

00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:31,420
yeah yeah big shared sequel server

00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:35,080
cluster this was this broker does what

00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:37,540
you would expect to get from DBA right

00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:39,400
if you say hey hold like a database this

00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:42,310
gives you a database and it gives you a

00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:44,260
dedicated user for that database however

00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:46,510
their you know their limitations Radio

00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:47,800
Active Directory authentication if

00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:49,690
you're doing any type of sequel

00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:52,300
clustering it doesn't expose any of

00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:53,620
those features the focus on this at

00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,620
least at this point was very much kind

00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:56,000
of anomie

00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:59,000
of getting in the hands of customers

00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,220
getting it tested and then as Microsoft

00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,450
takes over the long-term maintenance of

00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:04,490
this they'll probably have a roadmap

00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:16,460
that could potentially include features

00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:19,190
like this thank you okay cool and I

00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:22,370
guess I think Zac mentioned this but

00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:24,500
I'll stress it that I guess the team

00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:28,090
from Microsoft is also involved and will

00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:32,570
be pretty much maintaining this good so

00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:38,059
if we they're the experts so feel free

00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:40,429
to talk to them okay can I say one more

00:31:38,059 --> 00:31:42,590
thing before we yeah sure topic max I

00:31:40,429 --> 00:31:44,330
just wanted to mention that at Summit

00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:47,350
this is the first time we've got a cloud

00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:50,240
native net track full track of talks

00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:52,100
dedicated to to.net programming so if

00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:54,140
you're if you're somebody who who likes

00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:56,960
that world come join us

00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:58,520
we've got Scott hunter he is the head of

00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:01,040
dotnet engineering at Microsoft he's

00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:04,040
going to be headlining on there's also a

00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:07,150
one-day training class that that will be

00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:10,130
provided by pivotal plus Kevin Huffman

00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:12,890
at the beginning of Cloud Foundry summit

00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:14,150
and then stay tuned for during the

00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:16,280
keynotes we've got a couple different

00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:17,840
demos that will be leveraging net on

00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:19,790
cloud foundry ins in different ways

00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:22,730
including the steel-toe project so some

00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:26,059
very cool stuff in that space yeah

00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:28,880
excellent I mean getting the old dotnet

00:32:26,059 --> 00:32:32,780
world into cloud foundry is brilliant

00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:36,559
thank you for that okay so I guess next

00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:39,080
we have another engineer from pivot also

00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:41,900
stiffened Devine you you guys seen him

00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:45,020
before he gave us an overview of his

00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:47,440
brilliant yet local too and now he's

00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:50,150
back with even more and I know Steven

00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:53,390
had one of the best talk that we've had

00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:55,040
in the cab core so here's a challenge to

00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:59,600
top himself so let's see what you can do

00:32:55,040 --> 00:33:04,059
see this but you got 30 minutes 25 sorry

00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:04,059
but sounds good to me

00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:08,850
yes we can hear you and we can see you

00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:10,410
yeah great

00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:13,170
so before I start I want to introduce

00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:17,340
Scott Cecil who's joining me as Co p.m.

00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:28,680
for CF eV and PC a better than this

00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:29,220
effort so let me share my screen all

00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:34,460
right

00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:36,480
I think everybody can see that cool so

00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:39,210
first I want to talk for a second about

00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:41,520
PCF des and so what that project was if

00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:44,190
you're not familiar with it so PCF Deb

00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:48,270
was a local or is a local Cloud Foundry

00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:51,180
experience that you know worked on top

00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:52,740
of VirtualBox it didn't have a community

00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:54,300
version it was available through pit net

00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:57,540
which had a barrier to entry that was a

00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:59,640
little higher than we like and didn't

00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:01,710
have Bosh that was a big limitation to

00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:05,130
and so a little while ago we decided

00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:07,290
that we wanted to sort reimplemented of

00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:09,030
a little differently and also offer a

00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:13,500
community version of it that would be a

00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:15,300
foundation project and so that is yet

00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:17,100
done so PC of Deb isn't going to go away

00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:19,350
it's just gonna be an extension on top

00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:20,850
of CFN that lets you deploy PCF the sort

00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:22,860
of pivotal woman except really won't be

00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:24,690
related to the Cloud Foundry project you

00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:30,420
know we'll keep separation between the

00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:32,070
two so CF dev is a very different

00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:33,750
experience from PCF Dev although the

00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:36,290
user experience though if you're just

00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:41,520
using Cloud Foundry is very similar so

00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:44,100
CF dev is another CF CLI plugin but

00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:45,840
unlike these yep dev it works on native

00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:50,550
hypervisors so you don't need VirtualBox

00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:52,500
to use it it has a full box director and

00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:53,940
so you can deploy any box release

00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:55,740
anything that'll successfully deployed a

00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:59,040
box flight should deploy just as easily

00:34:55,740 --> 00:35:01,440
to see of dev but CF dub when you start

00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:03,410
it comes with full CF pre deployed and

00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:06,630
starts in about the same amount of time

00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:09,750
when I say native hypervisor I mean like

00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:11,430
a hyper kit on Mac using the native

00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:15,750
hypervisor framework or hyper-v on

00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:16,860
windows were KVM on Linux so you don't

00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:19,290
need anything but stuff that the

00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:21,010
operating system is providing and so we

00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:25,420
already have a release

00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:27,520
oh the first alpha release the this is

00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:28,690
only for Mac right now we're working on

00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:31,780
a Windows version that'll work on

00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:33,760
hyper-v but if you install this you

00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:37,990
don't need VirtualBox or anything else

00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:39,820
besides a Mac OS C or greater we do have

00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:41,740
a bug in this initial alpha release that

00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:43,690
makes it not work if you haven't ever

00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:45,960
had docker for Mac installed but you can

00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:49,060
have it uninstalled it's very strange

00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:51,280
so if you run into that you might need

00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:52,630
to install docker from X but the next

00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,369
release won't have that limitation it's

00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:56,830
just the configuration change we didn't

00:35:54,369 --> 00:35:59,410
notice the augur from X meaning that

00:35:56,830 --> 00:36:00,790
this elderlies have CF eV and the sort

00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:03,220
of the new implementation we're using is

00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:06,160
users a lot of similar technology that's

00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:09,400
- a doctor from X so it's using legs kit

00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:11,590
with the VPN kit to do all this fancy

00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:13,600
networking and stuff so we get we get

00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:15,640
benefits like if you have a corporate

00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:19,240
proxy you don't have to get the proxy in

00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:20,619
bars and everywhere in the VM just

00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:22,840
magically figures out how to write

00:36:20,619 --> 00:36:31,359
everything through your proxy it's

00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:33,730
pretty fancy stuff so yeah so the next

00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:35,650
thing is we have this proposal we

00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:38,350
submitted this yet confused -

00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:42,760
unfortunately similarly games so you

00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:45,220
have to have mailing list that is sort

00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:46,570
of proposing incubation for CF dub I

00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:47,980
encourage you to check it out people

00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:51,400
have been asking a lot of good questions

00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:53,260
but what this is what PCF dev was you

00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:55,420
know what our motivations are and things

00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:58,030
like that I definitely encourage you to

00:36:55,420 --> 00:37:03,190
take a look and definitely reach out if

00:36:58,030 --> 00:37:08,380
you have questions so with that I am

00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:10,540
going to deploy spring music classic app

00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:13,869
for the classic sample I put live

00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:15,730
pounding to see F EE it's gonna be a

00:37:13,869 --> 00:37:18,040
very short demo I want to leave a lot of

00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:19,900
time for questions and we don't have

00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:21,520
services available yet you can deploy

00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:23,560
them yourself but they're not pre

00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:25,560
deployed so there's not all that much to

00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:27,760
demo besides the standard CF features

00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:28,380
that you know you're all pretty familiar

00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:32,170
with

00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:33,210
so with that people see this terminal

00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:35,940
here

00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:37,500
I hear I didn't want you to wait for

00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:39,480
this thing to start even though it's not

00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:42,780
too slow I know and take a long time

00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:45,720
during the demo so I installed PCF

00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:50,970
Denton's I installed the cff plug-in

00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:55,109
that I did just from github site and I

00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:58,410
ran cff start and you can see we updated

00:37:55,109 --> 00:38:00,660
the ass carrot logo although it looks

00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:02,460
like resizing the terminal it made it

00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:05,880
look a little funny that's okay

00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:09,650
so I'm going to go ahead and log into

00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:12,180
the CFM I just started this morning and

00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:15,510
excuse user passes and cadential as you

00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:17,970
can see got those right here and then I

00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:19,500
have the spring music app that I already

00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:21,780
built a jar so you wouldn't have to wait

00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:30,750
for that and I'm just gonna see you push

00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:36,300
it to see if that and this should take

00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:39,660
about a minute to push you can see here

00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:42,420
it's running for the detection process I

00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:44,609
found a jumbo pack that's your standard

00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:46,500
push experience everything in and see if

00:38:44,609 --> 00:38:48,089
that is what you'd expect from a cloud

00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:51,900
kind of installation

00:38:48,089 --> 00:38:55,290
no John build packs there currently this

00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:57,630
is running a CF deployment one well I

00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:59,190
think we're 1:1 it's a little out of

00:38:57,630 --> 00:39:03,799
date the next release should have you

00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:06,420
runnin elitists yet between them and

00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:09,150
yeah we'll just wait for this

00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:11,220
after finishing really quickly you can

00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:12,809
see I pushed it ahead of time just so I

00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:24,119
hit the cache and would let them take

00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:28,680
you long one-one minute someone asked a

00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:32,910
question in the chat just figure out how

00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:33,869
to get the chat on the screen chair can

00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:36,990
you repeat the question

00:39:33,869 --> 00:39:41,520
I read the question

00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:44,849
it's from norm he said will we be able

00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:48,270
to in the future have PCF toe and CFD

00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:51,750
both installed at the same time

00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:57,960
so we don't plan or we haven't thought

00:39:51,750 --> 00:40:00,980
about that yet we may you know fix the

00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:02,910
namespacing issue or release with the

00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:05,070
problem I think that's referring to is

00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:06,450
the name of the plug-in once you

00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:07,980
installed the command and installs as

00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:08,460
dad's which conflicts with the PC of

00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:09,720
Devlin

00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:11,280
so you can't have both installed at the

00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:12,599
same time currently we didn't think

00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:15,480
that'd be a problem initially because

00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:17,339
the VMS are both relatively large so you

00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:18,810
wouldn't want to have both started at

00:40:17,339 --> 00:40:21,119
the same time and you can leave one

00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:22,859
running if you uninstalled uninstalling

00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,390
a plugin doesn't shut down the VM so you

00:40:22,859 --> 00:40:27,359
can't install one plug-in install the

00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:29,160
other one is that whatever that is not

00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:32,730
the best you don't usability experience

00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:34,020
and on Mac it is possible windows it's

00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:35,670
not possible to run hyper-v in

00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:37,380
VirtualBox at the same time anyways so

00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:39,920
it's not not an issue on Windows but a

00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:42,839
Mac you can run VirtualBox and hyper

00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:45,000
hyper kit and so we may look into

00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:46,380
addressing that but we don't think there

00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
are a lot of use cases for it and it's

00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:51,450
already kind of possible so you may you

00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:57,450
may not end up doing that I will think

00:40:51,450 --> 00:41:01,550
about it so you can see that so you can

00:40:57,450 --> 00:41:05,250
see this is sorry kind of someone meet

00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:07,589
there's some background noise there okay

00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:10,560
so you can see a screen music push

00:41:07,589 --> 00:41:13,980
successfully I'm gonna grab there to

00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:20,160
route it generated randomly then go back

00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:24,060
to my web browser here and tada music

00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:26,609
running locally from this domain which

00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:29,430
was pointed at a pointing back at your

00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:31,349
machine at actually at an alias

00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:33,720
interface on your loopback interface is

00:41:31,349 --> 00:41:36,869
how VPN you think it does the networking

00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:39,210
it's that was pretty interesting so we

00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:42,180
don't have services yet but I can show

00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:45,960
you gosh so we can deploy your own

00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:49,349
services if you want to so here I'm

00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:50,820
gonna do CF launch and you can see

00:41:49,349 --> 00:41:55,020
there's only one so you have to have off

00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:57,420
command available which is this n bar

00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:59,610
thing so if you see if that box and you

00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:01,500
get this selection of environment

00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:02,910
variables these are temporary generated

00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:08,160
secrets and that supposing anything

00:42:02,910 --> 00:42:12,420
anybody can pack into here and the if I

00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:16,230
source that using eval run that using

00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:18,600
eval against now my gosh CLI has full

00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:20,790
access to the Bosh director running

00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:24,990
inside of C I've done so pretty Bosh

00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:27,660
releases you can see all my releases

00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:30,900
from C up deployment are there and maybe

00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:33,420
five deployments you can see my CF

00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:36,480
installation is there and has all those

00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:39,390
releases deployed as using the Bosh

00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:40,800
lights themselves this is the Box

00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:43,230
aspects of this are similar to Bosh

00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:45,360
light I mean it's using a the same

00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:51,480
director Bosh light does with the same

00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:53,430
CPI so that's about it eventually will

00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:55,410
be able to bother you can currently

00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:57,570
bashed employee we've tested rabbitmq

00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:59,130
already and that deploys really easily

00:42:57,570 --> 00:43:02,460
if you just change the box flight routes

00:42:59,130 --> 00:43:04,230
then RabbitMQ repo and get it to play

00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:06,840
rabbit you service in there eventually

00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:08,850
we'll have flags like the current CF CLI

00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:10,890
does little light you to play services

00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:12,860
but probably you could probably be more

00:43:10,890 --> 00:43:15,540
dynamic you'll probably will say CF

00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:17,910
deploy this and we run deploy it on a

00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:22,260
running instance opens up a lot of

00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:22,650
possibilities for us here and that's

00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:25,410
about it

00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:27,780
that's all I got for my demo anybody

00:43:25,410 --> 00:43:28,350
have questions there was one more

00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:32,730
question

00:43:28,350 --> 00:43:35,010
guess I'm turning into a moderator from

00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:37,110
Mike he said do you foresee support for

00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:44,880
adding custom bought shop files to the

00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:48,300
CF dove deployed so current custom box

00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:50,190
ops files for deploying like other

00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:52,620
servant like like do we plan to offer

00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:54,930
all hostiles for deployment are there

00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:57,360
other services I think what he means is

00:43:54,930 --> 00:43:59,370
for Cloud Foundry like maybe you have

00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:02,280
your own customizations to Cloud Foundry

00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:02,880
and you want to override them with the

00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,770
manifest

00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:08,310
that's why I'll try to call the reader

00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:10,200
blue yeah yeah so we plan to offer the

00:44:08,310 --> 00:44:12,300
minute you can download the manifest in

00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:13,080
this box director using Bosh and so you

00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:15,030
can download

00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:17,340
make changes to it and redeploy if you

00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:19,710
want to and that that works completely

00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:21,360
fine you can you can undo play CF and

00:44:19,710 --> 00:44:21,930
deploy a new CF if you want to that all

00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,970
works

00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:25,560
we are planning an option to just give

00:44:23,970 --> 00:44:27,030
you the box tractor with nothing else to

00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:28,590
make it kind of like a box light

00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:30,690
experience on the native hypervisors

00:44:28,590 --> 00:44:33,150
that would let you deploy so you also

00:44:30,690 --> 00:44:34,920
all those things are possibilities that

00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:39,920
will have an easy way to do at some

00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:42,210
point we when we do the service flags

00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:43,470
you know we can offer more services than

00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:44,970
we've offered in the past because we

00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:47,960
don't have to bake them in the moment

00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:50,280
that we offer you co dev I mean and so

00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:54,630
there'll be you know custom ops files

00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:55,950
and and or manifests for all that that

00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:57,930
you'll be able to download and use to

00:44:55,950 --> 00:44:59,670
play you know sort of wider selection of

00:44:57,930 --> 00:45:04,370
services than the three or four we have

00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:06,810
right now Nick a question on the

00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:08,760
resource requirements so about three

00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:11,820
years ago I bought a brand-new Mac air

00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:15,540
and and it still works really good right

00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:18,090
up until I tried to see if there's the

00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:20,880
CF damn looks like it uses almost 10% of

00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:22,200
my 500 gig SSD drive which three years

00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:25,980
ago is pretty fancy drill ethical I

00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:28,950
think you and I like it and when I went

00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:30,930
to try to play more things my machine

00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:31,770
became very unhappy that that I was

00:45:30,930 --> 00:45:34,140
trying to do all this stuff

00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:35,880
what is there filleth not like my

00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:38,430
machine does the problem but what is

00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:41,730
this or resource requirements so

00:45:38,430 --> 00:45:43,560
you should be yeah for this first alpha

00:45:41,730 --> 00:45:46,440
you probably want a machine with 16 gigs

00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:48,300
of ram or more and quite a bit of free

00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:50,070
disk space I haven't even looked too

00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:51,540
much at much to space it's taking up in

00:45:50,070 --> 00:45:53,040
the latest release and the latest

00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:55,050
acceptance builds

00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:58,470
we haven't applied many of the

00:45:55,050 --> 00:45:59,520
optimizations we made to PCF deaths too

00:45:58,470 --> 00:46:00,930
so you have done quite yet

00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,860
and still in the backlog we wanted to

00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:04,080
get the fresh lease out was just

00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:06,210
something that worked and then cover

00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:07,680
that later so we're hoping to get to a

00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:09,930
similar footprint it's gonna be a little

00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:11,820
bit bigger because bond the box director

00:46:09,930 --> 00:46:12,360
they're not box agents running and stuff

00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:14,940
like that

00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:16,020
but we're hoping that will be you'll

00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:17,670
still be able to run it in a machine

00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:21,210
with eight gigs of ram and put a few

00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:22,980
amps as the goal the optimizations we

00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:25,110
haven't applied yet or things like their

00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:26,570
perform there are some JVM options you

00:46:25,110 --> 00:46:29,120
can use to tune you and

00:46:26,570 --> 00:46:30,830
to take a class memory you know there

00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:32,660
there's some things that you know we

00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:36,740
just haven't got around together I mean

00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:39,470
we know we can do you said it was really

00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:43,250
fast when I booted it up again on my

00:46:39,470 --> 00:46:44,690
classic Mac even after downloading

00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:46,040
everything it still took 40 minutes to

00:46:44,690 --> 00:46:48,890
bring about bring it up is that is it

00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:52,460
doing a like a resurrection or is there

00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:54,470
a reason why I take so long is it so we

00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:58,220
see it take on a machine with 16 gigs of

00:46:54,470 --> 00:47:02,480
RAM that's a relatively fast machine of

00:46:58,220 --> 00:47:04,340
i7 or something it takes about 10 to 15

00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:08,900
minutes which is about the same as PCF

00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:11,060
dev the you know first alpha release may

00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:14,540
vary a little bit more than subsequent

00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:16,070
releases for that time probably is it

00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:17,960
doing a resurrection of something pretty

00:47:16,070 --> 00:47:19,970
deployed or is it deploying it and

00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:23,360
what's deploying it's deploying from

00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:25,760
scratch the it's just it's like if you

00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:29,330
deployed CF to bash light but we made

00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:31,880
some changes to flashlights that you

00:47:29,330 --> 00:47:35,720
know improve that experience and they're

00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:38,000
mostly upstream might actually and the

00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:41,150
we've seen on the native hypervisors on

00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,560
Mac at least that that process if done

00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:43,790
with all the right that's locally and

00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:45,680
with that it doesn't have to download

00:47:43,790 --> 00:47:48,290
anything during the process and stuff

00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:51,860
doesn't take that much longer than the

00:47:48,290 --> 00:47:53,420
PCF the PC of devs process where all the

00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:55,340
pre deployed services would start at the

00:47:53,420 --> 00:48:00,880
same time it's mostly just copying stuff

00:47:55,340 --> 00:48:00,880
around that it's the extra time on top

00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:07,730
so following on the heels of the

00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:11,150
previous presentation with the MSS devel

00:48:07,730 --> 00:48:12,830
service broker what's the timeline for

00:48:11,150 --> 00:48:16,400
getting this heap of Awesomeness into

00:48:12,830 --> 00:48:18,710
the hands of the windows world hyper-v

00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:20,720
is what I'm really dude just to clarify

00:48:18,710 --> 00:48:22,520
do you mean you want to runs you want to

00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:24,350
do cff start on a Windows machine with

00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:26,740
hyper-v or do you mean you want Windows

00:48:24,350 --> 00:48:30,380
cells like pushing Windows apps or

00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:32,060
hyper-v yeah hey look you know I'm in

00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:34,370
the windows world I've got his awesome

00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:36,650
surface book and it's got 16 gigs I ran

00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:39,710
a lot of discs it's like a MacBook Pro

00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:43,280
except that it's windows yeah

00:48:39,710 --> 00:48:46,820
so relatively soon that's that's coming

00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:50,030
up pretty quickly we are fixing one or

00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:51,650
two bugs on on Mac first right now we

00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:53,720
need to make sure PCF deploys to it well

00:48:51,650 --> 00:48:55,640
and then we're gonna tackle hyper-v we

00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:57,619
would not call it you know we wouldn't

00:48:55,640 --> 00:49:00,830
say it's finished until hyper-v support

00:48:57,619 --> 00:49:03,109
works just as well as you know support

00:49:00,830 --> 00:49:04,670
on Mac that's that's you know critical

00:49:03,109 --> 00:49:07,280
part of my roadmap it's definitely

00:49:04,670 --> 00:49:09,740
something that we'll get to soon and

00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:10,760
just we started in that first awesome so

00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:13,430
Tuesday right

00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:18,250
not like on Tuesday but but you know

00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:20,900
soon the we do we are thinking about

00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:23,030
windows cells support also the ability

00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:25,460
to draw on Windows machine or if you can

00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:28,490
run a Windows VM deploy Windows apps

00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:29,780
like that net apps to it that's that's

00:49:28,490 --> 00:49:31,520
something we're thinking about - we

00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:33,589
definitely care a lot about our Windows

00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:36,470
users especially because our PC of death

00:49:33,589 --> 00:49:37,970
integration we think we largely used by

00:49:36,470 --> 00:49:39,920
Windows users because that's who you

00:49:37,970 --> 00:49:42,589
know most most of the user basically

00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:44,750
slept at right now is Windows so you

00:49:42,589 --> 00:49:49,880
have a couple of volunteers in the chat

00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:53,410
for you know just let me see if I can

00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:53,410
figure out where the chat window when

00:50:00,670 --> 00:50:06,410
somebody want to read to me is that is

00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:07,849
that participants little bubble thing

00:50:06,410 --> 00:50:10,400
and then when you click there then

00:50:07,849 --> 00:50:12,830
there's a chat so Mike Lloyd and myself

00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:16,450
and we've got one other that would be

00:50:12,830 --> 00:50:20,230
able to help test on Windows yeah

00:50:16,450 --> 00:50:22,910
there's also a question about networking

00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:24,800
to get access to the web UI associated

00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:28,099
with things like who is use so I guess

00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:34,420
he needed some tips so maybe something

00:50:28,099 --> 00:50:34,420
akin but I found the chat window so

00:50:34,510 --> 00:50:38,060
after working this you have to have a

00:50:36,290 --> 00:50:42,730
little any tips on networking with

00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:47,500
getting access to do is associated with

00:50:42,730 --> 00:50:49,400
things like Prometheus and someone

00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:51,619
Patrick can you talk a little bit more

00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:52,549
about that question what are you looking

00:50:51,619 --> 00:50:55,819
for a for network

00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:57,410
yeah sure so I was actually kind of

00:50:55,819 --> 00:50:59,749
stumble on to see if dev and was working

00:50:57,410 --> 00:51:01,400
with it a little bit so basically I was

00:50:59,749 --> 00:51:03,079
looking to do some application

00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:06,559
monitoring so I wanted I did a

00:51:03,079 --> 00:51:08,929
deployment for Prometheus to do just

00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:10,910
like I said some app monitoring but I

00:51:08,929 --> 00:51:12,380
had some issues I ran into some

00:51:10,910 --> 00:51:15,160
networking problems trying to get access

00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:17,239
to the web UI is associated with it and

00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:21,079
maybe I could talk to you after the call

00:51:17,239 --> 00:51:24,859
or something like that to maybe get some

00:51:21,079 --> 00:51:29,150
tips on that yeah sure that sounds good

00:51:24,859 --> 00:51:30,529
the networking and PCF that is rated

00:51:29,150 --> 00:51:32,299
networking and see if that is kind of

00:51:30,529 --> 00:51:35,029
interesting it's more more interesting

00:51:32,299 --> 00:51:37,789
than it wasn't PC up depth with VPN kit

00:51:35,029 --> 00:51:40,640
there so you know I can definitely

00:51:37,789 --> 00:51:42,319
imagine that there be maybe some issues

00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:44,269
there are some issues with box

00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:47,809
networking in the alpha 2 that should be

00:51:44,269 --> 00:51:49,369
fixed in the next alpha release the one

00:51:47,809 --> 00:51:51,079
of there's a Bosch subnet that's not

00:51:49,369 --> 00:51:53,359
routing correctly in the office that may

00:51:51,079 --> 00:51:56,229
be what you're running into but let's

00:51:53,359 --> 00:52:02,269
let's chat afterwards perfect thanks

00:51:56,229 --> 00:52:06,650
next question I see is no I don't see

00:52:02,269 --> 00:52:08,660
anything else sorry I'm missing I talked

00:52:06,650 --> 00:52:10,549
about customized files installed at the

00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:12,990
same time and the rest looks at sequel

00:52:10,549 --> 00:52:16,080
stuff

00:52:12,990 --> 00:52:18,660
this is this is like Wayne said eBook

00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:22,200
awesomeness I think he said it's really

00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:24,359
really cool Stephen so of course you

00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:27,300
know with after reading your proposal

00:52:24,359 --> 00:52:30,210
you're talking also about services how

00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:32,310
are you gonna I guess support that maybe

00:52:30,210 --> 00:52:34,020
you can mention briefly what what that

00:52:32,310 --> 00:52:36,930
is again so that people can be even more

00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:38,970
excited and and maybe you can finish

00:52:36,930 --> 00:52:43,890
with a timeline of when to expect this

00:52:38,970 --> 00:52:46,140
and I'm not trying to pressure you mean

00:52:43,890 --> 00:52:48,060
what services will make available the

00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:49,290
like they'll be easy to deploy or

00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:51,240
whether you won't have to talk posh to

00:52:49,290 --> 00:52:54,440
get them there

00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:56,670
well I mean it depends right like it I

00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:59,010
think what you what you've done with

00:52:56,670 --> 00:53:01,800
local and this is to make it easy for me

00:52:59,010 --> 00:53:03,750
as a developer to just get started with

00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:05,400
a foundry without having to deploy if a

00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:08,210
foundry and manages and you're making

00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:11,160
all that easy but obviously any

00:53:08,210 --> 00:53:12,390
developer needs to start when you when

00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:16,410
you start using a foundry you need

00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:19,560
services so I expect that's part of the

00:53:16,410 --> 00:53:21,839
next step is how to connect my

00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:23,310
applications that I'm doing which

00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:25,109
services without having to deploy them

00:53:23,310 --> 00:53:28,740
or would you expect me to deploy them

00:53:25,109 --> 00:53:30,300
and then use them yeah so going back to

00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:31,950
the screen share over here what we

00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:34,440
suspect the experience will be like is

00:53:31,950 --> 00:53:37,170
when you do CFM start by itself it'll

00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:38,700
probably start with broker at least we

00:53:37,170 --> 00:53:40,080
want to keep the footprint pretty low so

00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:41,970
you may not add a whole bunch of

00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:43,349
services by default but then if you want

00:53:41,970 --> 00:53:45,710
extra services you're going to do

00:53:43,349 --> 00:53:50,640
something like this

00:53:45,710 --> 00:53:52,230
MQ and mass or something and if you do

00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:54,510
that then we'll pre deploy those

00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:57,180
services at when CFM starts you'll be

00:53:54,510 --> 00:53:58,710
able to do CF create service and find

00:53:57,180 --> 00:54:00,390
the services to grab anything like that

00:53:58,710 --> 00:54:02,790
this is probably the current experience

00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:05,940
with TC at that give that everything is

00:54:02,790 --> 00:54:07,980
baked into the DM and so you know we we

00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:09,330
always start services except for spring

00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:11,310
cloud services being there already on

00:54:09,330 --> 00:54:13,710
your machines and I'll take up too much

00:54:11,310 --> 00:54:15,630
and this it'll probably be more like you

00:54:13,710 --> 00:54:16,619
get my sequel and if you start with

00:54:15,630 --> 00:54:18,690
other ones it will download those

00:54:16,619 --> 00:54:20,200
piecemeal and install them if you

00:54:18,690 --> 00:54:23,320
request them

00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:25,060
I guess you're basically doing what the

00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:27,760
administrator of the broker would have

00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:28,780
to do to set up and and so on right you

00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:30,850
you're doing all of this in the

00:54:28,780 --> 00:54:34,260
background yeah and it's just pasta ploy

00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:37,600
underneath okay we're using the standard

00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:41,380
you know like yeah Frank you release

00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:42,490
Redis release no those those things and

00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:43,810
you can deploy them right now you don't

00:54:42,490 --> 00:54:44,980
need this this is just a convenience

00:54:43,810 --> 00:54:46,690
function you can go and clone this

00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:48,520
repose and do you know change it much

00:54:46,690 --> 00:54:51,370
light routes to be freed up piece you

00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:53,620
have to add IO and do a box deploy and

00:54:51,370 --> 00:54:56,950
we pushing rabbit rabbit at least we

00:54:53,620 --> 00:54:58,180
develop that works for the PCF

00:54:56,950 --> 00:55:00,880
integration for this will also make

00:54:58,180 --> 00:55:04,300
spring cloud service is available but

00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:04,780
that'll be part of the PCM extension one

00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:07,150
other question

00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:10,270
you know usually with workers you have

00:55:07,150 --> 00:55:15,760
to enable the worker for particular

00:55:10,270 --> 00:55:18,070
organ and I guess space in CFD F you

00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:20,080
give me a organ space and if I create

00:55:18,070 --> 00:55:23,800
new organ space and those would have to

00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:25,420
be added like you'd have to add them to

00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:29,140
like the services would have to be

00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:33,400
enabled for those register broker across

00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:37,890
all those and spices may be kept yeah

00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:37,890
and also we do in the PCM time right now

00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:45,460
you do anything you have fallen there we

00:55:43,570 --> 00:55:47,110
give admin credentials and user

00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:49,180
credentials and you start this up and

00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:53,290
both they're pre-prepared and work you

00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:55,120
can see yeah so you can administrate

00:55:53,290 --> 00:55:56,830
your cluster or you can pretend that

00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:59,260
you're just a regular user and use this

00:55:56,830 --> 00:56:02,170
they're already I see so you are in

00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:04,480
admin when you spin up see update I

00:56:02,170 --> 00:56:06,250
guess when you start yeah there we offer

00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:07,960
an admin user and a regular user and

00:56:06,250 --> 00:56:09,820
also you have full access to Bosch so

00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:11,980
you can deploy whatever you want to it's

00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:14,050
just like if you had botch light and

00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:15,160
everything we're pre deployed and worked

00:56:14,050 --> 00:56:18,760
perfectly in Iran on your native

00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:19,060
hypervisor ISM all that very cool very

00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:21,100
cool

00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:23,980
one more question I don't know if

00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:26,260
anybody else but in terms of like stem

00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:28,210
cell management you also give me

00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:30,400
full-blown I can create upload

00:56:28,210 --> 00:56:32,050
difference to themselves and and start

00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:33,700
using those and testing with that as

00:56:32,050 --> 00:56:37,299
well

00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:40,059
so the stem cells are specific to

00:56:37,299 --> 00:56:41,470
different ayahs so this you just uses

00:56:40,059 --> 00:56:43,180
the Bosch light stem cell if you tried

00:56:41,470 --> 00:56:44,260
to imitate oh yes stem cell obviously

00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:46,960
wouldn't be able to use them no of

00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:48,819
course right but you could I am pretty

00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:52,599
sure you can if you wanted to make a

00:56:48,819 --> 00:56:53,289
custom you know was warden whatever it's

00:56:52,599 --> 00:56:55,089
called

00:56:53,289 --> 00:56:58,119
warden Bosch light infantry trusty

00:56:55,089 --> 00:57:00,099
whenever it stem cell you could you know

00:56:58,119 --> 00:57:03,339
I suspect that will work as well I

00:57:00,099 --> 00:57:05,650
haven't tried it yet yeah he's an ass is

00:57:03,339 --> 00:57:07,900
because a lot of CVS you know end up
