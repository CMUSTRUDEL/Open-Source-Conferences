	00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:04,640
uh i'll kick things off um big news from

00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,200
the foundation of course

00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,599
we announced dates for cf summit uh so

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,960
that's gonna be july 21st and 22nd

00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:16,240
um it'll be in north america time zones

00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:19,199
uh and the call for

00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,840
proposals is now open so i believe that

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,359
ends

00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:25,279
may 21st so um

you should uh check it out it's it's on

00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,160
the website um you can register for the

00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:31,119
event

00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,640
there is a sponsorship prospectus and

00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:34,399
but most importantly the call for

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,440
proposals is open so for

00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:40,320
you know uh cloud foundry committers and

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,200
everyone else in the community um now is

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,920
a great time

00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,559
uh to put in proposals for cloud foundry

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,320
summit

00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,239
uh should be fun uh another virtual

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,079
event i i am

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,960
very much cautiously hoping there will

00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:55,039
be in-person events in 2022

00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,879
but uh you know it is what it is still

00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,680
so uh but but it should be fun to get

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,559
together again

00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,480
and um yeah just one event this year so

00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,479
hopefully be a bit bigger turn out but

00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,320
um yeah looking forward to that but call

00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,439
for proposals is open please spread the

00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,520
word on that

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:12,720
to all the project teams and folks in

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,720
your respective companies

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,240
other than that i just wanted to say

00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,400
keep us informed of

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,159
interesting project updates we're always

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,439
looking for blog posts for the cloud

00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,520
foundry blog

00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:27,280
ids for ideas for live streams or

00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,159
tutorials ram and shedrack i've been

00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,320
doing a lot of

00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,920
cool cool work there so if there's you

00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,920
know a project that you feel like could

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,960
use a little bit more

00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,560
uh visibility or you know you'd like a

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,439
tutorial written for which can probably

00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,479
help with that

00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:44,640
so just reach out to the cff if you have

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,920
any ideas for live streams tutorials

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,759
if you'd like to write a blog post or

00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:51,040
you'd like us to write a blog post

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:53,439
let us know um

00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,520
so with that i guess does anyone have

00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:57,200
any i'll get to pmc updates in just a

00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,399
second but does anyone have any other

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,640
things they want to bring up talk about

00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,640
today

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,080
okay uh with that um eric do you want to

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,360
give us some updates on the application

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,040
runtime pmc yeah i'm happy to um so i

00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,120
made some notes in the doc but i'll run

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,120
over those real quick um across the

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,520
integration projects i've had kind of

00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,959
regular releases for both cf deployment

00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,560
and tia for cates from release

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,480
integration i think the

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,160
latest see if kate's minor version has a

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,920
nice improvement to cf apps

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,160
so if you have some some missing apps or

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,360
some apps even with zero instances

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,200
those will actually return in a

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,959
reasonable amount of time when you run

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,879
that command

00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,239
and then uh folks from early integration

00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,080
have also been working with

00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,519
uh some other folks from sap and ibm

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,400
outside the team to be testing cf

00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,480
deployment

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,840
against uh the bionic stem cells and uh

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,879
getting some mileage on those and

00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,720
driving out a few bugs um

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,720
and then qcf is continuing to release

00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,959
some patch versions on the 2.7

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,480
line with some cf operator fixes and

00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,080
some other dependency updates

00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,840
i think uh there's a pretty big cf

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,680
operator update that resolves uh some

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,080
outstanding bugs there

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,400
and then on some of the component teams

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,360
i'm pretty sure that cappy is done

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,159
with all the v3 endpoints at this point

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,840
but

00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,760
i'm still waiting on independent

00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,200
confirmation of that but

00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,200
so pretty sure that's done so they've

00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,800
been focusing on a few other things

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,640
as well i know there's been a few edge

00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,080
cases that they have realized around

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,920
some of the

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,360
state transitions for apps and how they

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,519
affect rolling app deployments

00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,040
or you could end up with an unexpected

00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,080
app restart if you change one of the

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,519
parameters

00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,959
on an app so they've been fixing up some

00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,560
of those cases so that they're all much

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,319
more consistent and predictable

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,760
and i think they're restarting some work

00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:40,560
on app manifest

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,840
uh diffs uh uh with the server-side

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,239
manifest apply

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,680
um pretty soon and then irini's also

00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,159
been working with the capi team

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,000
to transition over to a crd interface

00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:52,239
for their lrp abstraction

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,280
um inside of cloud controller so you

00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,640
know they've been

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,680
working on that for a while but they're

00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,519
getting more serious about the

00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,879
transition to that as the main api

00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:03,599
into the irini component to align more

00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,959
with some of the kubernetes native

00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,200
practices around managing those

00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,439
resources

00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,439
on the networking side i know they've

00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:13,439
started to look at what it would take to

00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,879
support http 2 as a protocol

00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,639
and the go router and some of the other

00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,120
changes around that and so i think

00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,880
they're

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,400
they're working on an initial problem

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,840
statement and proposal for that

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,759
that they'd like to get feedback on so

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,520
keep an eye out for that soon

00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,080
and then a couple other uh improvements

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,479
um a while back diego had

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,360
um taken in some work uh that was

00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,520
contributed

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,960
to alaskan refinements to some of the

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,280
bin packing that it does

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,080
uh in order to favor the lower indexed

00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,280
cells

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,960
to try to get some more efficient

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,560
packing on those and so they're working

00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,120
on some additional indexing refinements

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,120
to support that in a few edge cases

00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,199
and then uh the logging and metrics team

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,880
also uh had some releases

00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,639
uh again to address some of the bionic

00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,400
stem cell compatibility issues that had

00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,320
come up in earlier testing

00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,759
and they've also had some uh component

00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,280
logging improvements trying to get

00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,000
everyone aligned on those human readable

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,160
time stamps

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,680
for component logs so those are just

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,560
some of the highlights across those uh

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,440
pmc teams

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,440
for the past month or so

00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,759
uh great thank you eric um and i believe

00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,880
we've got

00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:17,120
uh maya here from uh bosch pmc uh my

00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,520
idea of some updates for us on that

00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,160
yeah um i maybe don't have anything as

00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,600
polished as

00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,560
eric but uh i'll just run through uh my

00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,680
points i guess

00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,440
uh so we have some tweaks to uh memory

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,120
task cleanup right now

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,639
when you run the scheduled task cleanup

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,880
it loads all those fast enough memory

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,160
so um we're getting some reports that

00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,000
customers are having to inflate their

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,360
director size so hopefully that fix will

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,320
come out soon

00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,880
um right now the postgres director ships

00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:47,280
with postgres9 and postgres10 sorry the

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,600
bosch director

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,639
and i think postgres10 has another year

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,560
or two of support

00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,639
but we've introduced postgres 13 so

00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,360
customers can

00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,360
move over

00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:04,240
we also shipped bosch dns last month

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:07,440
because we bumped to go 115

00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:10,639
go 115 now uh enforces sands

00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:13,919
on cert so people that

00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:15,280
bump to washington s128 might run into

00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,360
deployment failures

00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,199
um if they don't have sands on their

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,560
certs so i think we've documented that

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,440
in bosch deployment but that's something

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,440
to keep your eye out for

00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,319
um and then bionic is still moving along

00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,680
uh i think we're still hoping to get a

00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,960
ga soon

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:35,199
um sap and ibm have both been

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,520
really involved in driving this forward

00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:41,120
and i think the plan is to move this

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:44,000
um to the foundation at some point

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,240
um with like a real open source model of

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,120
contribution for this going forward

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,639
but i think there should be

00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,639
communication about this coming out soon

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:59,840
great um yeah awesome um

00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,840
any questions for eric or maya about

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,840
those

00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,840
updates

00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:11,039
okay um the extensions pmc

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,840
as troy left i've been just doing some

00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,840
housekeeping

00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,759
and whatnot for the extensions pmc we

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,680
didn't think it necessarily

00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,800
made sense to find a new extension pmc

00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,639
lead given the

00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,479
technical governance changes coming up

00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,400
presumably in a couple of months

00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,840
so i've just been sort of place holding

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,800
for that i did

00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:30,240
formally retire a few projects a couple

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,479
that had been long dormant

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,360
uh sql server and brooklyn broker

00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,400
probably could have been retired a

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,800
couple years ago

00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,479
um and then also cf swagger which is

00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,759
also long dormant but

00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,720
i thought perhaps there might be some

00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,560
community interest there because it's

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,680
kind of a worthwhile thing

00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,160
um and then cf dev which is uh more

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,000
current

00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,840
uh but that's also no longer being

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,199
maintained uh so we moved back the

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,440
or i haven't moved to the attic yet but

00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,319
i will this week so those four projects

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,360
formally retired

00:07:54,319 --> 00:08:00,160
a few more coming probably uh cfcr

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,680
in the next couple months and um cf

00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,160
local once

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,360
once a few other things have happened to

00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,919
replace that

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,720
um and yeah lots of other projects are

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:13,759
still you know

00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:16,720
jumping along i know um

00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:18,000
service fabric at a major release or not

00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,440
a major release but uh

00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,960
you know it's a 0.13 but but still like

00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,039
lots of new

00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,319
bug fixes and features and whatnot and

00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:29,039
um

00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,400
we will get some significant updates

00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:33,919
from

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,719
the build packs crew uh at the next cap

00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,479
call meeting

00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,240
so current state of cloud native build

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,399
packs picketto build packs

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,839
last generation cf bold packs all that

00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,760
stuff um

00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,920
how c uh cloud native bill pax are

00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,560
playing with uh cfr cates things like

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,720
that

00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,000
um so that should be a nice deep dive

00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,360
into build packs

00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,440
uh at the next cab call but we do not

00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,240
have a presentation for this cap call

00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,519
uh so uh unless there are any other

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,920
orders of business

00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,519
um i think that's probably a wrap um

00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:08,320
anyone have anything they want to

00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:10,000
talk about or uh

00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,600
okay well thank you all very much for

00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,720
joining uh maya thanks for coming from

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,560
the bosch pmc

00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,920
uh eric thanks for the updates thank you

00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,120
all for coming chris

00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,000
yeah steve um sorry can i try to put

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,000
people in the spot

00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,080
um a little bit sure probably maya and

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,000
eric i apologize but um

00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:30,160
with the bionic stem cells is

00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,640
given the the april kind of deadline we

00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:36,800
have to make a decision on cloud.gov

00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:41,040
whether or not we open uh related

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:44,560
things um if we can't get patches

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:47,680
and so do we have any idea of

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:49,600
of how hard that timeline actually is

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,720
for for bionic and if that's going to

00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,279
work because we have to

00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:56,560
unfortunately start a compliance process

00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:59,760
and a whole slew of paperwork

00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,640
and figure out a remediation plan and we

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,640
don't want to do that

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,079
if you're all really confident that

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,399
we're going to hit april 30th or

00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,399
whatever

00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,480
um i'm not sure i fully understand the

00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,680
question so you're going to take the

00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,959
existing stem cell

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:19,040
and then audit it for some compliance

00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,240
no i mean so part of our sorry part of

00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,480
our ssp says

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,160
uh our system security plan says that we

00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,600
get regular updates and patches the

00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:29,279
operating systems

00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:31,360
and if that can't happen because um

00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,560
the existing stem cells are no longer

00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:36,079
going to be patched

00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,279
and bionics not ready and proven with cf

00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:39,360
deployment

00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:41,839
then that puts us in a position where we

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,959
have to address that with the compliance

00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,079
folks

00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,880
and have a remediation plan and that's

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:50,880
actually

00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:53,440
a lot of work um and

00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,680
from the communications we've seen you

00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,399
know they all say hey we might hit this

00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,440
we might not hit this deadline of april

00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,640
30th

00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,040
and i'm just trying to get an

00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:06,160
understanding of you know

00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,959
how close we think that would be because

00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,079
of the

00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:11,040
the amount of work we'd have to do like

00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:13,440
let's say it's not

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,079
ready not proven not tested for cf

00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,240
deployment

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:21,360
by april 30th is it

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:24,640
may 5th is it july

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,800
like those are very different targets if

00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,399
that makes sense

00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,480
i know that's a hard question answer i

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,600
apologize yeah i i think that that makes

00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,839
sense steve

00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:39,040
um i i think there's still some risk

00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:42,160
that there are operational unknowns with

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:44,480
um how some of the deeper components

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,680
of cf deployment things like garden

00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,360
especially

00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,880
are going to work so i know there's been

00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,079
a couple of fixes that have gone into

00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,920
garden already

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,360
for some issues that were discovered on

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,800
previous rounds

00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:59,360
but um i

00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,079
like i couldn't say you know for 100

00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,320
certain

00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:04,639
that like there will be a lot of mileage

00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:07,680
with cf deployment in particular

00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:10,639
on uh on bionic stem cells by that

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,399
the end of april and so i do i do see

00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,120
some risk of of running past that i

00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,800
don't think it would be

00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,160
much like i doubt it would be into july

00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,120
to take us to resolve any of those

00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,440
issues

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,639
um you know certainly a lot of the other

00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,600
big vendors

00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,079
um uh you know especially sap and ibm if

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,360
they've

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:27,120
really been stepping up to drive this

00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,800
effort uh they have

00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,720
some of those same concerns security

00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,360
concerns uh and want to make that

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,680
transition

00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,560
for their large cf environments over to

00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,600
bionic

00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:40,000
uh very quickly so um

00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,800
if it does go past april i i would hope

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,560
that there'd be

00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,639
kind of increased urgency to getting

00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,959
that resolved say sometime in may

00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,079
um but you know i wouldn't say april

00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:51,519
30th is a lock

00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:53,440
at all okay

00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,519
thanks that that helps a lot appreciate

00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,519
it

00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,760
all right thanks steve um and everybody
