00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:26,519
perfect all right now and both edy where

00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:29,580
I'm from so I'll show you a video maybe

00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:33,600
towards the end it works out but anyways

00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:35,730
we have full agenda people yes

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,000
everybody's here we have two speakers

00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:41,040
and then we usually start with Cloud

00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,590
Foundry foundation giving us an update I

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:47,160
think Sequoia is here so maybe you can

00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:49,230
take it I'm going you to avoid any noise

00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:52,890
around here but that's far enough

00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:56,250
yep I'm here so just a quick update on

00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:58,170
the summit this whistlin register as

00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,760
already assertions open the early bird

00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:03,570
registration I think is open until July

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:06,210
20th we have a hundred and eight

00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,500
registration so far so it's great to see

00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:09,720
that folks have already started

00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,840
registering for the event we had a

00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:15,030
slightly higher than usual submissions

00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,310
for this year so we had over 300

00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:20,700
submissions for speaking proposals so

00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:23,159
our call for paper announcements the

00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,650
acceptance the notifications will go out

00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:27,420
in the first week of July think they are

00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:30,930
the second week of July after the fourth

00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:33,630
of July weekend here in the US we all we

00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:35,810
will also have a first announcement kind

00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:37,950
of aligning with the same week of

00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:39,689
notifications announcing the first set

00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:42,930
of line and the keynote speaker sponsors

00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:46,320
and all that jazz I have updated all of

00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:48,450
this in the cap agenda document so you

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,540
can find the links over there we also

00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:54,329
recently worked on the team foundation

00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:57,119
and the clarity foundations values and

00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:59,070
culture so you can take a quick look at

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,479
of that as well

00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:03,240
I think from the Linux Foundation

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,430
perspective they also recently published

00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:08,039
the open source jobs report I provided a

00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:09,920
link here so here interested in kind of

00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:13,670
taking a quick look at the jobs report

00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,670
that's available as well

00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:22,670
if there's no questions from me for me I

00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:25,580
will pass it back dr. max Thank You Sora

00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:27,290
I guess just a quick I'm not sure if you

00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:30,440
mentioned this at DNA was switching

00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:33,050
things in terms of registration counts

00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:35,210
and submission counts we were good or do

00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:39,860
we need everybody to do a push

00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:41,480
especially for registration I think at

00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:43,550
this point we're still good

00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,410
it's pretty expected to see a huge spike

00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:47,660
as we get closer to the event and

00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:49,700
significant spike in the last four weeks

00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:51,580
before the event so I think we're good

00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:54,440
this is an expected trend we are not

00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:56,570
significantly lower or higher and the

00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:59,750
speaking proposals last year we had

00:02:56,570 --> 00:03:03,530
about 280 or 290 submissions this year

00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:05,510
we had 304 or 305 so it's it's trending

00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:09,080
in the right direction we had a lot more

00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:11,390
interest this time and we had that one

00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,980
week extension definitely how to hope

00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:15,920
the communities have been done a ton of

00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:18,709
more sessions as well as that it's so

00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:25,430
far things are really good so endemic

00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:27,620
amounts for which get excited the yeah

00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:29,810
that follows the fourth of July weekend

00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:31,550
so I think it's the week of July 6th or

00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:34,220
something I don't have a candidate not

00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:37,670
me but the notifications will go out to

00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:40,519
the folks that submitted that right

00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:44,510
after the 4th of July week and we also

00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:48,739
are lining up our announcement of first

00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:51,050
set of sessions and keynote speakers and

00:03:48,739 --> 00:03:58,370
kind of overall summit meals for that

00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:59,989
week as well I don't know if anybody has

00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:05,900
questions I don't see anything on the

00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:14,030
chat so we'll switch to I think Yui I

00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:16,580
don't see a pivotal Danny do you want to

00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:19,010
actually Dimitri Journal so you want to

00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:21,530
give us an update on Bosch maybe we go

00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:24,830
with Bosch first and then we get to Eric

00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:26,389
after that or run time any highlights

00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:34,159
anything you want to

00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:41,150
Demitri a message dropped so maybe Danny

00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:46,810
do it obvious blush nothing yet you

00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:54,139
chicken go ahead say that hey education

00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:56,779
we could hear it huh well I think

00:04:54,139 --> 00:05:02,840
continuing to work on some where

00:04:56,779 --> 00:05:06,639
existing tracks Toronto has been a hard

00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:10,849
work at removing registry and updating

00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:17,779
some of the CPI related machinery to

00:05:10,849 --> 00:05:21,469
work with CB IV to hopefully that

00:05:17,779 --> 00:05:26,180
simplified certain things we've also

00:05:21,469 --> 00:05:30,520
been fixing a few problems that we saw

00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:36,589
is 260 lists related to some of the

00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:42,289
links refactoring and whatnot I think

00:05:36,589 --> 00:05:46,520
side from that just trying to catch up

00:05:42,289 --> 00:05:49,969
with all the things we have lots of

00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:51,289
Piazza that we still have emerged yet so

00:05:49,969 --> 00:05:57,610
we're slowly kind of going through that

00:05:51,289 --> 00:06:03,110
Q has been doing also some fixes to

00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:07,909
xenial stem cells and polishes I think

00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:15,649
recently we've published a t10 stem cell

00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:16,720
a version that excludes EFS so that's

00:06:15,649 --> 00:06:20,370
that

00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:24,460
more or less kind of a stable artifact

00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:26,440
that we feel pretty confident with so we

00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:31,169
pushing more teams to test against

00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:36,190
xenial steps l and that way hopefully

00:06:31,169 --> 00:06:40,630
shortly Cloud Foundry deployment repo

00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:47,010
will start adopting that as a default

00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:47,010
stem so let's finish it

00:06:49,590 --> 00:07:01,479
any questions no I don't see anything on

00:06:54,490 --> 00:07:03,940
the chat when you say waiting for more

00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:05,470
tests you mean do you mean that you

00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:07,080
wouldn't recommend people to go in

00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:10,120
production with this or would you say

00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:12,310
test it and then it do it for you just

00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:16,600
go for it but what's your recommendation

00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:18,100
on this version I think this version is

00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,680
fine I was just saying that claw

00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:24,820
foundries deployment reboil switch to it

00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:26,710
by default yet but we're we're trying to

00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:31,740
have all the teams who contribute to the

00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:31,740
repo tester out see how it goes

00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:42,669
unless there any question but to your

00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:46,210
watch we dated will switch to Eric or

00:07:42,669 --> 00:07:48,010
you we I didn't see or join so I don't

00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:50,440
know if Eric you can give us the update

00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:51,360
for when I come back sure I can comment

00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,800
on a few things

00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:57,550
Dimitri mentioned xenial stem cells and

00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:59,650
I know a bunch of the core CF runtime

00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:01,090
teams have been testing against that

00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:04,900
fact I think the Diego team just

00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:07,449
switched its concours CI over to that as

00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:08,889
well as some of our test environments we

00:08:07,449 --> 00:08:13,060
haven't seen much that's surprising so

00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:14,440
far which is good news some other things

00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:18,210
that are on the horizon

00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:20,560
I know Cathy's making good progress on

00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:23,650
allowing rolling app updates through the

00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,990
v3 API and so I expect they'll have

00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:29,680
something that's ready for beta level

00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:31,600
feedback pretty soon so definitely

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,909
to the runtime PMC notes for updates

00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,620
there and Zack may also have something

00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:38,500
for the mailing list when that's ready

00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:40,539
for some mileage I also know the routing

00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:43,360
and continue networking teams are

00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:46,899
proceeding with various aspects of is

00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,190
CEO and envoy integration I think the

00:08:46,899 --> 00:08:51,450
routing team is continuing to make

00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:53,380
incremental progress supporting

00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:56,830
coordination with Sto

00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:59,370
pilot and envoy components for the new

00:08:56,830 --> 00:09:02,380
routing tier and routing control plane

00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:05,680
and continue networking is also working

00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:07,870
on various options to route internal

00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:10,300
traffic through the on voice to take

00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:14,680
advantage of some of its client-side

00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:17,470
load balancing capabilities and then

00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:21,730
also one thing that Diego and garden

00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:23,440
have been working on is getting all the

00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:27,279
details right to support rootless

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:29,680
containers with all of the configuration

00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:32,560
around containers that is now the

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:35,080
default in CF deployment so I think

00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,580
there's one last aspect around how

00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:39,250
container networking works with

00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:40,450
realistic containers that the garden

00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:42,339
container networking camps are working

00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:45,160
out but then hopefully is something that

00:09:42,339 --> 00:09:49,360
we can start moving real CF environments

00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:52,720
to so I think there's a the highlights

00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:56,050
in past month or so it's just far as

00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,970
kind of core application and routing

00:09:56,050 --> 00:10:02,380
features of the CF app runtime are

00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:04,900
concerned I can add a little bit for

00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:07,000
container networking just because they

00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:10,360
kicked up a new track yesterday so they

00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,430
just ingested on dynamic egress so you

00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:15,579
don't have to rebind your applications

00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:19,540
when a if see change and also

00:10:15,579 --> 00:10:21,970
configuring policies to destinations are

00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:23,320
than to individual like these so that's

00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:25,150
something they're working on I'm sure

00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:28,050
should I will have something about it in

00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:28,050
the PMC notes

00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:38,170
Nexen what was that Bhushan and a Koopa

00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:49,399
okay

00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:50,690
any questions one time we did know yes

00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:55,639
everybody's waiting for the two talks

00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:58,610
that's good let's see if Matt Keane is

00:10:55,639 --> 00:11:04,730
here to give us an update on open

00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:09,680
service go for it yeah no I didn't see

00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:12,199
him so maybe he'll join after so for

00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:16,310
extensions as we clear and so mad I

00:11:12,199 --> 00:11:20,899
guess Johnson the key thing is we have a

00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:25,130
talk today but we got to talks we dated

00:11:20,899 --> 00:11:29,000
you extensions versus the Stratus update

00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:31,279
as you know that was accepted earlier

00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,800
this year or I guess last year and then

00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:35,600
we have project Blockheads and the

00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,519
reason they're also presenting is

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,959
because you're gonna submit it as an

00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,569
extension so everything you're gonna

00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:46,399
hear from Nina is going to be submitted

00:11:41,569 --> 00:11:50,149
to be include sanction so the proposal

00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:55,399
will come out I guess sometime today

00:11:50,149 --> 00:11:56,870
we missed the call that's not due to

00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:59,750
various reasons but we'll have on this

00:11:56,870 --> 00:12:02,120
one so I think if you want to updates

00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:04,790
for the other projects we've got

00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,899
previous ones updates and then wait for

00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:08,839
us to announce it

00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:20,569
or join Nick's next week it's gonna be

00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:24,550
Monday so that's it okay so we'll try to

00:12:20,569 --> 00:12:27,260
give as much time to the two presenters

00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:36,260
part of the reason I asked them to

00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:39,079
present or because I think somebody was

00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:45,820
asking if there is any updates on the

00:12:39,079 --> 00:12:49,070
cube CAF and operations I don't know if

00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:52,190
somebody has a question about that just

00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:55,460
generally but we then there's not no

00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:57,470
plans to add them yet since no no I mean

00:12:55,460 --> 00:13:01,670
I guess one of them is already part of

00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:03,500
Bosch and one is part of the runtime so

00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:05,030
I guess those updates will go through

00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:09,490
there and then of course people can ask

00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:12,550
questions but I think chip has his

00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:15,380
weekly or bi-weekly calls for Q C

00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:19,070
integrations maybe next time we'll have

00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:22,190
more to talk about but so today we have

00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:25,340
two presentations really important

00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:28,310
points so first one is gonna be an

00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:29,990
update on the Stratus UI so people that

00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:32,540
don't know anything about Stratus UI

00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:36,080
especially people listening to this on

00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:39,830
the internet it's basically a full-blown

00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:43,130
UI for CF it pretty much gives you a UI

00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:45,620
that you can now you know with your

00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:48,860
small company or even bigger companies

00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:51,830
to use for Cloud Foundry I know we have

00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:55,130
IDM have looked at it seriously and and

00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:57,140
I think I don't know the details of

00:13:55,130 --> 00:14:00,320
where it's being used but I know it's

00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:04,270
being used by Oasis and of course Susa

00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,270
is the one that submitted it and it's

00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:08,510
they're continuing developments are they

00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:09,590
gonna tell us about version 2 the one

00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:11,120
thing I can tell you is when I use it

00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:14,630
myself

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:16,190
in Boston I literally didn't have much

00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:18,710
experience because I seeing what Neal

00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:21,350
had and I could put it together on my

00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:24,170
iPad and iPhone in a few minutes and get

00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:25,820
it working so very excited about this

00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:28,089
and then after that we have the

00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:32,660
blockhead project which is a blockchain

00:14:28,089 --> 00:14:34,780
batarians much conformist without too

00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:39,380
much thinking too much of their time

00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:40,880
Neal if you want wanna I guess unmute

00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:44,710
and then you have to share your screen

00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:48,830
also all right I'm about 25 minutes yeah

00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:51,700
okay good let me share my screen is

00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:51,700
 funny right

00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:58,940
okay good can you see that yes we can

00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:01,310
see it awesome

00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:04,880
alrighty so Optimax asked me to keep an

00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:06,140
update on Stratus so I think some of the

00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,540
history's already been gone over but

00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:11,690
really briefly we been debating this at

00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:14,390
Sousa sometime and then I think last

00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:17,270
November or so I think I did that demo

00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:20,810
on this very call and we submitted it to

00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:23,090
the extensions framework and it was

00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:25,100
approved in December so pretty much I

00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:28,100
think since January we've been operating

00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:29,600
as the within the CF extensions PMC well

00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:33,740
the repo has been moved over to the

00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:36,830
cloud foundry incubator github and our

00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:39,050
focus I guess for the last I've got four

00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:41,600
six months has been on this version two

00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:44,870
which is what I'll I'll run you through

00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,400
today and if you've not seen it before

00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:49,700
hopefully there'll be something there

00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:51,050
that will whet your appetite maybe get

00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,970
you to go take a look if you've seen it

00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:55,460
before then hopefully you'll get an idea

00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:57,140
of where we're heading but um the main

00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:59,840
focus on the BT release has been to kind

00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:02,150
of movers from the older angularjs

00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:03,170
framework to the newer angular stack so

00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:07,100
hopefully we've got something that will

00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:09,530
carry us forward for a bit longer we've

00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:12,170
also taken the opportunity to kind of

00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:14,000
refresh the UI so we're using sort of

00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:15,740
material design and we using a kind of

00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,990
open source which is set for that rather

00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:20,180
than our own we've tried to kind of

00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:21,470
improve the layout throughout and make

00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:24,500
it easier to find the information you're

00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:27,110
looking for improve some visuals in

00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:28,880
various places and we've got some

00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:32,180
improved support for services which are

00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:34,970
showcase and that's something that we we

00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:36,770
want to move forward and improve as as

00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:38,570
time progresses and certainly as the

00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:40,400
open service broke stuff improves as

00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:43,010
well and then also lots of other

00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:44,780
improvements throughout the UI around

00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:46,430
being able to redeploy apps and all that

00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:50,180
kind of stuff so hopefully our I'll

00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:54,380
showcase some of those so what we're

00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:56,090
headed is for doing this v2 we are

00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:58,070
currently have a kind of a beta version

00:16:56,090 --> 00:17:02,150
tagged and we're working hard to get a

00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:05,030
release of this for July so next month

00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:06,800
we have the v1 is still still there so

00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:10,220
you can you can go

00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:12,520
I'll get her page which is happy there

00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:15,800
you can see had green created Stratus

00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:17,890
there's a some documentation road maps

00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:21,410
on there are planning our weekly updates

00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:24,590
all that you can take the the v1 off

00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:26,360
master or the the v2 what I'm showing

00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:29,270
today's there me too hopefully you can

00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:32,450
see my login screen so this is within

00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:34,150
the game syndicating it's the UA eh I'll

00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:37,550
skip that screen while it loads actually

00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:40,280
one of the things about Stratus is we

00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:42,470
support being able to manage multiple

00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:44,780
cloud foundries it's also these bottom

00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:46,280
except this is a web-based UI for

00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:48,680
managing Cloud Foundry and for

00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:50,830
developers and administrators to to

00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:54,020
achieve their tasks through a visual UI

00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:55,940
we let you register and connect multiple

00:17:54,020 --> 00:18:00,950
cloud foundries if you wish

00:17:55,940 --> 00:18:04,310
so here I've I've got three only two are

00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:08,300
connected I can connect the third so

00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:10,820
again we only use the the public v2 API

00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:13,160
endpoint and the SSH and the log stream

00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:14,390
to connect to the cedar any any access

00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:16,430
to any internals of your cloud phones

00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:20,840
you just need to point it at the public

00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:22,070
API you can go in you can connect with

00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,270
your potentials so you might have

00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:26,510
different credentials for each of these

00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:27,920
obviously probably well but you might be

00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:31,310
an admin on one or develop on the other

00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:32,600
so you can go in and connect in so here

00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:34,880
I'm just gonna connect up multiple pcs

00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:36,800
dev it's all three and they're connected

00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,920
an administrator can actually register

00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:41,030
those endpoints so I won't do that now

00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:42,680
pre-done that's to add them into the

00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:44,330
system and then each user that comes in

00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,710
is able to connect to those with their

00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:47,420
own credentials so they get the right

00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:50,510
level of access against each of those

00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:53,000
cloud foundry deployments that send

00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:54,950
points the kind of key focus starting

00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,960
the top is really round applications so

00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:58,340
this is the what call the app wall took

00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,590
a little while to load there as it's

00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:02,270
gone out to all three of those

00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:04,760
boundaries is retrieved all the

00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:06,830
applications obviously we we try to be

00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:09,380
reasonably intelligent with the API

00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:10,640
cause we make it you know there's

00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:12,890
quaddle of information to get around

00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,230
orgs and spaces and domains and routes

00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:16,850
and all that stuff so we try to make

00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:19,520
sure we only make those when it's

00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:20,570
absolutely necessary it will cache those

00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,120
results within the

00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:24,200
you I said you move around won't you go

00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,840
and fetch things that hasn't already

00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:28,669
gone or if you choose to refresh because

00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:30,889
obviously that those things can take a

00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:33,769
bit of time so as I've shown about three

00:19:30,889 --> 00:19:35,620
Clara foundries connected I can look at

00:19:33,769 --> 00:19:39,200
all my apps here in this card view

00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:44,029
switch to a ListView just sorting by the

00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:48,740
various rows columns fields can refresh

00:19:44,029 --> 00:19:51,799
I can filter down to only see my apps in

00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:55,460
the various boundaries and again I could

00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:59,750
even go down to a particular author

00:19:55,460 --> 00:20:01,370
space no education to that org so I can

00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:04,370
jammer and look at my apps within a

00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:07,460
given app I can drill down and get a

00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:09,679
kind of an app view and again we've we

00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:11,450
switched in v1 from from how it else

00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,490
into this more of this card layout so

00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:15,559
we've tried to put less on this screen

00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:17,629
may look a bit busy but there's less on

00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:19,610
here in terms of we used to have roots

00:20:17,629 --> 00:20:21,350
and instances I think on this this view

00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:23,269
as well so we've tried to space things

00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:24,649
out a bit more and we've moved instances

00:20:23,269 --> 00:20:26,389
and groups if their own tabs that you

00:20:24,649 --> 00:20:29,720
can see across the top so this gives you

00:20:26,389 --> 00:20:31,580
a summary of the app as at home we've

00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:33,019
tried to get a bit more information here

00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:34,610
than we used to have around uptime and

00:20:33,019 --> 00:20:36,350
the average admin across your app

00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:39,470
instances then for instances you've got

00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:41,750
and we've used these status indicators

00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:43,309
on the cards to try and draw you to

00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:45,169
where there may be an issue you look at

00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:48,169
so here it's all green in other cases it

00:20:45,169 --> 00:20:51,289
could be red or orange I've got a bill

00:20:48,169 --> 00:20:54,110
pack info and come on deployment shortly

00:20:51,289 --> 00:20:57,080
I've got links to the cloud foundry and

00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:59,899
open spaces in so if you've got multiple

00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:02,299
countries registered you can easily jump

00:20:59,899 --> 00:21:04,039
in and go to the appropriate place to

00:21:02,299 --> 00:21:06,110
look at other apps and information

00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:08,389
within that space or country and I'll

00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:10,909
show that in a sec so as I've mentioned

00:21:08,389 --> 00:21:12,470
we've moved things like instances into

00:21:10,909 --> 00:21:17,509
their own tab again using this card

00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:19,429
layout so I can get more simple stats I

00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:21,649
guess against the instances I can see

00:21:19,429 --> 00:21:26,509
the states of instances it's easier now

00:21:21,649 --> 00:21:27,769
to kind of scale the app so that we're

00:21:26,509 --> 00:21:30,760
going to scale the up and tell me you're

00:21:27,769 --> 00:21:33,409
scaling and I'll see those starting if

00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:34,010
any of this is crashing then you know

00:21:33,409 --> 00:21:35,810
you'll get nice

00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:38,270
datas if any of them was going over its

00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:41,360
memory disk or CPU you'll see orange or

00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:43,280
red as it goes in fresh thresholds so

00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:47,180
that's the embrace improvements on the

00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:48,410
one root is broken out here this because

00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:51,350
you'd expect you can view and manage

00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:53,540
roots you can add a root that didn't

00:21:51,350 --> 00:22:05,900
have a TCP domain add a TCP domain then

00:21:53,540 --> 00:22:07,370
you could create these root as well so

00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:09,680
pretty much basic stuff together

00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:12,770
Christmas stuff a long stream you can

00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:15,950
stream that in the UI it's just the a

00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:17,480
block stream as it goes services this

00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:19,460
probably doesn't have any substance

00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:21,860
sister to see them here I can add a new

00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:23,840
one I'll show that for announced for in

00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:26,900
a second you can see the variables for

00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,920
your app you can see recent events you

00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:30,080
can obviously add variables on the

00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:31,670
rebels page so that's allows you to

00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,860
manage most things around your

00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:35,900
application you can go up here and edit

00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:38,030
the app so you can change its name from

00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:39,320
here you can also scale up or down

00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:42,370
change the disk quota

00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:46,040
you know enable SSH that kind of stuff I

00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:50,210
can choose to delete it if I was to do

00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:51,620
that I can select some of the dependent

00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:53,450
parts of the application if I want to

00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:55,460
delete those as well so this has three

00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:57,140
weeks bound to it so I could also choose

00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:59,450
to delete all of those routes at the

00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:01,280
same time or choose not to and equal if

00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:05,150
had service instances I'd see the same

00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:07,850
sort of thing restart its or just stop

00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:09,020
it so quickly going back one of the

00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:12,110
other sort of things we have is the

00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:15,940
ability to for an app so this is the

00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:19,700
sort of same as CF push but from the UI

00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:23,600
so we support letting you deploy from

00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:24,980
github or and I would free get URL or an

00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:28,730
application archive file or folder

00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:32,150
that's local on your system maybe try

00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:36,830
one of these for fun so I chose my file

00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:40,640
I can choose an app so I've got go and

00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:42,620
that is it I can select that it won't

00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:45,320
quit you look at the what's in there

00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:46,940
what's in there look at the file give me

00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:48,620
a size nice it's a zip I

00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:50,450
next that's very quick it's on the

00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:53,180
uploading 70k that's uploaded to our

00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:55,130
back-end and I'm ready to do a deploy so

00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:58,430
hit deploy and it's going to do the

00:23:55,130 --> 00:24:01,430
equipment CF push so we do use the CF CF

00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:02,930
CLI code as part of this was not we're

00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:05,240
not doing anything different to what CF

00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:06,650
push would do it's exactly the same code

00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:09,050
path we'll just invoking it through

00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:11,090
through our back-end and I can either

00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:12,980
wait for that to go or go take a look at

00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:18,130
that app so you can see while it's

00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:18,130
deploying it's in staging status and

00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:22,250
because I really had to go and deploy

00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:23,330
this effect there we deploy so you can

00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:26,210
see I've already got some information

00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:27,770
here and you can see the deployment info

00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:32,120
tells me that it was deploy for a local

00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:43,520
file I can go back and real quick I'll

00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:45,560
deploy I can change the branch if I

00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:48,980
deployed some quick app from github

00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:51,110
I can open the project in a new tab just

00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:53,870
to make sure it's the right one now I

00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:57,380
can this is different in v2 v1 I can't

00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:59,390
use a particular did use a particular

00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:07,160
commit to deploy from so I could go back

00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:08,810
a committed way from there and then once

00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:13,540
it's actually started deploy and we've

00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:22,910
got the application it should light up

00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:29,140
in this case I close so I should see

00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:29,140
it's here there is CF quick out I did

00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:33,950
okay so that's the point what I want to

00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:35,900
choose when I go through github you can

00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:39,830
see there's deployment info here and

00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:40,940
we've also added a github tab so this

00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:43,490
gives you some information about where

00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:45,560
you deployed it from what we do is we

00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:48,140
add a variable to the project that we

00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:51,740
can read back and use to populate this

00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:53,570
so I can see where this was deployed

00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:55,550
from and I can also then look at the

00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:58,700
commit list and if I wish to update it I

00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:59,120
can choose to deploy from that new or

00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:01,400
late

00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:03,200
commit so just you know just some tools

00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:05,480
to make it easy for developers to to

00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:09,830
maybe push apps directly from God or

00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:12,220
from a local archive we do little things

00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:15,380
like provide CLI info that's

00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:17,420
contextualized based on where you are in

00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:18,860
the UI in other words it will fill out

00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:20,600
the appropriate bits depending on what

00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:24,170
you're looking at so it's just there to

00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:26,720
help people I think that's probably it

00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:30,470
for apps you can see we're doing then

00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:32,270
the have been most useful stuff then the

00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:34,970
sort of stuff you added more recently is

00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:38,210
around services so we've spit out the

00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:39,590
the marketplace which is yes its

00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:41,980
catalogue from the actual services or

00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:43,970
service instances so here we're

00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:47,440
presenting a cart view so this is all

00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:50,150
fairly new and different to what's in v1

00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,230
so you can see all the services in the

00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:52,820
same way that you can see all the

00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:54,860
applications and these are aggregated

00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:55,760
across all of the cloud factories so I

00:26:54,860 --> 00:27:00,290
could choose to look in a different

00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:01,700
cloud foundry working looking all of

00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:03,020
course all of them and I can see search

00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:05,900
by main for the particular one I'm

00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:08,330
looking for you can drill down to those

00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:11,330
get a bit more information I see Emily

00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:12,740
service plans they they have see if

00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:16,880
there can't be any instances of that

00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:18,679
service you can also go into service

00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,840
instances and see all of the service

00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:23,330
instances that you have across all your

00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:24,890
cloud boundaries again you can filter

00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:27,110
down just as with applications to look

00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:29,900
at account from your space or do a

00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:33,290
search these are all junky test ones but

00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:35,270
um from here you can edit or delete a

00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:37,250
service instance you've got here and

00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:40,400
create let me definitely actually you

00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:41,929
can the marketplace you can create from

00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:44,510
various places so from the service

00:27:41,929 --> 00:27:46,100
instances you can create one from from

00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:48,200
here you can drill down into one if you

00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:49,940
like create one and so you won't have to

00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:53,840
select which service you're interested

00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:57,880
in so I can pick one I can see all the

00:27:53,840 --> 00:28:01,070
plans there's a bad once it's not free

00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:02,780
but I can I can go through I can choose

00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:05,120
an app 2.0 optionally and then I can

00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:11,530
creative so maybe if I chose someone

00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:11,530
like simple office Kayla sorry service

00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:40,770
pick that and I should see the test so

00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:43,380
citizens it's got no applications

00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:45,240
attached so this whole UI around the

00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:46,950
marketplace and services is his muses

00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:49,830
said in the previous view when we we had

00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:52,380
some basic stuff it really was some very

00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:54,420
basically compress into this this is

00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:56,370
stuff we want to build up further as we

00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:59,640
move beyond to it but it's hope it's a

00:28:56,370 --> 00:29:00,810
good starting place and then lastly you

00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:05,700
know we have a bunch of UI around

00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:07,710
CloudFactory itself so with most of

00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:10,440
these things if you have only one cloud

00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:12,900
foundry connection into the system we

00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:14,790
will optimize the UI a little bit so you

00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:16,950
won't see a selection page like this but

00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:19,230
I have three so if I click on cloud 4

00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:20,850
enjoy get see all three and I can you

00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:22,380
know pick one I'm interested in and we

00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:25,020
get this kind of view so again this is

00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:27,210
different to be one we're trying to do

00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:28,260
the same thing of using the cards to the

00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:30,030
highlight some of the more important

00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:32,190
information and bring that to be able to

00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:34,230
attention so you kind of get some review

00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:35,490
showing you the basic information maybe

00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:36,690
some of the recent apps that are updated

00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:40,110
with their status

00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:42,240
I can shortcut click through these cards

00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:44,670
to get me to say the August tab to see

00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:47,100
all the organizations I've got I can

00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:49,080
drill down into and all and see all the

00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:51,680
spaces same kind of thing see where I am

00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:55,350
against my quotas see what my role is

00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:57,750
look at the spaces I can delete I did

00:29:55,350 --> 00:30:00,270
spaces clicking fit space itself and see

00:29:57,750 --> 00:30:03,090
the same kind of view in terms of my

00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:04,550
quilt usage for a space and then when

00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:06,750
you get down to the space you can also

00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:11,010
look at all the applications and

00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:12,840
services online there but you can you

00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:14,970
can view those across just that spaces a

00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:18,300
slightly different view for that the

00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:19,410
other thing we've added in v2 which we

00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:21,600
had in v1 but I think we've done a

00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:23,190
better job this time around is some of

00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,860
the user management or at least be able

00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:28,850
to assign user roles across

00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:31,910
the auction spaces so you can you can go

00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:35,690
any user you can choose their roles

00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:38,180
across organizations and then spaces so

00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:42,020
it makes it much easier to to do that I

00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:43,640
think and what we do this better than v1

00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:44,780
is we show you this kind of summary view

00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:47,000
of what is going to happen you know

00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:48,440
you're going to add to these roles to

00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,150
this user and if I was removing they

00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:52,660
might see removal and then when I have

00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:54,560
hi you would see it and we're away and

00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:55,880
do them and it'll make sure it doesn't

00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:58,370
in the right order some of these have to

00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:00,020
be done in a particular order so it

00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:01,640
takes care of that for you and you can

00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:03,500
manage the users from various places

00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:04,550
again contextualized whatever you're

00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:08,600
looking at whether it's an author or a

00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:11,800
space so this gives me a kind of a view

00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:14,960
of you all users across my Cloud Foundry

00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:18,080
fires because I'm an admin we can look

00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:21,800
at photos and we can filter that down by

00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:24,740
the rest different types of information

00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:26,600
coming in we can then look at some basic

00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:28,130
stuff like that feature flags gimmicky

00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:31,160
social check they'll perhaps we've got

00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:32,540
which is facts so again this was Souza's

00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,770
Cloud Foundry so whatever local suits

00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:36,110
and we can look at the security groups

00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:37,790
so we don't let you do any editing of

00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:38,960
these yet that stuff we could add in but

00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:41,360
for now at least give you the kind of

00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:45,530
the ability to read we will view those

00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:47,540
from the UI and it's worth saying that

00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:50,480
with all of this we do kind of retrieve

00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:51,860
the permissions from the kind of back

00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,750
end for the cloud frames you are looking

00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:55,760
at and make sure that what the user is

00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:57,110
presented with is only applicable for

00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,760
the Commission's they have obviously the

00:31:57,110 --> 00:32:00,470
API would gate them from not being able

00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:02,510
to do stuff they can't do but we make

00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:05,690
sure that what you see in the UI is only

00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:09,170
what you're allowed to do and so

00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:11,630
hopefully that was a funny Whistlestop

00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:15,890
tour of the UI where we're getting this

00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:18,320
in place as I said the v2 so at least do

00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:19,970
what b1 does what it does and it does a

00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:23,030
bunch more as well and then we'll be

00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:25,280
really moving on to looking at the next

00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:26,990
set of function I to add in so we're

00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:28,670
trying to get the kind of you know

00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:29,120
sprint Lee to weekly releases where

00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:32,110
we'll be doing

00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:34,850
point releases to kind of steam along

00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:37,610
we're starting to see more kind of

00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:38,540
uptake as documents are suggested so

00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:40,490
we've got lots of people from

00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:42,410
organizations which is great coming on

00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:45,950
board either just to use the UI which

00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:47,960
which we love and in some cases doing

00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:48,380
PRS and helping us out which is great

00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:51,260
too

00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:55,220
so if you are interested go take a look

00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:58,340
at our github page gives a star

00:32:55,220 --> 00:33:04,850
join us like channel so we have a snack

00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:06,710
channel in the CF X FAQ deployment hash

00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:08,000
Stratus to join that and you'll find the

00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:10,430
team so if you've got any questions for

00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,060
me other team then then find us there we

00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:15,260
do do a monthly sort of status call

00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:16,820
which is advertising that slack channel

00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:18,020
as well where we kind of go through this

00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:20,540
kind of stuff of what we've been up to

00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:23,120
and do demos appropriate and we

00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:25,490
published sort of weekly status updates

00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:29,480
as to still what's been happening in the

00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:31,790
tech 13 so hopefully that was was useful

00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:35,140
as I said if you got any questions reach

00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:35,140
out to me and I'd be happy to help

00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:41,900
thank you thank you so much I don't

00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:45,220
think we have too much time for

00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:45,220
questions but it there's a quick

00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:51,480
question why Thank You Neil I have no I

00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:52,800
mean this is amazing every time I see it

00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:55,020
it gets better and better and it also

00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:57,000
used it works on your iPhone guys you

00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:57,630
want to try to use it there it's pretty

00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:03,300
amazing

00:33:57,630 --> 00:34:06,770
okay so Nima maybe if you can unmute

00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:06,770
yourself sing something and then you can

00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:11,730
so Nima will show us block it and it

00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:16,950
will talk about the project

00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:19,080
do you guys hear yes yeah okay perfect

00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:21,840
so let me just show you my screen and

00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:23,399
then we can get to it and hopefully I'll

00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:26,340
be able to squeeze squeeze and

00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:33,060
everything that I've been planning to

00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:38,070
present in the remaining time all right

00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:40,710
do you guys see my screen yeah cuckoo

00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:42,390
okay so I'm gonna present project

00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:44,399
blockhead and for those of you who don't

00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:46,350
know project blockhead was in fact like

00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:48,320
the project that we did four day

00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:51,090
hackathon and see if some imposter and

00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:53,669
the initial idea was that we wanted to

00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:56,660
quickly enable people who use clarified

00:34:53,669 --> 00:34:59,190
real kubernetes to also benefit from and

00:34:56,660 --> 00:35:00,660
you know blockchain and you know deploy

00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:03,840
their applications and integrated with

00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:05,340
the blockchain and after the hackathon

00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:07,080
there was quite a lot of interest from

00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:11,190
people wanting to know how these things

00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:12,210
work and so as more people got

00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:14,820
interested we thought that we could

00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:16,440
submit the project as a CF extension

00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:18,000
project and hopefully continue working

00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:20,850
on it and making it available for the

00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,640
community to also you know experiment

00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:25,920
with it and give us feedback so let's

00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:29,010
get to it how do you code for blockchain

00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:30,750
like if you want to deploy what the

00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:33,060
blockchain application you need to do

00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:34,650
quite a bit for your application to be

00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:37,010
up and running first of all you need to

00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:39,510
write contracts and contracts for

00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:41,490
especially for block chains that are

00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:43,200
based on EPM or a theory and virtual

00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:46,530
machine needs to be written in a

00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:48,000
language called solidity and if you have

00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:49,440
your contract returned then you need to

00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,060
bring up this standalone a theory of

00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,650
node and then you have to create an

00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:55,230
account on it and then you have to

00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:56,850
deploy your contract you have to compile

00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:58,890
it and then deploy your contract and

00:35:56,850 --> 00:36:00,720
they get the interface for the contract

00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:03,480
back integrated into your app okay

00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:05,099
and only then you you get to a point

00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:06,810
where you can actually start developing

00:36:05,099 --> 00:36:08,760
your and you know know the application

00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:11,339
of whatever type of application that you

00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:13,230
want to deploy to watch so these steps

00:36:11,339 --> 00:36:14,460
are actually complicated and there's

00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:16,260
quite a bit of knowledge that is

00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:18,630
required for you know a typical

00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:20,099
deployment doing developer to have in

00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:23,670
order to be able to deploy applications

00:36:20,099 --> 00:36:25,829
to launch so what is a project block

00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:28,050
with project block and what we try to do

00:36:25,829 --> 00:36:30,450
was to have a solution for all these

00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:33,210
challenges that I went over earlier so

00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:36,420
we wanted to enable web 3d application

00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:38,579
developers to be able to easily do more

00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:41,520
easily develop applications for Andrea

00:36:38,579 --> 00:36:43,349
kubernetes and and you know integrated

00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:46,050
with blockchain networks we wanted to

00:36:43,349 --> 00:36:48,810
simplify and manage the lifecycle of a

00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:51,089
theory of nodes or blockchain knows as a

00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:53,250
as a whole and also we wanted to be able

00:36:51,089 --> 00:36:56,220
to manage the lifecycle of contracts and

00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:58,050
that you deploy to these nodes also we

00:36:56,220 --> 00:37:00,569
wanted to make it available for

00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:02,910
production so that you can and deploy

00:37:00,569 --> 00:37:05,550
and integrate with a public blockchain

00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:08,160
and then also deploy your application in

00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:09,839
production and benefit from all the good

00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,460
things that you know platforms like

00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:13,109
kubernetes and Platt and Clark that we

00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:15,390
offer in terms of scaling your

00:37:13,109 --> 00:37:18,450
application and debugging your

00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:21,210
application and all sorts of good stuff

00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:23,310
that we have with these problems also we

00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:24,900
wanted to make better web 3 application

00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:26,160
development and blockchain application

00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:27,960
there will be an agnostic at the

00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,579
blockchain network so right now as I

00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:32,609
mentioned it works me the etherium but

00:37:29,579 --> 00:37:35,550
that doesn't mean that it has to use it

00:37:32,609 --> 00:37:37,440
area it can and it should potentially

00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:39,750
down the road support any blockchain

00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,130
network and your nodes for any block

00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:44,069
shape should be able to connect to the

00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:48,270
rest of the nodes and basically help you

00:37:44,069 --> 00:37:49,920
deploy contracts ok so the way we did it

00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:51,630
was that we developed a service broker

00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,859
and block it is a service broker and

00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:54,450
through the interactions with the

00:37:52,859 --> 00:37:56,339
service broker we actually allow for

00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:58,859
management to the large circular bit

00:37:56,339 --> 00:38:00,990
node any contract so how do you start

00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:03,240
the standalone blockchain node when you

00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:06,329
create a service in block it it actually

00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:08,400
brings up a node tree and it also as it

00:38:06,329 --> 00:38:11,880
brings over a node it creates a contract

00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,859
and then and it makes that contract a

00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:15,289
bit

00:38:12,859 --> 00:38:17,269
sorry I mean an account it creates an

00:38:15,289 --> 00:38:20,089
account and makes that account available

00:38:17,269 --> 00:38:21,859
for you and then as if you want to

00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:24,920
deploy a contract all you need to do is

00:38:21,859 --> 00:38:27,349
to bind your service with the reference

00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:30,079
to your contract into your blockchain

00:38:27,349 --> 00:38:31,700
node and when that happens your contract

00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:33,680
gets compiled and then gets deployed

00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:35,749
into the node use it they can that was

00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:37,880
created in the previous step and then it

00:38:35,749 --> 00:38:40,069
provides all the information for how to

00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:41,809
interact with the contract as we kept a

00:38:40,069 --> 00:38:43,519
modeling variables to the application so

00:38:41,809 --> 00:38:46,969
the application can actually point to it

00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:49,759
and start music okay so that was a very

00:38:46,969 --> 00:38:51,170
quick rundown and because I'm short in

00:38:49,759 --> 00:38:52,849
time I'm just gonna jump into the demo

00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:57,950
and show to you guys how this thing

00:38:52,849 --> 00:39:00,140
works and so hopefully you see see my

00:38:57,950 --> 00:39:02,109
screen and hopefully demo gods are gonna

00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:05,959
be with me and this thing's gonna work

00:39:02,109 --> 00:39:07,819
so let's have a look if we looked at the

00:39:05,959 --> 00:39:10,759
number of IBM's that I've deployed I've

00:39:07,819 --> 00:39:12,920
deployed our broker start to side with

00:39:10,759 --> 00:39:15,140
12 foundry so you see I have all the

00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:17,269
values running but I have these two

00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:19,279
extra VMs running for the darker broker

00:39:17,269 --> 00:39:21,109
deployment which is like the darker VM

00:39:19,279 --> 00:39:24,349
in the subway and one thing that I

00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:26,150
forgot to mention is that we built the

00:39:24,349 --> 00:39:29,869
initial weighted version of block hit

00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:32,690
broker on top of the class boundary

00:39:29,869 --> 00:39:34,699
docker broker service broker that was

00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:39,499
initially submitted to the client the

00:39:34,699 --> 00:39:42,529
community by dr. Nick and his team so

00:39:39,499 --> 00:39:45,349
the doctor broker in fact brings up a

00:39:42,529 --> 00:39:47,479
docker and container and then we use

00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:49,219
that docker container to bring up any

00:39:47,479 --> 00:39:53,329
theory and connect that if you you know

00:39:49,219 --> 00:39:55,069
to the network so on the right you see

00:39:53,329 --> 00:39:57,199
that I'm connected to that darker beer

00:39:55,069 --> 00:39:58,880
in our deployment and this is where the

00:39:57,199 --> 00:40:01,579
docker agent is running so initially if

00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,959
I run docker PS no docker container is

00:40:01,579 --> 00:40:05,449
running here which basically means that

00:40:02,959 --> 00:40:10,579
there is no etherium not running either

00:40:05,449 --> 00:40:12,049
so if I look at the marketplace and for

00:40:10,579 --> 00:40:14,749
my cloud foundry deployment I've already

00:40:12,049 --> 00:40:16,579
and created the marketplace and I've

00:40:14,749 --> 00:40:18,769
already added my service so you see the

00:40:16,579 --> 00:40:21,259
state theorem services available and the

00:40:18,769 --> 00:40:22,910
plan is free so what I'm gonna do is I'm

00:40:21,259 --> 00:40:25,309
gonna create an instance of that service

00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:26,090
and I'm gonna call it simple so where

00:40:25,309 --> 00:40:28,700
that happens

00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:31,310
almost once the service gets created if

00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:33,910
I go back to the doctor VM and do a dr.

00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:36,410
PS you see that now I have a docker

00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:38,270
container running and if you're familiar

00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:41,030
with ethereal node you see that the

00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:42,980
ports for the get node which is the

00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:44,780
etherium node implementation in go are

00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:48,590
exposed on the hospital

00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:58,220
so let's actually see what's happening

00:40:48,590 --> 00:41:10,520
with that doc you can take their connect

00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:14,600
to it until their logs it's cool okay so

00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:17,930
you see it started at nany theorem node

00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:20,090
right now it runs it in dev mode and I

00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:21,320
explain later on whites in dev mode but

00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:24,380
you see that it started the mining

00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:25,820
operation and so on on the Left I'm

00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:27,110
gonna push on application and it's a

00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:29,570
very application that we've already

00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:32,270
deployed so I'm gonna do is see of

00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:35,270
course it's a simple polling application

00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:38,290
basically but just for voting so I'm

00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:41,270
going to push it in a no start node and

00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:43,130
then once the application is pushed I

00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:47,650
can bind it to the service that I just

00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:47,650
created and it will see what happens

00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:56,230
cool the application has been closed

00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:02,230
you

00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:04,420
you

00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:09,800
laptops gets a little bit slow and I'm

00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:13,370
sharing my screens and so that would

00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:15,530
mean here is this thing it's thing and

00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:17,750
this all also works on kubernetes right

00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:20,030
like in terms of growing the poker and

00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:24,320
using it yeah the broker can be deployed

00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:26,570
and can can use kubernetes as well it

00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:29,150
cannot be deployed on kubernetes as a

00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:31,790
standalone and because there are some

00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:33,590
complications with docker sockets and

00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:35,510
stuff what we're working on making it

00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:37,760
actually be fully deployed on kubernetes

00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:41,660
but you can deploy it side by side and

00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:43,280
integrated as a as the service into

00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:46,930
kubernetes and you did use it with

00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,930
kubernetes application students

00:42:48,829 --> 00:42:53,119
cool and as we're waiting for at that

00:42:50,569 --> 00:42:55,849
time I know we chatted and slag that

00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:59,119
you're gonna submit the extension today

00:42:55,849 --> 00:43:00,619
the proposal so we're gonna try to pass

00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:02,239
rack that so that we can hopefully

00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:05,869
people that are interested can join the

00:43:02,239 --> 00:43:08,869
project is that yeah that's that's a

00:43:05,869 --> 00:43:12,079
plan and we have the project proposal

00:43:08,869 --> 00:43:13,130
ready ready so hopefully after after the

00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:15,799
stock I'm going to share it with

00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:17,660
everyone and you know feedback so

00:43:15,799 --> 00:43:20,390
definitely welcome and you can go

00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:22,279
through it and we're more than happy to

00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:26,150
open it to the community and a little

00:43:22,279 --> 00:43:29,390
bit contribute you okay cool so it looks

00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:31,369
like my application is pushed now what

00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:34,519
I'm gonna do is that I'm going to bind

00:43:31,369 --> 00:43:36,890
this service that I created initially to

00:43:34,519 --> 00:43:39,019
the application and as you can see the

00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:40,789
way I pass in a contract is through the

00:43:39,019 --> 00:43:45,140
contract URL so this contract you're a

00:43:40,789 --> 00:43:46,789
pole that soul is a solidity contract

00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:50,839
like a simple solidity contract that

00:43:46,789 --> 00:43:54,549
allows for voting and as I push as I

00:43:50,839 --> 00:43:57,140
find the service to my pull application

00:43:54,549 --> 00:43:59,390
the URL of the key of the contract is

00:43:57,140 --> 00:44:01,130
communicated to the broker and you're

00:43:59,390 --> 00:44:03,039
gonna see here that the contract is

00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:05,989
going to be pulled on this docker

00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:07,910
container and then it's going to be

00:44:05,989 --> 00:44:10,519
compiled and it's going to be deployed

00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:13,309
on the container and we're gonna get the

00:44:10,519 --> 00:44:15,259
contract address back and you'll see the

00:44:13,309 --> 00:44:16,819
transaction hat on this side so right

00:44:15,259 --> 00:44:18,199
now it's compiling it's it's actually

00:44:16,819 --> 00:44:20,180
pulling the contract on the docker

00:44:18,199 --> 00:44:22,309
container and compiling it what's the

00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:23,449
completion it's done it deploys it into

00:44:22,309 --> 00:44:30,079
the node there you go

00:44:23,449 --> 00:44:32,180
so you see let's see I think that the

00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:36,289
binding was successful man let me see my

00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:42,289
I believe that the contract if I do see

00:44:36,289 --> 00:44:44,509
if and cool you're gonna be able to okay

00:44:42,289 --> 00:44:48,410
let's try to find it again I feel like

00:44:44,509 --> 00:44:50,920
it's violet but I think you know my

00:44:48,410 --> 00:44:54,430
shame my teachers parking lot just

00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:56,490
rotating play again

00:44:54,430 --> 00:44:56,490
you

00:44:57,580 --> 00:44:59,640
you

00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,740
you

00:45:14,070 --> 00:45:18,480
cool so you see this time the binding is

00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:19,980
successful you see that the contract is

00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,640
actually created and there's an address

00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:23,640
for it

00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:25,470
so if I do see if I pull and then you

00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:27,810
see that you know the same contract

00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:31,230
address that we see on this side appears

00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:33,210
also as part of the the cab environment

00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:35,880
variables for the application also you

00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:39,090
see the API for the contract and this is

00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:41,580
what the application is going to use in

00:45:39,090 --> 00:45:44,520
order to be able to you basically point

00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:46,620
to the contract and to basically use the

00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:48,990
blockchain application so with all of

00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:50,370
this now we can start the application

00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:52,890
and the application as I mentioned is a

00:45:50,370 --> 00:45:54,570
simple polling application I can show

00:45:52,890 --> 00:45:57,570
you that in the application what we do

00:45:54,570 --> 00:46:00,630
is that we basically just read all those

00:45:57,570 --> 00:46:02,790
environment variables from the big cab

00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:04,410
services and my own variables and then

00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:08,670
use them in the application in order to

00:46:04,410 --> 00:46:12,900
point to the planchette and after okay

00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:16,110
so if I do see if the start for let's

00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:18,320
see hopefully let's start successfully

00:46:16,110 --> 00:46:18,320
to

00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:27,210
you

00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:27,210
you

00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:32,650
so while this is doing this I want to go

00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:36,470
over some of the details of what you get

00:46:32,650 --> 00:46:38,570
when you do compile your contract you

00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:41,000
see the API is the application binary

00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:45,320
interface and this is and the interface

00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:47,900
that the web 3 J's library for aetherium

00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:51,760
uses in order to send data and receive

00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:54,680
data from the from the etherium knot and

00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:56,960
aetherium node is actually using like I

00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:59,690
think an RPC communication that there

00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:01,850
were three J's library uses for

00:46:59,690 --> 00:47:04,610
communication with the contract and the

00:47:01,850 --> 00:47:07,550
address is the address of the account

00:47:04,610 --> 00:47:09,560
that we created for the user on the fly

00:47:07,550 --> 00:47:12,170
and the contract address is the address

00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:14,300
of the deployed contract basically for

00:47:12,170 --> 00:47:16,670
which the API is returned so with all of

00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:18,740
that then the application has all the

00:47:16,670 --> 00:47:19,790
information requires in order to

00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:21,470
communicate with the blockchain

00:47:19,790 --> 00:47:26,900
application and be the blockchain

00:47:21,470 --> 00:47:28,700
network so generally like because it's a

00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:30,910
node application it takes quite some

00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:36,620
time for everything to be downloaded and

00:47:30,910 --> 00:47:39,740
for everything to be up and running so I

00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:40,910
think as this process is going I can

00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:46,160
take on any questions if you have

00:47:40,910 --> 00:47:49,330
anything otherwise we could just wait

00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:49,330
for this thing to go through

00:47:57,290 --> 00:47:59,350
you

00:47:59,890 --> 00:48:01,950
you

00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:11,930
and NEMA just I guess just time since

00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:14,060
it's dead time right now you mean to do

00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:16,010
those what contract it could be any of

00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:18,110
this much contract that are available

00:48:16,010 --> 00:48:21,230
totally key right now that people have

00:48:18,110 --> 00:48:24,560
created right the BBC once right I don't

00:48:21,230 --> 00:48:26,480
want so is it yes so the smart contract

00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:27,800
basically don't want that we the one

00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,880
that I pass in is the one that is

00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:30,800
written specifically for this

00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:33,170
application but you can bring your

00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:35,600
contract and to the broker and use it

00:48:33,170 --> 00:48:37,760
with the broker basically any contract

00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:42,490
that is available on the internet and

00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:42,490
has like a public URL associated to it

00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:49,720
being binding the service and the

00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:51,520
contract will be downloaded by the

00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:53,670
broker and will be compiled at Weebly

00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:55,840
deployed to a node on the fly and then

00:48:53,670 --> 00:49:00,850
becomes available to the application

00:48:55,840 --> 00:49:02,140
that you find the service to in fact

00:49:00,850 --> 00:49:03,760
what we try to do as part of the

00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:05,470
hackathon project was that we created a

00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:07,210
marketplace where we uploaded some of

00:49:05,470 --> 00:49:09,010
these contracts into a marketplace and

00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:11,320
users could go and search for the

00:49:09,010 --> 00:49:12,400
contracts that they require so one of

00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:13,869
the promises is that you don't

00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:16,270
necessarily need to write your own

00:49:13,869 --> 00:49:18,520
contract and especially because reading

00:49:16,270 --> 00:49:19,810
and writing contracts in this solid if

00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:22,630
language may not be as a straightforward

00:49:19,810 --> 00:49:24,100
for everyone so in case there's a

00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:25,930
marketplace that you can go and search

00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:27,520
for it and choose whatever contract I do

00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:30,600
you require for the application and then

00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:30,600
bring it and bind it to your application

00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:37,359
in terms of next steps I mean I'm sure

00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:39,460
everybody will see some of those when

00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:42,369
you submit the proposal but can you talk

00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:44,920
about some of the next so I think I have

00:49:42,369 --> 00:49:46,510
so many systems in this slides and so

00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:55,630
maybe we can just go back and talk about

00:49:46,510 --> 00:49:57,369
me some of those movies okay so so

00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:58,780
generally the vision of this project is

00:49:57,369 --> 00:50:00,580
that as blockchain becomes a de-facto

00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:01,570
technology for trust less p2p

00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:04,780
transactions

00:50:01,570 --> 00:50:07,540
businesses should be able to and you

00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:09,220
know integrate seamlessly into using

00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:10,960
blogs and applications and deploy their

00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:12,760
contracts and AD apps in the cloud and

00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:14,260
benefit from all this scalability and

00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:15,850
all the good things I can't find rien

00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:18,880
communities on platforms like this offer

00:50:15,850 --> 00:50:20,680
and that's why they won't change so as

00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:24,310
part of the roadmap in the future what

00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:26,050
we want to do right now and the nodes

00:50:24,310 --> 00:50:28,420
that we creating blockchain are in

00:50:26,050 --> 00:50:32,170
developer mode and that's because it's

00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:34,390
quite difficult to nsync a blockchain

00:50:32,170 --> 00:50:36,400
node with the rest of the network right

00:50:34,390 --> 00:50:39,190
now for your theorem the size of the

00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:41,080
ledger is around 600 gigabytes so if you

00:50:39,190 --> 00:50:43,090
want to have like a full ledger on a

00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:45,490
docker container it's going to take

00:50:43,090 --> 00:50:48,700
quite a long time for the food syncing

00:50:45,490 --> 00:50:50,230
the ledger to happen and so for the

00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:51,460
hackathon particularly we chose to go

00:50:50,230 --> 00:50:53,890
with the dev mode because you don't need

00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:55,740
to do syncing but as part of the road

00:50:53,890 --> 00:50:57,550
now we want to make it possible for

00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:59,610
public

00:50:57,550 --> 00:51:03,490
block J networks to also be integrated

00:50:59,610 --> 00:51:04,870
all so as I mentioned the primary reason

00:51:03,490 --> 00:51:06,880
we're releasing you that the community

00:51:04,870 --> 00:51:08,230
project is we want to see feedback from

00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:09,490
people and want to see what the

00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:11,530
community thinks and whether this is

00:51:09,490 --> 00:51:13,600
something useful and how they want us to

00:51:11,530 --> 00:51:15,580
extend it as I mentioned we want to

00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:17,740
provide support for kubernetes and so

00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:19,180
that it can be deployed on kubernetes

00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:21,400
and be integrated with kubernetes

00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:24,760
applications we want to support other

00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:27,100
blockchain networks and Bitcoin cash is

00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:29,770
one of the targets also down the road we

00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:32,590
are planning to integrated with IBM

00:51:29,770 --> 00:51:35,350
fabric and also we want to make it work

00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:36,880
in production as a CF coop service and

00:51:35,350 --> 00:51:44,740
hopefully connect to the main net or the

00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:46,120
test net in those in Cloud Foundry we

00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:49,980
clarify three applications

00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:55,110
okay so let's restage this thing I think

00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:55,110
because yes

00:51:56,150 --> 00:52:01,040
so this is one of the problems that I

00:51:57,650 --> 00:52:04,250
have and I and dem on my laptop

00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:08,140
everything it's like super slow and then

00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:08,140
it comes back and then it goes again

00:52:39,910 --> 00:52:43,770
you

00:52:41,710 --> 00:52:43,770
you

00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:51,140
so going back to the room and I think

00:52:49,790 --> 00:52:52,730
these are some of the resources that I

00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:55,190
wanted to share this year of extension

00:52:52,730 --> 00:52:57,950
proposal I'm going to share it with

00:52:55,190 --> 00:52:59,630
everyone and also we wrote a blog post

00:52:57,950 --> 00:53:01,820
about the project we'd actually

00:52:59,630 --> 00:53:06,800
discipline explains whatever we did for

00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:10,880
the for the hackathon as well as all the

00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:12,740
resources also some of the repositories

00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:14,000
these are lockers all repositories for

00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:17,990
the code that we developed during

00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:20,420
hackathon that people can access as I

00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:23,420
said I'm going to share it with everyone

00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:27,190
after this demo if the demo collaborates

00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:27,190
and you know things move faster

00:53:30,459 --> 00:53:35,900
and right now the code for this is under

00:53:32,869 --> 00:53:37,729
your account but hopefully when it when

00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:43,209
it goes with us yep extensions will move

00:53:37,729 --> 00:53:43,209
it you and the baby right yeah yeah I

00:53:47,049 --> 00:53:50,719
don't know if anybody else have

00:53:48,979 --> 00:53:55,219
questions when you know as we're waiting

00:53:50,719 --> 00:54:02,689
for the absolutely stage if you're

00:53:55,219 --> 00:54:08,239
asking your knee yes I have a questions

00:54:02,689 --> 00:54:10,729
there on the on the right side what does

00:54:08,239 --> 00:54:14,299
it mean block ceiling failed waiting for

00:54:10,729 --> 00:54:17,089
transactions well it's it's it's in the

00:54:14,299 --> 00:54:19,759
dev right so the ceiling of the block is

00:54:17,089 --> 00:54:21,859
basically when it adds it to the there's

00:54:19,759 --> 00:54:24,169
there's two phases when then the ledger

00:54:21,859 --> 00:54:27,439
gets created so when a new transaction

00:54:24,169 --> 00:54:29,150
block comes in it actually keeps it in

00:54:27,439 --> 00:54:32,390
the memory and then it tries to append

00:54:29,150 --> 00:54:34,699
it to the into the blockchain and keep

00:54:32,390 --> 00:54:36,799
it on disk and the ceiling rent happens

00:54:34,699 --> 00:54:39,890
when whatever data is in the memory

00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:43,369
tries to be written in the desk and so I

00:54:39,890 --> 00:54:45,439
think because you know like things get

00:54:43,369 --> 00:54:47,059
really slow and really wonky when I run

00:54:45,439 --> 00:54:49,189
it on my laptop and do the demo at the

00:54:47,059 --> 00:54:50,479
same time so I'm thinking that the

00:54:49,189 --> 00:54:52,400
ceiling is failing because there's

00:54:50,479 --> 00:54:54,049
something wrong with writing it today to

00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:56,569
the disk on the doctor container at this

00:54:54,049 --> 00:54:58,969
one but that doesn't prevent you know

00:54:56,569 --> 00:55:02,269
like this going through and creating the

00:54:58,969 --> 00:55:04,059
blocks in memory so I think that's an

00:55:02,269 --> 00:55:06,619
error that we can't grow in for now and

00:55:04,059 --> 00:55:10,329
you see it's actually warning because it

00:55:06,619 --> 00:55:14,409
can't really write it today to do this

00:55:10,329 --> 00:55:14,409
okay thank you yeah

00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:18,820
you

00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:22,290
you

00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:31,930
another question was gonna ask is do you

00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:35,450
know of any similar workers because I I

00:55:31,930 --> 00:55:38,390
remember when I first reviewed puzzle I

00:55:35,450 --> 00:55:40,540
couldn't see any alternative to this

00:55:38,390 --> 00:55:42,500
this is pretty much the first of a kind

00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:46,760
it is yes

00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:48,710
so to the best of my knowledge and there

00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:50,690
are platforms and there are frameworks

00:55:48,710 --> 00:55:53,450
that allow for development of blockchain

00:55:50,690 --> 00:55:55,040
applications they bring up and noting

00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:58,160
the development of the Internet they

00:55:55,040 --> 00:56:00,080
allow developers to write the apps and

00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:03,020
connect them to the note but nothing

00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:04,880
that integrates lead and you know a past

00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:07,490
platform like clarify and we are Cuban

00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:08,810
edits and nothing that allows this level

00:56:07,490 --> 00:56:11,750
of integration and this level of

00:56:08,810 --> 00:56:13,280
lifecycle management for the notes so in

00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:16,050
that sense this is their first effort

00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:18,220
and in doing so

00:56:16,050 --> 00:56:21,610
[Music]

00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:24,730
yes but there are frameworks like for

00:56:21,610 --> 00:56:27,670
example truffle that allows for and you

00:56:24,730 --> 00:56:29,680
know blockchain application that I think

00:56:27,670 --> 00:56:31,330
the main benefit that we get from a

00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:34,800
service broker like this is that it

00:56:31,330 --> 00:56:37,720
really gets integrated into the you know

00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:38,950
full process of pushing an application

00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:40,750
and binding your services in cloud

00:56:38,950 --> 00:56:43,390
foundry and kubernetes so as these

00:56:40,750 --> 00:56:45,400
platforms actually see more momentum and

00:56:43,390 --> 00:56:47,440
you know more interest from people and

00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:49,570
as blockchain becomes more interesting I

00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:52,600
think the combination of the two 19cm

00:56:49,570 --> 00:56:58,300
for developers to test and deploy in a

00:56:52,600 --> 00:57:00,790
real world like my yeah and I can

00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:02,350
imagine that a blockchain solution is

00:57:00,790 --> 00:57:04,630
not going to be just adoption

00:57:02,350 --> 00:57:06,670
applications gotta be other applications

00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:09,040
and those are applications you already

00:57:06,670 --> 00:57:13,900
using boundary or kubernetes to build

00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:16,060
them so you can easily integrate the

00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:19,960
blockchain pieces into your workflow and

00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:25,510
make that simpler and yeah exactly

00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:27,870
thank you okay we have about two more

00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:31,860
minutes hopefully that works here but

00:57:27,870 --> 00:57:34,240
you know I think I also looked at your

00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:36,970
blog post which is really good I

00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:39,340
reviewed it it actually goes to all the

00:57:36,970 --> 00:57:42,070
steps too so people that are watching

00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:45,850
this and once you try to get more

00:57:42,070 --> 00:57:47,590
information into its that you yeah

00:57:45,850 --> 00:57:49,090
there's also a video recording of this

00:57:47,590 --> 00:57:50,800
entire thing so if you don't get to

00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:52,360
finish everything I can probably share

00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:54,400
that video with everyone and those who

00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:56,230
are interested can have a look at it as

00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:58,840
I said generally it's a lot faster when

00:57:56,230 --> 00:58:02,260
I don't and demo imprisoned at the same

00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:04,180
time and but if you don't manage to get

00:58:02,260 --> 00:58:05,920
to the end of it today like you can look

00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:09,040
at the video and get a sense of how

00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:10,480
things work and hopefully that gives you

00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:14,940
a better understanding though I'm with

00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:14,940
there yeah I fingers crossed right

00:58:15,630 --> 00:58:22,590
that's hope all right I'm waiting for

00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:22,590
out to start let's see

00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:37,830
so the staging is done that's a good

00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:39,960
thing so this is this didn't proceed to

00:58:37,830 --> 00:58:41,640
finish the staging and last time we

00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:42,210
tried so it does time at least staging

00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:43,860
it's done

00:58:42,210 --> 00:58:46,490
hopefully the app is going to start

00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:46,490
successfully

00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:55,620
you

00:58:55,690 --> 00:58:57,750
you

00:59:00,329 --> 00:59:09,040
you guys intend to have a slack channel

00:59:02,730 --> 00:59:10,930
you know so we do yes alright so it

00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:16,960
looks like the app is it started so if I

00:59:10,930 --> 00:59:18,750
go to pull Bosh like on you see they

00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:20,829
care about that be just deployed

00:59:18,750 --> 00:59:37,319
hopefully this actually responds pretty

00:59:20,829 --> 00:59:37,319
quickly to everything is not

00:59:47,630 --> 00:59:54,240
can you share the link to of your slides

00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:56,040
in slack absolutely yeah I'll show you

00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:58,890
like - there you go so the app is

00:59:56,040 --> 01:00:00,360
running on you see if I click on this so

00:59:58,890 --> 01:00:02,250
this is a simple vote in yep as I

01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:06,180
mentioned but if I vote for dogs and

01:00:02,250 --> 01:00:08,010
submit you see what happens is we did a

01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:09,450
world and we get a transaction that

01:00:08,010 --> 01:00:12,000
actually writes to the block sharing

01:00:09,450 --> 01:00:14,130
with that number that we had so now the

01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:16,050
value for dogs actually gots incremented

01:00:14,130 --> 01:00:18,420
by one and the data is registered in the

01:00:16,050 --> 01:00:25,220
blockchain so now if I open a different

01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:25,220
session and go to the same application

01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:33,210
let's see and okay so hold that bottle

01:00:30,540 --> 01:00:37,770
icon they say our application comes up

01:00:33,210 --> 01:00:39,630
and this time I again vote for dogs and

01:00:37,770 --> 01:00:44,820
let me actually write this side-by-side

01:00:39,630 --> 01:00:46,680
we'd be at this one so you see that as I

01:00:44,820 --> 01:00:49,710
press submit the transaction comes in

01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:52,290
and gets written to the blockchain so if

01:00:49,710 --> 01:00:53,670
you submit it you see that the

01:00:52,290 --> 01:00:55,350
transaction gets registered to the

01:00:53,670 --> 01:00:57,300
blockchain and this time the value is

01:00:55,350 --> 01:00:58,650
two because I already wrote it so it

01:00:57,300 --> 01:01:00,030
reads the previous value from the

01:00:58,650 --> 01:01:02,550
blockchain which is the one that we

01:01:00,030 --> 01:01:05,640
voted first and then I walk to it I'd

01:01:02,550 --> 01:01:09,900
write it back to the day today and today

01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:11,220
launching so this is basically like a

01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:12,600
very simple interaction of the

01:01:11,220 --> 01:01:13,980
application with the blockchain but you

01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:15,930
can do tons of stuff with it right you

01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:18,030
can create a lot more complex contracts

01:01:15,930 --> 01:01:20,160
and you can do the integration one thing

01:01:18,030 --> 01:01:22,260
that is important is that if I read the

01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:23,730
results you don't see any transactions

01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:25,380
happening with the blockchain but if I

01:01:23,730 --> 01:01:28,260
write to the block and you see the

01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:31,230
transactions happening so again if I

01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:33,390
restart and if I vote again and you see

01:01:31,230 --> 01:01:35,160
that changes again and this time I'm

01:01:33,390 --> 01:01:37,800
going to vote for cats so that you see

01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:41,000
actually let's open a new one because I

01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:41,000
think this for mommy denies me

01:01:41,410 --> 01:01:51,090
oh gosh like on I think I stay with

01:01:54,270 --> 01:01:57,960
gosh - light

01:02:02,090 --> 01:02:06,910
cool so again I'm voting for

01:02:05,349 --> 01:02:08,680
making sure that you know if you're just

01:02:06,910 --> 01:02:12,849
putting off the spaces here so that you

01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:14,589
see that actually once again there you

01:02:12,849 --> 01:02:16,569
go and there's got to go screw dogs

01:02:14,589 --> 01:02:17,710
won't work for kid any new transactions

01:02:16,569 --> 01:02:20,019
happening on the block sure

01:02:17,710 --> 01:02:21,819
so that's the demo so forth a little bit

01:02:20,019 --> 01:02:25,450
of lag it's usually a lot faster than

01:02:21,819 --> 01:02:28,930
that's my screen but I think that can I

01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:30,940
think included demo so I'm gonna stock

01:02:28,930 --> 01:02:32,319
share at this point and make things a

01:02:30,940 --> 01:02:34,029
little bit fun yeah well thank you

01:02:32,319 --> 01:02:36,489
everybody I think we're just in time

01:02:34,029 --> 01:02:41,410
actually so thanks everybody

01:02:36,489 --> 01:02:43,599
I guess we will reconvene on July 18 for

01:02:41,410 --> 01:02:46,359
the July capital and look for a Nima's

01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:50,369
