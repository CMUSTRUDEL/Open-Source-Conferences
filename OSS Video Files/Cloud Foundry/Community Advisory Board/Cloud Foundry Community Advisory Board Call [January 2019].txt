	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,359
these summit so it's really all around

00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:09,929
the summit the summit is coming very

00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:11,790
quickly and it's a really four points

00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:14,610
there's the contributor code if you've

00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:17,660
contributed software bug ideas you know

00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:20,820
bugs reports documentation updates

00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:23,279
whatever you could use the contributor

00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:27,900
code to register and it's been sent out

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:30,179
to the mailing lists pink Swarna if

00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,650
you've contributed and haven't seen that

00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:35,100
email or need help finding the code

00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:37,800
we're happy to help there we did the

00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:41,640
first set of talks acceptance

00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:43,770
notifications just so people understand

00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,829
there are additional tracks that haven't

00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:48,870
been announced yet so if you've gotten a

00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:52,020
wait list notification that means that

00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:54,570
that you may very well be where you're

00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:58,079
probably still in consideration for some

00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:00,000
of the additional tracks so keep that in

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,329
mind that was the first wave we usually

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:08,220
do two waves for the schedule update

00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:11,070
let's see so we today we do announce

00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:14,549
that schedules live we've got some of

00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:16,790
the initial keynotes as part of that

00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:20,100
announcement it's a good good blend of

00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:23,189
both CF centric stalks and demos as well

00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:27,360
as because we would like to add a little

00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:29,369
bit of brain food for everyone that

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,979
doesn't necessarily relate directly to

00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:33,930
Cloud Foundry there are some talks on

00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:36,299
different ways to think about their

00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:40,590
development processes and empathy and

00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:42,659
things like that flat point she has here

00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:46,140
is early bird registration so for those

00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:47,790
of you that aren't contributors and 23

00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:50,399
is the last day for the early bird

00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:52,560
pricing so and I won't sell that hard

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,430
but I think is largely a good number of

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,670
contributors here and they'll all go

00:01:55,430 --> 00:02:02,280
either way

00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:03,780
that ends on January 23rd cool you

00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,430
happen to have statistics that you can

00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,530
share with us in terms of like number of

00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:13,790
submissions acceptance rate things like

00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:13,790
this okay I see Chris

00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:19,470
maybe we can wait next time okay all

00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:22,800
right cool well III think this question

00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:28,200
of essentially the stats thumbs up

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:30,150
always maybe we can share yeah yeah I

00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,130
think so we have to get through I mean

00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,780
it's not worth telling you're giving

00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:36,260
giving that out at this point even

00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:38,340
though if I had it not in front of me

00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:41,190
but we're going to go through another

00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:43,170
wave with the additional tracks right at

00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:45,000
the end sure happy to tell you how many

00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:46,650
and what the acceptance rate was that

00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,160
sort of thing a lot of really good

00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:57,810
quality I also want to make sure we can

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:59,370
fit everybody in your backyard chip so

00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:01,770
for people that don't know it's gonna be

00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:05,130
in Philadelphia and chip is from there

00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:07,709
so I think you know we're all making

00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:08,640
sure we're you ready to go see it anyway

00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:10,530
oh cool

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,450
okay I'll get a bus rented it's about an

00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:16,380
hour drive north so I'll get a bus

00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:20,040
rented Russia and I'm gonna cook burgers

00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:22,170
or something you don't need to worry

00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:25,620
about space to me out of eating cheese

00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:30,299
steak whole all week I'll be else in

00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:33,150
these tables that's fine you are if you

00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:34,799
want to get my dogmatic opinion about

00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:39,269
which is the right one to go eat let me

00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:45,860
know offline I actually do I and I

00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:49,440
actually will Jules we can go together

00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:52,250
this is gonna be the summit evening

00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:55,070
party right all the sendee reception

00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:57,450
tips favorite cheese steak restaurant

00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:58,950
yeah yeah and it's definitely not gonna

00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:08,850
be either one of the two famous ones

00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:10,560
that is the easy cheese steak track so

00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:13,410
I'm assuming no other questions for

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:19,350
chips or this yep other things related

00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:21,989
to different okay cool so I see Eric

00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:25,289
Eric always gives us an update on I

00:04:21,989 --> 00:04:27,600
guess run time and what's going on with

00:04:25,289 --> 00:04:30,580
Diego and stuff so maybe

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,169
tell us hey that from axe yeah thanks

00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:33,370
I'll cover some of the highlights over

00:04:32,169 --> 00:04:35,020
the past month it's been a little

00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:39,280
quieter on account of the winter

00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:41,139
holidays but one main thing that people

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,870
want to watch out for is release

00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:47,080
integration is about to release version

00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:48,400
seven of CF deployment and they've noted

00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,530
that this is going to require a

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,630
migration from the old my sequel release

00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:54,130
to the new PXE my sequel release if

00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:56,410
you're using that as your backing

00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:57,820
database for the deployment so watch out

00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:59,860
for that if you haven't done it already

00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:01,210
I think they've they're polishing up

00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:03,789
their migration instructions to make

00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:05,800
sure that they're pretty solid

00:05:03,789 --> 00:05:08,229
one other thing the campi team is

00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:11,080
continuing to polish their zero downtime

00:05:08,229 --> 00:05:12,490
update app updates and they're also

00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,349
continuing to close out their API

00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:16,330
metadata track so they'd certainly

00:05:14,349 --> 00:05:19,479
appreciate feedback on those things they

00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:22,000
also recently broadcast a link out on CF

00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:23,860
dev soliciting app developer feedback in

00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,690
general so I've put a link into the cab

00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:27,250
agenda there in case you get the

00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:31,150
opportunity to give them some feedback

00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:33,520
or tell your developers about that I

00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:37,150
think also the CLI just released new

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,800
minor version 6.42 and one of the major

00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:40,930
features there is they've added some

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,479
flags on the network policy commands to

00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:45,849
support setting up network policies

00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:48,130
across org sore spaces so previously

00:05:45,849 --> 00:05:50,710
been able to do it easily between apps

00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:53,289
in the same space and it's giving you

00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:54,970
some more flexibility there a few other

00:05:53,289 --> 00:05:57,340
highlights routing and continued

00:05:54,970 --> 00:06:01,270
networking are continuing to collaborate

00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:02,919
on getting the container on voice to

00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:06,460
dynamically direct traffic between

00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:08,259
containers transparently so complicated

00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:10,659
bit of work but they're making progress

00:06:08,259 --> 00:06:12,400
on that it's also related to the sto

00:06:10,659 --> 00:06:15,780
integration the dynamic configuration of

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:18,940
that voice comes from mystia pilot

00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:22,090
services api they've mentioned that

00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:23,889
they're continuing to work on some

00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:25,990
stories to allow multiple registrations

00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:29,110
for the same service broker so it seems

00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:31,000
like this is something that has come to

00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:34,060
a head with space scope service brokers

00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,599
where you might be accidentally stopping

00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:39,520
on a global registration by seeing a

00:06:37,599 --> 00:06:41,020
thumbs-up from baird there if you

00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,289
register service broker with the URL

00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,819
then you

00:06:41,289 --> 00:06:45,479
can't register it elsewhere on platform

00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:48,219
I've seen including in a different space

00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:51,849
and then a garden is continuing to work

00:06:48,219 --> 00:06:54,069
on better reporting about CPU usage for

00:06:51,849 --> 00:06:56,939
app containers they're also continuing

00:06:54,069 --> 00:07:01,389
to progress on adopting container D as

00:06:56,939 --> 00:07:03,819
taking one step up the complexity stack

00:07:01,389 --> 00:07:06,729
in terms of container creation and

00:07:03,819 --> 00:07:09,039
management anyway there's some previous

00:07:06,729 --> 00:07:10,599
updates from December but a lot of those

00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:14,379
other team activities are still ongoing

00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:15,849
so not significant updates they're cool

00:07:14,379 --> 00:07:17,229
I see Jules there do you want to talk

00:07:15,849 --> 00:07:20,529
about brexit or you want to tell us

00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:28,899
about you mentioned something you want

00:07:20,529 --> 00:07:30,899
to stay quiet get out of my head that's

00:07:28,899 --> 00:07:34,479
that's why I've been repeating to myself

00:07:30,899 --> 00:07:37,899
most of the last 24 hours

00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:42,520
everything's fine and that that was a

00:07:37,899 --> 00:07:44,439
Rini update is not a brexit update they

00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:49,389
released a really good though it really

00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:52,449
is now passing the cats so it's where

00:07:49,389 --> 00:07:54,519
we're just starting to work on the kind

00:07:52,449 --> 00:07:56,279
of the non-functional requirements are

00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:58,419
functionally it works how you'd expect

00:07:56,279 --> 00:08:01,029
and now we're doing the things like

00:07:58,419 --> 00:08:03,909
making sure that is highly available so

00:08:01,029 --> 00:08:06,069
you can you can run two copies and those

00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:13,709
those things you'd want nor this running

00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:19,169
in production I see any questions for

00:08:13,709 --> 00:08:19,169
Erik or Jose or even Yui

00:08:20,999 --> 00:08:26,979
okay so for Bosch we usually go to Fred

00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:30,490
I don't know it's easier I don't see him

00:08:26,979 --> 00:08:35,169
but I know he's not I'm covering for him

00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:38,079
today okay go ahead so let me find my

00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:40,180
notes I took for this Toronto Bosch team

00:08:38,079 --> 00:08:41,649
has been working on figuring out some

00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:44,139
cert rotation so we can more easily

00:08:41,649 --> 00:08:46,329
rotate certs I think in particular

00:08:44,139 --> 00:08:48,069
talking with cred hub to figure out what

00:08:46,329 --> 00:08:51,550
the interface and contract with that

00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:53,649
should look like in SF we've been doing

00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:54,760
a pretty extensive tract of work that

00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:57,640
crisps around

00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:59,560
my PR to enable configuring job

00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:02,200
credentials to be stored on a temp FS

00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:03,400
rather than on persistent disk we're

00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:06,490
hearing quite a lot of feedback from

00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:08,530
various banks about that and then we're

00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:11,620
also getting close we cross team paired

00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:14,320
with Diego last week on Bosch DNS links

00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:16,030
being scoped to jobs rather than

00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:19,600
instances for healthiness to help with

00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:21,400
some stability and then the trucker

00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,320
sorry Europe Bosch team has been working

00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:26,350
on figuring out some parallel

00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:31,450
resurrection work as well as some slow

00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:35,200
deploy issues that they noticed cool

00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:41,110
Thank You Morgan any questions so far or

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:42,310
Morgan or even okay so for extension

00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:49,240
it's going to be very easy because we

00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:51,700
haven't had our call happens after this

00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:54,160
so basically next week and but the good

00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:56,080
thing is we have at least one of the

00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,850
projects that is gonna give you an

00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,160
update so maybe what I'll do is I'll

00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:02,710
just pass it along to Nicolai from SAT

00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:07,030
who's gonna tell us about what he's been

00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:09,040
doing and it's me on multi apps if you

00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:11,740
remember last year I think he gave us an

00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:15,070
update halfway through the year so this

00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:16,540
is sort of an already one and then so

00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:18,820
anyway you have about 20 minutes and

00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:21,840
then after that was which well you can

00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:27,490
probably take 25 and then it will be

00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:28,660
Shannon for networking but I see you is

00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:32,800
sharing your screen already so let me

00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:36,310
quite well guys I'm the quadrant from

00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:38,890
from ICP I would not take the 20 or 25

00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:43,060
minutes probably would fit in 10 bucks

00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:46,350
15 so I will give you a project update

00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:51,160
from the multi apps extensions project

00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:57,360
from the max area and I would do that

00:10:51,160 --> 00:11:01,180
with a demo so just briefly I would

00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:04,600
actually open this this picture here

00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:06,400
this is an app we are usually using for

00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,259
for for demo purposes it is a spring

00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:11,639
music but the last one

00:11:08,259 --> 00:11:13,959
it has the standard Springwood

00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:17,229
application that is hosting the UI but

00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:19,569
we enhance that with some news around

00:11:17,229 --> 00:11:22,600
around music and there is also some

00:11:19,569 --> 00:11:25,720
external news which is coming from from

00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:28,119
outside not managed by us and here is

00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:31,299
also the standard database service

00:11:28,119 --> 00:11:35,439
instance in our case Bosporus and yeah

00:11:31,299 --> 00:11:37,239
again multi apps in in short it provides

00:11:35,439 --> 00:11:41,410
you this the qualitative model where you

00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:45,189
can actually describe several Cloud

00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:47,289
Foundry entities apps services routes et

00:11:45,189 --> 00:11:49,299
cetera all kind of artifacts and

00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:54,249
actually manage them as one lifecycle

00:11:49,299 --> 00:11:56,919
unit and going directly to to my spring

00:11:54,249 --> 00:12:01,959
up I would actually show you directly

00:11:56,919 --> 00:12:04,989
the the the declarative model so this is

00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:07,859
the declarative model this is we call it

00:12:04,989 --> 00:12:10,749
the deployment descriptor so here I have

00:12:07,859 --> 00:12:12,699
an abstraction layer modules and

00:12:10,749 --> 00:12:14,470
resources and actually the resources are

00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:19,209
usually mapped to banking services or

00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:22,769
external services or or configuration so

00:12:19,209 --> 00:12:25,209
here you can see our PostgreSQL resource

00:12:22,769 --> 00:12:27,189
that would be created out of my

00:12:25,209 --> 00:12:29,199
automated deployment of the spring

00:12:27,189 --> 00:12:30,699
energy captain there is also one user

00:12:29,199 --> 00:12:34,059
provided service that I haven't

00:12:30,699 --> 00:12:36,009
configured here so nothing new at this

00:12:34,059 --> 00:12:40,029
point of time but what we introduced in

00:12:36,009 --> 00:12:43,629
top in the last mouse is this parallel

00:12:40,029 --> 00:12:50,319
deployment of all the stuff from from

00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:52,089
our muti app so I have okay two services

00:12:50,319 --> 00:12:53,649
they would be created but the important

00:12:52,089 --> 00:12:56,019
stuff is these modules this would be

00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:58,749
actually materialized as California

00:12:56,019 --> 00:13:00,759
applications and right now I have two

00:12:58,749 --> 00:13:04,089
the spring music web

00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:06,509
this is the spring music both classical

00:13:04,089 --> 00:13:09,369
up and I've developed one node.js

00:13:06,509 --> 00:13:11,409
application as well and actually these

00:13:09,369 --> 00:13:13,419
two could work independently of one

00:13:11,409 --> 00:13:15,309
another so they don't have any

00:13:13,419 --> 00:13:17,679
dependency and could be deployed in

00:13:15,309 --> 00:13:20,140
theory in parallel actually speeding up

00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:23,410
that the overall deployment but

00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:26,110
if there were actually some kind of a

00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:28,840
deployment dependencies then this is the

00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:32,560
kind of modeling that is needed here

00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:35,050
this deployed after so this is kind of a

00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:37,960
force in the dependency graph between

00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:41,740
the different the different modules that

00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:44,350
we have and okay I have this decorative

00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:47,680
model right now what should I do

00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:49,780
actually for for sake of packaging core

00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:52,810
publishing called transport ink of my

00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:56,580
application between accounts or River

00:13:52,810 --> 00:14:01,690
co-founder landscapes I could actually

00:13:56,580 --> 00:14:06,730
assemble it using this comment which

00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:08,710
would actually create on our hive so we

00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:11,200
are here talking about an application

00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:13,720
our hive containing of the all the

00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:15,970
binaries of these applications if we go

00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,950
back to to the to the descriptor you can

00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:20,130
see that all these modules have paths so

00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:23,020
all this is packaged here and and

00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:28,330
possible for actually transports intend

00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:30,880
appointment and yeah what is new again

00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:34,030
the parallel deployment modeling was

00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:38,470
this packaging concept they have I this

00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:41,710
MBT assembled to do now we've used maven

00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:45,190
plugins for for the assembly of the mood

00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:48,910
yet and they actually could with just a

00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:51,010
single common just deploy the moody up

00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:53,770
but together with the deployment that

00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:56,050
would also pass a runtime configuration

00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:58,990
which we teach deployment specific

00:14:56,050 --> 00:15:02,320
configuration which is this file here so

00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:04,990
these are some stuff that I want to

00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:07,420
change from my descriptor that goes to

00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:11,410
the to their hive so this is things that

00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:13,390
you might want to change from deployment

00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:17,260
to other deployment like for instance

00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:19,600
this concrete URL of this external user

00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:21,960
provided service that I said this are

00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:26,410
providing the external news

00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:31,600
so that see it just deployed

00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:33,640
so again packaging this is our client it

00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,440
would upload their hive to

00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:37,330
second component which is directly

00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:40,720
talking with with the controller to

00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:43,900
actually automate the mentoring

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:47,950
deployment of the application again this

00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:51,250
is you status AP with three thousands of

00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:56,770
deployments per day here we are talking

00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:59,080
to the v2 Cloud Controller API and on

00:15:56,770 --> 00:16:02,970
the point is actually to utilize the v3

00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:06,160
and actually do a rolling update

00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:08,710
deployment as part of our automation

00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:14,260
here actually achieving through CDM

00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:16,150
update for the applications and yeah as

00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:19,570
you can see here actually the creation

00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:22,150
and also the uploading of the apps is is

00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:23,830
done here in parallel following the

00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:27,040
dependency graph that you've modeled in

00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:32,200
the in the descriptor which might not be

00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:35,080
that big kind of performance the poet

00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:38,520
I'm game for this app but for bigger

00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:43,450
applications that are modeled for these

00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:45,220
purposes as a as a multi up the

00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:48,160
performance gains rather rather

00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:52,000
significant we have performance PDFs

00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:58,170
from from like twenty minutes to to

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,170
seven minutes at a TCP so yeah this is

00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:07,650
are the original updates and again here

00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:10,329
I I've built the then the movie app and

00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:12,790
I think another thing that we are

00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:15,339
working right now is that the deploy

00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:17,740
comment would work also from directory

00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:20,860
directory without even the needs to to

00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:24,730
build to package the the mutia but

00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:27,730
directly deploy from directory or just

00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:31,150
deploy one of the modules of the of the

00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:33,060
whole mood health this another thing

00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:35,170
that would support the incremental the

00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:38,490
development the deployment of just

00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:38,490
single entities

00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:53,150
yeah do you have any questions kind of

00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:56,750
feedback or the experience then you

00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:59,840
should know yeah mo that you I mean I

00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:02,060
guess you are yeah this is the a mode

00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:04,600
that is used for the quality of

00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:07,250
description of the whole application

00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:09,350
actually haven't walked you through all

00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:15,050
the features but just highlighted the

00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:17,620
most important ones we have the modules

00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:22,090
the resources the dependencies between

00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:25,940
these two divide this notation requires

00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:28,250
imodel service bindings so yeah I have

00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:30,980
creation of backing services service

00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:33,320
bindings configuration of these and also

00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:34,910
this powerful notation for placeholders

00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:37,550
that for instance when you deploy an

00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:40,130
application for instance this default

00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:42,050
URL would be resolved to the to the URL

00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:44,690
assigned by the platform on the pointman

00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:47,120
time and you can for instance expose

00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:55,610
this and actually inject it in another

00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:59,620
application environment thank you

00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:59,620
let's if there are any other questions

00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:09,140
yeah actually all of these examples are

00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:11,150
also available on our github repo so you

00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:20,120
can check it out directly there together

00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:22,430
with the description files Thanks Thank

00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:31,610
You Nikolai let's see if Shannon is here

00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:46,190
I know he told me that you know half an

00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:54,710
hour I don't see him let me see if I can

00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:58,450
thing among is on his way this is

00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:58,450
supposed to be good so it's going to be

00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:07,640
the updates

00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:17,840
0 integration boundary but specifically

00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:23,780
the traffic spitting so maybe let's give

00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:25,700
him a few minutes and I know he did tell

00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:27,530
me that we would have to start around

00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:31,430
how to pass the hours and maybe that's

00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:45,220
give them a few minutes Wayne can you

00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:45,220
entertain us I mean that oh the circuit

00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:53,230
I can share my screen that'd be awkward

00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:08,100
as far as advocating for for Jewel's to

00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:09,690
to rant about Greg's it's more I was

00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:16,020
gonna suggest that but I feel like he's

00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:17,910
you know is in be careful what you wish

00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:28,380
for you thought me up now and I'll still

00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:31,640
be going by summit I mean I guess no I'm

00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:36,180
a nobody knows what they're all doing

00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:38,430
it's all we know we there's someone's

00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:40,290
pulled the pin out of the grenade no one

00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:42,480
has any clue how to put a pin back in

00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:45,750
the grenade and everyone's just kicking

00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:48,420
to grenade further and further away but

00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:50,660
I mean it's still a grenade so yeah

00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:53,250
nothing nothing much just changed

00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:55,350
whereas everybody else in the EU is kind

00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:57,810
of a popcorn and there's latinus like

00:21:55,350 --> 00:22:01,320
it's almost as interesting as American

00:21:57,810 --> 00:22:03,420
politics I I think everyone else is kind

00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:06,120
of looking as going you do you know the

00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:11,090
isoquant aid is do you that's not a

00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:11,090
that's that's kind of explode you guys

00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:26,190
we know that's fine we're serving

00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:30,360
hamburgers that are you know president's

00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:35,610
residence so it's good hamburgers it's

00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:36,960
just McDonald's just saying I I state

00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:39,330
those some Wendy's in that a

00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:42,390
filet-o-fish there there are some

00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:47,120
Wendy's some burger key so if someone

00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:47,120
said hamburgers that was pretty funny

00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:52,350
you see the baby beets they're all out

00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:56,430
of hamburgers but there's certainly

00:22:52,350 --> 00:23:04,470
hamburgers all day Bret are you getting

00:22:56,430 --> 00:23:05,730
paid yes the cloud backup team is funded

00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:07,340
from the acquisition services fund which

00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:10,140
is not a congressional appropriation a

00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:12,420
lot of people rely on are not getting

00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:15,170
paid it is not funny right now and

00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:15,170
people are very

00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:22,140
what happened an immigrant from South

00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:23,490
America who has a skilled engineer and

00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,850
he feels like his country doesn't won

00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:27,270
him anymore

00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:30,150
so he's looking for other jobs so for

00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:31,860
people that are on the call that Oh from

00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:35,400
a different country than the US the

00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:37,890
government of the United States is shut

00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:42,380
down and that's what they're talking

00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:42,380
about here so I'm not getting paid

00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:46,260
really furloughed they're not working

00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:48,750
and not able to work and not able to

00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:50,490
take other jobs in the mean time and

00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:51,780
there are a lot of people who are

00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:53,159
considered essential and are being

00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:55,220
called back to work and being forced to

00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:57,690
work even though their paycheck is zero

00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:59,340
and then the government is deciding case

00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:01,770
by case who is essential and bringing

00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:03,690
people about people back so this

00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:08,039
includes apparently people who run oil

00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:10,140
auctions and as you can imagine with the

00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:11,130
agency so lightly staff it's an

00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:13,340
opportunity for all kinds of shenanigans

00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:16,200
to happen without any kind of oversight

00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:19,470
it's really bad it's completely

00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:22,169
manufactured crisis it's a it's a cell

00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:23,490
phone and if you were deliberately

00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:27,120
trying to do stabilize the United States

00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:29,309
it's exactly what you wanted it yeah I

00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:32,309
mean I think the the lack of inspections

00:24:29,309 --> 00:24:34,590
of a number of things is also like

00:24:32,309 --> 00:24:40,860
incredibly wearing like from the planes

00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:43,230
to the food - yeah lots of things the

00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:45,120
the the the mo for bringing people back

00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:47,059
seems to be what will the public notice

00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:49,260
or what will business getting mad at

00:24:47,059 --> 00:24:52,830
rather than like what do poor people

00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:57,059
need or you know what is what is good

00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:58,470
for safety it's really a business a

00:24:57,059 --> 00:25:00,900
there's a significant contingent of this

00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:01,799
country that wants the government and

00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,909
wants people to believe the government

00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:05,909
is not essential and so they're trying

00:25:02,909 --> 00:25:07,890
to carefully you know not have people

00:25:05,909 --> 00:25:08,820
get bummed off at airports because then

00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:10,110
people would have recognized the

00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:16,320
government is essential they want to

00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:17,520
make the case that yeah this is a it's

00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:20,130
really bad there's a federal worker

00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,870
it just feels incredibly shitty to be

00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:24,919
taking advantage of in this way and used

00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:24,919
as a as a football

00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:31,170
did somebody else make that noise again

00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:38,970
that was really fun the little circus

00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:40,410
noise that was more fun than this yeah

00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:44,220
it also happens to fit the situation

00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:46,680
because this really does soundtrack for

00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:50,130
2019 well I was looking for the

00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:51,720
show button but it's not here actually

00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:54,330
the funniest thing that I've seen

00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:56,670
recently the status thing recently is

00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:58,230
there was a I don't know a CNN where I

00:25:56,670 --> 00:26:03,030
was going to the airport the other day

00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:05,940
and they had the byline of the news

00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:10,910
article on the government shutdown was

00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:14,550
literally shut - show was the Bible I

00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:16,590
did brilliantly done for they were the

00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:20,730
news agencies but at the same time it's

00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:23,720
very applicable yeah somebody or their

00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:23,720
pay that day that's awesome

00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:33,630
I don't hear from shannon but let me

00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:35,550
plug this one thing with me as we were

00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:38,850
waiting and if he doesn't join I guess

00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:41,220
in the next two minutes was it and then

00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:45,630
we visit next time let's see if I can

00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:47,100
share my screen so actually I don't have

00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:50,030
to share my screen but the key thing I

00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:54,690
want to mention is that he had this

00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:57,480
survey running I guess he won't get

00:26:54,690 --> 00:27:01,020
chatting today that's a good feedback to

00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:04,020
me to make sure people can join at the

00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:07,350
right time but I know he did tell me he

00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:10,110
would join after I pass so it's on me

00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:13,920
but anyway the survey is three questions

00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:15,690
it's you know if you have not taken it

00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:18,300
don't be afraid you click on the link

00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:20,280
and you get there it's like simple

00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:23,310
questions I think the first question is

00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:27,290
you know you joined the cap ball how

00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:29,460
often and so on and then you know

00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:31,830
there's always an opportunity for you

00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:34,560
just fill in insurers in addition to

00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:39,060
drop down and then the second question I

00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:42,390
think is you know you what you like and

00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:44,940
what you know feedback as you have and

00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:48,960
then I think the last question is how is

00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:51,000
make it better than I'm gonna use the

00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,980
responses I think I've gotten quite a

00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,300
bit of responses already I come out 20

00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:59,490
pilots but I haven't checked recently so

00:27:56,300 --> 00:28:03,030
there's more and if you remember last

00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:07,100
year what I did is I tried to create

00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:09,690
some graphs around you know not only

00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:12,060
common responses because every response

00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:14,880
every question has a set of response

00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:18,210
that you have to select and then also

00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:21,480
kind of like a tag cloud of the of the

00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:23,760
text and people entered so take it

00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:26,930
seriously let us know the point is to

00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:31,650
make it better for everybody right so

00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:35,670
sometimes alright to see if Shannon join

00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:37,620
us and then I guess

00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:41,360
I joined the meeting late I don't know

00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:45,960
if anyone talked about sorna's email

00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:51,870
asking for thoughts on contributor

00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:55,590
activity at Summit but no that's a good

00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:58,710
topic to discuss so go for it you why

00:28:55,590 --> 00:29:01,890
are you able to talk about it or yeah

00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:04,110
sure I can thanks for bringing it up so

00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:06,510
I sent an email courtesy of the mailing

00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:08,250
list a couple days ago I think we gotta

00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:12,840
pee we got feedback from the community

00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:14,940
that at summits we need to have a little

00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:17,430
more focus or increased focus to bring

00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:20,130
value even to the contributors whether

00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:23,580
it is providing a forum only for the

00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:25,860
contributors to discuss or share

00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:29,400
feedback or discuss a road map or the

00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:31,410
upcoming plan for the projects or even

00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:34,500
for the end users to come and talk to

00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:36,690
the contributors and see if they can

00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:38,730
provide any feedback or such so I was

00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:40,860
trying to see before we decide on a

00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:42,510
format or something I wanted to get the

00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:44,460
same feedback from I mean feedback from

00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:49,170
the same folks from the community to see

00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:51,450
how how we can make it really more

00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:55,290
efficient and valuable activity there

00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:57,450
with a format of parallel track maybe

00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:59,760
would that be the right choice or with a

00:29:57,450 --> 00:30:03,390
dedicated room with specific moderator

00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:05,610
topics which is more like I guess an

00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:09,630
extension or a really formal officers

00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:13,140
and a format but with a more with more

00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:16,440
structured and more dedicated timings so

00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:18,330
that its focus is not just as broad as

00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:21,060
anything officers related but more

00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:24,960
particularly in in relation to the

00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:26,970
specific topic or specific feedback for

00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:29,250
that discussion or for the topic so I

00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:33,180
was trying to get a few thoughts from

00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:35,180
the community before we finalize a

00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:38,340
specific format for the contributor

00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:40,770
activity and also should it be a day

00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:42,960
zero activity or should it be in

00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:45,300
parallel to the rest of the events that

00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:48,090
are happening on day zero one and two so

00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:49,540
that it's it's all through the event so

00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:51,820
if you have any feedbacks to

00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:53,680
a feedback do send me an email or if you

00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:59,830
have anything and would like to share

00:30:53,680 --> 00:31:03,640
some here I'm all yours and thank you

00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:11,040
for bringing that up yeah I'm excited

00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:13,960
about trying to put some effort and and

00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:15,670
provide some additional things for for

00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:20,040
individual contributors to do while I

00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:22,600
enjoy the hallway track very much the a

00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:31,300
little bit more structure I think could

00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:34,600
help I'd second that discussions could

00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:36,160
be on existing projects or even for

00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,900
brand-new contributors that are just

00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:39,550
trying to get their feet wet on trying

00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:41,440
to figure out how do we get started

00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:43,240
where do we get started who to be paired

00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,860
up with how do we pair up a tour what is

00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:48,130
pairing all these kind of things like it

00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:49,900
can be anything really broad but if we

00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:51,850
have some structure around it I think it

00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:54,010
will be extremely a good use of time for

00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:55,840
everybody and for specifically

00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:59,340
contributors that are attending summit

00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:59,340
it'll be more valuable for them

00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:02,000
you

00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:09,980
[Music]

00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:13,190
okay cool so I don't see Shannon he's

00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:17,150
done on slack he did tell me he could

00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:20,929
only start after half past when we have

00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:23,960
five minutes past that time so maybe he

00:32:20,929 --> 00:32:27,650
can do it so I'll give everybody back 25

00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:29,179
minutes and then we'll figure out you

00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:31,640
know what to do about the update it

00:32:29,179 --> 00:32:34,220
certainly I guess the plug for him is

00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:37,730
that if you are interested in traffic

00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:39,830
splitting as a feature it at least

00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:44,059
recently and that's what he was going to

00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:47,020
show so you can probably look at repo

00:32:44,059 --> 00:32:52,730
that I included in the link and then

00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:59,510
hopefully also in slacks but is the

00:32:52,730 --> 00:33:01,130
wording so unless there anything else

00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:07,640
with clothes already and we give

00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:09,860
everybody everybody okay

00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:12,350
all right thank you everybody talk next

00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:18,549
time hopefully a little bit better I'll

00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:18,549
