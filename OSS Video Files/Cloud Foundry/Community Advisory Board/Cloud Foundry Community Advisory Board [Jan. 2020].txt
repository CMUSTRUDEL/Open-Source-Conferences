and can somebody say something because I

00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:11,400
don't think I've heard anybody say

00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:14,250
anything we can hear you we're just

00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:17,010
waiting for all the technical operations

00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:19,050
or technical issues to be resolved how

00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:23,300
many engineers do we need how many peas

00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:27,890
do we need how many grains I don't know

00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:35,190
it's just hard this stuff hard all right

00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:38,640
we got 18 folks in the call recording

00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:39,149

all right so this is the first call for

00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:46,440
the year there's a few things we need to

00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:50,039
go over and then we of course have a

00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:54,120
really good demo I'll do the cab survey

00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:58,170
last since we want to give trying the

00:00:54,120 --> 00:01:01,160
team as much time as possible to to do

00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:04,080
their presentation and then of course

00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:06,740
the p.m. see you at highlights and cff

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:11,369
and so on right so welcome

00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:15,240
this is 2020 Cloud Foundry advisory

00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:17,189
meetings and we excited to have you and

00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:22,740
if you're listening on youtube you can

00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:25,759
always join by just going to this zoom

00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:28,500
meeting at the time provided and then

00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:34,979
you can ask questions and we have a

00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:37,259
slack channel town CIB so you can join

00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:39,570
in the discussion there so we usually

00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:42,180
start with boundary highlights so I

00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:45,119
think so when I hear and I saw chip also

00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:46,799
so I think I guess when are you added

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,899
those so maybe you can update us and

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:55,200
then of course chip feel free to chime

00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:57,119
in as well and welcome you 2020 hey um

00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,490
yeah so I just wanted to quickly update

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:02,219
on the Cloud Foundry summits but right

00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:04,979
before we broke up for the holidays we

00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:06,659
had an announcement talking about just

00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:08,220
savior to save the date kind of an

00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:11,129
announcement with Cloud Foundry summits

00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:13,080
this year we are co-locating with our

00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:13,990
anchor event for Linux Foundation which

00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,270
is the open source

00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:18,280
sumit it used to be called linux con in

00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:21,160
the past so you may be familiar with one

00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:24,100
or the other name it will be on the

00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:26,020
Thursday so right after the opens our

00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:28,360
summit closes we will have the Thursday

00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:32,410
focused on Cloud Foundry so much we are

00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:34,210
working on the CFP the number of tracks

00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:37,210
the registration details all of those

00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:41,860
kind of specifics we will be announcing

00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:43,840
those quickly so that people can start

00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:45,730
planning for it but at least for the

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,010
dates it's the North American one is on

00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:50,860
June 25th in Austin Texas and the

00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:53,830
European one is in on August sorry

00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:56,290
October 29th in Dublin Ireland so at

00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:57,670
least you can save the dates hopefully

00:02:56,290 --> 00:03:00,670
in the next week or so we will get the

00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:04,150
rest of the details announced as well I

00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:06,880
also wanted to share one other thing for

00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:10,870
anyone here who has the bandwidth or who

00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:14,410
has the time and who's interested in in

00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:18,130
becoming a mentor this is more like for

00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:21,430
students in remote locations in various

00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:23,950
geographies they have submitted interest

00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:25,990
in Cloud Foundry as a project through

00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:29,920
the Linux foundations community bridge

00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:32,590
initiative so I am talking to pretty

00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:35,320
much all the 35-ish people that submit

00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:38,200
an interest and most of them want to

00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:41,110
start contributing to Cloud Foundry in

00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:43,900
some fashion some of them have mentioned

00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:48,100
these specific projects like the CLI or

00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:49,900
ireenie the quarks kind of projects as

00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:52,300
the areas of interest that they would

00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,980
like to start contributing so if you are

00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,930
interested or if you know someone on

00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:59,080
your team that is interested in or and

00:03:55,930 --> 00:04:00,940
is able to mentor folks that come in

00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,410
from that program let me know just drop

00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:06,280
an email I will start making that

00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:08,830
introductions and as a last thing we

00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:11,170
have a community calendar on our website

00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:13,090
I added the link as well it has the

00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:15,100
links and the meeting information for

00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:16,840
all of these meetings just a quick note

00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:19,150
on some of the upcoming meetings we have

00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:21,400
the Bosch pmc meeting tomorrow at 11:00

00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:24,479
a.m. you are specific and we have the

00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:27,700
Sigma ting co-founder for kubernetes

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,150
Sigma ting next week or next Tuesday we

00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:31,180
have two

00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:33,639
the Sigma ting and the bi-weekly app

00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:35,800
runtime PMC meeting and we also have the

00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:38,440
Cloud Foundry operators cig meeting next

00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:41,669
Wednesday so feel free to add the

00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:45,699
calendar to your own and there are also

00:04:41,669 --> 00:04:47,259
channels for those sig meetings in Cloud

00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:49,780
Foundry select so feel free to join the

00:04:47,259 --> 00:04:54,370
channel and ask questions or look for

00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:57,940
the agenda and such any questions I was

00:04:54,370 --> 00:05:01,870
gonna ask that I saw that you now the

00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:06,880
the conference is one day right yep okay

00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:08,410
so that means I guess do we keep the

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:12,910
same number of tracks oh is it clearly

00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:15,550
gonna be much yes we will probably

00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:17,080
reduce the number of tracks because it

00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:18,910
just doesn't make sense to have all

00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:21,430
seven or eight tracks that we used to

00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:22,840
have in the past across two days and

00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:24,699
those are the kind of details that we're

00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:27,460
still trying to figure out today and

00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:29,650
tomorrow we are gonna have those

00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:32,020
discussions and see how many rooms do we

00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:34,139
get how many tracks can we host what are

00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:38,289
the most meaningful tracks and such and

00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:41,199
announce those as I think as late as

00:05:38,289 --> 00:05:42,340
next week hopefully but yeah those are

00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,930
the details that we're still trying to

00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:47,139
figure out as to what tracks are

00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:48,880
relevant and how many tracks can is it

00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:52,750
possible or reasonable to do you know

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:55,599
one-day event right good so you still I

00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:57,310
guess the the the gist of it is that you

00:05:55,599 --> 00:05:58,990
know typically there's kind of one day

00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:01,060
even would be just a single track single

00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:04,449
room but there's a possibility that you

00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:05,800
might have multiple that's all yes we're

00:06:04,449 --> 00:06:07,659
definitely looking at more than one

00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:10,090
track that is for sure because we have

00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:11,949
just so many broad topics that is not

00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:13,900
possible to have just a one track kind

00:06:11,949 --> 00:06:16,180
of an event so we are looking at

00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:19,389
multiple tracks it's just how many can

00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:21,699
we accomplish is it something that we're

00:06:19,389 --> 00:06:24,400
discussing and then we'll not start it

00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:26,199
like 4:00 in the morning that's it again

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:30,729
we'll need to start at 4:00 in the

00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:34,060
morning at night let me sleep sleep is

00:06:30,729 --> 00:06:36,729
underrated let's go overnight Wow well

00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:40,020
we can also look at shorter talks maybe

00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:40,020
maybe the same content

00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:51,319
so dr. Nicki you're gonna shorten your

00:06:45,569 --> 00:06:54,389
talk to what 30 seconds just jokes

00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:56,580
welcome I got a message from actually

00:06:54,389 --> 00:06:58,680
saying that most of waiting

00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:01,110
would be able to join but I guess you

00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,669
know when you're in Australia the Aspire

00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:04,849
all around you you need to you need to

00:07:02,669 --> 00:07:07,259
have some comfort with us right welcome

00:07:04,849 --> 00:07:09,650
right I'm currently getting comfort from

00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:09,650
Utah

00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:12,860
surrounded by snow

00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:20,900
of course people know it's a joke I mean

00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:20,900
we all wish on Australia the best and

00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:30,509
another question I had for you swimming

00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:33,240
race is obviously this is part of the

00:07:30,509 --> 00:07:35,370
open source summit and I'm not looking

00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:38,550
at the calendar for those events is this

00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:40,529
the day before or is it in the middle as

00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:43,259
part of the conference itself it's the

00:07:40,529 --> 00:07:45,360
day after so open source summit ends on

00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:48,089
the 24th of June for North America and

00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,610
the 28th of October in Europe it will be

00:07:48,089 --> 00:07:51,870
the day right after

00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:53,699
so it's co-locating but it will not

00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:56,400
conflict or overlap with the opens or

00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:57,659
summit schedule cool so that means that

00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,599
people can actually attend both

00:07:57,659 --> 00:08:03,539
conferences very well exactly and that's

00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:06,120
the whole reason we're trying to do it

00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:08,099
after so that people can kind of come in

00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,839
either on Monday or Tuesday even if they

00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:11,939
don't want to stay for the entire opens

00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:13,319
or summit and can stay on until Thursday

00:08:11,939 --> 00:08:17,099
of that week to attend Cloud Foundry

00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:19,560
summit excellent cool the other thing

00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:21,539
that I'll add to that yes water can

00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:24,300
clarify if I say it incorrectly but

00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:27,960
we're also programming the two cloud

00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:29,009
tracks for open source summit so you

00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:32,459
know if you're planning to come to the

00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:35,940
clarity part of the event which will be

00:08:32,459 --> 00:08:37,709
focused on contributors and focused on

00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:40,079
the end users is the two primary

00:08:37,709 --> 00:08:42,000
audiences there's also going to be a lot

00:08:40,079 --> 00:08:43,910
of content that's very relevant during

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,820
the core of its source summit itself

00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:52,680
excellent that is very true I will add

00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:54,700
that here I forgot to mention that let's

00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:56,470
see if there are any questions or

00:08:54,700 --> 00:09:10,990
I mean I guess chip if you have any

00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:12,280
other additions now that's it no we

00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:14,850
gonna be doing that again this year and

00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:18,160
any interest in that or is it different

00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:20,350
yeah it's it's different because the I

00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:25,750
think that the Clapp Energy Summit

00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:28,570
itself will be largely designed around

00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:32,680
those that that use it everyday and

00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:36,220
build it with less of a kind of an expo

00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:38,860
floor style but we're still looking to

00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:41,410
see if it's possible to do something and

00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:44,590
it's also a possibility that we'll have

00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:47,710
some type of CF related hands-on labs as

00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:49,960
part of the open source summit sponsor

00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:52,480
area so not really sure exactly how to

00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:55,180
pull that up yet okay with respect to

00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,440
the hands-on lab style things we're very

00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:59,110
interested in helping out with that so

00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:01,000
please you know keep some Lube or if we

00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:01,810
can help in any way no awesome those

00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,110
Wainwright

00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:09,460
you betcha already I already spoke to

00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:11,560
Ashley and Brian and one other person

00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:13,750
whose name I'm drawing a blank on from

00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:16,390
Stark and Wayne right before we closed

00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:18,820
for the holidays so yeah I I'm

00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:21,820
definitely gonna pull any and all of you

00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:24,550
from from the previous hands-on labs or

00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:32,080
anyone if we do get and go down that

00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:38,590
path okay last chance for questions or

00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:43,360
the foundation or on those topics we can

00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:45,100
you can always be we'll also be on the

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,590
call for the rest of the duration so

00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:49,060
feel free

00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:53,530
I just want to make sure I give joy as

00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:56,530
much time yeah okay great so we are

00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:59,740
going now to the highlights and I have

00:10:56,530 --> 00:11:01,900
every you know with me or runtime

00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:04,330
updates and hopefully you can hear him

00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:07,059
if you cannot hear him say something so

00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:12,759
we can move in yeah

00:11:07,059 --> 00:11:14,889
okay yep yep oh yeah I'll comment

00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:18,279
briefly on some of the activity that

00:11:14,889 --> 00:11:19,389
going on in the runtime PMC so a lot of

00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:22,899
it actually has been focused on

00:11:19,389 --> 00:11:27,789
development around kubernetes and

00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:30,159
getting the system to run there so I

00:11:27,789 --> 00:11:33,179
release integration in particular has

00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:35,379
been focused on this problem providing

00:11:33,179 --> 00:11:38,229
integration support to one of the

00:11:35,379 --> 00:11:40,509
component teams as they've been focusing

00:11:38,229 --> 00:11:43,659
their own efforts on getting kids to

00:11:40,509 --> 00:11:45,069
playable artifacts for their components

00:11:43,659 --> 00:11:48,789
and adapting them to interact with

00:11:45,069 --> 00:11:50,589
kubernetes and so I think psy is

00:11:48,789 --> 00:11:55,479
planning on sending out a proposal for

00:11:50,589 --> 00:11:57,309
the first phase of that effort and along

00:11:55,479 --> 00:11:58,539
the lines of the component teams Kathy's

00:11:57,309 --> 00:12:01,179
really been focused on that both

00:11:58,539 --> 00:12:03,939
building out their criminal use

00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:05,709
deployment artifacts and making some

00:12:03,939 --> 00:12:07,629
initial progress through their

00:12:05,709 --> 00:12:11,529
milestones I'm in for the Netscape act

00:12:07,629 --> 00:12:14,829
do you run plug native don't packs for

00:12:11,529 --> 00:12:18,159
staging tasks and likewise you a I

00:12:14,829 --> 00:12:20,469
believe it has a long track of work in

00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:24,099
their tracker now around building a

00:12:20,469 --> 00:12:25,929
kate's deploy water fact for you a and I

00:12:24,099 --> 00:12:30,789
previously mentioned that networking is

00:12:25,929 --> 00:12:32,739
also they had even a few months ago

00:12:30,789 --> 00:12:34,389
released an initial version of their

00:12:32,739 --> 00:12:35,889
component that synchronizes CF private

00:12:34,389 --> 00:12:37,329
folk to us do incriminate these

00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:40,659
resources and they're continuing to

00:12:37,329 --> 00:12:43,239
refine that and I know also work on the

00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:45,339
logger Gator team history around both

00:12:43,239 --> 00:12:48,699
logs and metric integration on top of

00:12:45,339 --> 00:12:51,159
that gate substrate so there's a lot of

00:12:48,699 --> 00:12:53,559
parallel activity kicking off then on

00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:55,659
those teams I need to get that over able

00:12:53,559 --> 00:13:03,029
to get them into something somewhat

00:12:55,659 --> 00:13:06,339
worked okay thank you

00:13:03,029 --> 00:13:08,739
yes Nick hey you might have said we're

00:13:06,339 --> 00:13:11,199
at the top and I apologize and packaging

00:13:08,739 --> 00:13:11,799
of things towards you know kubernetes

00:13:11,199 --> 00:13:14,289
obviously

00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:18,069
partly its docker part is everyone gonna

00:13:14,289 --> 00:13:20,619
be using build packs and and you know so

00:13:18,069 --> 00:13:20,920
some be up for example Cloud Control is

00:13:20,619 --> 00:13:23,019
written

00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:24,910
Ruby we don't have a Ruby bill pack but

00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:30,970
will everything be using bill packs or

00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:32,410
will some not yeah I think as as they

00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:35,769
have the bandwidth teams are very

00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:42,519
interested in using tools like comm unit

00:13:35,769 --> 00:13:45,490
bill acts to build provide mechanisms by

00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:48,550
which downstream vendors can build their

00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:50,769
own variants of those components maybe

00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:56,230
UAA is further along in that because

00:13:50,769 --> 00:13:59,410
there is a Java built pack but if you

00:13:56,230 --> 00:14:01,389
they're just building doctor files to

00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:04,959
produce those components I think Kathy

00:14:01,389 --> 00:14:08,290
might be having to do that for now I

00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:09,670
might not be in everyone's channel of

00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:11,589
the team that if they start shipping

00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:13,990
artifacts they want people to test happy

00:14:11,589 --> 00:14:15,459
to start testing as soon as as soon as

00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:17,829
they've got things to be tested

00:14:15,459 --> 00:14:37,120
great yeah I know a broadcaster

00:14:17,829 --> 00:14:39,130
elsewhere also been on the line so he

00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:42,339
could probably talk to you their plans

00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:44,380
with the other languages yeah I just

00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:46,540
wanted to dr. Nick I think obviously

00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:49,779
right ruby is very much on our radar in

00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:53,410
terms of priorities we know a lot of the

00:14:49,779 --> 00:14:55,930
components look to would need the Ruby C

00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:59,560
and B in order to make use of the new

00:14:55,930 --> 00:15:02,410
clan about packs so that is actively on

00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:04,779
our roadmap right now look at the

00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:07,510
wrap-up the dotnet core in PHP and then

00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:12,190
Ruby is looking to come very close after

00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:18,510
that so um stay tuned I guess thanks

00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:24,190
Mike Eric can you give a quick output on

00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:26,470
how you intend to solve the upcoming

00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:28,839
issue around blob stars because if we

00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:31,899
are on a coop native world I think

00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:34,300
everybody agrees that the existence of a

00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:36,410
blob store is probably not

00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:38,720
like to have everything on image

00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:41,650
registry and I know that there is some

00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,580
work that has been some work happening

00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:46,070
and I know that there has been some work

00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:48,590
at the top controller but a doctor

00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:50,810
keeping can you maybe quickly outline

00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:56,180
how that strategy is supposed to come

00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:58,490
together and in this context yeah I mean

00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:00,470
I think you're right cog controller is

00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:05,690
what the only client of that blob store

00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:08,090
and to my knowledge feedback and then

00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:10,970
k-pax for the consolidation of resources

00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:12,980
on the OCI image registry solves a lot

00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:15,110
of that there's still a few loose edges

00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:18,620
may be a resource matching is the main

00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:21,650
one that comes to mind so I don't know

00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:23,930
the exact plans for removing that

00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:25,610
dependence but that's probably something

00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:30,080
to talk with Zack and Scott about

00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:31,880
specifically and will crack normal as

00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:38,300
one of the other engineering leaders on

00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:41,960
that side okay great if we could get all

00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:45,440
the blob management into the interface

00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:47,480
of noci image registry since that that

00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,070
dependency won't we're expecting always

00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,210
to be present and then you know it'd be

00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:52,850
great if we could remove that other one

00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:55,340
but but do I get this right that in

00:16:52,850 --> 00:17:04,130
consequence that means that one of the

00:16:55,340 --> 00:17:07,100
upcoming CF CF for an application

00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:09,620
platform for kubernetes distributions or

00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:12,590
cmf is whatever the name of that thing

00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:15,890
will be right the the kubernetes based

00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:19,750
one will that then package any like

00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:25,210
Capek as a as a additional component is

00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:32,080
parts or how is that well I believe that

00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:34,520
any any distribution of a CF this

00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,110
incorporating Capac would then have a

00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:38,270
distribution of a dessert that's my

00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:39,860
understanding of the current plans been

00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:43,340
to the extent that can't be irrelevant

00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:46,700
have been discussing how to get a more

00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:47,420
coherent artifact in the community that

00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:50,240
incorporates

00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:52,190
that work I think pigment planning

00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,930
jointly so have kickback incorporated

00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:55,700
there and they may just be some

00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:58,760
discussion with like which side it falls

00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:00,920
on were to be bundled directly into the

00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:05,210
cloud controller deployment resources or

00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:07,760
would it as part of some integrated set

00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:13,570
of modules that would be more

00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:13,570
understated relevant on our control okay

00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:21,520
excellent any more questions or Eric

00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:29,000
okay cool

00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:34,460
so I pinged Morgan he's been a bit sick

00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:37,370
so he did send me the update for blush

00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:40,880
and it's pretty straightforwardly it's

00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:45,050
busy I guess so slow week sorry which is

00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:47,180
expected this is the second week the

00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:48,920
holidays but he mentioned that they've

00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:52,010
been working on exposing director

00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:57,070
metrics things like for instance number

00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:58,370
of unresponsive VMs is that all three

00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:01,160
sorry

00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:05,960
resurrection status number of questions

00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:08,180
max number of cute tasks etc so I'd

00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:12,590
recommend you to join the Bosh PMC

00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:14,690
meeting which is this Thursday at 11:00

00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:18,880
a.m. Pacific if you have more questions

00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:25,070
or if you have questions I guess Morgan

00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:28,970
okay for extensions it's definitely been

00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:30,800
in you know spill and we have not had

00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:34,130
our first meeting which will happen at

00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:39,790
the end of the month so hopefully we'll

00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:39,790
get you some dates next year next month

00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:47,810
yeah I know rush I think the important

00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:50,390
thing also to mention for people if you

00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:54,800
have not you know gotten a status for

00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:57,560
extensions since a few months ago that

00:19:54,800 --> 00:20:00,140
we have three projects that move to the

00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:00,860
Attic so those projects are moving to

00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:05,420
boundary

00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:07,760
and it's mainly lack of interest or also

00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:13,340
I guess you know experiments that maybe

00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:16,790
didn't pan out as much as we expected so

00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:19,250
with that let me see if you have any

00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:23,600
questions for anything that happened so

00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:28,880
far otherwise we'll ask Troy and I guess

00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:32,780
it's to you from Sue said to start

00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:35,540
sharing and then we'll move to the cube

00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:40,730
CF presentation which is sort of the

00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:42,290
main event oh great thanks so thanks

00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:45,650
very much and this is gonna relate back

00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:47,390
to the stuff that was talking about can

00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:48,679
everyone hear me okay yeah there's a

00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:50,750
little bit of a background can I ask

00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:52,660
people to go to mute if you're not the

00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:58,460
speaker I'm gonna go to mute as well

00:20:52,660 --> 00:21:02,350
okay so I will share my slides if I

00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:05,330
could and then I'll hand it over to

00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:08,870
Tulio at some point I'm getting a

00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:11,500
message that I cannot start screen share

00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:15,200
while other participants are sharing Oh

00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:24,260
am i sharing prop

00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:26,570
sorry Troy all right look okay

00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:29,090
yeah we can seriously think okay great

00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:33,440
so this is a presentation about cube C F

00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:36,470
and our into our team's intention to

00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:38,270
bring it upstream it's a little bit of

00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:39,530
internal evangelism so everyone knows

00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:41,720
we're out what we're up to what our

00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:44,240
intentions are so that we don't

00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:46,340
duplicate effort I was listening very

00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:49,850
attentively to what Eric was talking

00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:53,270
about with the upstream teams kubernetes

00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:54,890
vying and making the components not only

00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,820
kubernetes native but kubernetes

00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:57,290
idiomatic

00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:59,960
this will deal a little bit with that

00:21:57,290 --> 00:22:01,160
but it's mostly to let everyone know how

00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:05,559
far we've come

00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:08,840
what we're up to give a little demo and

00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:12,380
sort of let everyone know how important

00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:16,130
this is not only to us also to IBM but

00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:20,809
to the community as a whole so what is

00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:23,480
cube CF it's a github repo and a number

00:22:20,809 --> 00:22:25,490
of public build pipelines which you

00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:28,010
might not necessarily know about but you

00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:32,780
will see the results of in that in the

00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:37,570
git repo it's currently at the under the

00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:42,530
Sousa org souza slash cube CF and that

00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:45,770
grew out of the our v3 branch of Sousa

00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:49,280
SCF which some of you may recall this is

00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:54,169
the basis of our cloud application

00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:55,820
platform distribution our intention is

00:22:54,169 --> 00:23:00,320
to get this upstream we'll talk a little

00:22:55,820 --> 00:23:03,500
bit about how we do that later but its

00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:06,710
function as a central point for bringing

00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:10,070
together components for for kubernetes

00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:13,790
distribution is is like CF deployment so

00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:15,440
it brings together but because it's sort

00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:17,120
of downstream from CF deployment it

00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,860
actually relies on CF deployment at the

00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,900
moment

00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:22,460
Tullio and Jeff or Vlad please feel free

00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:27,559
to join in and correct me if I'm wrong

00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:31,120
here we published this as a set of

00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:34,730
container images that are created using

00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:37,520
using Fissel and and these public build

00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:37,970
pipelines as held charts so helm charts

00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,460
haven't they

00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:43,910
that coordinate these and deploy them in

00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:45,290
much the same way as as we did for SEF

00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:47,840
there's some important differences

00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:53,000
though in the in the newer branch of

00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:55,670
code though most specifically that it

00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,980
relies on the works work from quarks in

00:23:55,670 --> 00:24:02,480
fact we sort of consider this right now

00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:05,030
as part of the quarks project because

00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:07,430
cube CF relies on CF operator in order

00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:09,380
to run properly on on communities in

00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:13,130
fact it won't work without it if you

00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:15,170
push the cube CF helm chart directly

00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:19,910
without a CF operator in place it won't

00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:22,400
really do anything and that's because CF

00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:25,970
operator is in charge of lifecycle

00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:29,290
management for jib CF it watches the

00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:33,110
namespace and a CRD translates bosh

00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:37,280
manifests into communities manifests in

00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:40,840
real time cube CF provides those those

00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:46,090
manifests and an agreed amount slicing

00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:50,150
and it manages some gate specific stuff

00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:52,130
so as I mentioned this is it serves the

00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:55,310
same function as CF deployment but it

00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:58,520
actually tracks CF deployment as an

00:24:55,310 --> 00:25:01,430
upstream source of truth and this is

00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:04,010
done by a manual process so we we bump

00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:08,480
to specific CF deployment releases and

00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:10,850
that involves doing some patches and

00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,350
Tullio are you online did you want to

00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:15,710
elaborate on this at all

00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:18,200
yeah so well since the CF deployment

00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:20,750
itself was not designed to run on

00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:23,120
Canaries what we have to do is think

00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:24,770
some some things and I'm going to show

00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:27,640
when I do the demo I'm going to show

00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:37,190
like a few ups files that we use to

00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:40,130
trick that behavior okay some very

00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:44,990
important questions we need to decide on

00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:47,210
as a community we we of course have some

00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:50,960
preferences chip has expressed an

00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:54,230
opinion on this is where does this go

00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:57,040
whence is Adam eights at upstream is it

00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:59,830
a Cloud Foundry incubator project or

00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:01,970
should it be part of the quarks umbrella

00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:03,290
chip suggestion was that it was a

00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:07,700
separate we should be a separate project

00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:11,120
under the runtime PMC we've had a number

00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:14,300
of discussions with release integration

00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:18,140
with site about how this will work with

00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:19,550
CF deployment and of course something we

00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:22,730
have a little more control over is is

00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:26,060
when that happens we were very keen to

00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:28,160
get it in as soon as possible to raise

00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:32,960
the profile of cube CF so that everyone

00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:35,630
who's working on porting CF components

00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:39,230
to kubernetes know about it and know how

00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:42,500
it works we want to get another release

00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:44,480
out to get things stabilized so that the

00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:46,700
developers aren't pulled off answering

00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,140
questions where we know that it's just

00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:52,030
you know you have to do this little

00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:54,710
thing to get everything working so I

00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:57,290
communicated to a couple people at CFS

00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:59,060
that that we're gonna do it right away

00:26:57,290 --> 00:27:02,090
we're probably going to hold off for at

00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:04,130
least one more release of cube CF before

00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:06,500
we donate it we want to get some Doc's

00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:09,170
better in order only the brave and

00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:10,970
intrepid if have managed to find our way

00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:13,340
through I know dr. NIC has played with

00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:16,300
this with some success but we want to

00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:21,770
make it easy for people before before we

00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:24,260
release the hounds when we make the

00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:26,570
decision about where this goes

00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:32,330
we must be mindful of the fact that this

00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:35,330
is cube CF is the crucial source for to

00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:37,910
downstream distributions or our

00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:43,610
clarification platform from Sousa and

00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:45,230
IBM C fee so we need to know sorry sorry

00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:52,160
to jump in I think there is one person

00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:52,490
that is not muted we you thank you sorry

00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:56,480
about that

00:27:52,490 --> 00:28:01,150
great Troy I thought it was me so we

00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:04,669
just we need to take care about how

00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:09,559
sensitive this is and and

00:28:04,669 --> 00:28:12,710
be aware so I'm gonna mute now and I

00:28:09,559 --> 00:28:19,639
will stop sharing so that Tullio can

00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:25,429
share he's gonna give the demo I hope

00:28:19,639 --> 00:28:28,460
you all can see my screen I actually yes

00:28:25,429 --> 00:28:31,580
we can see okay cool

00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:35,899
you know the check that we all do every

00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:41,269
time I'm going to just start showing you

00:28:35,899 --> 00:28:44,330
guys a typical value start one more that

00:28:41,269 --> 00:28:48,409
we use to deploy cubes here this is a

00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:50,419
this is not the actual one that Troy

00:28:48,409 --> 00:28:52,820
used to deploy on the cluster that I'm

00:28:50,419 --> 00:28:56,029
going to show but it's very similar and

00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:58,220
the the requirements the central

00:28:56,029 --> 00:29:01,190
requirement is the system to make that's

00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:05,539
what you have to to define right like

00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:08,509
what founder cannot just guess the

00:29:05,539 --> 00:29:11,389
system domain and this is going to go

00:29:08,509 --> 00:29:16,129
away in 0.2 it's here just to show how

00:29:11,389 --> 00:29:20,350
we do own 0.1 and we also have the

00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:23,509
features property which enables us

00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:25,549
allows us to enable feature so for

00:29:23,509 --> 00:29:27,950
example and the culture that I'm going

00:29:25,549 --> 00:29:32,269
to show you you'll see Irina is enabled

00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:34,879
and ingress is enabled we have other

00:29:32,269 --> 00:29:37,159
features that we can't really question

00:29:34,879 --> 00:29:38,720
so can we yeah we're just doing dev

00:29:37,159 --> 00:29:41,330
testing of this thing can we just put in

00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,889
zero zero zero slash zero for those two

00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:48,409
ranges or do it do they need to be

00:29:42,889 --> 00:29:50,149
accurate I'm using 0.0 here because at

00:29:48,409 --> 00:29:55,549
this point it's going to be irrelevant

00:29:50,149 --> 00:29:57,440
easier about you the reason it's there

00:29:55,549 --> 00:30:00,080
in the first place it was a mistake that

00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:02,330
I dated to to to actually create a

00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:04,999
security group to talk to about red hub

00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:07,489
on 0.1 we are removing business here

00:30:04,999 --> 00:30:10,220
about you so at this point I'm using 0

00:30:07,489 --> 00:30:12,759
that 0 just to make it easy to run on

00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:12,759
that cluster

00:30:12,979 --> 00:30:22,259
okay I'm actually going to do this so we

00:30:18,929 --> 00:30:25,799
don't confuse anybody anymore so this is

00:30:22,259 --> 00:30:28,019
a typical values like one more if you

00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:32,429
want to add many features feel free to

00:30:28,019 --> 00:30:35,989
look up into the original values that

00:30:32,429 --> 00:30:40,709
were mode and you will see you will find

00:30:35,989 --> 00:30:50,700
all the the features that the recurrent

00:30:40,709 --> 00:31:00,839
currently have so here what I'm going to

00:30:50,700 --> 00:31:04,440
show you now is the cluster itself so

00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:07,940
these are all the pods so you can see we

00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:11,119
have the cube CF namespace

00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:14,119
with all the components that we are used

00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:17,479
to see with CF deployment with that with

00:31:14,119 --> 00:31:19,879
a minor a changes like for example we

00:31:17,479 --> 00:31:23,509
don't see the diego's itself instead we

00:31:19,879 --> 00:31:26,389
see a greeny because we activated it and

00:31:23,509 --> 00:31:31,239
we see a few jobs out of their original

00:31:26,389 --> 00:31:31,239
instance groups like the routing API and

00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:42,129
they schedule what we do have different

00:31:38,719 --> 00:31:44,869
is this other namespace that holds the

00:31:42,129 --> 00:31:51,079
the apps for ireenie

00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:55,359
and I'm going to show you the commands

00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:59,269
now that I use to to deploy this is a

00:31:55,359 --> 00:32:01,399
similar cluster that Freud what that's

00:31:59,269 --> 00:32:03,529
the one that I'm showing you guys first

00:32:01,399 --> 00:32:07,599
we create the namespace for cube C F and

00:32:03,529 --> 00:32:07,599
then we install the separator

00:32:08,389 --> 00:32:17,149
we use hell it it should work without

00:32:12,549 --> 00:32:20,929
passing any extra values but you can in

00:32:17,149 --> 00:32:26,539
some cases it may be useful and then we

00:32:20,929 --> 00:32:30,080
install cube CF here I'm using 0.1 not

00:32:26,539 --> 00:32:33,480
chip master and I'm using that values

00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:36,179
that I just showed you guys

00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:39,840
and then we can interact with the

00:32:36,179 --> 00:32:45,390
cluster so here I just applied the

00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:49,520
twelfth neutral factor app you can see

00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:55,230
some logs you can see the app running

00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:59,280
and we can we can access or this other

00:32:55,230 --> 00:33:08,010
cluster here we can even access it

00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:14,150
through the browser of course and we can

00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:14,150
live into a another push here

00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:25,539
same same experience study that

00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:30,100
everybody please use with not

00:33:25,539 --> 00:33:37,259
I'm going to show you now a few pieces

00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:40,960
of code so this is we have a a bunch of

00:33:37,259 --> 00:33:44,350
ops files here and like I mentioned

00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:47,340
before they are used to either add

00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:50,950
functionality to CF deployments that is

00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:55,629
specific to kubernetes so for example of

00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:58,480
probes health checks parts that we need

00:33:55,629 --> 00:34:02,769
to open October Nettie's and we do this

00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:06,220
by adding the parts properties for the

00:34:02,769 --> 00:34:08,710
jobs so for example here we are doing a

00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:11,260
readiness probe on the parts to 2 to 3

00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:14,530
for the ssh proxy and we are also

00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:19,089
opening the part 2 to future and this

00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:25,260
parts property properties is handled by

00:34:19,089 --> 00:34:28,389
CFO creator to create services or to

00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:34,299
create the pods with the proper health

00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:36,609
checks another thing that we have to do

00:34:34,299 --> 00:34:38,379
like I mention like patches we have two

00:34:36,609 --> 00:34:42,040
pre-rendered scripts and a bunch of

00:34:38,379 --> 00:34:45,129
patches to trick functionality from some

00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:49,210
jobs in this case I'm patching the

00:34:45,129 --> 00:34:53,619
routing API and changing for example the

00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:58,169
BPM one more file in this case and then

00:34:53,619 --> 00:34:58,169
we are able to make it run on two ns

00:34:59,819 --> 00:35:06,960
and this is it for my demo any questions

00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:16,079
thanks to you

00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:21,840
[Music]

00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:34,650
so what's next

00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:39,930
as Julio showed all of the stuff that

00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:42,360
goes to make kubernetes cf release comes

00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:46,560
right now from Bosch with a with a

00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:48,750
couple of exceptions coming in we

00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:51,690
designed it of course before any of the

00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:53,640
efforts of the upstream teams started to

00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:56,820
turn their components into kubernetes

00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:59,400
native components so Bosch was the

00:35:56,820 --> 00:36:05,180
lingua franca for for what we've built

00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:07,790
here that said now that this kubernetes

00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:10,410
movement has started happening upstream

00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:13,530
we're going to also consume other types

00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:16,170
of artifacts to combine them into the

00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:18,360
release within cube CF so the first of

00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:20,940
those artifacts will be held charts the

00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:24,420
ireenie team expressed an opinion that

00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:27,720
they would rather deliver rather than a

00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:30,480
Bosch release deliver just a helm with

00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:32,310
some reservations about helm chart sweet

00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:36,060
everyone who's working with helm has a

00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:39,810
few reservations at least about them or

00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:42,600
or and so cube CF has the ability to

00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:45,390
consume other Bosch releases now we are

00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:48,420
in the works we're working on for

00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:53,460
example subbing out the the database

00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:56,790
component instead of using the one the

00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:58,710
CF my sequel to instead of using the

00:36:56,790 --> 00:37:01,830
Bosch release of that trying out some

00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:07,670
helm charts for some highly available my

00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:11,520
sequel databases like Marina DB we could

00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:13,350
add support to add cumin and ECMO

00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:15,950
directly unten plated kubernetes

00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:20,760
configuration and container images and

00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:25,020
we've seen demos from Dmitriy on ytt

00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:28,110
templated release artifacts and we could

00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:30,810
also consume those and make those start

00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:33,630
of a CF cube CF release but we would

00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:35,910
need help from the the

00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:37,859
teams that are making those components

00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:40,109
and making those choices of how they

00:37:37,859 --> 00:37:44,309
want to package their their components

00:37:40,109 --> 00:37:48,000
would need help in the cube CF team to

00:37:44,309 --> 00:37:49,799
to get those integrated but but it's our

00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:55,380
intention to make this extensible and

00:37:49,799 --> 00:37:57,150
it's our intention to eventually replace

00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:59,430
all of the Bosch releases with

00:37:57,150 --> 00:38:02,119
kubernetes native components very much

00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:05,220
built into the design of cube CF that

00:38:02,119 --> 00:38:08,309
over time is can evolve rather than

00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:10,230
stopping work altogether on all of our

00:38:08,309 --> 00:38:14,519
stuff and rebuilding everything on

00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:17,279
kubernetes this Cube CF was designed to

00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:19,200
give us a path to gradually move so we

00:38:17,279 --> 00:38:21,150
can still have releases even though

00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,710
maybe all the component teams haven't

00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:24,210
ported their stuff to kubernetes fully

00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:28,890
yet because we have things to

00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:32,670
automatically port that so likewise the

00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:34,799
kubernetes this CF operator the CF

00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:36,750
operator right now is very complex and

00:38:34,799 --> 00:38:38,009
we understand that it's very complex

00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:43,829
it's very complex for a reason because

00:38:38,009 --> 00:38:46,890
it has to translate Bosch into something

00:38:43,829 --> 00:38:48,690
that communities can understand ideally

00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:51,900
it would not have to be so complex we

00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:55,619
can start removing more and more of that

00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:58,559
complexity as the individual components

00:38:55,619 --> 00:39:02,910
of C far start to be ported to

00:38:58,559 --> 00:39:06,569
communities we would ask anyone who's

00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:11,190
working on cube native components or

00:39:06,569 --> 00:39:14,369
we've seen the proposal on cube

00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:16,740
idiomatic guidelines anyone who's

00:39:14,369 --> 00:39:19,890
working on that stuff we would love to

00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:22,829
have some interaction with them between

00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:25,259
them and the cube CF team and consult us

00:39:22,829 --> 00:39:28,680
about how to integrate what they're

00:39:25,259 --> 00:39:30,690
doing into cube CF that's actually the

00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:34,980
primary goal of this whole presentation

00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:39,599
is to internally evangelized this point

00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:46,230
of contact between cube CF team quarks

00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:46,640
team and the component teams and about

00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:49,220
why

00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:51,589
what we can do to help some of you know

00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:53,930
that a number of the Sousa team have

00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:55,789
been working on trying to get cloud

00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:58,490
foundry to run on kubernetes for about

00:39:55,789 --> 00:40:01,549
five years since before the $1 release

00:39:58,490 --> 00:40:04,549
of kubernetes we learned a lot of

00:40:01,549 --> 00:40:06,920
painful lessons over that time and we

00:40:04,549 --> 00:40:09,920
would love to help people avoid those

00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:12,950
and learn from the experience a lot of

00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:15,230
people first dealing with kubernetes

00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:16,490
will assume that it will all make sense

00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:18,200
and everything will work beautifully

00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:19,490
because that's what the hype is about so

00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:23,960
there are a lot of pitfalls that we

00:40:19,490 --> 00:40:27,289
would love to surface and allow the rest

00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:29,260
of Cloud Foundry development to avoid so

00:40:27,289 --> 00:40:33,440
please don't repeat our mistakes

00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:36,200
sounds like a conference submission here

00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,890
I could definitely do that I am happy to

00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:40,250
of all this

00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:42,890
I've also promised Catelyn a blog post

00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:44,510
about this to this all this all started

00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:47,269
this presentation started with my post

00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:50,029
to CF dev exhorting people to come in

00:40:47,269 --> 00:40:51,829
and become familiar with cube CF and

00:40:50,029 --> 00:40:53,450
what we're trying to do so that we can

00:40:51,829 --> 00:40:55,309
get a coordinated effort towards

00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:59,539
everyone running beautifully on

00:40:55,309 --> 00:41:01,099
kubernetes so I mean oh yeah

00:40:59,539 --> 00:41:02,690
you've also got a bunch of interesting

00:41:01,099 --> 00:41:07,250
general-purpose things that are in the

00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:11,900
CF operator that might the world like

00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:14,690
the yeah so we again that's a good point

00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:17,390
we had to put those in and the initial

00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:18,559
intention was we can make these useful

00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:22,269
for everyone we could even try and

00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:24,109
submit them upstream to kubernetes but

00:41:22,269 --> 00:41:25,759
actually even within terms that we're

00:41:24,109 --> 00:41:28,039
not completely unanimous that that's a

00:41:25,759 --> 00:41:31,579
good direction to go in maybe we should

00:41:28,039 --> 00:41:35,740
just focus on providing in the operator

00:41:31,579 --> 00:41:39,829
only what is absolutely necessary to run

00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:41,299
run see far on kubernetes so yes it's

00:41:39,829 --> 00:41:43,759
there and it's good stuff

00:41:41,299 --> 00:41:45,529
and it should be a lot of those things

00:41:43,759 --> 00:41:47,779
should be kubernetes features we'd love

00:41:45,529 --> 00:41:50,869
to get those either as independent

00:41:47,779 --> 00:41:54,079
operators or submitted upstream but at

00:41:50,869 --> 00:41:57,109
the same time we realize the CF operator

00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:59,660
is very complicated because it's

00:41:57,109 --> 00:42:00,470
providing extended functionality to

00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:04,670
kubernetes we

00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:06,289
ideally we wouldn't have to use so that

00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:09,109
actually segways make things like my

00:42:06,289 --> 00:42:12,109
first seed question here which is why is

00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:13,880
it so complicated because there's a lot

00:42:12,109 --> 00:42:19,160
of stuff that Bosh does that kubernetes

00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:24,400
doesn't so yes even in kubernetes

00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:24,400
certificates suck yeah yeah exactly

00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:29,720
and oh yeah I wanted to call it the

00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:33,049
kubernetes idiomatic component

00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:35,569
guidelines and I forgot who authored

00:42:33,049 --> 00:42:39,640
that they are any team somebody remind

00:42:35,569 --> 00:42:43,400
me it's a pivot from the other any team

00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:45,380
and it's being shopped around and and

00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:47,750
we're contributing feedback to that

00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:51,920
people are chiming in with how they feel

00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:56,990
about those guidelines they are not very

00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:58,940
opinionated yet and I think we may get a

00:42:56,990 --> 00:43:00,410
lot of teams departing in different

00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:02,750
directions and doing things in radically

00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:04,730
different ways which is a good learning

00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:06,859
experience but I'd argue that we don't

00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:10,519
have a lot of time to learn this stuff

00:43:06,859 --> 00:43:13,910
and that and that stricter guidelines

00:43:10,519 --> 00:43:18,190
are tooling to enforce a certain amount

00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:18,190
of conformity would probably be helpful

00:43:20,019 --> 00:43:26,799
other questions

00:43:23,529 --> 00:43:30,589
smoke tests how do you run smoke tests

00:43:26,799 --> 00:43:36,769
or errands in general purely on you

00:43:30,589 --> 00:43:40,089
after that oh yes so let's see 15 can I

00:43:36,769 --> 00:43:45,160
share this wait maybe it's easier to

00:43:40,089 --> 00:43:45,160
just show you go ahead

00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:48,960
[Music]

00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:58,330
okay so we we have it actually automated

00:43:55,960 --> 00:44:01,420
here with basil so it's easier to

00:43:58,330 --> 00:44:29,710
trigger from CI but basically we are

00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:34,750
doing a cubes channel edit all the so

00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:44,940
it's something this what we do is that

00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:44,940
we we edit the is no press parks job so

00:44:54,810 --> 00:45:01,240
it's not activated in this cluster but

00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:05,860
we do have a quartz job that is talking

00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:26,500
a minute again sorry again that you had

00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:27,130
that edit command and then this yeah

00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:33,600
sorry

00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:36,970
I usually trigger with basil is that

00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:41,890
just how to get that quartz job through

00:45:36,970 --> 00:45:45,970
the bug is jumbled I sorry I have a good

00:45:41,890 --> 00:45:47,590
time to understand this question if you

00:45:45,970 --> 00:45:50,320
could try to explain how to get the

00:45:47,590 --> 00:45:54,940
quartz job for the smoke test through

00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:58,119
the bar oh yes yes

00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:58,119
[Music]

00:45:59,810 --> 00:46:07,050
in the values were more we have this

00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:10,770
test and we do have the is no test by

00:46:07,050 --> 00:46:14,060
default true for production but we do

00:46:10,770 --> 00:46:16,980
not have this cat and then even bring us

00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:20,910
so you can come and passed us in

00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:23,400
whatever you wants to to deploy whatever

00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:27,930
what's a reindeer will do brain caring

00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:37,579
Tessa Sousa it is a Sousa acceptance

00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:37,579
this and what Maru happens that a

00:46:37,849 --> 00:46:44,430
inerrant becomes a quark job so set

00:46:41,550 --> 00:46:48,869
operator detects collects like cooking

00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:50,640
and arrange a trade secret job but the

00:46:48,869 --> 00:46:53,550
quarks job is not triggered

00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:58,589
automatically and this is why we have to

00:46:53,550 --> 00:47:00,810
to round this patch on the job and we

00:46:58,589 --> 00:47:03,869
are basically saying strategy now and

00:47:00,810 --> 00:47:06,569
what it does is the controller for the

00:47:03,869 --> 00:47:11,700
courts job creates a job that actually

00:47:06,569 --> 00:47:13,980
runs in the cluster the tests and that's

00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:15,390
we can make a week I don't know I know

00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:19,410
you've got your basil thing but we could

00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:21,990
make a little coops cuddle plug in to

00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:27,210
sort of map these sort of ideas to sort

00:47:21,990 --> 00:47:29,270
of fear down oh yeah happy with the

00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:32,069
basil things but that's obviously

00:47:29,270 --> 00:47:39,089
playing suffering and you wrote them for

00:47:32,069 --> 00:47:42,210
everyone else I guess the other on the

00:47:39,089 --> 00:47:44,160
CI part and for development it's quicker

00:47:42,210 --> 00:47:46,290
but not for production we definitely

00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:48,960
need to add these commands to the

00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:53,190
documentation and this is how you knew

00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:55,829
Lancelot and you can just edit the file

00:47:53,190 --> 00:48:02,099
and change it in your text editor and

00:47:55,829 --> 00:48:04,849
save it you can yes absolutely

00:48:02,099 --> 00:48:04,849
okay

00:48:06,579 --> 00:48:21,380
we'll be something like that right I

00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:28,910
don't have it here so it will fail and

00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:29,480
then you manually trigger it okay good

00:48:28,910 --> 00:48:35,480
question

00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:39,589
exactly thank you okay I don't see

00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:43,009
anything in the chat you see lots of

00:48:39,589 --> 00:48:45,440
information and contact points and I

00:48:43,009 --> 00:48:47,029
guess you guys are part of the ESC goes

00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:48,859
alright so you can yeah

00:48:47,029 --> 00:48:50,210
and that's where we that's where a lot

00:48:48,859 --> 00:48:55,309
of the discussion came up about how

00:48:50,210 --> 00:48:58,400
we're going to to keep keep our efforts

00:48:55,309 --> 00:48:59,900
in line with the efforts of the

00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:03,410
component teams I just wanted to I

00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:06,499
missed a slide on my way earlier just a

00:49:03,410 --> 00:49:08,660
bit of a timeline 100 of C F operator

00:49:06,499 --> 00:49:13,759
was December 20th we've had another

00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:18,380
really since cube CF we're gonna have a

00:49:13,759 --> 00:49:20,569
zero dot 2.0 very soon lots of great

00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:23,119
feedback from the community notably from

00:49:20,569 --> 00:49:27,279
dr. NIC a lot of those fixes are going

00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:32,329
in and we hope to have keeps EF 1.0.0

00:49:27,279 --> 00:49:34,970
March 2020 and that will be the point at

00:49:32,329 --> 00:49:38,930
which we move it upstream but possibly

00:49:34,970 --> 00:49:43,489
sooner we can talk a little bit about

00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:44,930
that offline but what what good timing

00:49:43,489 --> 00:49:49,670
for that is if it's good to announce

00:49:44,930 --> 00:49:53,180
that it at Sousa con or some other thing

00:49:49,670 --> 00:49:54,470
but yeah we just want to get some more

00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:55,999
documentation in place so that people

00:49:54,470 --> 00:49:58,009
don't get confused when they come to the

00:49:55,999 --> 00:49:59,269
repo when they know what to do know how

00:49:58,009 --> 00:50:04,880
to run the acceptance tests and all

00:49:59,269 --> 00:50:06,680
those things these are the links I guess

00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:09,470
I could put a link to this presentation

00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:15,369
in the agenda so people can know where

00:50:09,470 --> 00:50:15,369
to find it any any further questions

00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:23,650
that's good thanks giant truck Julia

00:50:20,369 --> 00:50:28,180
okay cool yeah I second but thank you

00:50:23,650 --> 00:50:31,690
very much on slack with them we have one

00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:35,170
more final presentation with it also let

00:50:31,690 --> 00:50:40,740
me share my screen and then we'll get to

00:50:35,170 --> 00:50:44,770
it so I think you have to now allow it

00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:55,210
if you have it okay can you guys see my

00:50:44,770 --> 00:50:58,270
screen okay still in the past three

00:50:55,210 --> 00:51:00,700
years I've done this survey and I've

00:50:58,270 --> 00:51:01,510
been running these meetings and I'm

00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:04,750
happy to do it

00:51:01,510 --> 00:51:06,790
but obviously at some point maybe it

00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:08,589
makes sense to change and that's one of

00:51:06,790 --> 00:51:10,990
the big difference within with this

00:51:08,589 --> 00:51:12,670
survey versus previous surveys but let's

00:51:10,990 --> 00:51:14,829
go through the results and then we can

00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:16,570
hopefully have like a couple minutes to

00:51:14,829 --> 00:51:19,960
discuss so I have seven minutes on my

00:51:16,570 --> 00:51:23,290
clock so I send this out hopefully you

00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:26,680
guys took it we had about 20 for

00:51:23,290 --> 00:51:29,500
response but the goal is to do kind of

00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:33,790
an informal retro and collect feedback

00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:36,819
and I the the responses are anonymous

00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:42,550
but some people actually volunteer their

00:51:36,819 --> 00:51:45,040
names like Sorna but you know the point

00:51:42,550 --> 00:51:47,980
is to try to find out information right

00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:49,480
from the community and see what works

00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:51,579
and what doesn't work and let's see if

00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:55,960
we can adjust we do it once a year so

00:51:51,579 --> 00:51:58,900
it's not too much to ask at all so the

00:51:55,960 --> 00:52:01,329
first question was have you attended the

00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:03,430
cab call in 2019 just to get a feel for

00:52:01,329 --> 00:52:06,010
how many people attending and how much

00:52:03,430 --> 00:52:10,210
are they attending what did you enjoy

00:52:06,010 --> 00:52:12,880
the most and this is a new question does

00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:17,010
it need new leadership the cab you know

00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:20,770
the community calls and then construct

00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:22,569
constructive feedback I keep it short

00:52:20,770 --> 00:52:25,150
because I want people to actually take

00:52:22,569 --> 00:52:27,400
the survey because as you know you've

00:52:25,150 --> 00:52:29,380
taken surveys when they have a lot of

00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:33,130
questions you

00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:35,590
stop halfway so these are the results we

00:52:33,130 --> 00:52:37,680
had only 41 percent completion rate but

00:52:35,590 --> 00:52:39,370
this is the highest we've ever had so

00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:42,340
this is pretty good

00:52:39,370 --> 00:52:44,860
34 responses and it took about 20

00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:46,420
seconds on average for people to respond

00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:48,460
so if you didn't take it thinking it

00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:52,030
would take you a lot of time just know

00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:56,110
it's very quick next time so these are

00:52:52,030 --> 00:52:59,590
the responses for the first question you

00:52:56,110 --> 00:53:01,660
can see that we only have a few regular

00:52:59,590 --> 00:53:03,670
participant and a few and the majority

00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:05,530
are attending every now and then I guess

00:53:03,670 --> 00:53:07,270
it makes sense because people look at

00:53:05,530 --> 00:53:10,150
their schedule and look at what's gonna

00:53:07,270 --> 00:53:12,010
be presented and if it's not of interest

00:53:10,150 --> 00:53:14,590
then they don't attend like today it was

00:53:12,010 --> 00:53:16,630
clearly a good attendance because a lot

00:53:14,590 --> 00:53:20,860
of people want to hear about coops yep

00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:22,930
so that was that was good so these are

00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:26,020
the results and I think maybe we had one

00:53:22,930 --> 00:53:28,780
every questions I allow people to put

00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:30,850
some text and you can see that some

00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:34,450
people say they read the call notes and

00:53:30,850 --> 00:53:36,340
that's the one comment that came so

00:53:34,450 --> 00:53:40,180
question two what did you enjoy the most

00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:44,410
and what I did is I looked at the

00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:47,920
responses and I cab you lated the words

00:53:44,410 --> 00:53:48,730
and did a count and then a tag cloud

00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:50,860
which I'll show you

00:53:48,730 --> 00:53:53,170
so people definitely love demos and you

00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:55,870
can see right like the the presentation

00:53:53,170 --> 00:54:00,580
today with the demo that Toby I did it

00:53:55,870 --> 00:54:03,060
with Troy it really helps you know kind

00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:06,190
of make it interesting for folks so

00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:09,490
clearly keeping presentations that

00:54:06,190 --> 00:54:11,790
include demos is key obviously people

00:54:09,490 --> 00:54:14,880
want to know about the projects and

00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:17,830
about the community what's going on and

00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:21,160
the presentations I only listed the top

00:54:17,830 --> 00:54:23,680
five of the words out of the responses

00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:26,170
and people loved the updates so this is

00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:28,570
the tag cloud and you can see that

00:54:26,170 --> 00:54:30,790
basically demos is key and hearing

00:54:28,570 --> 00:54:34,570
presentation projects so it actually you

00:54:30,790 --> 00:54:38,590
know really represents what people enjoy

00:54:34,570 --> 00:54:40,450
the most so these are

00:54:38,590 --> 00:54:43,030
some highlights from the responses

00:54:40,450 --> 00:54:44,500
somebody says always cool I don't know

00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:47,760
if it's water but I'm guessing it's her

00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:50,050
she's been very positive I love that but

00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:51,580
you know we want to also hear the

00:54:50,050 --> 00:54:55,060
negative part or at least the things

00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:57,160
that we can improve but it seems like

00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:59,380
these are kind of the highlights I just

00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:01,000
looked at the responses and picked the

00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:04,810
highlights towards the end of the slides

00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:07,870
I pasted all the responses wore the data

00:55:04,810 --> 00:55:11,020
so you can take a look at up all right

00:55:07,870 --> 00:55:13,830
so question 4 and this is important to

00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:16,720
me because I'm the one that's asking it

00:55:13,830 --> 00:55:20,440
now discuss it towards the end but let's

00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:25,720
look at the results so people say you

00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:28,300
know about 20% said yes and then the

00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:33,160
rest said no because I made this too you

00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:35,740
know yes no question and these are some

00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:38,710
of the highlights because this question

00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:40,720
only had yes or no and then a way to

00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:43,480
provide feedback to people say oh I'm

00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:47,530
sure somebody said new blood I love that

00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:49,390
it's not me I didn't take the survey and

00:55:47,530 --> 00:55:50,800
there are a couple people saying really

00:55:49,390 --> 00:55:55,900
good things about me I appreciate that

00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:58,450
but I think you know the this call works

00:55:55,900 --> 00:56:00,760
because of you attending and people

00:55:58,450 --> 00:56:02,860
presenting so how do we move forward and

00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:04,450
that's I think that's one of the reason

00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:08,430
I asked that question but let's discuss

00:56:04,450 --> 00:56:13,420
it with Xion so that's the response here

00:56:08,430 --> 00:56:16,330
I know I love I love you too and I love

00:56:13,420 --> 00:56:30,120
the love but at some point we'll have to

00:56:16,330 --> 00:56:32,950
figure out I'll still attend also right

00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:36,550
ok so let's look at the constructive

00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:38,050
feedback Thank You Wayne so this is you

00:56:36,550 --> 00:56:42,280
know what constructive feedback you have

00:56:38,050 --> 00:56:45,550
and seem that people said no none so

00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:49,060
basically they love what's going on and

00:56:45,550 --> 00:56:50,680
of course presentation was an item that

00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:51,760
came up and I'll show you some of the

00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:55,840
text

00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:58,840
more I think presentation and team means

00:56:55,840 --> 00:57:01,300
and good so these are were the words

00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:03,190
that featured the most out of the

00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:05,740
responses and I kind of like summarized

00:57:03,190 --> 00:57:08,619
it as none more team's presentation good

00:57:05,740 --> 00:57:12,760
right so that's kind of how it worked

00:57:08,619 --> 00:57:15,490
out the data and this is kind of the tag

00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:17,770
cloud and you can see that people are

00:57:15,490 --> 00:57:20,290
not asking for any changes they want

00:57:17,770 --> 00:57:23,650
more presentations and probably teams

00:57:20,290 --> 00:57:25,690
updates as well so that that was a cloud

00:57:23,650 --> 00:57:28,690
the tag cloud so these are the

00:57:25,690 --> 00:57:29,230
highlights from the responses keep up

00:57:28,690 --> 00:57:34,060
the good work

00:57:29,230 --> 00:57:38,980
none perhaps support Abby or chip could

00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:42,609
give a cab reinvigorated interest maybe

00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:47,080
they could guess present so here is one

00:57:42,609 --> 00:57:49,180
thing you know feedback for chip I'll

00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:51,400
ping them and see if they make you see

00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:53,410
see if it makes sense for the next one

00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:55,440
they could come in present but chip is

00:57:53,410 --> 00:57:59,680
always there and Abby does in AME so

00:57:55,440 --> 00:58:02,560
then you know I'm not so sure how to how

00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:05,530
to take this one but that was one of the

00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:07,270
feedback this one I was also interesting

00:58:05,530 --> 00:58:08,890
like maybe ask individual component

00:58:07,270 --> 00:58:10,750
seems to also present there would maps

00:58:08,890 --> 00:58:12,910
in more detail I think that's actually a

00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:17,680
excellent feedback in the sense that you

00:58:12,910 --> 00:58:19,450
know getting a you know p.m. present

00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:21,550
there would map instead of just saying

00:58:19,450 --> 00:58:23,290
hey here's the word map will read it or

00:58:21,550 --> 00:58:24,990
attend a bunch of course to get the word

00:58:23,290 --> 00:58:27,010
map this call might be a good place to

00:58:24,990 --> 00:58:30,450
actually present or would match so I

00:58:27,010 --> 00:58:32,500
thought that was really nice and then

00:58:30,450 --> 00:58:35,590
one person said there was a negative

00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:37,840
what is CF good for torn into cabs that

00:58:35,590 --> 00:58:40,450
I attended I definitely would not want

00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:42,580
this to be the case if that was a case

00:58:40,450 --> 00:58:45,010
and who definitely tried to figure out

00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:46,690
how to fix that but that's a feedback

00:58:45,010 --> 00:58:49,720
and I thought that was good feedback in

00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:51,460
a sense I could definitely see that tone

00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:53,290
perhaps bleeding through is everybody

00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:54,910
questions the future of where we're

00:58:53,290 --> 00:58:56,680
going with things especially in light of

00:58:54,910 --> 00:58:59,080
kubernetes adoption and all this other

00:58:56,680 --> 00:59:01,060
stuff so you know try to figure out the

00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:03,130
differentiation and I suspect something

00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:05,970
that tongue might come from those style

00:59:03,130 --> 00:59:09,750
discussions and one ponder

00:59:05,970 --> 00:59:13,260
yeah yeah that's good feedback I this

00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:15,690
good point where I think you know 2019

00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:18,869
was probably the pivotal well you know

00:59:15,690 --> 00:59:21,960
no pun intended year for Cloud Foundry

00:59:18,869 --> 00:59:24,210
in a sense of figuring out that

00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:26,520
kubernetes strategy and you can see with

00:59:24,210 --> 00:59:28,440
Cube CF and Yuri me and all the other

00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:29,640
projects we're sort of getting there

00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:31,500
right

00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:34,920
so hopefully that tone will sort of

00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:37,790
disappear and that foundry will be what

00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:42,000
it is in the middle of the rest of

00:59:37,790 --> 00:59:46,260
cognitive and within kubernetes so

00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:48,300
that's the results these are the answers

00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:52,589
complete answers if you want to read

00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:57,869
them I pasted the link in the cab

00:59:52,589 --> 01:00:01,109
channel and also in the agenda and then

00:59:57,869 --> 01:00:03,810
I'll paste it again other places if you

01:00:01,109 --> 01:00:05,670
want but I think let me open it for

01:00:03,810 --> 01:00:07,109
questions we are out of time but I think

01:00:05,670 --> 01:00:10,170
one of the things that I want to try to

01:00:07,109 --> 01:00:13,820
do is to see if people would want to

01:00:10,170 --> 01:00:17,790
volunteer to - to either replace me or

01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:19,770
code you know lead it with me until the

01:00:17,790 --> 01:00:21,500
point where they can take it over I mean

01:00:19,770 --> 01:00:25,349
I've been doing this for three years

01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:27,780
that would be the foot here and I'm not

01:00:25,349 --> 01:00:29,400
tired of it I'm happy to to meet with

01:00:27,780 --> 01:00:32,430
Wayne and dr. Nick and everybody else

01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:34,950
right but at some point it makes sense

01:00:32,430 --> 01:00:36,780
to give other people an opportunity and

01:00:34,950 --> 01:00:39,440
there's probably like new ideas right

01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:43,050
that could come in and I'm involved and

01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:46,680
other things now mostly you know key

01:00:43,050 --> 01:00:48,240
native and and so on so you know I don't

01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:50,280
have a lot of information I don't have a

01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:54,020
lot to add all I'm doing is pretty much

01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:57,240
you know organizing and providing some

01:00:54,020 --> 01:00:59,940
input here and there I think this was

01:00:57,240 --> 01:01:02,820
mentioned in the November call or been

01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:05,430
aware our last call was before we went

01:01:02,820 --> 01:01:06,480
out for the holidays that it might be

01:01:05,430 --> 01:01:08,310
worth that you're getting some

01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:10,890
volunteers to host these individual

01:01:08,310 --> 01:01:14,580
meetings while you still at least for

01:01:10,890 --> 01:01:16,230
the time for the mountain time frame for

01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:18,510
the time being even if you want to

01:01:16,230 --> 01:01:19,300
continue hosting like leading these

01:01:18,510 --> 01:01:22,510
calls

01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:24,760
if someone wants to step up and or gonna

01:01:22,510 --> 01:01:27,550
be the host for just that particular

01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:28,900
call that in during that occurrence I

01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:31,810
think that could be a great way to just

01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:34,060
get started get get to see what it takes

01:01:31,810 --> 01:01:36,550
to put the call together put the agenda

01:01:34,060 --> 01:01:39,370
together reach out to the folks and get

01:01:36,550 --> 01:01:42,310
the updates and also be that host or the

01:01:39,370 --> 01:01:43,810
emcee of the call for that occurrence I

01:01:42,310 --> 01:01:46,390
think that would be a great way for them

01:01:43,810 --> 01:01:48,580
to step up and get the experience at the

01:01:46,390 --> 01:01:53,340
same time get a little taste of what it

01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:56,740
takes and also get their get get their

01:01:53,340 --> 01:01:57,910
brand also established in our community

01:01:56,740 --> 01:02:01,900
if that is something that they would

01:01:57,910 --> 01:02:04,000
like to do cool yeah I think I think

01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:06,130
that makes a lot of sense Mona so if you

01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:08,830
want to volunteer somebody or better if

01:02:06,130 --> 01:02:10,750
you want to volunteer yourself then ping

01:02:08,830 --> 01:02:13,450
me or pings for now and then we'll see

01:02:10,750 --> 01:02:16,750
if we can tag you in the next one or the

01:02:13,450 --> 01:02:18,670
one after the next one so with that we

01:02:16,750 --> 01:02:20,350
are six minutes over time well

01:02:18,670 --> 01:02:23,350
