	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,890
multiplexing looks like it oh we got

00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:09,300
some post there alright I think I think

00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:14,730
what we can get started with very

00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:20,270
quickly his CFS update and I got a chat

00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:22,470
form from chip that he can't make it but

00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:30,359
you should have somebody to replace

00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:34,710
anything and it should be the new person

00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:36,980
running everything like the Swarna

00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:43,770
Budhia I think she should be here you

00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:46,110
might be a mute no not yet okay she

00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,640
probably is trying to figure out this

00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:50,090
this whole thing so let's give people a

00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,090
few minutes

00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:58,810
um let me also ping her if you know if

00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:01,330
you've been communicating with small

00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:03,100
enough maybe it might be nice if you

00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:05,220
could just tell her I'm trying to do

00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,220
this

00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:13,770
you

00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:28,320
so just a few more minutes as we get

00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:35,780
everybody and since we were a little bit

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:35,780
late to get the new the new number out

00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:54,860
all right is anybody else from the

00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:58,130
foundation here I guess Chris is your

00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:58,130
yeah I'm here

00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,770
I'm pinging Swarna right now all right

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,259
okay

00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:10,830
so thank you sis so let's let's give er

00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:12,300
it's 507 here but I guess we're seven

00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:14,010
minutes late so that give one more

00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:16,050
minute and if not we'll just get started

00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:18,410
and then we'll get to swarm oh and she

00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:18,410
gets here

00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:50,300
all right just 30 more seconds we'll get

00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:51,560
started all right let's get started and

00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:54,860
then we'll get to her when she gets

00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:57,170
there so I think so apologies for this

00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:59,630
little hiccup I think part of the

00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:01,730
problem is maybe the conference since we

00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:05,950
only used it once a month it's causing

00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:08,900
this but I think zoom has a way to use

00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:11,470
letters instead of numbers so maybe we

00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:14,180
can try to use that as a as a

00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:16,160
indirection so I'll see if I can set up

00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:19,520
one for xcf cap so that way people

00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:21,410
always remember it anyway maybe what

00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:32,230
we'll do is get project highlights I see

00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:35,370
that U is there with thanking Danny and

00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:35,370
[Music]

00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:55,760
yeah yeah yeah sure I think this is kind

00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:59,480
of at the intersection of Bosch and CF

00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:01,160
but the Diego team for example is now

00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:03,590
running an environment where a console

00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:07,040
is entirely removed so that's pretty

00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:09,200
exciting it's been been working fine and

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,730
so we're obviously relying on Bosch DNS

00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:15,110
for service discovery in that

00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:16,430
environment some things on the Diego

00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:19,340
side we've been working with the routing

00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:22,490
team to finish out this track work

00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:25,660
around ensuring integrity of connections

00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:28,790
from the garage application back ends by

00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:31,490
making TLS connections and verifying the

00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:33,170
instance identity credentials so again

00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:34,760
that's almost done I think there's just

00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:37,640
one little router bug that we need to

00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:40,310
resolve before we could recommend

00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:42,820
turning it on experimentally in some

00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,820
environments

00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:51,110
and Greek I slide Jules on on the line

00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:52,700
if he wants to talk about all the

00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:56,030
miscellaneous things that Guardian

00:04:52,700 --> 00:05:01,550
greeted vest is working on Oh God

00:04:56,030 --> 00:05:02,870
how long do you have I can't I have to

00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,880
pick it's like picking your favorite

00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:08,060
child

00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:14,270
interesting time Jules we're gonna

00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:17,960
wee-wee garden is now run time so we're

00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:21,440
about to enable that on a subset of

00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:23,030
cells in PWS to see what blows up but

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,910
we're fairly confident nothing will blow

00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:27,680
up and if so we're going to start the

00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:30,110
transition over and the main upshot

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:33,350
that's important for community people is

00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:34,970
this means it's finally finally time if

00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:39,080
you still have privileged containers

00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:41,330
running you need to fairly urgently

00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:43,550
figure out how to get off privileged

00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:46,070
containers because we will no longer

00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:47,870
have the ability to create them so that

00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:51,320
hasn't been the default a really long

00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:52,910
time now and I can't I can't say

00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,860
strongly enough how much better

00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:57,470
unprivileged containers are in terms of

00:05:54,860 --> 00:06:02,600
security so there are a lot of reasons

00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:05,030
to move anyway but also people lose the

00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:20,840
abilities with rootless to even make

00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:23,540
them so it's time hey can hear me yeah I

00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:26,180
guess a quick update for build packs

00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:28,160
we're introducing an engine X build pack

00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:31,490
soon and you'll see an email about that

00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:33,140
to cff that'll take some of the use

00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:35,210
cases for the static file build pack

00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:38,390
that don't have to do with a static

00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:41,450
content you know those those use cases a

00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:43,700
new place to live we're also gonna send

00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:45,380
an email out soon about what the next

00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:49,190
distribution of the route FS will look

00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:50,900
like and what the timeline is there for

00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:53,060
it becoming available so that people can

00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:57,040
migrate over you know away from trusty

00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:59,230
which is going to end of life in 2019

00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:09,130
and we think other things going on but

00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:11,440
those the two main things oh yeah sure

00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:15,880
CF local just moved into the Cloud

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:17,380
Foundry incubator org officially and if

00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:19,990
anybody has feedback on that or

00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:21,990
suggestions feel free to leave issues on

00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:27,370
the github issue tracker

00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:30,520
I also seen that McNee do you want to

00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:33,220
talk about service C yeah yeah sure so

00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:34,750
we're almost at the end of service and

00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:36,550
sharing a lust which will be pretty good

00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:38,380
and we're working with the CLI team at

00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:40,420
the moment to do some PRS to get support

00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:43,600
in that hopefully by the next year a few

00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:45,220
weeks time and last night we kind of

00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,050
agreed with the open service broker egg

00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:49,780
API working group what I'm acing the

00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:53,790
bindings could look like so now we're

00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:59,100
ready to start work on that precinct and

00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:59,100
Simon Moser we've got some exciting news

00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:11,430
no well if I fight my unmute button I

00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:14,890
yes which is too excited I'm too excited

00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:17,800
yeah so we are finished well we

00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:19,750
basically finished with all the feature

00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,940
function functionalities that we have

00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:23,590
kind of been promising for the bit

00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:27,340
service and are starting to integrate

00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:29,830
that into the proper I apply and

00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:32,530
hopefully now with the help of this year

00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:34,540
from each integration team SATA said at

00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:36,880
one point in time down the road we might

00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:40,720
be able to make the bit service a

00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:42,940
default component in CF release or in CF

00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:46,810
deployment I should rather say and

00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:48,550
therefore heading it into the critical

00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:50,860
path of off the system and having a

00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:52,860
properly defined blobstore API once once

00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:56,440
that's happening

00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:59,290
there is some work upcoming for adding

00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:01,510
MPLS because so far we have we do not

00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:04,300
have a full support for MPLS so that's

00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:07,630
an ongoing work and we're also what to

00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:09,940
do some more work on optimizing resource

00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:13,420
matching and a bunch of other features

00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:16,270
but the majority of the pieces are done

00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:17,920
and we have been we're just about

00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:25,750
cutting the final release and publishing

00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:29,500
there to Bosch IO so there's lots of

00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:32,890
other updates you can find about many of

00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:36,280
the core run-time teams in the or

00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:39,940
application runtime teams in higher rpm

00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:45,010
cenotes repo few highlights there CF

00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:47,860
deployment is on PWS fully completely

00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:52,120
transitioned away from CIF release

00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:57,850
months EWS and Davidson Eddie is working

00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:59,890
on a set of instructions and planning to

00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:02,560
send out an email declaring one dato on

00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:09,280
Siesta claimant I'm very excited about

00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:12,640
that and looking at send setting

00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:15,280
cf released in two ish months give or

00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:25,320
take because of holidays and things like

00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:26,770
that so that's really excited that's a

00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,850
big deal

00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:32,760
and then as if you've looked over the

00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:35,290
certification requirements for next year

00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:38,170
they're they're actually referring to

00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:42,670
the individual releases instead of CF

00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:45,660
release so for for CF application

00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:50,350
runtime certification moving over to to

00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:52,500
CF deployment or will be needed well

00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:57,820
take a look at that and provide feedback

00:10:52,500 --> 00:11:02,350
on that as well cool Thank You Julian

00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:04,120
local team I have not been on my cell

00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:08,860
phone and iPad so I wasn't able to

00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:11,620
update so people can just Jack judge jut

00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:13,150
like a line on your thing what you what

00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,570
you said on the agenda that would be

00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:16,930
nice

00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:19,300
this was postera t okay so we move on to

00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:21,700
unless there any questions I don't see

00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:23,140
anything stacked up we'll move on to

00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:26,800
Bosch the

00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:29,080
the amazing thing is my friend Demetri

00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:32,530
is on vacation believe it or not he

00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:35,680
takes vacation so you're gonna have to

00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:38,470
give the update for a Demetri here so

00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:40,990
I'm happy that I can see you sorry to

00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:44,490
prevent you from eating but give us an

00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:47,860
update for Bosch please

00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:50,380
last week we released the latest version

00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:53,400
of Bosch it includes few things like

00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:57,130
generic configs so you can get multiple

00:11:53,400 --> 00:12:00,060
configurations to the director and let

00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:03,040
it deal with merging includes a few

00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:06,250
security improvements around like

00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:09,520
director - agent communications we

00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:13,680
continue to work and improve some of the

00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:13,680
internal security of the components

00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:20,800
we're working on bringing in the new

00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:26,220
boom - xenial stem cell it's one of the

00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:30,150
things we're working on and there's some

00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:32,980
yeah other tracks going on around like

00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:36,120
improving how we work with links kind of

00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:40,780
working around an API for that for

00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:44,290
external consumption and trying to

00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:49,390
finish up some basic support for ipv6 in

00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:53,260
stem cells I think that's the bulk of

00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:55,690
what I record cool thank you very much

00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:57,340
yeah that's a good update especially the

00:12:55,690 --> 00:13:01,720
Zinio that's what people can ask them

00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:06,370
that any questions either on runtime or

00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:08,680
a boss no all right so we'll move on to

00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:11,530
actually open service bulgar I'm happy

00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:14,470
Alex actually already added is update

00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:17,620
but you know I think he's he's on the

00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:19,600
call so maybe we can get him to tell us

00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:23,890
what's the highlight for open

00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:26,830
serviceworker API Alex yeah everyone so

00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:28,000
I just recap if you're new to the open

00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:30,490
service broker API because it always

00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,950
causes confusion that is actually just a

00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:35,170
rename of Cloud Foundry Service Worker

00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:36,370
API that's been split out into a new

00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:39,450
working group we've got people

00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:41,980
from IBM Red Hat Google s ap Fujitsu

00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:44,529
Microsoft Dell all working on

00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:46,720
specification and testing this out with

00:13:44,529 --> 00:13:49,480
with various platforms including our

00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:52,600
boundary and most the other big one is

00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:54,610
kubernetes and so over the past few

00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,950
months we've been doing regular

00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:59,080
face-to-face meetups over the past year

00:13:56,950 --> 00:14:02,080
we've got another face-to-face meet up

00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:04,240
with the the PMC group and some

00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:07,029
community members that's happening on

00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,890
the 28th to 29th November this is going

00:14:07,029 --> 00:14:12,160
to be a Red Hat's office in Raleigh

00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:14,320
North Carolina so I think the the kind

00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,880
of attendees in-person is closed too

00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,100
close now because we've reached capacity

00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:20,820
but all of the sessions are going to be

00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:23,529
open to remote attendees Avaya zoom and

00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:26,890
so we've got an agenda document I've

00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:28,839
linked to in the in the cab notes and if

00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:31,900
there's anything you would like raise

00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:33,390
that this face-to-face you can raise

00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:35,380
your proposal and add it to the agenda

00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:36,910
so it's a good chance to start getting

00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:38,620
involved or at least come listening to

00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:41,140
some of the working group sessions these

00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:43,900
are normally quite productive a few days

00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:46,180
so recommend that other things to call

00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:47,680
out is it were growing community that

00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:49,240
are using the open service broker slack

00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:52,390
we've got three hundred and twenty-five

00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:54,250
users it's getting fairly active in

00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:56,459
there so this is another slack to join

00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:58,600
I'll put that link in the car as well

00:14:56,459 --> 00:15:01,029
and to other interestings

00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:04,410
so Google just announced a new project

00:15:01,029 --> 00:15:06,250
for the service catalog which is

00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:08,950
kubernetes version of the cloud

00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:11,170
controller effectively for services and

00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:13,900
so this this projects in alpha going to

00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:16,660
be too soon but Google have created an

00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:19,570
alternative installer and they've just

00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:20,950
launched that which looks quite cool and

00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:24,370
it also gives you access to the Google

00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:26,470
cloud service broker and then finally

00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:29,320
let's cool out there's a proposal to add

00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:31,900
a validation tool for service brokers to

00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:33,010
the open serviceworker api project and

00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,839
this is a tool that some folks in

00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:37,420
Microsoft we're working on that you can

00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:40,570
run against your service broker and it

00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:42,339
will give you a list of all the areas

00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:44,920
that you're not complying with open

00:15:42,339 --> 00:15:47,050
service broker a PS a-- fication but we

00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:49,720
like some kind of reviews on this to see

00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:51,399
if people find this tool usable

00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:54,100
what they think of the co quality and

00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:55,569
maintainability aspects so feedback

00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,910
there's some questions to think about on

00:15:55,569 --> 00:15:59,350
the issue that I've linked to but we'd

00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:01,000
love to get some more Service Worker

00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:02,860
authors trying this out and giving

00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:07,600
feedback before we merge it into the

00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:11,019
project excellent thank you Alex for

00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:13,660
detailed update and I'll mention one

00:16:11,019 --> 00:16:15,100
thing I'm actually in Europe for a long

00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:17,230
period of time is always attending worst

00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:21,670
meetings and we can either go I was at

00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:25,379
SSC and haha and I saw a presentation on

00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:29,290
open serviceworker API by Microsoft and

00:16:25,379 --> 00:16:31,449
giving a demo using kubernetes it was

00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:33,160
mind-blowing to see that right like all

00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:35,589
of these different groups working

00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:39,819
together that's that's a beautiful thing

00:16:35,589 --> 00:16:41,649
so great semester Michael yeah yeah yeah

00:16:39,819 --> 00:16:44,610
all right so let me give a quick update

00:16:41,649 --> 00:16:46,990
on extensions and then we'll pass it to

00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:49,269
suami so that she can give us an update

00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:51,699
on the CFF which we usually do first

00:16:49,269 --> 00:16:54,180
so of course towards the end of this

00:16:51,699 --> 00:16:57,220
call we're gonna have the SUSE

00:16:54,180 --> 00:17:01,839
presentation of Stratus UI I saw them at

00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:03,699
CEO summit in Basel and they have a list

00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:07,240
of projects that they want to bring

00:17:03,699 --> 00:17:09,750
forward so I'll introduce that later but

00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:13,679
just know that this is coming one big

00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:18,339
announcement is that the service fabric

00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:21,730
project from SAT got accepted and Ashish

00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:23,559
is here so we have questions for him

00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:24,939
this is a great time to sort of raise it

00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:27,490
if you want to just chat with them but

00:17:24,939 --> 00:17:30,130
they have a whole team of course SAT

00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:32,380
especially in India pushing forward with

00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:35,770
the service fabric good stuff coming

00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:38,049
down the pipeline for this one more

00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:41,470
thing is that Scott Lunger

00:17:38,049 --> 00:17:44,770
from pivotal actually has a proposal for

00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:48,340
a presentation he made before the on the

00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:50,830
CF scheduler so if you get a chance to

00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:53,080
review that soon take a look at it it's

00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:56,440
gonna come out pretty soon and then for

00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:59,500
backers there is a inception that's then

00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:01,240
I believe it's next week on the 23rd but

00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,500
will will be announcing it so if you're

00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,049
interested in what's going to happen

00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,970
with the back

00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:07,100
thanks version make sure to attend this

00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:09,649
there's worldwide people so we'll

00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:11,749
probably have to presentation to

00:18:09,649 --> 00:18:13,549
meetings for two hours each with a break

00:18:11,749 --> 00:18:16,429
in between so you can choose which one

00:18:13,549 --> 00:18:18,769
you want okay that's all I want to say

00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:20,539
about extension so let's see if anybody

00:18:18,769 --> 00:18:25,580
has questions for any of the different

00:18:20,539 --> 00:18:28,369
PMC's if you have a question your mute

00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:33,010
because we can't hear otherwise we'll

00:18:28,369 --> 00:18:36,340
move to to suami

00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:38,169
No okay so I can see you oh no this is

00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:40,960
the first time my writing thank you for

00:18:38,169 --> 00:18:42,309
being here and taking chips place maybe

00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,260
you can give us an update on what's

00:18:42,309 --> 00:18:47,890
happening with the foundation people

00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:52,600
should care about ensuring sure you guys

00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:54,040
can hear me yes we can awesome I had a

00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,990
little technical challenges in the

00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:58,990
beginning so kind of had to join in a

00:18:55,990 --> 00:19:01,030
little bit late I'm still relatively

00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:02,650
much much newer to the community so it's

00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:04,630
been less than a month since I've been

00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:07,090
with the foundation I'm still in the

00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:09,400
learning more absorbing everything else

00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:11,500
but I just wanted to start joining these

00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:14,169
calls based on Chris and chips

00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:17,500
recommendations that I have to be on

00:19:14,169 --> 00:19:20,140
this call so at least for now I don't

00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:22,630
have any updates per se other than the

00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:26,080
fact that the nominations the co-chair

00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:29,350
nominations for CFP is due today so if

00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:31,390
any of you hasn't done finished up

00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:33,370
crosses like submitting nominating

00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:35,290
yourself or nominating anyone else for

00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:37,950
the call for papers co-chairing please

00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:40,900
do that I will be presenting the link

00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:42,549
across in the mailing list and on slack

00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:45,370
channel but please do that

00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:48,130
I think it's 11:59 p.m. Pacific time if

00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:51,070
I remember about the deadline for

00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:52,990
tonight other than that I will be

00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:55,750
focusing a lot more on the community

00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:57,669
activities if you are on the Ambassador

00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:59,620
Program you probably already have seen

00:19:57,669 --> 00:20:02,380
an email or you you will see an email

00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:03,790
from me pretty soon but would love to

00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:05,500
hear in general from the rest of the

00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:07,929
community as well I would love to hear

00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:12,010
feedback on how things have been going

00:20:07,929 --> 00:20:13,419
what great ideas do we have in terms of

00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:15,700
what we can do better in terms of

00:20:13,419 --> 00:20:17,080
community and gearing of this summit if

00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:19,929
you have any additional ideas I would

00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:25,880
love to hear all of it so please do drop

00:20:19,929 --> 00:20:27,620
me a note oh thank you so on

00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,510
so I guess just to be clear I wasn't

00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:32,090
sure if I put that down but in the

00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:34,850
agenda I put that the deadline for the

00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:39,940
summit proposals is twelve one is it

00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:46,429
twelve one or twelve eight I think it's

00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:47,990
yeah yeah but the deadline that I was

00:20:46,429 --> 00:20:50,360
referring to earlier was for the

00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:53,059
nominations for co-chairs the call for

00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:55,370
paper code chasers so it's for the

00:20:53,059 --> 00:20:57,500
tractors we are looking for co-chair

00:20:55,370 --> 00:21:01,070
nominations and that is to end up today

00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:04,070
but we have we still have time for the

00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:06,260
actual speaking proposals itself yeah

00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:09,530
and let me speak about this a second i I

00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:11,000
was but you're not the current one and

00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:12,980
the recent one in Basel but the one

00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,289
before and it's very very rewarding

00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:17,090
thing you do have to do some work but

00:21:15,289 --> 00:21:19,730
what of the idea is that you get a very

00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:22,039
broad view of what people care about and

00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:23,809
what they are submitting and you get to

00:21:22,039 --> 00:21:26,900
choose it so you get to put together the

00:21:23,809 --> 00:21:29,450
program for a particular track and and I

00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:31,400
think it's it's something to do so if

00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:32,000
you if you know somebody that should be

00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,100
nominated

00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,429
make sure you nominate or nominate

00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:38,780
yourself and and and hopefully it's not

00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:42,549
the same people you don't want the same

00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:46,820
people always doing deciding right so

00:21:42,549 --> 00:21:50,450
nominate other folks so join in yeah and

00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:52,250
I think just to add on that I really

00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:53,990
agree that it's a very rewarding

00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:57,440
experience and it also adds to the

00:21:53,990 --> 00:22:01,039
content quality for the summit as well I

00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:03,260
think we have much fewer nominations for

00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:04,730
the node trek from what I hear from the

00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:06,530
events team so if you know anyone

00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:08,360
specific for the node track especially

00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:10,549
please do

00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,960
nominate them or please do reach out to

00:22:10,549 --> 00:22:14,240
them if they would be interested if you

00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:17,299
are not sure they'd be able to come into

00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:20,240
that kind of responsibility but we would

00:22:17,299 --> 00:22:22,880
love to see a lot more nominations and I

00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:25,039
agree that we want to be fair and can I

00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:27,440
spread the opportunity across everyone

00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:29,630
in the community so I don't want to see

00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,130
one person being nominated for five

00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:32,780
different tracks because it's not fair

00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:35,150
for us for the community so if you know

00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:36,770
that you can take all the responsibility

00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:38,390
please do that and we will of course the

00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:39,600
foundation team will be with you the

00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:42,180
whole time and

00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:44,520
if you cannot if you're not sure what to

00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:46,470
do or how to go to that kind of next

00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:48,060
step you'll definitely be there but we

00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:49,470
would love to get more involvement and

00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:51,960
engagement from the community all that

00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:54,030
yeah it's usually a pair of per track so

00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:55,320
you get to work with somebody else too

00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:57,450
so you have to know somebody else a

00:22:55,320 --> 00:23:01,440
little bit autism and of course chili

00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:07,200
will be there yes in addition yes okay

00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:10,370
so any question about what's going on

00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:13,560
okay so I do see Benjamin had a question

00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:16,080
about I guess it's related to Bush but

00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:18,360
more general also is that do you want

00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:21,780
ask had been given an in you know since

00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:22,950
I can see you you might have got yes

00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:26,880
thank you

00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:29,340
that was just formed a question that we

00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:33,620
would remove brush workspace from

00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:37,590
incubator purgative how can organization

00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:42,660
we have a we have a chat we had a chat

00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:46,260
with the author Robin Costa and we

00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:51,540
emerged a depreciation notice into the

00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:54,390
ring me so maybe this would this could

00:23:51,540 --> 00:24:00,480
go back to catenary community or um

00:23:54,390 --> 00:24:03,600
maybe clattery attic I don't know but I

00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:08,700
think it's here the where we vote for

00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:10,740
such the decisions isn't it I'm not so

00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:13,620
sure it's an interesting one because it

00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:15,330
was there before the extensions got

00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:17,370
started been started taking over the

00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:19,200
incubator so it was already there so I

00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:22,290
think I think the author is already in

00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:25,710
it as far as I know if you let's ask

00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:27,900
let's ask by email I think Yui has done

00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:30,540
a few where she moved stuff to addict by

00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:32,070
if I don't want to miss with you Yui but

00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:33,510
I remember you you essentially sent an

00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:35,520
email saying that it's gonna move to a

00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:38,100
date that's the air there any objections

00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:40,170
and we give a few days and then if not

00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:42,510
we'll do it you want to add anything to

00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:46,970
this you in terms of process or this

00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:50,340
kind of thing now sounds good

00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:53,420
okay so good I was asking you if I can

00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:53,420
see her I can see all of you

00:24:53,490 --> 00:25:01,279
yes so so we typically try to give at

00:24:57,510 --> 00:25:03,990
least a weeks notice before moving

00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:07,789
things to the Attic so that people can

00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:11,370
raise objections or concerns about that

00:25:07,789 --> 00:25:16,679
but but typically at least within the

00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:19,700
run time PNC we tried to bring that up

00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:23,820
as items in our in our bi-weekly calls

00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:27,450
or otherwise near this CA see I've done

00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:30,419
a Lamaze cool all right so let's do this

00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:32,730
Benjamin - you know since you already

00:25:30,419 --> 00:25:34,890
had talked to the author that sent it

00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:37,230
since I'm not overseeing it yet and then

00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:40,110
I'll certainly approve I mean agree with

00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:41,850
you and then let's see if anybody has

00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:44,700
any objection if there's no objection by

00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:48,330
the end of the week and we can work with

00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:50,520
Chris Chris Clark is on the call he's

00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:53,070
great he can help us with a lot of this

00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:54,779
- he's part of the founders yeah I'm

00:25:53,070 --> 00:26:04,919
always so always very enthusiastic to

00:25:54,779 --> 00:26:08,190
move things okay so let me quickly

00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:10,770
introduce this another project but I

00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:14,880
think there's gonna be a suit oh sorry

00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:16,710
somebody wants to add no okay so at the

00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:20,309
a lot of you should probably know

00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:22,799
Cornelius Schumacher he is the de souza

00:26:20,309 --> 00:26:24,899
that actually spent some time caring

00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:26,940
with us and Bosh and he's done quite a

00:26:24,899 --> 00:26:32,130
bit already in foundry so he's he's a

00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:34,710
dojo you know graduate but at the Basel

00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:36,659
summit I spent a lot of time chatting

00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:38,190
with him and also a bunch of his

00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:40,200
colleagues from Sousa and they have a

00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:41,940
series of project and they're gonna

00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,649
present one close to Otto's and

00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:45,149
Canadians will introduce it but the one

00:26:43,649 --> 00:26:46,860
thing I wanted to mention which I

00:26:45,149 --> 00:26:48,570
learned that I didn't know about Susa

00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:49,799
that I think it's worth mentioning

00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:51,899
because I don't know if he's going to

00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:56,700
talk about it is that it's not only of

00:26:51,899 --> 00:26:58,919
course a huge you know just true for or

00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:00,870
for Linux and they have tons of

00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:02,220
expertise and contributions or but

00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:04,649
what's interesting about Zeus is that

00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:06,389
their business model is itself okay so

00:27:04,649 --> 00:27:07,210
everything they do is open but their

00:27:06,389 --> 00:27:10,060
business model

00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:14,650
and their processes so I think it's a

00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:16,990
fantastic you know set of colleagues and

00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:18,730
engineers that are gonna help join and

00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:21,010
they're gonna talk about this particular

00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:22,900
project but there's at least two more

00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:24,730
projects that they also are considering

00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:27,780
submitted so with that let me see if

00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:31,060
Cornelius wants to add anything or

00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:32,410
introduced speaker for Stratis UI but

00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:35,950
then you have to also take over the

00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:40,270
screen so that you can share coyness

00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:42,340
okay great thank you yeah we sometimes

00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:43,840
call ourself the the open open company

00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:46,480
so that's that's what I told you at the

00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:48,070
summit and it's kind of cheesy but I

00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,200
think it's actually describing how we

00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:51,850
are working quite well and part of that

00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:55,180
is of course working as upstream as

00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:58,000
possible and that's why we are talking

00:27:55,180 --> 00:28:00,490
today about the the straightest UI so

00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,700
this is our fully open source UI for

00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:05,740
Cloud Foundry and we are proposing this

00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:06,220
for incubation as an extension in cloud

00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:09,160
foundry

00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:11,530
I sent the document to the CF def

00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:13,030
mailing list earlier today so this

00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:16,060
should be there also with the links to

00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:19,000
the for document yeah and we have Nia

00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:21,010
mcdougal here who is the lead for the

00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,320
team working on the straightest UI and

00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:26,950
he will give us some more information

00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:30,730
some introduction and also a demo so we

00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:57,460
can now see that and I will hand over to

00:28:30,730 --> 00:29:01,270
near then okay awesome thank you very

00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:03,280
much okay so as clearly said and dr. max

00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:07,720
introduced I'm going to talk a bit about

00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:10,000
Stratus UI so this is a user interface

00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:13,780
forward Cloud Foundry we'll talk about

00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:16,300
that and we have submitted this to the

00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:18,380
SIV extensions will be that we

00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:20,360
considered for acceptance

00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:21,560
of this clock wheel is just to to kind

00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:23,750
of tell you a bit more about what it is

00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:27,310
show you what it is so you're kind of

00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:29,690
better informed so there's a github URL

00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:32,000
kind of what is it so I will give you a

00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:33,680
demo since its UI that's the easiest way

00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,920
of kind of showing showing what it is

00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:37,910
and what it can do but this is something

00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:39,860
we've been working on it

00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:43,520
Suz for for quite some time it's

00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:46,700
currently all open source so the phone

00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:48,940
back the URL I had previously you can go

00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:52,580
check it out yourself from from there

00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:54,890
take a look we've designed it to be

00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:57,320
extensible on customizable and we're

00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:59,210
continuing to to build out the feature

00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:01,550
set for this and we're trying to make it

00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:03,170
as easily the problem as possible so

00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:04,730
kind of the the kind of tagline that we

00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:06,290
use for this is to say that it's you

00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:08,510
know it's easy to use it's web-based and

00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:10,790
we're targeting both sort of developers

00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:12,290
and administrators and we have an

00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:13,850
initial feature set the wheel one will

00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:15,140
kind of introduce and obviously over

00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:17,000
time we're looking to build that out and

00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:18,470
I guess part of the reason for you know

00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,700
submitting this as a proposed list to

00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:21,800
get others on board to maybe help us

00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:26,090
accelerate some of that development for

00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:27,950
the community so just touch on a couple

00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:31,100
of things that we put in the proposal

00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:32,660
for this if extensions track so firstly

00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:35,600
some assumptions the the reason that

00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:38,120
we're kind of proposing this is is under

00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:41,540
the assumption that users there are some

00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:44,090
desire to access the functionality of

00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:47,060
Cloud Foundry through a web user

00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:50,330
interface in addition to what you would

00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:54,230
get through the CF client API clients

00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:55,370
did I also that you know having kind of

00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:58,100
a fairly comprehensive user interface

00:30:55,370 --> 00:31:00,380
may or will help you know maybe bring

00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:02,900
more people on board particularly maybe

00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:04,460
some of the sort of country who are

00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:06,740
those may not may not use it intimidated

00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:08,960
maybe some bit strong but some some

00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:10,160
users find find user interface is

00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,480
particularly initially a good way of

00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:14,180
kind of getting plugged in understanding

00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:15,890
what they're saying and lastly you know

00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:18,080
we were streamed that kind of having a

00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:20,440
know freely available open web UI

00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:22,880
project will then kind of improve the

00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:24,770
usability for run for various cloud for

00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:27,080
under users and I think you know I know

00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:30,260
many of the larger organizations have

00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:32,240
developed their own or CEO souza this is

00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:34,820
the the UI that we include

00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:37,309
in our product but I think there's a lot

00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:40,040
of smaller companies maybe who are using

00:31:37,309 --> 00:31:41,150
Cloud Foundry deploying that and we're

00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:43,130
seeing some interest from those already

00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:47,150
and this provides them with a kind of

00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:49,220
toolset for them to take and use so some

00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:51,770
of our goals very quickly so we're

00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:53,480
trying to expose says all but obviously

00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:55,250
that's ongoing as much of the kind of

00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:59,059
features we can that exposure to the API

00:31:55,250 --> 00:32:00,710
and as I said targeting both you know

00:31:59,059 --> 00:32:03,290
developers as well as the administrators

00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:05,110
and you'll see that when we demo it you

00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:08,540
know we want to bid operate against any

00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:11,390
certified Clair founder distribution so

00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:13,160
I'll come on to that next one I guess we

00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:14,660
almost make it fairly flexible to deploy

00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:16,340
but I'm also you want to make sure it's

00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:19,580
to global by Bosch and as a kind of

00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:20,660
hungry app and one one difference I

00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:23,480
think maybe to some other things that

00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:25,820
you may have seen is we with we try to

00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:27,590
make sure that you can manage multiple

00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:29,690
cloud foundry instruments is through

00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:32,570
through one UI so it's not a you know

00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:34,850
one-to-one here you can you can look at

00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:37,059
multiple cloud foundry deployments

00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:39,920
attributions and kind of manage those

00:32:37,059 --> 00:32:42,590
and we've also bearing in mind today we

00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:43,520
want to have others take this use it

00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:46,309
we're trying to make sure it's easily

00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:48,260
themed at the moment I can show you a

00:32:46,309 --> 00:32:50,540
Sousa theme but obviously other people

00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:51,650
may or will want to change that and we

00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:53,570
all sort of make sure that it's easy for

00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:57,230
people to extend to swap this out at

00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:58,700
noob ascend very quickly antico so I

00:32:57,230 --> 00:33:00,440
think the top ones very important for us

00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:02,540
we we want to make sure we only work

00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:05,179
against the the public endpoints for

00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:07,340
Clara foundry not having to dig in 20

00:33:05,179 --> 00:33:09,440
internal databases or components through

00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:11,420
private interfaces so we work clearly at

00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:14,330
the you know the API level with them and

00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:16,640
using the SSH endpoint for example in

00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:18,380
the Doppler logging endpoint and we're

00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:22,790
not going to add any features that might

00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:24,590
size 20 specific distribution so as I

00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:27,559
said we've tried to make it fairly

00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:29,929
flexible in the way you can deploy it so

00:33:27,559 --> 00:33:31,970
go check out yourself you can just check

00:33:29,929 --> 00:33:34,940
out our repo and ocf push to push it's a

00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:38,150
foundry app we've got a Bosch deployment

00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:39,410
wave point of our Bosch also for our own

00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:41,090
products where you can deploy it in

00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:42,860
communities with home or you can just

00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:44,240
run it in a in docker using docker

00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:45,440
compose so we've tried to make it as

00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:49,340
flexible as possible to

00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:50,929
to deploy the UN device I come on to a

00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:52,389
demo but very quickly sort of touching

00:33:50,929 --> 00:33:54,799
on the features at a high level

00:33:52,389 --> 00:33:58,460
authentication so we do work against the

00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:59,659
UI a so you do have to login to the

00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:02,299
console and we differentiate between

00:33:59,659 --> 00:34:04,669
administrators and and sort of regular

00:34:02,299 --> 00:34:06,919
users we've tried a way to manage

00:34:04,669 --> 00:34:08,030
endpoints we used two term endpoint at

00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:10,190
the moment really just means Cloud

00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:11,480
Foundry clusters but down the line it

00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:13,609
could mean something you know more

00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:16,629
generic this is a way that people can

00:34:13,609 --> 00:34:18,710
connect in different countries and

00:34:16,629 --> 00:34:20,089
connect with their credentials come on

00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:20,810
to that we provide an application of

00:34:20,089 --> 00:34:22,639
view where you can see all of your

00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:24,770
applications and we kind of consolidate

00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:27,440
those across multiple boundaries you can

00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:29,659
drive into a single application and get

00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,800
application view we've done a fair

00:34:29,659 --> 00:34:32,060
amount on being able to kind of create

00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,250
apps so the kind of the equivalent of

00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:35,659
safe push three for the UI and then

00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:37,010
lastly we have more of the management of

00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:39,290
Clara friend where you can dive in and

00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:43,250
view various metadata about or your

00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:44,629
Clara foundry cluster okay so it's a

00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:47,359
bunch of screenshots here which I'll

00:34:44,629 --> 00:34:49,010
skip over I'll come back to I can make

00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:51,319
this the slides available I put the

00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:52,339
screenshots in here office leader I'm

00:34:51,319 --> 00:34:53,659
going to show the demo but if you're

00:34:52,339 --> 00:34:57,970
looking at these offline then that will

00:34:53,659 --> 00:35:00,589
make more sense you bring it up

00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:02,060
hopefully so I'll give you a quick demo

00:35:00,589 --> 00:35:04,099
um I won't take too much of your time

00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:05,060
but I want you to kind of see see some

00:35:04,099 --> 00:35:08,240
of the cool features just you've got a

00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:10,069
feel for put in that and if it's how

00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:11,390
mendl's come back and talk a little bit

00:35:10,069 --> 00:35:14,180
about how it's built and how we've tried

00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:18,609
to make it extensible so this is the

00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:21,680
Sousa look and feel that I'll I'll demo

00:35:18,609 --> 00:35:23,420
I think you know if we're gonna propose

00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:25,849
this as a session that's accepted then

00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:28,310
no ceased his skin so here's a here's a

00:35:25,849 --> 00:35:30,710
kind of example of a cloud foundry theme

00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:32,240
that I knocked up that would I think

00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:33,560
we'd make the default so it's fairly

00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,750
easy to kind of change the look and feel

00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:38,630
I don't know if this one for now

00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:40,819
so say I log in to the system we're

00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:42,829
gonna authenticate with the UI a we're

00:35:40,819 --> 00:35:44,300
fully localized so I can change the

00:35:42,829 --> 00:35:45,770
locale where any have variants of

00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:48,470
English at the moment but it's very easy

00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:53,770
to add in you and your language packs or

00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:55,420
although close to the UI okay so login

00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:59,490
already prepared register some end

00:35:55,420 --> 00:36:02,950
points so I will see some applications

00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:05,230
this so you've actually deployed the UI

00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:07,540
within Cloud Foundry as well as

00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:10,960
accessing the console through this

00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:14,470
different instance I'll keep this fairly

00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:15,630
quick so endpoints this is where I

00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:17,710
connect up and register multiple

00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:21,870
boundaries so here the one I was showing

00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:24,220
you was actually sa piece Hana platform

00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:26,740
Clara foundry and I've got a second one

00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:28,720
which is Souza's Claire foundry that's

00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:30,190
in beta which is currently disconnected

00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:38,560
so I'm only seeing application from one

00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:40,390
I can go in and I can connect that up so

00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,500
now I have to registered for about

00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:43,680
applications I should see the

00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:46,570
applications aggregated from both

00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:49,150
foundries so with administrators are

00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:51,430
able to add in new endpoints system and

00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:54,040
then every user who logs in is able to

00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:56,530
connect with their credential so they

00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:57,850
only see their the view that they're

00:36:56,530 --> 00:37:02,350
allowed to see on to a particular cloud

00:36:57,850 --> 00:37:05,290
foundry so we do come you know honor all

00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:06,460
of that level of access I won't talk too

00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:09,910
much about this this is the application

00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:12,130
view we do support grid and list you can

00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:13,270
change the way you sort you know all the

00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:17,350
stuff you might expect you can search

00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:18,430
for an app you can straight down to just

00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:20,610
looking at one particular Cloud Foundry

00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:23,200
and then you can choose an organ space

00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:26,200
so that's you know that's looking

00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:28,270
looking the applications let me undo

00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:29,680
this deploy new app so I can add a kind

00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:31,060
of scalar snap or I can kind of deploy

00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,190
an app so this is where we've tried to

00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:35,620
allow users to do the equivalent of CF

00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:38,590
push push but through the UI so let me

00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:40,660
just go ahead and deploy quick app so I

00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:43,810
can choose the which Claire for Andrew I

00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:47,020
wish in the organ space I can deploy

00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:50,140
either from get at the moment or a local

00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:52,390
file a folder so you can run sure here

00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:54,820
but you can drag and drop a folder or an

00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:55,990
archive file onto this UI here and we'll

00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:57,400
read that in and we'll check for a see

00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:58,360
if ignore and all those kind of things

00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:01,330
to make sure we do the right stuff and

00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:03,700
then you upload the bare minimum or I

00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:05,290
can actually browse with those icons or

00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:07,210
sensitively I need to enter a github

00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:09,910
project or a euro

00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:11,980
for any get protectors as well and

00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:16,780
publicly so let me just choose one

00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:19,020
that's one of mine so we'll go out and

00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:20,710
we'll fetch the list of branches and

00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:21,880
stuff like that give you a bit of

00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:23,380
information if you click on those you'll

00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,740
get links out to github all that kind of

00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:27,880
stuff

00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:32,380
if I hit deploy we will clone that in

00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:35,230
the backend and then we use the CF

00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:37,420
client to actually push that to to the

00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:38,619
Claire foundry and will stream the log

00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:41,500
here so this is done all over WebSockets

00:38:38,619 --> 00:38:44,830
them securely so I could sit and watch

00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:46,450
this or I can dive into the app so this

00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:48,490
is the application view that I talked

00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:49,570
about very quickly and this is where for

00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:52,420
the individual app you can kind of see

00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:54,790
what's going on so a bunch of metadata

00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:55,720
you can see a number of instances we've

00:38:54,790 --> 00:39:00,400
got I can see that it's currently

00:38:55,720 --> 00:39:04,089
staging all good stuff like like that

00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:05,380
this is updated periodically I can get a

00:39:04,089 --> 00:39:07,359
log stream again this is done over

00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:10,119
WebSockets so we kind of view this in

00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:11,619
real time I can see of any service

00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:13,810
instance is abound I can look at my

00:39:11,619 --> 00:39:16,630
variables see the events or all that

00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:19,060
kind of stuff which is so just nice up

00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:20,740
here we have the various actions these

00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:22,570
change depending on the state of the app

00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:25,030
so you can see it's gone green now so

00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:27,220
they've changed I can get some CLI info

00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:29,140
so if you want to transition from the

00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:32,230
web UI detail I we give some contextual

00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:34,480
ice cut help there this is now running

00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:41,310
you can see I'm sure the instance says I

00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:44,140
could choose to and this scale is up and

00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:48,460
or should refresh this in a second so we

00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:49,960
do you know we do the sort of basic kind

00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:52,089
of first cut of stuff that developers

00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:53,710
hope you'll find useful and make it much

00:39:52,089 --> 00:39:56,890
easier if them to come and get started

00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:58,720
you can also SSH from the browser so you

00:39:56,890 --> 00:40:00,490
can pick an instance and we've got a

00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:06,040
little terminal that well hopefully

00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:08,740
connect through yeah and you can it's

00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:16,000
quite a rich what are a few others that

00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:18,430
can be quite useful so that's all the

00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,960
kind of kind of developer oriented stuff

00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:26,440
I've shown variables you can bind

00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:27,700
services I won't show that now so we can

00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:29,290
show the Service Catalog you can pick

00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:31,180
service create an instance you can set

00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:34,210
service parameters and tags all that

00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:35,609
kind of stuff interesting I'll speed up

00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:37,810
a little bit

00:40:35,609 --> 00:40:40,480
Cloud Foundry so this is kind of a

00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:42,010
second kind of view where you can dive

00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,599
down individual Cloud Foundry

00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:45,460
because I've got multiple registered we

00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:47,440
kind of kept top level tiles I fear only

00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:49,630
had one then you know you'd go straight

00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:51,430
through to the one you had and that

00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:52,810
moment you kind of drill down and again

00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:56,230
gets from top level metadata you can

00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:58,390
create walls and spaces you can drill

00:40:56,230 --> 00:41:00,070
down into the organizations in the

00:40:58,390 --> 00:41:03,510
spaces and then you view the

00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:06,730
applications substances routes and users

00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:08,560
you can you know unwrap and delete

00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:11,830
routes and tidy up things at the space

00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:16,260
level again we shall see like commands

00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:18,609
users you can let's see yeah we can

00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:21,790
manage user access to individual space

00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:24,520
and orgs here so I can either do it

00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:27,220
individually by you know removing a

00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:28,990
particular role off of a user or we have

00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:32,890
a UI that should go through a new kind

00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:35,260
of bulk level user changes for accessing

00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:42,010
orgs and spaces I think back up at the

00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:45,250
top level okay space in orgs okay oops

00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:47,200
okay so we do also show some some other

00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:49,000
kind of top-level Cloud Foundry metadata

00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:51,640
again at the moment this this is kind of

00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:54,210
a read-only view much of this so you can

00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:59,680
sort of stream the the firehose

00:41:54,210 --> 00:42:04,660
obviously see after yeah you can turn

00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:09,430
on/off different aspects of the firehose

00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:11,109
I can you know if you feature flags what

00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:12,700
Bill packs I've got installed the specs

00:42:11,109 --> 00:42:14,020
and so you see what the suits are

00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:16,300
stacking this one and you can check

00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:18,730
these security groups so this is a kind

00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:19,990
of a cut of first level of Clara French

00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:22,750
arrangement there's kind of more that

00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:26,500
we're adding in the background as we go

00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:28,420
so that's hopefully a quick whizz

00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:31,300
through through all we have

00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:33,880
a bunch of stuff aimed at developers to

00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:35,380
allow them to see their apps add new

00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:37,000
apps manage the apps they've got in here

00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:39,370
delete apps Galya perhaps all that kind

00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,750
of stuff view the logs SS hm bunch of

00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:43,300
stuff for Cloud Foundry itself where

00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:46,090
users can go in and just check quotas

00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:49,270
you check feature flags those kind of

00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:51,190
things and then the ability to actually

00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:55,960
register multiple cloud for entries in

00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:57,610
one instance okay so I think that's

00:42:55,960 --> 00:43:00,610
there's a basic user profile information

00:42:57,610 --> 00:43:02,020
where you can kind of go in and you can

00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:04,120
at least change your password and and

00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:05,080
edit the user name that kind of stuff

00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:10,780
that's something we're going to build

00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:12,040
out so hopefully that was useful to give

00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:17,250
you a flavor what we've currently got

00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:17,250
implemented just finish off real quick

00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:22,020
so I will make these available

00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:24,250
afterwards

00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:26,770
just a tiny bit on kind of how we built

00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:28,420
this it's obviously one of submitting it

00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:30,070
as an extension proposal we'd like other

00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:31,870
people to kind of jump in and help us

00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:34,240
out so the moment is kind of built of

00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:35,800
two two core pieces so we have a web

00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:39,790
front-end which is a single page

00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:42,850
angularjs app and back-end which is

00:43:39,790 --> 00:43:45,970
running go and we use a database which

00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:47,220
can be Postgres my sequel SQL Lite and

00:43:45,970 --> 00:43:50,260
depending on how you want deploy it

00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:53,580
which just stores endpoint information

00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:56,080
we don't store any other information

00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:57,910
other than which endpoints you've got

00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:59,290
registered and we store some encrypted

00:43:57,910 --> 00:44:02,200
tokens so you don't have to reconnect

00:43:59,290 --> 00:44:04,930
every time you log in and really what

00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:08,320
this kind of API server does as well as

00:44:04,930 --> 00:44:09,600
manage those endpoints it proxies for

00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,750
calls through to the appropriate

00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:12,130
back-end

00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:14,350
and that's in the appropriate

00:44:12,130 --> 00:44:15,940
authentication headers for us so I won't

00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:18,280
talk through this but it makes sure that

00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:20,800
when the friend asks say the list of

00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:22,060
apps will go out to all of the cloud

00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:24,460
foundries you've got registered with the

00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:26,740
appropriate tokens if any tokens expired

00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:27,910
we will automatically you know get a new

00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:30,250
access token before you make the call

00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:32,850
again I go get responses and send them

00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:32,850
back the front end

00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:36,550
so just lastly you know we're talking

00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:38,830
about trying to make this extensible

00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:40,600
we've tried to build all kind of lay

00:44:38,830 --> 00:44:42,160
that the code out and put things

00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:46,810
together in a way that people can add

00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:49,000
and change components so much of the

00:44:46,810 --> 00:44:51,340
functionality that I showed you around

00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,710
say deploying your applications or SSH

00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:55,510
in into apps are done as plugins that

00:44:53,710 --> 00:44:58,330
can be turned on or off if you don't

00:44:55,510 --> 00:45:00,400
want that functionality the souza

00:44:58,330 --> 00:45:02,500
branding for example is also a plugin

00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:04,480
that you can swap out for another one so

00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:06,250
we defined a number of extension points

00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:07,450
that we will build over time you know

00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:09,100
we're trying to use standard mechanisms

00:45:07,450 --> 00:45:11,700
but you know using bow dependencies to

00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:14,740
allow you to wear a new front-end

00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:18,930
components you can extend both the front

00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:23,560
end UI as well as the back end server so

00:45:18,930 --> 00:45:24,760
so for example both the app SSH and the

00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:29,920
push that I showed you have both

00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:31,090
back-end and front-end pieces so kind of

00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:32,860
examples what you can do

00:45:31,090 --> 00:45:34,300
hopefull if you can think back to what I

00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:38,170
showed you it's very easy to add new

00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:39,760
top-level menu items to extend out many

00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:41,950
of the views to add a new tab so for

00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:44,140
example the kind of application view all

00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:47,170
of those tabs I've done this sort of

00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:49,240
plugins and you can you can add new tabs

00:45:47,170 --> 00:45:51,340
you can get rid of tabs you can have

00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:53,140
tabs to both apps and Cloud Foundry you

00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:56,020
can Athene that yeah you have the whole

00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:56,920
UI you can add new api's and you can

00:45:56,020 --> 00:46:00,940
change the way the whole thing is

00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:02,890
configured so here's the current set of

00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:04,150
components we've got a lot of the kind

00:46:02,890 --> 00:46:06,940
of cool stuff is in some of these

00:46:04,150 --> 00:46:08,530
top-level Cloud Foundry and have core

00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:10,720
components but we starts to pull out

00:46:08,530 --> 00:46:14,350
more functionality as I said into some

00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:16,570
of these separate components

00:46:14,350 --> 00:46:19,630
okay so that was it hopefully I gave you

00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:21,070
a good flavor of what we've done that

00:46:19,630 --> 00:46:22,780
we've tried to build in a way that's

00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:25,420
extensible that others can take

00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:28,330
contribute to by either adding new

00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:31,180
functionality or you know replacing say

00:46:28,330 --> 00:46:32,590
a theme with their own theme I'm

00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:34,090
available in slack if you want to follow

00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:38,590
up with me afterwards or habits take

00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:40,330
some questions now yeah let me be the

00:46:38,590 --> 00:46:43,180
first to say this is pretty amazing I

00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:47,380
mean wow I think there's no excuse not

00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:49,510
to have a UI for Cloud Foundry or start

00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:54,430
your own company and you have a UI you

00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:56,890
can just this is really cool let me see

00:46:54,430 --> 00:46:59,530
if other people have questions or if I'm

00:46:56,890 --> 00:47:04,570
the only one that's pretty impressed by

00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:11,530
this anybody if you're trying to ask a

00:47:04,570 --> 00:47:19,510
question you're new so if you don't do

00:47:11,530 --> 00:47:23,110
this oh yes I have a question does it

00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:27,730
support webpage that might be served by

00:47:23,110 --> 00:47:30,790
service brokers in order to set up

00:47:27,730 --> 00:47:34,300
services it doesn't at the moment but

00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:38,200
that's my roadmap very easy to add in

00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:40,410
for us so that's one of the areas that

00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:42,610
we are kind of active building out is

00:47:40,410 --> 00:47:46,600
improving the the support for services

00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:48,340
service catalog and I'm aware that yes

00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:50,950
being able to you know give to that link

00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:54,550
and then manage your service would be

00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:57,460
very useful so yeah it would be very

00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:59,830
cool by the way congratulations is it

00:47:57,460 --> 00:48:04,720
it's a really good thing to see finally

00:47:59,830 --> 00:48:08,020
a good UI for culinary and open source 1

00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:10,870
and xn civilize it ran very good ah

00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:12,340
thank you grateful yeah so welcome any

00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:14,620
feedback cuz I say ping me in slack or

00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:16,750
find us on github we're looking at

00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:21,460
always looking for new new features

00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:22,840
improvements good stuff we have a few

00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:24,340
more minutes we can stay let's see if

00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:26,440
people have questions but one thing I

00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:28,500
want to clarify I I know this is all

00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:30,850
open source so there's

00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:34,840
it's in the recording can you mention

00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:38,140
what the license is again or it's an

00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:40,330
Apache 2 license ok so it means that you

00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:41,830
can make modifications and all the good

00:48:40,330 --> 00:48:46,330
thing that comes with Apache tubes oh

00:48:41,830 --> 00:48:48,940
yeah no yes SUSE is very open you know

00:48:46,330 --> 00:48:50,530
one of the first things we did make sure

00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:51,580
wait state this whole UI it's all out

00:48:50,530 --> 00:48:52,900
there in the open you can take it you

00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:54,730
can I believe you can do whatever you

00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:57,160
want with it and we've got hopefully you

00:48:54,730 --> 00:48:58,510
contribute back hopefully yeah yeah

00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:59,620
that's what that's what we're looking

00:48:58,510 --> 00:49:02,080
for so the whole community kind of

00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:04,390
benefits from the improvements and

00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:06,190
changes other people make cool so now

00:49:04,390 --> 00:49:09,700
it's on let's see if there's any

00:49:06,190 --> 00:49:10,930
questions it's almost like you ask this

00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:14,620
question but I want to make sure that

00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:17,470
it's in recording yes Neil I think

00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:19,450
there's a question on the chat I think

00:49:17,470 --> 00:49:21,280
from Bret any reason that user role

00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:28,180
management is separate from or curse

00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:31,720
neutral zone for developers not sure

00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:33,070
hundred percent get it but the the the

00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:37,450
two things I showed the cloud friend

00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:40,630
review and the application view although

00:49:37,450 --> 00:49:42,250
they're kind of although the separate

00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:44,110
now view it's not the administrators can

00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:46,090
only see that Cloud Foundry view so both

00:49:44,110 --> 00:49:47,890
developers and administrators can go

00:49:46,090 --> 00:49:50,680
into both of those views but they will

00:49:47,890 --> 00:49:51,820
only they will only see what are at sea

00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:53,850
so an administrator will see a lot more

00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:56,290
particularly in that Clara foundry view

00:49:53,850 --> 00:49:58,960
but a developer will see the information

00:49:56,290 --> 00:50:03,100
on developers can go into that org space

00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:05,020
view and manage permissions for users if

00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:08,650
they have the right permissions within

00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:13,870
that space or org it's hopefully that's

00:50:08,650 --> 00:50:23,110
the question yeah there's another

00:50:13,870 --> 00:50:28,290
question I've may have missed this but

00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:31,510
are there any plans to support C f/c are

00:50:28,290 --> 00:50:41,290
okay what I excuse my ignorance for so

00:50:31,510 --> 00:50:42,040
yeah yeah this is me sorry was this not

00:50:41,290 --> 00:50:43,660
the right Ike Renee

00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:50,410
I'm just confused by semi-new acronyms

00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:51,220
in the last few months instead of I got

00:50:50,410 --> 00:50:59,950
the right one okay

00:50:51,220 --> 00:51:02,680
yeah gosh I guess not yeah I mean so the

00:50:59,950 --> 00:51:06,520
I guess the kubernetes project has coop

00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:09,280
dashboard right which is a very rich UI

00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:13,750
and I think for me coming into Clara

00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:15,190
foundry I'm not saying Stratos is its

00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:16,630
comparable at all but I think if we can

00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:18,100
have something that at least we've got a

00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:19,090
you I am on Cloud Foundry that's great

00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:20,800
because clearly cube Nettie's is

00:51:19,090 --> 00:51:24,580
marching forward with cube - but I'm not

00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:25,900
sure what we would bring in for the run

00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:27,340
time but if there is if there is things

00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:29,080
that people have concrete concretely

00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:31,300
think of that we'd want to surface

00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:33,130
through a Cloud Foundry UI relating to

00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:34,450
the runtime then yeah we'd definitely be

00:51:33,130 --> 00:51:41,410
up for that but we're not actively doing

00:51:34,450 --> 00:51:46,990
anything on that amendment minutes if

00:51:41,410 --> 00:51:49,300
there are any questions so just FYI as

00:51:46,990 --> 00:51:51,040
you think of your question and what's

00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:53,950
gonna happen next is that we're gonna go

00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:55,990
through the process of review and of

00:51:53,950 --> 00:51:58,840
course feedback to Cornelius and its

00:51:55,990 --> 00:52:01,420
team and then hopefully we go to vote

00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:04,120
and if it gets incubated and it's gonna

00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:06,010
transfer the assets to the foundation

00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:08,020
and into the incubator and so on so

00:52:06,010 --> 00:52:10,840
these are the steps coming forward right

00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:12,580
so this is your chance to talk to the

00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:14,830
people that have built it and that'll

00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:16,390
contributing this fantastic project so I

00:52:14,830 --> 00:52:18,430
think that'll put you in see otherwise

00:52:16,390 --> 00:52:19,900
we're gonna close it alright I have a

00:52:18,430 --> 00:52:22,560
question in terms of the collecting of

00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:25,990
data across all the different platforms

00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:28,590
instances when he's one of the instances

00:52:25,990 --> 00:52:31,180
get larger in terms of number of

00:52:28,590 --> 00:52:33,760
applications and stuff like that you

00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:40,090
have any feeling for how well this is

00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:42,070
going to work yeah so we we are doing

00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:45,520
that collation in the in the front end

00:52:42,070 --> 00:52:47,980
so beyond a certain point you will you

00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:49,660
will have problems we've I think we've

00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:52,150
had you know a couple of thousand apps

00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:54,270
and not had any any issues I think it

00:52:52,150 --> 00:52:55,680
I'm interested to hear from people up

00:52:54,270 --> 00:52:57,869
and custom used cases where maybe

00:52:55,680 --> 00:53:01,380
they've got you know significantly more

00:52:57,869 --> 00:53:04,860
apps and I think my have to consider a

00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:06,570
different approach to that we use you

00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:09,960
know we use various caching mechanisms

00:53:06,570 --> 00:53:11,640
to try maintain to maintain stuff so

00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:13,380
there but there's stuff we can do if

00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:14,820
performance comes a problem we've not

00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:17,220
seen that at the moment the browser

00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:19,650
copes quite well but if if people are

00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:23,280
seeing apps more or more than maybe 2000

00:53:19,650 --> 00:53:28,440
or so apps then yeah I think it stops to

00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:30,900
slow down thank you plastic thank you no

00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:36,119
okay we have time maybe for one last

00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:37,470
question no okay well thank you

00:53:36,119 --> 00:53:38,720
everybody sorry about the hiccup at the

00:53:37,470 --> 00:53:42,480
beginning

00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:44,400
Ola from Madrid from Malaga that's where

00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:46,619
I'm getting next but I will see you guys

00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:47,880
in San Francisco soon and then everybody

00:53:46,619 --> 00:53:53,030
on the call next month

00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:53,030
Cheers ciao Thanks thank you

00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:07,020
