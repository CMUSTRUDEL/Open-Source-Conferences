everybody's here I don't see Demetri but

00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:09,570
Donnie's there you can probably a big or

00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:11,969
dkn that's from someplace alright so we

00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:15,059
usually start with CFS so it might as

00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:16,859
well do that chip is here to give us the

00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:20,640
update that this one I think is that

00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:22,050
Oscar she is in fact a Toscana that'd be

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,150
maybe the first point to make if anybody

00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,760
here is a table can feel free to swing

00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:28,289
by the booth they'd love to see you

00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,210
Swarna and melissa from the foundation

00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:31,859
are there and there'll be various

00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,390
members of community that are

00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:36,450
volunteering to help us at the booth as

00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:40,410
well so actually some pretty decent CF

00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:42,450
content that's been going on there okay

00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:44,960
our own event we've got Basile coming up

00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:47,579
we launched the schedule so that's live

00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,460
more talks will start showing up over

00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:52,500
the course of the next month or so but

00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:56,629
the course schedules they're really good

00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:59,309
mix of end users interesting technology

00:00:56,629 --> 00:01:01,399
so I'm I think the schedule turned out

00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:04,080
really well and we want to thank all the

00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:06,960
track chairs who spent quite a bit of

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,689
time reviewing hundreds of submissions

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:14,070
and and kind of narrowing it down so

00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:16,310
amazing material was was proposed so

00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:18,659
that should be a lot of fun

00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:19,610
Lorna tells me to remember to tell

00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:23,189
everyone that early bird registration

00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:25,530
ends on the 18th today so if you want

00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:27,600
the discount I should do that although

00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:29,850
if you're a contributor and there's our

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,159
usual contributor code if you have any

00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:35,520
questions or changes that if you're a

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:38,520
speaker and you need to get in touch

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:41,520
with the events team use speakers at

00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:44,670
Cloud Foundry org I'm reading from a

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:47,340
list obviously let's see the other thing

00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:50,220
was that we we put out a member survey

00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:52,229
this was sent out to the points of

00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,579
contact that we have at each one of the

00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:55,979
corporate members of the foundation

00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:58,049
we're looking for feedback we do this

00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:00,570
about twice a year so just a reminder if

00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:02,460
you happen to be the point of contact or

00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:05,219
in particular if you're at a small

00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:06,479
company that's a member just make sure

00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:08,429
we get your feedback that would be great

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,080
because we do better if you tell us what

00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:12,270
we can do for you

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,590
and then I think so the last point I'll

00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:17,940
make is that it

00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:21,030
a bit of pmc lead news with Dimitri

00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:26,160
choosing to step back from the PMC lead

00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:28,019
role for Bosch that number one he's

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,099
gonna be missed right we to make sure

00:02:28,019 --> 00:02:31,769
he's been the stoic

00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:33,720
leader of I think I someone else that

00:02:31,769 --> 00:02:37,410
maybe was back the back of the Boche

00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:39,629
project for many years now he's moving

00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:43,560
on to go do some different things within

00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:46,049
pivotal and has nominated Marco from s

00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,819
AP who's been the project lead of the

00:02:46,049 --> 00:02:49,739
European contingent for the Bosch

00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:53,370
project so quite some time to take on

00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:55,319
the PMC lead role but nominations are

00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:58,530
open if anyone who's been active in that

00:02:55,319 --> 00:03:00,900
project wants to be considered you can

00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:03,030
email me directly and you can see more

00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:06,870
details about this on the Bosch mailing

00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:11,670
list so with that that's all I had for

00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:13,200
today all right thank you chip let's see

00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:15,870
if there's any question I'm looking at

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:20,090
the chat also so if you if you have

00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:20,090
question on the chat or on site you

00:03:20,329 --> 00:03:29,040
mention it I see that Chris o'clock is

00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:34,700
here Chris do you know if we'll have a

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,700
hackathon and like other stuff going on

00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:41,190
MX yeah will absolutely be having

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:44,940
another hackathon last one in Boston was

00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:46,109
really successful so hoping we get a lot

00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:48,410
of people who want to participate but

00:03:46,109 --> 00:03:50,940
yeah well they'll be Agathon

00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:53,340
excellent and I think part of the way

00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:55,829
the hackathon this is just to kind of

00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:57,959
remind people that don't participate I

00:03:55,829 --> 00:04:01,010
think when you register there's a little

00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:03,630
checkbox that says hey do you wanna

00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:06,840
register so put a hack - and obviously

00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:09,389
if you not sure we would suggest you -

00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:12,930
just say yes and then you can always not

00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:14,519
attend we would rather not but the other

00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:16,739
thing also is that if you don't check

00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:18,720
the box we don't know how many people so

00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:20,370
it's hard for us to control so please

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,070
check the box I would say just check the

00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:26,280
box if you can anybody don't check the

00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:27,210
box still swing by obviously the way

00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,130
hackathon work

00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:31,229
you put a team together and you try to

00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:35,280
build something cool like you remember

00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:37,560
last year or last time the winner did

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,240
you terraeum stuff and it's actually

00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,680
going through extensions and we'll talk

00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:45,319
about this later so it is there's lots

00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:48,780
of advantages consider participating ok

00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:51,539
with that unless there any question

00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:55,080
about CFS we're gonna move to kind of

00:04:51,539 --> 00:04:58,889
the quick highlights so the PMC's and

00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:01,919
then the two talks that we have so I

00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:04,440
don't see any questions ok cool

00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:07,560
so we usually start with one time we

00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:11,070
have every care Thanks hey so maybe can

00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:13,800
update us about a few things that have

00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:17,419
been really exciting or interesting on

00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:19,860
the CF application runtime front

00:05:17,419 --> 00:05:22,590
recently the routing team had a proposal

00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:25,620
about some of these our experience for

00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:26,669
weighted routing posted to see if dev so

00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,139
certainly if you have any feedback or

00:05:26,669 --> 00:05:28,800
thoughts on that I think they'd

00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:30,360
appreciate it

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:34,770
they're also looking at that as one

00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:37,199
potential new feature for the routing

00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:40,409
tier in Calgary that's going to drive

00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:42,300
their integration with the isseo system

00:05:40,409 --> 00:05:45,090
that they've been working on for a while

00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:48,150
I think also the campi team is making

00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:51,690
significant progress on rolling

00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:52,889
application updates and that I think

00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:54,320
that they may be close to having

00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:58,110
something that the community can

00:05:54,320 --> 00:06:01,380
experiment with more confidently and

00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:03,300
then also Jules maybe I see used online

00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:06,120
and can speak more to this but the

00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:10,409
garden team just incepted on some ideas

00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:14,060
about providing both better CPU

00:06:10,409 --> 00:06:21,479
monitoring and context inside of CF and

00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:23,280
better controls yes yes we we heard you

00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:30,150
loud and clear and only two or three

00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:34,380
years later we are going to fix all the

00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:36,419
very responsive Jules you you you are

00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:42,060
welcome you feel free to thanks in

00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:44,250
advance Jules is fun we reiterate for

00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:47,400
that here I would say quite quite

00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:50,070
seriously and the proposals on cff we've

00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,539
just inserted on it but feedback is is

00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:52,880
very welcome we're finding through this

00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:56,820
like quite iteratively

00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:59,310
and with lots of communications but any

00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:01,349
feedback about anything we've we've

00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:10,110
missed or any suggestions is very

00:07:01,349 --> 00:07:12,089
welcome I think those are some reason

00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:14,010
highlights as always I should be able to

00:07:12,089 --> 00:07:15,719
go to the road type EMC notes to see any

00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:20,099
more comprehensive information about the

00:07:15,719 --> 00:07:23,789
individual projects yeah any questions

00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:30,750
for Eric code Jules or folks for more on

00:07:23,789 --> 00:07:38,490
time no okay we'll move to open

00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:42,889
serviceworker I don't I'll ping him I

00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:45,740
guess we don't be this is he here no

00:07:42,889 --> 00:07:50,400
idea I know that they are having a talk

00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:55,620
at Basel and sort of like the updates

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:57,419
for open serviceworker and then also I

00:07:55,620 --> 00:08:00,810
know just because I've talked to dog

00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:03,839
yesterday that he was and the Bay Area

00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:07,229
to sort of discuss with what your report

00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:09,539
is wrong open serviceworker so glad

00:08:07,229 --> 00:08:11,310

that they attend or send me do things

00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:19,919
for next time it did not go back there's

00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:22,710
probably two key ones one is that a new

00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:25,860
release in the two that X line is open

00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:27,509
for comments right now and if you go

00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,889
look at the open serviceworker mailing

00:08:27,509 --> 00:08:33,060
list you'll see the Doug actually shared

00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:37,099
a kind of initial draft of what a v3 API

00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:39,280
may end up looking like all right cool

00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:41,169

00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:17,490
the world all right cool I'm sorry you

00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:23,560
you were seeing something and question

00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:26,440
funny of what to say don't you guys want

00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:28,630
to highlight the Zinio stem cell that

00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:31,930
got out and I think it's being tested or

00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:34,660
is it already ready for people to try

00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:36,490
out you know or or looking at it

00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:39,160
seriously I got a bunch of email

00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:40,660
yesterday about that awesome yeah so

00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:43,300
there's now a xenial stem cell line

00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:44,950
that's out we're trying to encourage

00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:47,950
everyone to start testing it and give us

00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:49,660
feedback as quickly as possible and

00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:52,730
start moving forward to that it should

00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:55,040
be up on Bosh IO

00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:57,589
quickly as well or it's there already

00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,089
sorry so definitely please start testing

00:10:57,589 --> 00:11:06,350
it and let us know how it's working for

00:10:59,089 --> 00:11:08,630
you I wasn't done sorry Danny I'm

00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:10,670
butchering your name do you want to add

00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:14,320
anything to kind of like what people

00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,320
should be thinking about for boss I

00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:20,380
think the Zinio testing is main thing

00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:23,089
that we're interested in we're

00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:25,940
continuing on some of our other stuff

00:11:23,089 --> 00:11:28,579
we've done a few past releases on Bosch

00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:30,250
266 and there were some links issues

00:11:28,579 --> 00:11:34,940
that should have people may want to

00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:36,649
update otherwise just kind of continuing

00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:38,360
on the trucks I think one other one

00:11:36,649 --> 00:11:43,160
we're working on right now is improving

00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:48,410
CBR integration for backups on director

00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:50,660
sides I think that's about it sweet

00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:54,110
thank you very much okay so last chance

00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:57,730
we'll watch any question anybody wants

00:11:54,110 --> 00:12:01,910
to mention something anything

00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:03,970
no I'll mention one thing I think I've

00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:07,490
said that publicly and I'll say it again

00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:08,209
Dimitri has been really phenomenal on

00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:09,920
Bosch

00:12:08,209 --> 00:12:11,899
we all know that we don't acknowledge it

00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,610
sometimes but you know we do it

00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:17,810
privately but I'll do it publicly and

00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:18,920
embarrass him he is a fearless leader

00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:21,529
fearless

00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:23,959
sort of you know proponent of Bosch and

00:12:21,529 --> 00:12:25,970
open source and showing me what critical

00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:27,319
goes here and we're gonna miss him a lot

00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:31,670
but the good thing is he's actually

00:12:27,319 --> 00:12:35,660
right here I know where he sits we all

00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:38,240
do need to take a web camera mic go and

00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:44,769
thank you for that I think what you're

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:48,649
saying is there's no escape exactly and

00:12:44,769 --> 00:12:51,949
nobody can enter it you need his help

00:12:48,649 --> 00:12:54,649
ping him and I'm sure he'll be happy to

00:12:51,949 --> 00:12:59,240
respond Thank You DK we love you at the

00:12:54,649 --> 00:13:01,550
bee tree love you too thing if it's

00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:05,660
definitely been fun

00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:07,880
all right cool so we'll do the last

00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:10,459
thing and then we'll go to the talks for

00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:13,310
extensions the main highlight is that we

00:13:10,459 --> 00:13:17,990
have a proposal out I believe it's the

00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:21,290
first time even as part of this year

00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:24,740
there is a project that sort of merges

00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:29,330
or marries or connects Cloud Foundry

00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:31,760
with you know this hot new thing called

00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:33,920
blockchain maybe not so hot anymore but

00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:37,190
certainly people are spending money on

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,839
this losing their money - okay connects

00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:42,500
connects blockchain with this hot new

00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:44,899
thing Cloud Foundry that's that's

00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:48,560
another way to say anyways the point is

00:13:44,899 --> 00:13:52,000
that this proposal was submitted it's

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:55,640
the winner of the hackathon in Boston

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,940
the team in particular Nima fabiani from

00:13:55,640 --> 00:14:00,410
IBM and the rest of the team they're

00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:03,080
looking forward to your feedback they've

00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:04,820
submitted the proposal I know you're

00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:08,120
very serious yesterday they were working

00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:09,620
on you know more stuff so you'll see a

00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,570
lot more things and they'll have an

00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:13,339
inception and all this but we need you

00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:15,350
right now to sort of take a look at the

00:14:13,339 --> 00:14:19,040
proposal take a look at the video from

00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:21,020
the last from presentation and give us

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:24,680
your feedback right because part of this

00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:26,839
open process is to allow you to mention

00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:28,790
what you like what you don't like don't

00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:31,490
necessarily you know give feedback on

00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:34,220
the direction we're gonna try to do a

00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:37,370
vote soon so you don't have a lot of

00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:39,529
time I would say I'll close the feedback

00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:41,690
tomorrow I said tonight but since I'm

00:14:39,529 --> 00:14:44,390
mentioning it today I give you guys a

00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:46,070
day and a half or two to give some

00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:49,130
feedback and then we'll go to a good and

00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:51,800
then once it's voted in or not then

00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:55,790
we'll go to to the extension and it

00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:58,550
becomes part of the cff and the code

00:14:55,790 --> 00:15:01,310
will migrate there and they'll be I

00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:04,459
guess a tracker with all the good stuff

00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:08,180
that comes with that okay so take a look

00:15:04,459 --> 00:15:09,410
at it I believe if the leg if you don't

00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:11,589
have that like how to put it in the

00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:14,820
notice once I get a chance right and

00:15:11,589 --> 00:15:16,710
Nima is actually local too

00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:18,900
so if you want to talk to them you can

00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:21,780
do that to this part of the Diego team

00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:23,720
so you can look for where Eric and the

00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:27,450
rest of the team is and your fireman

00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:30,210
okay so that's that's the main highlight

00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:32,580
for extensions then you stop here and

00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:34,140
see if there's any question for any of

00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:36,210
the things we've discussed so far and

00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:39,090
then then he asked

00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:42,020
sheesh to start getting ready for his

00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:44,460
presentation which is gonna be about

00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:45,930
service fabric and some of the updates

00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:49,230
and then after that we'll go to stock

00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:52,350
and weigh in for shield v8 so she she

00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:54,210
can get ready if you have questions you

00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:56,040
don't want to talk or you can't talk

00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:58,290
because you're in a loud place just type

00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:02,580
it in a chat or stock up to me and I'll

00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:05,340
read it for you sure dr. max I think

00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:07,050
then you can get started yeah go ahead

00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:14,640
and share your screen I don't see any

00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:16,440
question coming so okay you have about

00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:23,340
20 minutes so we can give those the 20

00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:27,930
minutes to James I'm sure my screen yes

00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:29,490
we can great okay so so we started with

00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:31,590
service fabric so there are a few

00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:33,780
updates on service fabric and then there

00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:35,910
is a demo lined up so today I have a

00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:37,650
couple of committers also with me who

00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:40,290
will take us through demo so sorrow and

00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:42,150
British actually so work for service

00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:45,270
fabric so they will go ahead with the

00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:46,890
demo so agenda is so we'll quickly have

00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:50,340
some project updates and then followed

00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:52,620
by a demo yeah so so during the cap

00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:54,000
called for the month of May that is

00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,530
where I actually presented the

00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,430
development plan for service fabric so

00:16:55,530 --> 00:17:01,320
these were some of the items which we

00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:03,930
planned for at least for the next by the

00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:06,150
next if summit so and now since we are

00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:07,950
almost at the midway I think it really

00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:10,500
makes sense to basically present the

00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:13,320
status of each of these items the first

00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:15,660
one is service fabric 2.0 so this is

00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:18,780
where this was also presented during the

00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:21,210
Boston summit where we spoke about our

00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:25,710
plans to evolve the service fabric

00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:27,450
design so this ff1 z1 auto design was

00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:28,559
quite opinionated so the plan is to

00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:32,909
basically move it to a more

00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:36,269
modular design where ease of onboarding

00:17:32,909 --> 00:17:38,370
other projects for example bbr or for

00:17:36,269 --> 00:17:41,460
example bringing some provisioners like

00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:43,799
a test becomes seamless the development

00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:47,370
for this is still ongoing as it is a

00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:49,590
major change for us and but by the time

00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:51,480
we get to service fabric to dot o in

00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:53,070
addition to what we have today as part

00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:57,990
of the deployment we will also end up

00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:59,960
with the CFC our HCD Bali's and the KSR

00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:03,029
api server will also be utilized

00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:05,820
basically to implement the control of

00:18:03,029 --> 00:18:08,460
design for service fabric so development

00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:11,159
is incremental as of today and currently

00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:14,580
we have been able to at least bring in

00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:17,850
some of the components at CD and Cuban

00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:20,490
it is API server in addition to this

00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:23,610
some of the implementations on the

00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:25,980
locking part so has also been moved from

00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:29,039
crowd foundries you have to basically at

00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:32,159
CD along with that some of the backup

00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:34,590
controllers has been implemented service

00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:38,840
hub decline for API server has been

00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:40,649
completed and now the major part of

00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:42,809
basically rewriting some of the

00:18:40,649 --> 00:18:44,340
controller so today we provision Bosch

00:18:42,809 --> 00:18:47,039
as well as docker based services so

00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:49,049
these controllers implementation is

00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,580
ongoing as of today and then there are

00:18:49,049 --> 00:18:52,559
some operation controllers which has to

00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:57,480
be read it and basically the pine

00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:59,879
controllers and in the back up on and

00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:02,509
then we are quite hopeful that which

00:18:59,879 --> 00:19:05,009
should be done before the basil summit

00:19:02,509 --> 00:19:07,409
so yeah so that's about the service

00:19:05,009 --> 00:19:10,019
fabric to doto the next one is service

00:19:07,409 --> 00:19:12,299
web break h a ends ADM and multi AZ on

00:19:10,019 --> 00:19:15,090
so this was another item which we have

00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:18,299
proposed and this was proposed for all

00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:20,820
the es basically on AWS Azure GCP as

00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:23,429
well as OpenStack so as of today the

00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:26,700
development is completed for all the

00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:28,860
years except Azure and but we are

00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:31,159
currently kept GCP and OpenStack

00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:34,889
implementation under observation to just

00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:37,980
run some tests and make a note off with

00:19:34,889 --> 00:19:40,529
the behavior and so today we plan to

00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:42,419
present a demo on this as well as during

00:19:40,529 --> 00:19:44,460
the Basel submit there is a session plan

00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:48,899
where we'll talk about the

00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:50,730
nitty-gritties of implementing a change

00:19:48,899 --> 00:19:52,950
idea multi a-z for a stateful broker

00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:56,249
covering all the AES and then again

00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:59,730
there will be a demo so that's about the

00:19:56,249 --> 00:20:02,399
service table catch is rate limiting so

00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:04,049
this again the primary motivation for

00:20:02,399 --> 00:20:07,679
this story was to address some of the

00:20:04,049 --> 00:20:09,299
limitations actually wash for example

00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:12,980
giving a fair share to the various

00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:16,350
lifecycle operations and then again

00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:20,549
basically making being fault tolerant

00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:23,340
towards Bosch unavailability so so this

00:20:20,549 --> 00:20:24,960
is and then again not to basically put

00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:27,269
in there in deterministic load on Bosh

00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:30,269
so this is this story has already been

00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:33,749
completed and this is available for

00:20:30,269 --> 00:20:36,840
people to you use then next one is

00:20:33,749 --> 00:20:38,279
deployment hooks this is where service

00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:40,080
fabric today provides capability to

00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:42,629
service owners to basically define some

00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,879
of books for the lifecycle operations

00:20:42,629 --> 00:20:47,190
basically for example a pre create

00:20:44,879 --> 00:20:50,759
report of the update or a pre delete or

00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:53,820
even a pre bind a pre unbind books and

00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:55,649
then this implementation actually runs

00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:58,230
in a secure isolated manner allowing

00:20:55,649 --> 00:20:59,789
only for some specific syscalls so we do

00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:03,239
restrict some of the calls for example

00:20:59,789 --> 00:21:05,759
the network calls and then during the CF

00:21:03,239 --> 00:21:07,320
summit in the basal there is another

00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:10,519
session which is lined up for this where

00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:13,499
we will talk about how we have basically

00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:16,379
implemented this in an so that the the

00:21:13,499 --> 00:21:19,350
load so the basically the workloads are

00:21:16,379 --> 00:21:21,059
run are run in an isolated in a secure

00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:24,059
manner action so so that's another

00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:27,749
session which will be presented by our

00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:31,320
committers the last two items we are yet

00:21:27,749 --> 00:21:33,509
to get started on that so but more

00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:36,539
details can be can be found in the

00:21:33,509 --> 00:21:40,259
trackers actually and now I think we can

00:21:36,539 --> 00:21:42,239
move on to the demo so I will ask Plitt

00:21:40,259 --> 00:21:47,009
ich and sort of kindly consider screen

00:21:42,239 --> 00:21:53,039
and then we can get yeah so any

00:21:47,009 --> 00:21:55,820
questions still here dr. max or anyone I

00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,820
don't see anything

00:21:56,470 --> 00:22:10,100
continue you have about 14 minutes can

00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:16,400
you see my screen yes we can higher

00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:18,170
mobility so I as a motivation you can

00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:28,580
minimize your window actually I think I

00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:36,890
can see you yeah fine I mean you can

00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:39,320
really do a full screen yeah yeah so the

00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:42,080
motivation behind was this a safe

00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:43,580
service proper was single not p.m. so

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:47,180
that was obviously single point of

00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:50,300
failure and also a couple of points like

00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:53,570
it was not PR disaster recovery applied

00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:56,480
so one VM was running particular

00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:58,730
abilities on land in that zone the data

00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:01,580
center is completely down so it will not

00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:04,040
be and then they are compliant

00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:07,580
so also during the update of this

00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:09,980
solution awake so it is to take around 1

00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:13,760
to 10 minutes in regular updates around

00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:17,330
the minutes when the package of code of

00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:18,860
it used to happen and then you know the

00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:22,730
extension update it needs to take quite

00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:25,340
a few mixed around 5 to 10 minutes so so

00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:28,460
to address all these issues we come up

00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:30,980
with the approach my service topic

00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:33,680
broker will be having two modes so you

00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:37,700
basically in the master slave model

00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:40,520
follow majestic order and it will be

00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:43,130
having also the zero downtime deployment

00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:48,310
in the sense the failover happens

00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:48,310
suppose what is during the update or any

00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:54,620
so the failure will happens in in few

00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:58,040
seconds in worst case around 10 to 15

00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:59,990
minutes also as I mentioned then two

00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:04,730
nodes will be situated in two different

00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:08,030
availability zone so thus we make that a

00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:10,130
safe HL and also the backbone for

00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:13,220
for this master/slave architecture will

00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:16,850
help you make utilization of people ID

00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:18,770
where the key polarity basically figures

00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:21,440
out which node is mastered without is

00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:23,300
late so based on that so master will be

00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:28,060
serving the rapist at any point of time

00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:31,010
so this whole model we have proposed for

00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:35,420
GCP OpenStack turbulence and actually

00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:39,890
assess each dimension so this is a block

00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:43,130
diagram of H a cluster so this is the

00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:46,130
tower controller so and there there e

00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:49,070
two games for the broker V em1 and em2

00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:50,750
those are two different zones and one VM

00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:52,820
will be acting as a master and other

00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:56,120
things will be acting as a backup or

00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:59,900
standby node so there will be highly

00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:04,190
available IP or HIV so in case of GCP it

00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:06,260
will be unload panel load balancer IP so

00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:10,640
the all the requested lifecycle requests

00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:13,900
like a create fine unbind delete for

00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:17,390
service instances right so those we have

00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:20,480
this highly available IP and all the

00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:23,150
traffic will be forwarding you the

00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:26,570
master node at any point of time by this

00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:30,530
IP when failover actually happens so

00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:32,630
then then the traffic gets forwarded to

00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:34,430
the second beam which one was the

00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:37,370
standby BM that point of end so that

00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:39,560
becomes the new master and the turkey

00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:44,120
goes there and the requests I will start

00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:46,940
by that VM by that available so it

00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:49,880
happens in ten to fifteen seconds in

00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:52,400
worst case usually it is around four to

00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:54,170
six seconds so in this demo so you

00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,210
quickly we'll set up our demo and in

00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:59,840
this demo we'll be showing the basic HL

00:25:56,210 --> 00:26:02,150
etcetera for multi C which is a cluster

00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:05,330
then one failover scenario where we will

00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:10,250
prepare process down as you know only

00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:13,970
that portion and so we'll be making

00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:17,000
process down of course Alex proper then

00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:19,940
over over over to of the turbulence

00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,520
around GCP console then will be see a

00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:27,080
downtime measurement by the passkey ffs

00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:29,330
so I hand over to release then we'll be

00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:47,660
answering their questions so British

00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:49,580
over to you go ahead with the demo first

00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:52,130
will be a setup

00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:54,050
so as you know that service fabric is

00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:55,520
abortionist deployment so first what I

00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:57,620
will do is that I'll show how our

00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:59,870
deployment looks like so these are the

00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:02,150
VM side service fabric is finally

00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:06,440
deployed with as you can see that one of

00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:08,210
our moon belongs to one and two so

00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:12,320
basically the deployment is still across

00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:14,810
multiple beams so that we are suppose

00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:17,450
one of the nodes in one of these this

00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:20,450
goes down then the other is the earthen

00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:25,070
moon is able to come up and still serve

00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:26,510
the process so on my screen on the left

00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:28,400
hand side you can see one of the nodes

00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:30,020
and of the right hand side you can see

00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,700
the other nodes over the left hand side

00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:33,560
we have the master node which is present

00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:34,970
inside one and on the right hand side I

00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:37,520
have two slave node which is present

00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:39,770
from Z so I will chose to showcase a

00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:41,420
very small demo of the use case for one

00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:44,090
of our use cases is a create service

00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:46,040
instance which is done through the

00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:48,620
broken process of the broker we are

00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:50,180
process running in one of the nodes so

00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:55,730
first what I will do is that I will do a

00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:59,420
simple and just steal the logs so that

00:27:55,730 --> 00:28:05,020
we can see which request is coming to

00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:10,670
which node so that we know that which is

00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:12,500
and so for example these are the nodes

00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:13,970
on my left hand side you can see some of

00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:16,250
the logs are moving because some

00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:18,560
activity is flowing on so now what I

00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:21,520
will do is that at into a simple catalog

00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:24,170
operator and hit the catalog improper so

00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:25,450
you can see that the log started

00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:27,429
responding on my left hand

00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:30,639
which means that that hold is active and

00:28:27,429 --> 00:28:32,919
sources master right now so moving on if

00:28:30,639 --> 00:28:35,590
I good one one of the operations that we

00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:37,870
want to create we want to showcase here

00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:41,980
so for example I will create a blueprint

00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:45,100
instance here so if so before doing that

00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:46,899
one Showcase is that we are using since

00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:50,320
this is a GCP landscape so we are using

00:28:46,899 --> 00:28:53,380
the Google load balancers are provided

00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:56,200
by a TCP load balancing between the two

00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:57,760
loads of service traffic broker so this

00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:00,340
is the load balancer that we have this

00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:02,230
is a DCP counseled against OKC so if I

00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:04,330
go into this load balancer we have two

00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:06,100
loads so the way I was showing you on

00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:08,049
the module that one of the moves is

00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:11,080
master the other one is slave so the

00:29:08,049 --> 00:29:13,000
master is now showing as healthy so the

00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:15,399
project that we have put up here is that

00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,230
if a node is faster it shows basically

00:29:15,399 --> 00:29:19,929
for the load balancer so that the

00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:22,000
traffic is redirected to that coming

00:29:19,929 --> 00:29:25,740
back to our demo so I'll now fire a

00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:28,899
three instance so the call has gone to

00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:32,110
the local master node now what I will do

00:29:28,899 --> 00:29:35,260
is that I will simulate an use case so

00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:37,539
for example let's say I bring down all

00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:39,580
the processes in this node so this could

00:29:37,539 --> 00:29:41,230
happen one of the senior dues as sort of

00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:43,240
discussed that this would have been a

00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:45,820
scenario for a routing update or taxing

00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:48,220
a VM 50 other outlets and easy failure

00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:50,470
one of the scenarios could be that so

00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:52,840
even if we have one of the scenarios

00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:54,850
like this then the other node should

00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:57,070
take up the traffic and we should

00:29:54,850 --> 00:30:03,880
shortly see that the other would mix of

00:29:57,070 --> 00:30:05,409
the traffic and starts as you can see

00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:07,389
now that the other node had started

00:30:05,409 --> 00:30:09,549
picking up the traffic now so basically

00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:11,620
cm does a last compression call on the

00:30:09,549 --> 00:30:13,539
broker so since we have already stopped

00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:15,190
a node on the master so the slave has

00:30:13,539 --> 00:30:19,409
picked up the traffic and the operation

00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:22,419
is going on so if I just watch over this

00:30:19,409 --> 00:30:24,370
creation process so this should succeed

00:30:22,419 --> 00:30:25,929
nevertheless even though one of her

00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:30,010
moods is down because other node is

00:30:25,929 --> 00:30:31,929
still up so similarly if we go back to

00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:34,090
the console as people discussing a while

00:30:31,929 --> 00:30:36,639
back so now that the other known has

00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:38,620
become the master we should shortly see

00:30:36,639 --> 00:30:41,680
the switch over as you can see here the

00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:44,320
which was cathy has now become down or

00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:47,559
unhealthy and other which was unhealthy

00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:48,760
has not become so you become healthy so

00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:52,059
that is why the traffic is getting

00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:56,380
redirected here so this process will

00:30:52,059 --> 00:31:01,690
take some time in service that we

00:30:56,380 --> 00:31:03,820
provision meanwhile we can maybe take

00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:06,210
some questions if there is any from the

00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,210
audience

00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:21,289
I got a one question any any reason why

00:31:19,249 --> 00:31:35,029
boss DNS cannot be used instead of a

00:31:21,289 --> 00:31:43,039
load balancer what's the question that I

00:31:35,029 --> 00:31:44,990
missed I know yeah I was asking if both

00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:48,259
DNS can be used instead of a load

00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:51,289
balancer it seems like it might be

00:31:48,259 --> 00:31:53,749
fairly expensive to set up all of the

00:31:51,289 --> 00:31:59,119
machinery for virtual IPS or a Loeb

00:31:53,749 --> 00:32:01,940
answer board Dinah's does provide you

00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:04,009
know similar functionality if it's a you

00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:11,539
know genus being resolved within the

00:32:04,009 --> 00:32:13,970
cluster Dimitri I think so we haven't

00:32:11,539 --> 00:32:16,940
evaluated this option actually but we

00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:19,730
can definitely look into it and what the

00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:21,889
idea was to be to be more cloud9 native

00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:23,330
in this case and I think that is why we

00:32:21,889 --> 00:32:26,570
have gone with approaches which have

00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:28,639
been quite specific to the the target

00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:30,590
the target infrastructure for example in

00:32:28,639 --> 00:32:32,869
case of AWS we use the virtual IP based

00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:35,509
approach and where we basically float

00:32:32,869 --> 00:32:38,899
the virtual IP and then again depending

00:32:35,509 --> 00:32:40,309
on for example for OpenStack we we use

00:32:38,899 --> 00:32:42,139
the allowed address pair approach and

00:32:40,309 --> 00:32:44,509
then in case of GCP we have the load

00:32:42,139 --> 00:32:46,610
balancer that was the thought process

00:32:44,509 --> 00:32:48,980
behind some of these implementations but

00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:52,009
as you said we can definitely look into

00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:56,779
it and then we can evaluate that option

00:32:52,009 --> 00:32:58,909
as well one one challenge when doing

00:32:56,779 --> 00:33:01,039
that approach well there's two

00:32:58,909 --> 00:33:02,960
challenges right one is a you know oh

00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:04,460
why is this a certainly different threat

00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:08,960
which means that they now have their own

00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:10,759
inferences but the second I think more

00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,440
interesting challenge is that you know

00:33:10,759 --> 00:33:16,190
one of the failures you were mentioning

00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:18,799
is an AZ failure and when a hizzy

00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:22,700
failure happens depending on the ayahs

00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:26,269
right they you may not potentially be

00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:27,810
able to use their a ap is to do changes

00:33:26,269 --> 00:33:32,700
right so for example some

00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:37,530
maybe you know an API won't be available

00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:38,730
to change your virtual IP right so

00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:40,170
that's that's one of the kind of a

00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:42,150
failure scenarios that's very hard to

00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:45,810
deal with if you're relying on the I ass

00:33:42,150 --> 00:34:01,320
because when I as the failure mode there

00:33:45,810 --> 00:34:04,440
is no guarantee how it will react you

00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:06,630
have about guys about two and a half

00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:08,790
minutes so we can pass it to the next

00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:12,420
demo so maybe you can show us the next

00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:14,460
thing and turn any note you know decays

00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:17,550
here if you guys need a little extra

00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:18,930
time be ahead and take it I probably

00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:21,720
don't have 20 minutes worth of material

00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:23,100
so okay all right cool thanks James so

00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:26,370
if you guys need a little bit more time

00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:30,320
that's cool but let's say see if you can

00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:35,550
wrap it up in about seven minutes seven

00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:37,860
okay so apart from that so the eyes we

00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:40,500
saw that this operation succeeded right

00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:43,170
now so if you check here to see if

00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:45,810
service status so the operation has now

00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:47,670
succeeded so the use case that we were

00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:50,520
trying to show here it was simple that

00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:53,400
even if we for even if a user has filed

00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:55,140
a request and in between that our proper

00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:57,900
process goes down or some sort of may

00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:59,580
see failure occurs or some beam some due

00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:02,400
to some process the process goes down

00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:03,900
stain the rock of rugged is equal to

00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,240
serve the request and complete the

00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:07,850
operation so this was one of the

00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:10,550
scenarios which I wanted to demonstrate

00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:12,990
now I'll demonstrate one turbulent

00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:15,240
instead so we will trigger one torpedoes

00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:20,160
incident and we will showcase the

00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:22,800
failover time that takes for bringing

00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:24,390
the other boat back to master so I just

00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,980
bring up all the processes back from

00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:28,170
this zone so that we are able to

00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:29,820
simulate the incident so what is

00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:32,070
happening in this incident is that we

00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:35,610
will be killing one of the broken doors

00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:37,980
so I need an app see if app which does

00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:40,820
something helping operation of this so

00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:40,820
and this part

00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:48,390
okay so the way I was explaining is that

00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:50,130
what we are doing in this turbulence

00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:52,050
incident so I have now triggered the

00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:53,850
transit sincere so what we are doing

00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:57,060
here is that we are trying to kill one

00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:58,470
of the broker Williams here and maybe

00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:00,660
that kill could have been not delete

00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:02,970
operation so it's the same simple

00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:05,280
turbine incident that we say we can see

00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:06,840
on the turbulence release so we are

00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:09,480
trying to simulate that incident and be

00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:12,360
able to check that how how fast a broken

00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:14,760
recovers from that failure so the zeros

00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:17,570
here indicate that the loop is still

00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:19,650
available and if we hand the timestamps

00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:21,870
lengthening the operation is happening

00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:24,930
here pre one second so the time stamp in

00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:27,000
da indicates that and once the finger

00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:29,250
pressure one some hooker goes down then

00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,830
we will see the value one which

00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:34,470
indicates unavailability status and then

00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:42,600
if it comes back up then it will see

00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:50,310
that so meanwhile maybe I can just show

00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:52,110
that this operation is check so as you

00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:54,750
can see that one operation is going on

00:36:52,110 --> 00:37:02,100
on the wash that it is trying to kill

00:36:54,750 --> 00:37:07,170
the boat so it will take a couple of

00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:09,780
minutes here so emotions if there are

00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:13,320
any further questions that we can dig up

00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:15,090
I have a quick question is your service

00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:16,950
broker does it have any state that needs

00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:23,700
to be transitioned across from the

00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:27,750
active to the passive yes so it doesn't

00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:31,400
need to transit any straight as a as

00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:36,870
such but is its model such a lie alike

00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:41,160
so it cannot work being both node being

00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:43,620
active active so one at a time it should

00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:48,030
serve the request as you will get it

00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:50,900
also maintains a state now as part of a

00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:53,250
separate City

00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:55,020
there are one there are few operations

00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:57,270
where it could lead to race conditions

00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:59,010
and that is to avoid such race

00:37:57,270 --> 00:38:03,870
conditions is why we have implemented in

00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:06,350
a master/slave architecture I hope that

00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:06,350
answers your question

00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:16,380
[Music]

00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:18,930
I know you're targeting GCP does this

00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:20,790
work in I know you're using keep alive D

00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:21,900
does this work in these fear if you're

00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:23,970
using brrp

00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:28,920
you guys have support for a virtual

00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:32,370
router address trading what these figure

00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:34,860
we haven't right this actually for we so

00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:36,540
we're not really sure about that okay

00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:38,910
because one thing you may want to look

00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:41,760
at the the H a proxy bought released an

00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:43,830
incubator has it uses people at D on the

00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:46,320
H a proxy nodes and they trade a bit

00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:49,080
back and forth which takes the place of

00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:51,630
your I as load balancer but it generally

00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:53,970
only works inside things like on Prem

00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:55,980
vSphere effect we did try it and Google

00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:57,390
and it doesn't work but if you get into

00:38:55,980 --> 00:39:05,160
the vSphere side of that that might be

00:38:57,390 --> 00:39:09,540
helpful sure and I'm not a questions

00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:10,950
knows supposed to sees a different

00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:13,860
screen because we were still seeing the

00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:16,230
turbulence yes so now that the

00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:19,290
turbulence test as a ended so I just

00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:21,510
wanted to showcase here so the 36 as you

00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:24,090
can see this timestamp so at 36 the

00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:25,770
broker started becoming down so that's

00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:28,830
why the warning came that the broker is

00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:31,350
down and it came back up at the last

00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:35,220
down signal that we got was on 49 and by

00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:36,750
50 it came back up so simply by

00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:39,420
subtraction I can see that we took

00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:42,900
around 14 seconds for the failover to

00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:46,110
happen so the process came back up

00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:48,150
within 14 seconds so on running the

00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:50,760
turbulence test so we see that our

00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:52,830
process failover time is approximately

00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:54,630
so best-case that we get around this

00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:56,460
like five to six depends from the

00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:58,860
scenario basically so first what we

00:39:56,460 --> 00:40:01,500
simulated was a process down scenario

00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:03,589
this is a like kill vm scenario so

00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:05,450
best-case we get around 60

00:40:03,589 --> 00:40:09,890
seven seconds and was specific 8 around

00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:14,170
15 seconds feel overtime so that is all

00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:18,349
that I wanted to showcase in the demo so

00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:21,229
yeah yeah thanks Otto and thanks Leticia

00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:25,849
I think if there are no other question

00:40:21,229 --> 00:40:27,859
then I think oh so I guess the thing to

00:40:25,849 --> 00:40:30,229
remind people is that serviceworker is

00:40:27,859 --> 00:40:32,359
part of the extensions group it's it's

00:40:30,229 --> 00:40:34,489
been there for a while and I would

00:40:32,359 --> 00:40:37,940
encourage you to take a look at it

00:40:34,489 --> 00:40:41,239
it works and I guess I should can can

00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:43,130
add more but northern Iran CF but also I

00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:46,039
think they added support for communities

00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:49,279
so if you wanted to manage your services

00:40:46,039 --> 00:40:51,650
there and it's sort of a management

00:40:49,279 --> 00:40:54,469
platform for your services right so I

00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:56,829
would say if you are looking for things

00:40:54,469 --> 00:40:59,479
like this especially with HJ support now

00:40:56,829 --> 00:41:01,190
you know pay attention to that instead

00:40:59,479 --> 00:41:03,289
of trying to recreate it yourself and

00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:06,920
they are looking for feedback and an

00:41:03,289 --> 00:41:09,650
help so feel free to be efficient in the

00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:12,019
team sure and I think you can reach out

00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:13,640
to us using the github channel as well

00:41:12,019 --> 00:41:15,410
as slack so we have we do have a

00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:18,859
selection eligible so feel free to post

00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:27,319
any questions there and it's obviously

00:41:18,859 --> 00:41:30,229
service - fabric or service product okay

00:41:27,319 --> 00:41:32,299
so I don't see any other questions so

00:41:30,229 --> 00:41:34,369
maybe issues we can stop your screen

00:41:32,299 --> 00:41:36,710
sharing and then we'll pass it to our

00:41:34,369 --> 00:41:42,650
friends at stuck in Wayne and James Hunt

00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:47,329
is here to talk about shield e8 yes we

00:41:42,650 --> 00:42:01,339
can see your screen James but we don't

00:41:47,329 --> 00:42:02,420
hear you all right nice my av person so

00:42:01,339 --> 00:42:05,150
I thought I'd give a little bit of

00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:06,619
update on shield a little bit of

00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:07,549
background on field to start if you're

00:42:06,619 --> 00:42:09,410
not familiar with it

00:42:07,549 --> 00:42:10,729
shield is an open source projects Derek

00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:13,579
and Wayne spearheaded about two and a

00:42:10,729 --> 00:42:15,650
half years ago to bring backup services

00:42:13,579 --> 00:42:16,650
into cloud foundry because we've got a

00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:18,420
lot of clouds out there

00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:20,220
bending under making life creating

00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:21,510
wonderful for devs

00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:23,279
but the ops guys were getting a little

00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:24,750
bit nervous because all the data was

00:42:23,279 --> 00:42:27,869
sitting out there no one was back it up

00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:31,079
so we built shield we went through a

00:42:27,869 --> 00:42:33,990
couple of revisions on the UI this last

00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:35,819
year we've finished up the v8 UI which

00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:38,849
is a complete retooling and more

00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:41,640
operator focus I did give my

00:42:38,849 --> 00:42:45,059
presentation at CF summit in Boston

00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:47,490
about shield that video is online I

00:42:45,059 --> 00:42:50,430
think from 500 org website you can find

00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:52,950
all those talks I was going to give a

00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:55,380
demo during that talk and that didn't

00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:58,650
really work out because five demos

00:42:55,380 --> 00:43:00,299
fun stuff as it turns out I'm not going

00:42:58,650 --> 00:43:02,490
to give a demo today because I didn't

00:43:00,299 --> 00:43:04,380
have enough time to pull it together if

00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:06,869
there's interest I can go ahead and look

00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:08,369
at doing one next cat call but I wanted

00:43:06,869 --> 00:43:10,529
to talk about today with some of the

00:43:08,369 --> 00:43:13,200
community outreach stuff we're gonna

00:43:10,529 --> 00:43:16,529
start doing and have started doing with

00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:19,260
shield as a project for a while she'll

00:43:16,529 --> 00:43:21,329
kind of languished as a github.com so I

00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:23,490
start going slash shield and that's

00:43:21,329 --> 00:43:26,160
where you went for everything

00:43:23,490 --> 00:43:29,069
a lot of github issues pour requests but

00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:32,099
no real community or documentation so

00:43:29,069 --> 00:43:34,140
starting early this year we went ahead

00:43:32,099 --> 00:43:36,539
and put together shield project IO

00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:39,799
this is still a work in progress but

00:43:36,539 --> 00:43:43,559
this is our primary focus on on the

00:43:39,799 --> 00:43:45,930
marketing and an outreach side of things

00:43:43,559 --> 00:43:48,630
shield retic that I was going to become

00:43:45,930 --> 00:43:51,390
our primary communication channel with

00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:55,049
everyone so starting from the front this

00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:56,400
is this is my open source sales pitch we

00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:58,049
write a lot of software and a lot of

00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,329
software it doesn't get a lot of

00:43:58,049 --> 00:44:02,819
marketing because it's open source so

00:44:00,329 --> 00:44:05,160
we're trying something different by

00:44:02,819 --> 00:44:07,319
trying to explain what the things that

00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:10,200
we have built are and we're starting

00:44:07,319 --> 00:44:11,579
with shield so a little bit of a landing

00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:15,750
page you know discussion of all the

00:44:11,579 --> 00:44:20,849
things shield can do what platforms we

00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:22,260
support and then some blog stuff we're

00:44:20,849 --> 00:44:24,089
going to be collocating all of our

00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:27,000
documentation here starting with the

00:44:24,089 --> 00:44:28,820
shield operators manual this is all live

00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:31,670
by the way so you can go look at this

00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:33,140
today please do be advised it is still

00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:37,640
work-in-progress and we're working hard

00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:39,080
to flesh out a lot of documentation but

00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:41,210
we've met we're starting an ops manual

00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:42,500
to try and take some of the edge off of

00:44:41,210 --> 00:44:43,850
getting this thing up and running

00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:45,320
because I've talked to a lot of people

00:44:43,850 --> 00:44:46,970
in the community and there's there's a

00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:47,990
lot of questions about what shield is

00:44:46,970 --> 00:44:49,970
and how it works

00:44:47,990 --> 00:44:51,290
questions that shouldn't be questions

00:44:49,970 --> 00:44:53,840
anymore and we're trying to turn those

00:44:51,290 --> 00:44:56,590
into answers so there will be a lot of

00:44:53,840 --> 00:45:00,050
information here in the dockside for

00:44:56,590 --> 00:45:04,600
operators wishing to spin shield we've

00:45:00,050 --> 00:45:07,280
got starting up our plugins reference

00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:09,920
plugins is how shield does back up so if

00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:11,210
you want to back up Postgres for example

00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:13,370
you would come out and look at the

00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:15,350
Postgres plugin and it would provide all

00:45:13,370 --> 00:45:16,490
the configuration necessary to do your

00:45:15,350 --> 00:45:19,010
backups and stores

00:45:16,490 --> 00:45:20,390
so now we used to put all this on go org

00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:22,010
because we're a bunch of developers and

00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:24,470
assume that everyone else in the world

00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:25,760
loved reading go Docs it turns out

00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:30,440
that's not the case so we're kind of

00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:32,660
putting it here on the website the other

00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:35,810
side of things from documentation is the

00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:39,200
developer's documentation we're trying

00:45:35,810 --> 00:45:41,150
to be better about involving open source

00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:43,370
public community in the development

00:45:41,150 --> 00:45:45,830
process of field and understanding the

00:45:43,370 --> 00:45:46,970
road map and understanding how the thing

00:45:45,830 --> 00:45:49,760
works under the hood and how to

00:45:46,970 --> 00:45:51,230
contribute the first thing is really

00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:53,150
about the only thing that's on the dead

00:45:51,230 --> 00:45:55,610
side of the website right now is the

00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:57,320
shield api reference so if you've ever

00:45:55,610 --> 00:45:59,900
had to try and curl something against

00:45:57,320 --> 00:46:01,580
shield if you're curious about you know

00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:03,800
how to get a list of all stores for a

00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:05,740
tenant all this stuff is now out there

00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:08,540
and this is procedurally generated

00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:10,610
through a concourse pipeline so as we

00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:13,130
push changes up and make releases the

00:46:10,610 --> 00:46:14,570
website updates automatically because

00:46:13,130 --> 00:46:17,270
I'll be the first to admit I'm Way too

00:46:14,570 --> 00:46:20,680
lazy to do these things by hand so I

00:46:17,270 --> 00:46:20,680
will use concourse wherever I can

00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:26,930
similarly from an automation standpoint

00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:29,510
we are syndicating our github releases

00:46:26,930 --> 00:46:31,430
over the website we're not writing any

00:46:29,510 --> 00:46:32,930
release notes specific to the website so

00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:35,090
these are the same as they are on github

00:46:32,930 --> 00:46:37,130
but this is trying to facilitate the

00:46:35,090 --> 00:46:40,340
goal of getting everyone to go through

00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:41,460
shield project il-4 anything they need

00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:42,680
about shield

00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:44,000
[Music]

00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:46,040
and to finish up I want to talk about

00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,620
the community page because as I said

00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:50,720
this is a lot about community outreach

00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:53,060
we do have a slack org that we're

00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:54,860
running now we still run this shield

00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:57,200
channel and CF slack if you're

00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:59,960
interested the main reason we spun up

00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:01,790
our own slack org is we have used users

00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:03,680
and use cases outside of Cloud Foundry

00:47:01,790 --> 00:47:06,500
and a lot of them were a little

00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:09,320
reluctant to join CF slack just to talk

00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:11,180
to us about shield so we'll be probably

00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:14,180
in both places for the foreseeable

00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:19,040
future our dev stuff is all taking place

00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:21,380
on on the actual shield slack we have

00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:23,950
teams channels and things that we're

00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:25,880
doing but that's there if you need help

00:47:23,950 --> 00:47:28,700
we've listed up all the good enough

00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:30,800
stuff we've got a Trello board now and

00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:34,190
we're using the Trello board to kind of

00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:36,860
prioritize all of our work outside of

00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:39,530
github issues we try to github projects

00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:42,830
and work too thrilled with it github

00:47:39,530 --> 00:47:44,120
issues are hard we might look at the

00:47:42,830 --> 00:47:46,280
little tracker but for now we're going

00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:49,580
Trello so this is kind of a it's a

00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:50,870
public board with non open membership so

00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:53,690
if you want to keep track of where we're

00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:56,630
at on what we're working on this is

00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:57,800
where to go what we're doing and the

00:47:56,630 --> 00:47:59,720
last thing I wanted to follow up on

00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:02,570
whether finish up on was our shield

00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:05,650
roadmap call so I had some conversations

00:48:02,570 --> 00:48:08,750
with folks at CF summit and the biggest

00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:10,550
the biggest blocker most people had and

00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:12,410
wanting to get involved in shield was

00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:14,300
not knowing where the heck we were going

00:48:12,410 --> 00:48:16,310
we're starting Wayne was going with

00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:18,470
shield where the open source side of

00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:20,660
shield was going so we put together this

00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:22,910
roadmap call we just had our first call

00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:25,490
last Thursday I will be doing these

00:48:22,910 --> 00:48:28,760
every Thursday or every second Thursday

00:48:25,490 --> 00:48:31,520
of the month over zoom and it's just a

00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:33,380
place to get in and talk to the shield

00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:35,240
devs figure out where we're going what

00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:37,460
we're doing we'll be running through the

00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:39,950
Trello board we'll be talking about

00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:41,480
future direction and new features and

00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:43,940
then my favorite part of this is the

00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:46,070
open forum which is where anybody can

00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:47,540
join and we just talk through issues and

00:48:46,070 --> 00:48:50,300
the issues are have been deploying any

00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:54,260
questions you have any gaps that you've

00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:56,539
noticed in the project pretty much it's

00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:58,279
a it's an open

00:48:56,539 --> 00:49:00,650
users can come to us and tell us what

00:48:58,279 --> 00:49:03,859
they think and then after each call we

00:49:00,650 --> 00:49:06,919
are posting summaries this is actually

00:49:03,859 --> 00:49:11,839
more of a novel than a summary but

00:49:06,919 --> 00:49:13,339
that's that's my fault so that's where

00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:14,929
we're at with shield trying to get a

00:49:13,339 --> 00:49:16,160
little bit more community engagement and

00:49:14,929 --> 00:49:18,380
trying to get a little bit more public

00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:20,719
visibility on the project because it's

00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:24,709
good software it just has a bad
