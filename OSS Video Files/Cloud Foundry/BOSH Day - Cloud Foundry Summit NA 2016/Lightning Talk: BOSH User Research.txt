my name is Nisha Ramachandran I am and

00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:11,010
I'm part of the ops manager team I tend

00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,469
to walk around a lot on the stage so

00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:16,500
this is a little weird for me but I was

00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:18,210
trying to stay near the mic so as far as

00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,699
the ops manager team he started out a

00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:23,550
round of research to see how people were

00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:27,119
using Bosh and what we really wanted to

00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:29,550
get to was two things one of them was

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,710
you know how hard is it really to use

00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:35,370
boss because I heard really like bad

00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:37,860
stories about it and the second one was

00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:40,079
around what are some best practices

00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:42,090
around applying Bosh and so these were

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,739
the two things that we really wanted to

00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,960
get at through this user research and

00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:48,870
I'm here today to share some of those

00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:52,289
results in whatever can fit in the next

00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:54,870
three to four minutes so when I started

00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:56,760
out this research everyone warned me

00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:58,649
about Bosch and I started it out

00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,980
thinking that Bosch is a little bit like

00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:03,840
this untamable beast where it takes an

00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:07,680
army of people to really get it working

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:11,130
and I was or Dmitriy to get it working

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,920
so I started it out a little bit scared

00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:16,020
of what I was gonna find but it turned

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,500
out to be okay and some common trends

00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,850
emerged from this research so some

00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,470
common trends around this was that

00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:25,590
people do have a lot of pain around

00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:28,350
deploying and running who vcli upgrading

00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:30,720
it the versions things like that but

00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:33,600
they have worked around it you know

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,189
either by standardizing on on Ruby

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,310
environments using things like RB an

00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:40,770
extra etc the other was around

00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:43,770
installation and upgrades and security

00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:45,540
patches and things like that again here

00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:48,030
it turns out that we've come a long way

00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,369
and with Bosh in it most people are

00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:53,520
pretty happy with the install process of

00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:56,969
it for upgrades and for keeping things

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:59,100
updated we saw a lot of pipelines being

00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:01,860
used and I heard a lot of pipelines

00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:03,990
being talked about today as well so

00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:08,160
definitely you know there are some best

00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:12,150
practices around that using CI pipelines

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,380
to basically automate a lot of stuff the

00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,630
third question we had

00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:18,990
for our customers were around how do you

00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:22,770
store state now this was divided into

00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:24,990
two parts most customers did have you

00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:28,140
know something like github enterprise or

00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:31,290
some other home built tools to really

00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:33,210
store state but even here and we heard

00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:35,250
this a lot I've heard this throughout

00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:37,440
the conference with every everyone's top

00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:40,080
of mind is how do you store secrets and

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,370
how do you get those secrets back into

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,020
your manifest when you want to do

00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:46,380
deployment so that that was a big

00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:47,940
concern to be also so and a common

00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:49,470
question you know a common response to

00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,540
the question was what about secrets was

00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:54,510
we don't know we're still trying to

00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:56,750
figure that out right or I wish that

00:02:54,510 --> 00:03:00,450
Bosh would give me a solution for this

00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:02,400
and finally editing manifests we we saw

00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:04,830
Matz talk on this since there was a

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,690
whole 40 minutes about its I don't want

00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:09,000
to talk about a bit people are still

00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:11,580
doing manual editing of manifests and

00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,530
that's really painful and you know so

00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:16,860
this that that's another thing that that

00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:21,300
we saw as a common problem that people

00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:22,800
see so let's shift gears a little and

00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:25,740
talk about things that we told people

00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,840
and that really made them feel like okay

00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:30,690
the future is gonna be better so one of

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,850
the things around the Ruby CLI was

00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:36,990
moving to a go based CLI would be really

00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:38,900
create for people the other was having

00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:42,810
some form of credential management

00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:45,209
capabilities within Bosch itself again

00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:47,340
Matt spoke about this a little and so

00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:50,510
you know this again it's something that

00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:53,310
would really make a big difference to

00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:57,240
making things easier for people to

00:03:53,310 --> 00:04:00,090
manage their boss so most of our

00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:03,360
conversations were around using cloud

00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:05,130
foundry but Bosch though you know some

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,080
of these some of these conversations

00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:08,640
were also around like manifests for

00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:12,420
cloud foundry itself which is really

00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:16,049
hard to manage so the last part was

00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:18,060
around automation I think we really saw

00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:21,750
that people wanted to automate more and

00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:24,280
more so having more CI pipelines using

00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:27,220
concourse a lot more

00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:32,139
having api's to do a lot of the

00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:34,780
automation against against Boston

00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:38,680
against Cloud Foundry so I'll conclude

00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:40,720
with just you know the ending sort of

00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:43,600
impressions that we had from this

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,490
research so I started out really

00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,460
thinking that Bosch was scary but at the

00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:50,590
end it really seemed that it was quite

00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:53,230
tameable and it was really quite a

00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:57,040
powerful tool that when it was harness

00:04:53,230 --> 00:05:01,480
it could really work well for you very

00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:05,380
much like this racehorse so that's my

00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:10,759
talk thank you for listening

00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:10,759
