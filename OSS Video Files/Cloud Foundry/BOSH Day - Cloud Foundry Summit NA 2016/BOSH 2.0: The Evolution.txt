hello everybody sorry hey my name is

00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:13,309
Alex la mothe I work at L Taurus and

00:00:13,969 --> 00:00:23,939
there's my logo and death log of L

00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:26,939
Taurus and I walk with Bosch for almost

00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:31,619
three years and it was quite a time and

00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:36,930
I had lots of stories about it to tell

00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:39,989
but the timeframe is very short and I

00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:43,950
afraid that we need to move it move this

00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:46,680
discussion to the next next sessions and

00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:49,680
after party I would be happy to talk

00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:52,800
with you about technical implementations

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:57,930
of all features I will mention today but

00:00:52,800 --> 00:01:02,010
it would be impossible to to describe

00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:06,240
them right now and I feel sorry about

00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:09,270
this anyway I also wanted to say thank

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:13,860
you thank you all for stain for

00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:20,210
surviving all this summit and been here

00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:22,229
talking about this perfect tool and and

00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:27,659
also thank you

00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:30,869
all organizers that that give me this

00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:33,659
opportunity to be with you and to make

00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:39,180
talk with you finally I got the slides

00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:42,180
okay so from very very long time ago I

00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:45,119
met Bosch the for the first time and I

00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:47,430
saw its logo that it's not that is not

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:51,030
official logo but still it is on Vicky's

00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:56,969
page and you know you you think I kind

00:01:51,030 --> 00:02:00,000
of kind of you kind of take it as a as

00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:04,320
official and here is it if you don't

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,560
know this is little shell and while I

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:11,009
was not familiar with Bosch I was afraid

00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:13,130
of this logo because because I thought

00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:16,490
that I will find pearl

00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:29,060
inside of this product but still it was

00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:34,220
Ruby and so after I got got acquainted

00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:40,190
with this product I like this the way

00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:42,440
this logo you the way this logger is

00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:45,110
done because you know this is shell and

00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:48,320
it hides something and you never know

00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:51,800
what it is and you know because of the

00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:57,530
speed of how Bosch is developed and

00:02:51,800 --> 00:03:01,550
evolved you you can go to the same court

00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:05,360
in few during two weeks and it will be

00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:06,050
completely rewritten and that makes

00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,290
Bosch

00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:12,110
something like a good book so when you

00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:15,770
open it another time you find something

00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:20,720
interesting there and you will find

00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:26,660
another clever clever thought and you

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:29,330
can learn from it a lot so so for those

00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:32,240
who just starting to walk the Bosch I

00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:36,260
need to say that there there there are

00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:41,300
lots of cute cute things inside of this

00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:44,510
pearl inside of this shell but also

00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:49,510
there are quite dangerous things so this

00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:55,610
was my my feeling when I implemented CPI

00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:59,180
before external CPI mechanism worked was

00:03:55,610 --> 00:04:05,840
implemented so I'm here to talk about

00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:11,209
bosch 2.0 and this version this bus

00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:14,030
around this version made me give me a

00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:18,020
desire gave me desire to wrote bought

00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:20,390
for slack to answer to answer the

00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:24,380
questions about what was Bosch 2.0

00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:25,550
because in Bosch select channel there

00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:28,520
are

00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:31,790
every month such every week such

00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:36,979
questions arrive arrive arrive and I

00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:38,360
first time I hear this term was from

00:04:36,979 --> 00:04:40,490
uncie

00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:44,240
there is a his talk and if you haven't

00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:52,729
seen it you just need to do it right now

00:04:44,240 --> 00:05:00,289
we can skip my session you okay run why

00:04:52,729 --> 00:05:02,800
he so after I healed this term first

00:05:00,289 --> 00:05:08,660
time I was wondering what is behind this

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:11,750
this second this number two here so it

00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:15,650
was a very large question for me and I

00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:19,490
was wondering how how worship how

00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:22,910
versions are created in Bush how is

00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:26,690
there any philosophy behind it and why

00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:29,360
we have why we need to have this second

00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:32,360
version after you know three thousand

00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:37,610
releases of the first one so the current

00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:42,110
version is 1.30 232 and that's you know

00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:45,349
large number so I'm not quite sure that

00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:48,470
they haven't changed science I might be

00:05:45,349 --> 00:05:49,130
sliced yesterday so don't believe me on

00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:52,190
the wall

00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:56,000
don't rely my words still I have my

00:05:52,190 --> 00:06:01,820
personal feeling and I am feeling like I

00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:05,539
have an idea of this version in and to

00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:10,490
my mind it should be ended on a

00:06:05,539 --> 00:06:13,880
one-point 60 180 it's you know it's a

00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:16,330
good good number number that describes

00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:22,250
golden ratio

00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:25,910
so I'm here to tell you that I have

00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:28,160
feeling in my my brain that there are

00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:31,340
there we know there will now be released

00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:37,580
two points all that will release with

00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:42,380
this number okay and so the when you

00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:45,410
look at how Bosh evolves it it makes you

00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:48,610
feel that you look on some kind of

00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:56,960
evolution process here and that's really

00:06:48,610 --> 00:07:02,630
amazing how how it can go go so fast and

00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:06,650
so far and there are several tools and

00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:08,560
approaches and things that I wanted to

00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:12,280
tell you about this evolution process

00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:16,840
first of all this evolution is

00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:21,770
continuous and you you'll never get

00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:24,310
another another release with plenty of

00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:28,250
features in it that are new for you but

00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:31,250
features are added one by one was the

00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:37,700
step by step and you never noticed when

00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:44,720
we will come to to Bosch 2.0 so another

00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:48,410
thing is both notes project so this is a

00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:52,280
project that was created by so called

00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:54,350
cardinal of borscht representative of

00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:59,210
watch team in open source walls as I

00:07:54,350 --> 00:08:03,820
take him and you can find a lot of

00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:08,150
interesting stuff about plans and about

00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:10,450
what should be done there so I'll play

00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:14,330
these slides on my speaker deck and

00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:16,550
you'll be able to get this link and I

00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:19,820
think that it is extremely useful to

00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:22,790
both go through these notes to get idea

00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:25,330
of direction where we go and also you

00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:28,029
can influence these

00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:30,189
these direction by creating pull

00:08:28,029 --> 00:08:30,789
requests to this project or creating

00:08:30,189 --> 00:08:33,969
issuses

00:08:30,789 --> 00:08:36,219
if you have something in mind just just

00:08:33,969 --> 00:08:37,839
issue a great issue in this project and

00:08:36,219 --> 00:08:43,110
it will be reviewed

00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:48,600
so after then the second really great

00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:54,250
driving force of of the progress here is

00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:56,829
concours if you don't know it run from

00:08:54,250 --> 00:09:00,100
my section and try it right now because

00:08:56,829 --> 00:09:02,230
it's it's really amazing thing I can't

00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:06,220
imagine anything that it can it can't do

00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:10,620
so it can post slack messages it can

00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:13,870
write you mail you it can brew coffee

00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:19,360
it's really powerful thing that's why I

00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:22,060
decided to to coordinate with it and ask

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:32,970
it to create me some slides about this

00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:39,189
about this topic so so here is concours

00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:42,579
running on my machine and for the slides

00:09:39,189 --> 00:09:47,410
will be provided from these concours and

00:09:42,579 --> 00:09:50,800
under now I will describe you features

00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:56,380
that are most important personally for

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:58,959
me and it is hard to decouple one it is

00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:00,850
hard to decouple these features and make

00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:04,420
at least groves

00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:07,360
because all of these features influence

00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:12,220
each other and might be the least will

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:18,209
be not so right for somebody so first of

00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:18,209
all I I want to admit that there is

00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:30,670
there is a documentation about update so

00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:34,630
when I started to walked with to walk

00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:37,850
with dogs to walk with wash there were

00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:42,410
no good documentation and

00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:50,680
the one documentation you had was source

00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:56,810
codes and after that lots of lots of

00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:59,990
updates are located in manifest manifest

00:10:56,810 --> 00:11:03,440
is like the soul of all boards

00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:09,260
deployment and lots of new features are

00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:13,850
added to it and there is a list that it

00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:18,230
is incomplete but still the main feature

00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:21,350
for me is here is button aiming so it is

00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:24,350
sometimes it's hard to explain people

00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:28,370
why we have these jobs and so on and

00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:30,080
there are much more clear obstructions

00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:34,450
that people can get something like

00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:39,170
clusters and and so on so at this moment

00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:43,250
work work is in progress and in future

00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:46,130
we will have bad manifests and another

00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:51,710
cool another another great feature here

00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:54,050
is cloud config so you already hear

00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:57,530
about and hear about it many times and

00:11:54,050 --> 00:12:02,060
just repeating that called configs helps

00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:05,300
use to separate your your infrastructure

00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:09,710
into dependencies from Yaman of your

00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:15,070
manifests and and it quite amazing so

00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:19,160
you can have one one file for every

00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:23,060
infrastructure you deploy if you take a

00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:27,340
look on the how concourse is implemented

00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:30,800
and how can course Bosch release is made

00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:34,670
you'll find this out there and it's

00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:39,680
quite amazing and I back on course also

00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:42,650
because it has a lot of really many new

00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:46,360
features from all over from different

00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:51,510
technologies including boss first of all

00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:56,670
then you hear many times here about

00:12:51,510 --> 00:13:01,530
links and this list we walk as relations

00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:08,220
between between jobs deployed with

00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:10,800
releases so this kind of bring us on the

00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:13,740
level of abstraction when will have when

00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:17,010
will be able to point take this job and

00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:22,130
connect with this job and you forget

00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:27,270
about IP messing with IP addresses and

00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:32,150
put in the in them in manifest many

00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:36,300
different updates are here and this will

00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:43,050
this will allow us to this will allow

00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:46,860
what to get rid of of Nessus neccessity

00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:49,050
to use speed for instance for using for

00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:52,920
writing networks for creating IP

00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:58,770
addresses and so on so it's quite a good

00:13:52,920 --> 00:14:02,270
news so this one use is the greatest one

00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:07,940
from my mind because you know sometimes

00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:11,130
sometimes there is the research tortures

00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:14,310
by manifests when you have manifested

00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:17,450
with 5000 with lines and you understand

00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:22,100
that guns don't kill people

00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:22,100
manifests kill people so

00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:34,570
also global networking is here and

00:14:30,029 --> 00:14:36,670
partly it is enrollees with links so

00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:41,770
with global networking you don't need

00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:44,440
you don't need to have IP addresses in

00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:48,640
your jobs both director will take care

00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:54,180
about all of this stuff so you you can

00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:58,709
sit and relax so but to connect to

00:14:54,180 --> 00:15:02,260
releases to jobs you'll need to have

00:14:58,709 --> 00:15:05,170
you'll need to have these liens in these

00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:08,490
releases and they will provide a

00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:12,640
mechanism of how one job will figure out

00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:13,350
about how it can connect to another job

00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:16,420
job

00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:20,230
another thing I wanted to mention is

00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:25,120
compiled releases here that's like a

00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:28,029
great feature and it allow us to reduce

00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:31,089
time of deployment in many times but

00:15:28,029 --> 00:15:36,329
simply not compiling everything in the

00:15:31,089 --> 00:15:41,770
second time and I also liked Bosch IO

00:15:36,329 --> 00:15:44,950
sites with with the list of available

00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:48,010
releases and it kind of the place where

00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:54,520
I should go every time you know you need

00:15:48,010 --> 00:16:02,529
to deploy something new so changes with

00:15:54,520 --> 00:16:04,899
stem cells in stem cell was for in in

00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:09,490
very beginning building stem cells with

00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:12,940
new stem cells was quite a bit hard just

00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:17,620
because it didn't know the whole process

00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:20,800
and now there are stem cell pipelines

00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:26,980
where you can look and figure out how

00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:30,250
these how this works how you even can

00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:34,449
you still need to fork these CIA

00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:36,499
pipelines to be able to update them but

00:16:34,449 --> 00:16:41,209
and you can't create

00:16:36,499 --> 00:16:44,599
your own assets and like like you can do

00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:48,229
with CPI for instance but still it is it

00:16:44,599 --> 00:16:51,619
is a good move forward also the great

00:16:48,229 --> 00:16:56,689
feature here is a possibility of using

00:16:51,619 --> 00:17:02,029
atoms atoms are much the same as

00:16:56,689 --> 00:17:05,899
releases and the one thing is here you

00:17:02,029 --> 00:17:12,350
can not use it in every release you can

00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:14,659
just declare them with stem cell and it

00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:17,240
will appear in every stem cell so if you

00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:21,980
have some agents that should be on every

00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:26,179
virtual machine with with this stem cell

00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:29,960
they will be there there are lots of

00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:33,649
other features I'm excited about when

00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:39,919
Bosch in it appeared it was like like a

00:17:33,649 --> 00:17:42,649
lightning and the happy time began so

00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:47,119
now we have external CPI and it is

00:17:42,649 --> 00:17:49,340
really really easy much more easier to

00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:51,799
create new CPI's and not telling you

00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:58,309
that it is easier because you know you

00:17:51,799 --> 00:18:01,519
need to consider different yeah okay

00:17:58,309 --> 00:18:04,340
they want to go to Troy chances talk

00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:08,450
that's great I really like this stock

00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:12,350
because it has such solid view and

00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:16,279
perspective on where we should go

00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:18,559
and welcome community and butyl should

00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:24,559
appear that's kind of amazing thing

00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:28,909
because such high levels view is not

00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:32,779
always it will it knows it is not always

00:18:28,909 --> 00:18:39,080
pub so public so another cool feature

00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:43,100
that make our security guys happy was

00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:46,210
your UA integration so now Bosch can

00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:49,580
walked we work with all stuff that that

00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:50,299
is provided by UVA so you can connect

00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:55,580
with

00:18:50,299 --> 00:18:58,759
and so and so on also the research thing

00:18:55,580 --> 00:19:05,289
is dynamic provisioning and this is like

00:18:58,759 --> 00:19:05,289
an idea that Bosh will be used as

00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:13,099
service in Congress so both will become

00:19:08,989 --> 00:19:17,149
service and whenever you run great

00:19:13,099 --> 00:19:20,899
service it it will go to Bosh and tell

00:19:17,149 --> 00:19:24,739
it to deploy cluster and you have will

00:19:20,899 --> 00:19:28,129
have lots of clusters separated without

00:19:24,739 --> 00:19:30,229
any interference between them and it

00:19:28,129 --> 00:19:32,229
kind of great stuff because there are

00:19:30,229 --> 00:19:35,929
lots of product that don't have

00:19:32,229 --> 00:19:40,639
multi-tenancy in them and this is kind

00:19:35,929 --> 00:19:44,119
of the one solution for them so I know

00:19:40,639 --> 00:19:48,200
that there is there will be lunch here

00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:52,940
so I will not I will not take your time

00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:55,999
because I guess you're quite starving

00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:59,119
now I'm just from what we had a mistake

00:19:55,999 --> 00:20:01,609
the programming so that this these two

00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:06,979
two two things that should go together

00:20:01,609 --> 00:20:11,959
stakes and programming and I I'm not so

00:20:06,979 --> 00:20:15,559
stirring as you sow so that's it and

00:20:11,959 --> 00:20:16,490
thank you for for this opportunity to

00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:19,759
talk to you

00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:19,759
