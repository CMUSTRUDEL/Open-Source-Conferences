good morning and welcome to Cloud

00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:08,530
Foundry Morning Edition

00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:09,610
I'm starving Peters VP of technical

00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:12,070
evangelism for the Cloud Foundry

00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:14,199
Foundation so I thought a lot of fun the

00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:16,359
this past week a couple of good hacking

00:00:14,199 --> 00:00:19,679
sessions yesterday I spent the whole day

00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:22,599
working with learning the meetup API and

00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:24,009
Python and I managed to make myself

00:00:22,599 --> 00:00:26,679
several scripts that will spit out all

00:00:24,009 --> 00:00:28,449
the meetup Cloud Foundry meetup data in

00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:30,909
the format I want so I'm gonna have to

00:00:28,449 --> 00:00:32,200
read my notes here but I can tell you

00:00:30,909 --> 00:00:36,160
that in the month of October October

00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:38,430
2015 you can go to meetups in London the

00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,900
London ones actually happening right now

00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:42,700
or like in a half hour it starts it's

00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:44,560
not in a pub this time it's about

00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:47,320
securing containers you can also go to

00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:49,000
one in Irving California Minnesota and

00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:51,430
you could skip over to Europe and go to

00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,610
Munich or Sydney there's one here in

00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:56,380
Colorado or Home Depot speaking then you

00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:59,020
go back to Europe and you can go to one

00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:01,030
will actually make a stop at Canada on

00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:02,980
the way go to one in Montreal doesn't go

00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:04,869
to Paris and Dublin then head to

00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:07,479
Southeast Asia go to Manila Vietnam

00:01:04,869 --> 00:01:09,880
Seoul come back to San Francisco Chicago

00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:11,350
Seattle then you know go back to Madrid

00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,969
go to Europe for a little bit and come

00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:16,060
back and finish up your month in Dallas

00:01:12,969 --> 00:01:20,020
so those are all Cloud Foundry meetups

00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:22,390
happening this month and some some of

00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:24,399
the cities like like London and Cisco

00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:27,159
had more than one Meetup so I just told

00:01:24,399 --> 00:01:29,049
you one for each bus so I had a lot of

00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:31,270
fun getting the data out in the format I

00:01:29,049 --> 00:01:33,100
want and I had a lot of fun seeing we're

00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:36,340
all Cloud Foundry zat now each of those

00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:37,719
talks isn't Cloud Foundry like just

00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:39,729
Cloud Foundry related but I think most

00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:40,299
of them were some are like a little more

00:01:39,729 --> 00:01:42,520
paths

00:01:40,299 --> 00:01:45,280
you know the meetups bring and other

00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:47,109
topics all of those meetups and many

00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,450
more are looking for speakers so if

00:01:47,109 --> 00:01:51,389
those places sound fun and you use Cloud

00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:53,799
Foundry or you work on Cloud Foundry

00:01:51,389 --> 00:01:55,240
please reach out to the meetup owner and

00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:58,450
then if you need help with travel funds

00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:01,299
let me know I was originally planning to

00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:03,039
go I thought it would be fun to go to a

00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:05,109
meet-up a month until I'd gone to all of

00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:06,789
them I figure at the current rate of

00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:08,709
meetups it will be more than 10 years

00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:10,929
before I could visit all of them even

00:02:08,709 --> 00:02:12,340
attending one a month but I'm doing

00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:14,640
pretty good I've been to a couple of

00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,640
them already

00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,519
the event front general electric had

00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:21,159
their grouping event

00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:21,879
minds and machines huge event in San

00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:24,099
Francisco

00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:27,040
and they had a massive launch to attract

00:02:24,099 --> 00:02:28,810
eyes v's and system integrators to

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,030
predix which is their Cloud Foundry

00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:32,590
platform Cloud Foundry based platforms

00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:36,519
that's totally awesome to see that

00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:39,489
happening I'm in that industry on event

00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:42,010
still right now in Dublin is Linux con

00:02:39,489 --> 00:02:43,780
cloud open and I believe there was just

00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:45,430
a tweet with someone on stage talking

00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:47,620
about cloud foundry just as I started to

00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:50,889
record this so things happening live

00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:52,599
there right now other exciting news that

00:02:50,889 --> 00:02:55,599
has come out of Europe is Swisscom

00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:57,970
extended its cloud offering with a pass

00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,950
based on cloud foundry so huge news

00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:02,260
there huge community that can use that

00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:06,280
and right after they launch that they

00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:09,400
immediately went to a hackfest - Zurich

00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:11,139
I think where they they were promoting

00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,790
Cloud Foundry and having teams hack on

00:03:11,139 --> 00:03:14,200
it um I believe some of the other cloud

00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:16,239
foundry members were also there like I

00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:18,010
say PE and bluemix so I said people

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,139
living since whisk on and we're all at

00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:21,909
this hackfest letting people build

00:03:20,139 --> 00:03:24,040
awesome things on cloud five new

00:03:21,909 --> 00:03:26,319
platforms so really exciting news there

00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:29,139
especially ramping up to our Cloud

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,579
Foundry summit in Europe in Berlin so if

00:03:29,139 --> 00:03:32,739
you didn't get to go to that hackfest

00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:34,150
you could still sign up for that the

00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:37,599
cloud powder summit in Berlin and join

00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:40,409
us there other news other partners

00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:43,150
promoting it it was kind of fun to see

00:03:40,409 --> 00:03:45,489
Bank of New York Mellon BNY Mellon and

00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:46,389
post an ad I forget now if it was the

00:03:45,489 --> 00:03:47,590
New York Times or The Wall Street

00:03:46,389 --> 00:03:50,139
Journal it's like one of the big New

00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:52,269
York papers and they said they were the

00:03:50,139 --> 00:03:54,489
first investment company to join the

00:03:52,269 --> 00:03:56,590
cloud foundry foundation so since then

00:03:54,489 --> 00:03:59,590
we've started that financial sig we have

00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:01,900
a large number of financial companies in

00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:03,250
the financial industry working with us

00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,590
to make sure that we include their

00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:07,620
requirements in the you know and the

00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:09,879
features that they need in cloud foundry

00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:12,370
so for your in the financial industry I

00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:13,659
want to participate in that please let

00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:15,400
us know we'd be happy to include you

00:04:13,659 --> 00:04:19,150
there next meetup is gonna be in Berlin

00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:21,009
right before the summit I believe so

00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:23,289
that was fun to see good to see people

00:04:21,009 --> 00:04:24,520
bragging about open source software

00:04:23,289 --> 00:04:27,360
that's making the world a better place

00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:29,310
and then we had our dock

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,740
last week I got another whole day of

00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:33,960
hacking during the dock sprint we had

00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:37,740
about 14 people from several different

00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:39,960
companies I'm including HP bluemix a

00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:44,430
blue box I'm sorry HP blue box and

00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:46,650
pivotal as well as some individuals that

00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:49,530
joined us some volunteers and during the

00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:51,650
dock sprint the individual as a board

00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:54,569
member part of his source at Safeway

00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:55,770
at least one of them yeah so lots of

00:04:54,569 --> 00:04:58,800
that's a great people working with us

00:04:55,770 --> 00:05:01,740
and we had four projects that we focused

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,479
on for the day one group created a new

00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,919
landing page for the docs beforehand or

00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:06,509
right now I think it's still just a list

00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:08,430
of all the docs that exist all the

00:05:06,509 --> 00:05:10,800
projects and they worked on the landing

00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:12,930
page just like what does someone come to

00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,340
the docs page for and what are they most

00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:16,590
likely gonna want to do think I want to

00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:19,439
stock Cloud Foundry launch app I'm said

00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:22,500
they worked on that another team worked

00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:24,599
on getting started from scratch so you

00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,909
know how can you get from nothing about

00:05:24,599 --> 00:05:29,099
Cloud Foundry on your laptop to cloud

00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:31,800
foundry installed running an app on it

00:05:29,099 --> 00:05:33,089
and I think 45 minutes was the time that

00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,639
got it down in from like nothing

00:05:33,089 --> 00:05:38,190
installed to up running on it then

00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:40,469
another team looked at you know people

00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:42,180
app developers who come to use Cloud

00:05:40,469 --> 00:05:43,979
Foundry are going to be familiar with

00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:45,150
different languages so can we make the

00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:47,069
first app experience

00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:49,289
I'm easy for them in whatever language

00:05:47,069 --> 00:05:50,669
they're used to so can we have sample

00:05:49,289 --> 00:05:54,000
apps in each of the languages so they

00:05:50,669 --> 00:05:55,830
worked on that and then the fourth group

00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,960
there were in any particular order the

00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:59,729
fourth group worked on what is Cloud

00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:02,279
Foundry and I'm actually working on a

00:05:59,729 --> 00:06:06,419
little video clip to show you how the

00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:08,699
definition got edited over time so I

00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:11,250
will share that on YouTube as well and

00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:13,650
I'll share it in next week's co-founder

00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:15,409
Morning Edition if my video editing

00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:17,969
skills live up to the task

00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:20,310
um I just wanted to point out I'm

00:06:17,969 --> 00:06:22,979
focused on a technical evangelism at

00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:24,509
cloud foundry and I'm and it came up in

00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:25,830
the docs print in it and it comes up

00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:28,379
again and again I just wanted to point

00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:29,909
out that with evangelism we're focusing

00:06:28,379 --> 00:06:32,009
on users so we think it's really

00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:34,589
important to make sure that more people

00:06:32,009 --> 00:06:36,120
can use Cloud Foundry because we have a

00:06:34,589 --> 00:06:37,349
really active strong base of

00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,969
contributors especially with all our

00:06:37,349 --> 00:06:42,879
member companies so we are focused on

00:06:39,969 --> 00:06:45,369
user friends for now and this came up

00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:46,929
during we had a meet-up in San Francisco

00:06:45,369 --> 00:06:49,029
at the Cloud Foundry Foundation offices

00:06:46,929 --> 00:06:51,729
after the docs print and one of the

00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:54,309
speakers talked about community and we

00:06:51,729 --> 00:06:58,179
talked about is it more important to

00:06:54,309 --> 00:07:00,489
have users versus contributors company

00:06:58,179 --> 00:07:03,159
employees versus individuals who are

00:07:00,489 --> 00:07:05,669
volunteers and our community of

00:07:03,159 --> 00:07:08,559
contributors is very much at the moment

00:07:05,669 --> 00:07:10,869
the majority of them are employees at

00:07:08,559 --> 00:07:12,429
companies but I think one of the the

00:07:10,869 --> 00:07:13,899
strengths that brings is that we're

00:07:12,429 --> 00:07:15,849
growing our community that way and

00:07:13,899 --> 00:07:18,159
companies are investing in these people

00:07:15,849 --> 00:07:19,749
and then these people can move around in

00:07:18,159 --> 00:07:21,549
the ecosystem and that makes a better

00:07:19,749 --> 00:07:23,049
environment for companies to be able to

00:07:21,549 --> 00:07:24,729
find good people to hire it's better for

00:07:23,049 --> 00:07:26,559
the people to have that in a career I

00:07:24,729 --> 00:07:28,809
think that's a great thing but from an

00:07:26,559 --> 00:07:33,519
evangelism perspective we're focused on

00:07:28,809 --> 00:07:35,439
getting users and as a way to do that or

00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:38,589
focus on lattice i'm so we're focused on

00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:41,349
making sure people down can download and

00:07:38,589 --> 00:07:43,179
use lattice effectively because when

00:07:41,349 --> 00:07:44,919
people try out Cloud Foundry as we found

00:07:43,179 --> 00:07:46,629
out at the docs print on cloud foundry

00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:48,879
is pretty massive if you're using a

00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:50,679
little you know a little laptop that

00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,659
might have as much memory as a server in

00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:55,089
your and your work environment and

00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:56,619
lattices built to bring you to show you

00:07:55,089 --> 00:07:59,589
what cloud foundry is to bring you some

00:07:56,619 --> 00:08:01,149
of that power to your to your laptop and

00:07:59,589 --> 00:08:03,759
there was even an article this past week

00:08:01,149 --> 00:08:07,689
about best tools for web developers and

00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:11,829
Ladas is one of the ones listed so focus

00:08:07,689 --> 00:08:13,179
on users focus on lattice other news of

00:08:11,829 --> 00:08:15,129
the Martian the movie the Martian

00:08:13,179 --> 00:08:16,959
released this week and you're asking why

00:08:15,129 --> 00:08:19,419
is that about Cloud Foundry the Martian

00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:22,299
was not filmed or written on Cloud

00:08:19,419 --> 00:08:24,189
Foundry platform as far as I know but

00:08:22,299 --> 00:08:27,429
Andy weir who's the author of the book

00:08:24,189 --> 00:08:29,499
the Martian gave he's a friend of the

00:08:27,429 --> 00:08:32,769
same remedies and he gave a keynote at

00:08:29,499 --> 00:08:34,809
the Cloud Foundry summit last May and

00:08:32,769 --> 00:08:36,849
it's a really awesome keynote because he

00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:39,370
explains well he explains how you wrote

00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:40,839
this book and then he's plays I read

00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:44,439
this book with open source methods so he

00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:47,079
wrote this book and it didn't sell and

00:08:44,439 --> 00:08:49,929
so then he and he and he had written it

00:08:47,079 --> 00:08:51,459
over over years or months I don't

00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:52,660
remember the timeframe with a lot of

00:08:51,459 --> 00:08:53,680
help from people like every time he

00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:55,119
needed help with

00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,680
put it out there and you put up the

00:08:55,119 --> 00:08:59,079
books and peace you know bits and pieces

00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:00,999
and so he kind of felt like it was a

00:08:59,079 --> 00:09:03,399
community effort I'm so at one point he

00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:05,230
tried to give the book away and people

00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:06,249
wouldn't take it in that format so he

00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:08,100
ended up having to sell it through

00:09:06,249 --> 00:09:10,329
Amazon and I mean I end up getting a

00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:12,970
publisher but it's a really awesome

00:09:10,329 --> 00:09:15,579
story about how he developed this book

00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:18,249
very much in collaboration with other

00:09:15,579 --> 00:09:20,170
people in the community and how that led

00:09:18,249 --> 00:09:22,720
to the finished product and and he's

00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:24,610
very humble and just kind of comes

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,379
across very genuinely I'm in the keynote

00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:28,809
so if you go to youtube you just search

00:09:26,379 --> 00:09:31,629
YouTube clapping foundry and do where

00:09:28,809 --> 00:09:34,420
you can watch that that video from from

00:09:31,629 --> 00:09:35,800
when he was speaking about that um I'm

00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:38,589
not so happy news I was really

00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:40,209
disappointed yesterday to read a post by

00:09:38,589 --> 00:09:42,369
Sarah sharp who's a Linux kernel

00:09:40,209 --> 00:09:43,809
engineer saying that she has left the

00:09:42,369 --> 00:09:45,249
Linux kernel community she hasn't left

00:09:43,809 --> 00:09:48,490
open sorry she's still doing awesome

00:09:45,249 --> 00:09:50,850
stuff without Ricci in sort of a more

00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:53,860
user level open-source software projects

00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:55,990
and a huge thank you to her for all of

00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:57,999
her her Linux kernel contributions and

00:09:55,990 --> 00:10:00,160
for all of the the contributions she's

00:09:57,999 --> 00:10:01,990
currently making but it was it was sad

00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,149
to me to see that she gave the reason

00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:07,899
for her leaving was the Linux kernel

00:10:04,149 --> 00:10:09,790
community culture and I think we all

00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:11,740
need to continue to do as much as we can

00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:15,550
to make sure our communities are as

00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:17,139
diverse as possible because we're

00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:19,149
leaving like half of the potential

00:10:17,139 --> 00:10:20,980
developers out there like the Linux

00:10:19,149 --> 00:10:23,829
kernel doesn't have very many women in

00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:26,079
it and so women are half the population

00:10:23,829 --> 00:10:28,149
if they had women in the Linux kernel

00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:30,189
community they could have twice as many

00:10:28,149 --> 00:10:31,600
people and then those maintainer I could

00:10:30,189 --> 00:10:32,679
have twice as many maintainer x' and

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,209
then they wouldn't be so stressed out

00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:38,439
and they went out they wouldn't feel

00:10:34,209 --> 00:10:39,999
like they had to act like that so thanks

00:10:38,439 --> 00:10:42,279
to Sarah for our contributions thanks

00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:44,079
for speaking up if you are in any

00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:46,929
open-source software community or any

00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:49,179
technical community and you see people

00:10:46,929 --> 00:10:50,949
email getting short-tempered or speaking

00:10:49,179 --> 00:10:52,660
inappropriately or making jokes that

00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:55,029
aren't welcoming of everyone you know

00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:56,860
please speak up we're trying really hard

00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:59,139
at Cloud Foundry foundation and I don't

00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:01,480
know if I've ever mentioned at the Cloud

00:10:59,139 --> 00:11:03,519
Foundry foundation we have a really

00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,350
respectful environment and we don't

00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,100
interrupt each other and it's the first

00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:08,380
time in might

00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:10,600
20 year career I have been at a place

00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:12,010
where you don't interrupt people and

00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,920
have to say I feel like I'm the most

00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:17,430
guilty of it the most often but it's

00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:19,870
it's really it's it it really is a

00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:22,180
awesome way to work when you get to say

00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:23,590
your idea and everybody who listens

00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:25,210
right attentively and then when you're

00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:27,520
done someone else speaks and you listen

00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:30,520
to them like it creates such a such a

00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:32,650
team a really strong team in a very

00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:34,090
short time because of that culture of

00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:36,670
respect and they're not interrupting is

00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:38,770
it's one piece of that I also have to

00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:39,940
say that Hana and and we owe and we're

00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:41,340
also working really hard to make sure

00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:45,010
like the speakers at the Cloud Foundry

00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:48,850
summits are diverse you know as diverse

00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:51,460
as we can make them and we have

00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:53,230
diversity meet they're not meetups but

00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:55,750
there's the events at the club boundary

00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:58,390
summit for example in the Santa Clara

00:11:55,750 --> 00:12:00,280
one we had Robin Reynolds come she made

00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:02,350
a documentary about women in tech after

00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:04,540
a conversation she had of their daughter

00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:07,270
and it's been released we got an early

00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:09,700
preview of it at the summit but you can

00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:11,440
watch that as well then my funny thing

00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:13,240
I'm not funny I mean it's sad but it's

00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,120
funny I really loved the way Sarah

00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:17,860
sharps moderator is handy handling nasty

00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,690
comments so she said she was gonna do

00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:21,940
this and they're doing this I'm whoever

00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:23,380
the moderator is whenever anyone posts a

00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,730
nasty comment or some inappropriate

00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:26,800
comment I don't know what they are I

00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:28,690
haven't seen them they leave the person

00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,270
and their comments and they just replace

00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:33,820
the text with fart fart fart it's I I

00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:36,880
think it's awesome I'm gonna try that

00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:39,340
for my blog post from now on um so so

00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,710
please I hope all the communities you're

00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:43,390
in be welcoming and diverse because it

00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:46,480
will make us all stronger not just a

00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:49,570
numbers of people but just a diversity

00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:52,900
of ideas I'm wanted to remind you Cloud

00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:55,510
Foundry summits in Berlin and Shanghai

00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:57,550
are coming up you can register now

00:12:55,510 --> 00:13:00,070
I got an ad from United saying there's

00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:01,720
$250 tickets to Berlin I couldn't manage

00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:03,070
to look at those if you do you have

00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,170
better travel skills than I do and I'd

00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:07,390
love to hear from you but I do know it's

00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:11,200
very cheap to buy Asia and I do know

00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:12,660
that the Berlin agenda is really awesome

00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,190
very strong

00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:17,100
and we're working on the Asian one right

00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:19,560
now on the topic of cloud foundry summit

00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:21,180
Asia we're still looking for sponsors

00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:23,250
for the China event and I just kind of

00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:25,260
wanted to put a plug in and why China is

00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:26,940
so important so we actually surveyed a

00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:29,700
whole bunch of people to get data and

00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:32,630
China came up as a place where we should

00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:35,460
be in it it's because right now in China

00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:37,260
if you ask people there they're talking

00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:38,910
about innovating faster over business

00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:41,700
differentiators which is totally the

00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:43,380
continuous innovation model they're

00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:45,060
talking about building DevOps cultures

00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:48,150
right now they're talking about cloud

00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:49,800
native apps and they're really leaping

00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:52,560
to the platform so they're really moving

00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:55,500
from building apps on internet as a

00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:57,450
service infrastructure to platform as a

00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:59,190
service infrastructure so now is really

00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:02,040
the time if you are a cloud foundry

00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:04,710
business to be to be looking at China

00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,910
and the summit is is a great way to get

00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:08,250
in front of a whole bunch of people

00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:10,560
interested in it all at once so if you

00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:12,240
haven't registered for pod foundry

00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:15,600
summit related or cloud foundry summit

00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:18,240
Asia Shanghai you can do that right now

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,770
we'd love to see you there and if you

00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,870
are companies in cloud foundry and want

00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:24,120
to sponsor the the China summit we are

00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:26,340
looking for sponsors and so have a great

00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:29,670
week look for my little vignette on what

00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:31,910
is cloud foundry and I will see you next

00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,910
