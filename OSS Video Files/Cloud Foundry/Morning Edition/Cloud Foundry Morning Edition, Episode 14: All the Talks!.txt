welcome to the Cloud Foundry Morning

00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:05,910
Edition episode 14

00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:09,090
I'm storm repeaters VP of technical

00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:10,410
evangelism good morning and welcome to

00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:14,400
the Cloud Foundry Morning Edition

00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:17,090
episode 14 so a lots been going on just

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,050
this first month of the year in January

00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:20,550
we have signed up a couple of new

00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,050
members of the Cloud Foundry foundation

00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,689
I can't tell you who they are because

00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:27,150
the press releases are about to go out

00:00:23,689 --> 00:00:29,730
but stay tuned to welcome them and we

00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:32,700
opened a new dojo already so January 20

00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:34,350
seconds we opened it dojo at the EMC

00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,360
Cambridge offices and there was a

00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:39,239
meet-up and people talking in food and

00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,700
drinks and IBM's dojo and rally is

00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:44,399
coming soon to give you an idea of

00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,890
things that happen at dojos I'm so like

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,770
for example at one of the dojos s ap is

00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,969
leading the Bosch CPI for OpenStack and

00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:52,920
and they did that after they

00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:55,530
participated in at Cloud Foundry dojo

00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:59,239
for the full six-week training period so

00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:02,520
people get to that level of commitment

00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:05,729
also the news we've had we had a at a

00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:08,700
blog article about dorm acaba one of the

00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:10,290
Swisscom customers there a leading

00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,090
provider of security and access

00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:15,330
solutions and they have chosen Cloud

00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,430
Foundry I gave a talk at scale last week

00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:18,869
which was fun as a very beginner talk

00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,490
and I had a very beginner audience

00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:22,799
although I have three people in the

00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:25,650
audience who turned out to be cloud

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:29,130
foundry users and developers who did not

00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:31,490
fess up until it was all over but they

00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:34,650
helped me answer questions so all's get

00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:36,840
at the I missed the Denver meet up and

00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:39,390
all the other meetups around the world

00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,979
the demmer meetup had like 75 people at

00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:43,470
an intro to cloud foundry so it was kind

00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:46,320
of an intro month whose January and I

00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:48,720
realize I forgot to show you guys and

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,000
gals I'm one of the dummer meetups I

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,840
picked up this handout from ECS and

00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,640
where they have a whole bunch of

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:58,110
resources in terms for Cloud Foundry and

00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:00,000
somewhere on here that even mentioned

00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:01,530
the Cloud Foundry mornings it's kind of

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,009
cool

00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:06,360
let's see what else has been going on um

00:02:04,009 --> 00:02:09,539
we launched certification certification

00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,670
of the code in December and we're still

00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:12,380
getting lots of really

00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:14,150
some articles from that so there's one

00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:18,260
for information we there was one in

00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:20,630
Linux comm I put links to them in the in

00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:22,760
the body of this article but I really

00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:25,340
like Sam Ramsey's quote on the

00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:27,980
InformationWeek article he ends by

00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:30,410
saying my senses over the next couple

00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:32,510
years if this rate of adoption continues

00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:34,310
instead of saying paths you'll just say

00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:36,440
Cloud Foundry which is really awesome I

00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:40,190
hope that is true and we're headed that

00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:40,760
way um speaking of articles that have

00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:43,550
come out

00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:45,290
Duncan win from pivotal had a book come

00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:47,270
out it's a cloud foundry the cloud

00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:50,450
native platform and it's a free download

00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:53,450
and a good read um he also gave keynote

00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:55,070
at kotzebue summit in Shanghai and which

00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:56,900
were recording separately to share with

00:02:55,070 --> 00:03:00,290
you all I'm so you can get a preview of

00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:02,180
what he says that in his book then we

00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:04,850
had the cab call earlier this week that

00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:07,370
Cloud Foundry advisory board or last

00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:09,680
week and some things that came out of

00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:11,330
that was things like um just reminding

00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,430
everyone that Diego is like officially

00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:16,010
part of Cloud Foundry now and you should

00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:18,680
migrate DEA to Diego and they had some

00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:22,790
pointers if he needs help on that stuck

00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:25,070
and Wayne wrote needs called sheet but

00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:26,600
as far as far applicable data system so

00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:28,220
they had like a whole bunch of pluggable

00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:32,230
data systems that you can use through

00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:35,150
this tool I'm including s3 blob stores

00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:37,519
not from the cab but from like this week

00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:41,420
in Cloud Foundry and they pointed at a

00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:44,600
plug-in written by Josh crook that lets

00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:46,100
you download the current droplet for an

00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,570
app to your local file system for

00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,610
troubleshooting so know typically your

00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:52,010
droplets your containers and would run

00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:53,239
all in the cloud foundry instance but if

00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:54,650
you're trying to troubleshoot it and you

00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:57,910
want to download it just like it runs

00:03:54,650 --> 00:04:00,769
this plugin will help you do that and

00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:02,930
there's also a pointer to a webinar on

00:04:00,769 --> 00:04:05,510
lessons learned from GE software

00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:07,190
Allstate Philips and Mercedes and

00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:13,100
evaluating five founders that would be

00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:15,769
useful to people too and then in in the

00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:18,560
the advisory board meeting Ted young

00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:21,140
talked about adding a value volume

00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,490
manager interface I'm in Diego cells so

00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:24,240
that you could mount external devices

00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:25,590
inside containers

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,400
they plan to support multiple device

00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:30,630
managers simultaneously so as always

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,120
when these things are in proposal mode

00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:36,590
that's the time to chime in give your

00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,910
input to get any data that you have and

00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:41,220
then I wanted to talk about upcoming

00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:42,750
talks that are coming up beside I've

00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:44,849
actually created a two mailing lists

00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:46,560
which you're all welcome to join I'm one

00:04:44,849 --> 00:04:48,210
of the cf speakers if you go to Cloud

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,180
Foundry mailing lists one is called CF -

00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:53,099
speakers and that's for people that want

00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:54,960
to give talks to have given talks on

00:04:53,099 --> 00:04:57,960
Cloud Foundry and for people looking for

00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:00,919
those people to give talks so for

00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:03,990
example on that list just recently

00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:05,639
someone from cloudscape 2016 an event

00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:08,340
that's gonna be held in March March 8th

00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:10,020
the 9th in Brussels and was looking for

00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,699
a speaker and so they posted there that

00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:13,620
mailing list so if you are a speaker

00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:16,500
looking for speaking opportunities or

00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:18,330
need a speaker the speakers list is a

00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:21,360
great place to go and then there's also

00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:23,940
a CF meetup organisers list from meetup

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:27,590
organizers to share best practices and

00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:30,419
get to know each other but back to talks

00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:32,520
February 5th dr. max is giving an abacus

00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:37,139
talk at pivotal and it's open to the

00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:39,960
public and this Wednesday evening um the

00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:42,300
evening this Wednesday in London there's

00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:45,479
events called co-ed code which is to

00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:47,490
help get more women involved and

00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:48,630
participating in systems programming and

00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:50,599
systems infrastructure

00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:52,919
um so if you are interested in helping

00:05:50,599 --> 00:05:54,479
get more women involved in our space

00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:56,460
that would be a great meet-up to go to

00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:59,099
if it's successful they're also looking

00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:01,050
for people to hold these meetups around

00:05:59,099 --> 00:06:02,789
the world in different places because

00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:06,210
the number of women in systems

00:06:02,789 --> 00:06:09,180
programming is is even less than other

00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:11,430
types of programming then Thursday is

00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,900
the very first New Jersey meetup to be

00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:15,000
held at the Honeywell offices they're

00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,560
pretty stoked about that about now to go

00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,169
into New York for their meetup the

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:23,310
Hobbit in New Jersey and then February

00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:26,070
11th the London meetup is happening and

00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:28,169
they invited a bunch of the the speakers

00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:29,820
from the different summits in Europe and

00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:31,979
Asia and they're gonna be recording that

00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:33,900
so if you can go I think it'll be a lot

00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:36,870
of fun and if you can't make it they'll

00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:38,010
be recorded and then there is a whole

00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:39,870
bunch of call for papers

00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:41,340
and we would love to see more people

00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:43,230
talking about Cloud Foundry at more

00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:45,180
conferences so I encourage you all the

00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:46,710
go submit of paper and even if one of

00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,480
them gets accepted then you will help

00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:52,200
spread the word of cloud foundry the

00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:53,910
