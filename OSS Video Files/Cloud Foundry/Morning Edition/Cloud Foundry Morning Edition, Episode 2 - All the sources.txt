good morning I'm stormy Peters VP of

00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,500
technical evangelism for the Cloud

00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,179
Foundry foundation welcome to the second

00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,829
episode of the Cloud Foundry morning

00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:13,619
edition I'd like to start out by

00:00:10,829 --> 00:00:16,260
thanking all of my sources so I listened

00:00:13,619 --> 00:00:18,210
to Cloud Foundry after dark I read the

00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,010
Cloud Foundry Advisory Board minutes

00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:23,010
that are put out by feel Phil Whelan

00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:24,600
from active state and I also read this

00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,830
week in cloud foundry which is

00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,240
maintained by a group of people that are

00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:28,950
always looking for help so if you'd like

00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,960
to contribute to cloud foundry that's

00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:33,089
one way as well as I read a lot of

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,070
tweets and blogs from around industry so

00:00:33,089 --> 00:00:37,409
thanks to everyone for helping make this

00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,969
happen this is the five to ten minute

00:00:37,409 --> 00:00:41,219
summary maybe fifteen but I'll try to

00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:42,539
keep it to five or ten summary of what's

00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:45,390
happened in the past week in Cloud

00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:47,729
Foundry um so the big news that like got

00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:50,850
launched by companies is a couple pieces

00:00:47,729 --> 00:00:52,800
I'm so VMware launched photon platform

00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,719
which is a way to manage all of the

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,999
virtual machines and containers with

00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,920
pivotal Cloud Foundry on top of it so

00:00:56,999 --> 00:01:01,859
it's everything you would need in a

00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,890
stack for a cloud native application and

00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:07,110
kind of the idea is that a company could

00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:07,530
go from idea to production in less than

00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:08,820
a day

00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:12,420
so everything you need for a cloud

00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:14,070
native stack and application altos and

00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,210
IBM also announced that they didn't they

00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:17,160
wouldn't announce but they've been

00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:19,680
working on experimenting on getting quad

00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,810
foundry on IBM's power8 architecture and

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,000
they have been successful and they're

00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:26,160
checking that in upstream so those are

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,660
kind of two official news updates that

00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,940
went out and press cycles but lots of

00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:32,100
other things have been happening I

00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:34,620
personally got to go to a my first Cod

00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,510
foundry meetup I'm down in Denver it was

00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:38,820
a really good group of people I'm there

00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:40,770
probably 70 people showed up and I think

00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,360
at least half of them if not all of them

00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:43,890
came up and introduced themselves before

00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:47,130
we got started which was really fun I

00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:48,690
felt very welcomed and everyone

00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:50,490
participated you know listened very

00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:53,190
attentively um I gave an update on the

00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:56,760
Cloud Foundry foundation and after that

00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:58,140
it was followed by a spring demo um very

00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,700
technical a lot of good questions in

00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:03,270
that one too so that was great to see

00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:05,760
I'm on oh and I got some swag so I got a

00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:07,740
USB Drive that says Cloud Foundry on it

00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:09,360
with a little logo and some of you are

00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,400
more observant might have noticed the

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,600
Thersites making a new logo or new thing

00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,530
coming if you saw on the splash screen

00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,910
so

00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,790
watch out for the little ninja rabbit

00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:20,100
who might be coming but speaking of

00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:23,010
meetups and not logos we also announced

00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:24,870
it this week meetup plan to offer our

00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:27,240
sponsorships for speakers who want to go

00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,440
to meetups as I said last week that

00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,120
that's been one of the biggest problems

00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,440
for meetups is getting good speakers and

00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,209
so that plan is all launched we have a

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,530
bunch of speakers signed up and I've

00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:36,540
been to meetup owners joining the meetup

00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:39,420
list so please jump in if you're

00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:42,450
interested in that I'm speaking of new

00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:44,130
programs and new people Bridgette was on

00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:45,660
Cloud Foundry after dark she started

00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:48,870
last week so she's had her whole first

00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:50,340
week and they put her in the cloud ops

00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:52,440
team so embedded her in the cloud

00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,430
operations team for the first week so

00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,540
that she could learn how to use the

00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:56,310
technology which I thought was an

00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:58,980
awesome intro like can I go sign up for

00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:01,140
that team and she said the most

00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:02,880
surprising thing to her was pairing

00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:05,280
especially pairing in the operation

00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:07,320
space but she said it worked really well

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,720
for asking questions I'm learning but

00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,920
one of her observations made me think

00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,480
about how we do things in the project

00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,190
and maybe think about how we could do

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,900
things differently and she said when

00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:18,750
you're pairing you have very little time

00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,430
to spend on slack or email so the

00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:22,620
conversations you have with people

00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:24,299
outside your pair are necessarily

00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,860
limited not because you're trying to

00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:27,120
ignore them or you don't love them but

00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,890
because you're actively working with

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,690
someone sitting next to you so that's

00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:32,160
kind of a different twist on the any

00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:33,360
conversation you have in the room make

00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,100
sure you put on the mailing list like

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,750
this is how are you gonna capture a

00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,320
whole day's worth of conversations it's

00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,120
interesting

00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:41,519
I'm also on cloud foundry after dark

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,100
Kelsey Hightower showed up and he had

00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,380
some great points as always um to the

00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:47,700
points he had well one is he said you

00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:49,410
know obviously it's important for Cloud

00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,280
Foundry to be open-source software and

00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:52,410
that's how we're gonna win in the

00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,850
ecosystem so if you'd like him to hear

00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:56,190
him explain that you can go watch that

00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:58,350
and then he also made a point for

00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:00,780
wanting the Cloud Foundry components I'm

00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:02,760
to be branded and marketed individually

00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,780
for a number of reasons and I also

00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,700
thought it was interesting Matt curry

00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:08,010
jumped in from Allstate jumped in and

00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:09,930
said people want to ask and understand

00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:11,670
even if it doesn't matter and that kind

00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:13,170
of goes on like hi founders atoms or

00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:14,430
software project people download it and

00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:16,590
play it before they use it so there's

00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:18,060
really been a theme here unless I think

00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:19,440
there's something there so if you want

00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:22,049
to hear that conversation you can go to

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,310
Cloud Foundry after dark I'm also pod

00:04:22,049 --> 00:04:25,740
founder if de dark speaking of Matt

00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:26,200
curry from Allstate he he said there's

00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,760
two people

00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,700
while state working on in class founders

00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:32,770
who wanna build packs and when I'm Bosch

00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:35,020
speaking of Bosch Dimitri was on after

00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:38,440
dark and he was introduced as the Bosch

00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:40,090
guy and so he also gave an update in the

00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,100
Cloud Foundry advisory board meeting on

00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:43,600
the technology I'm so you talked about

00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:45,970
some of the things that they're adding

00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,670
like they're simplify it simplifying a

00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:51,310
lot of the manifest UI making it simpler

00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:54,310
to configure adding things like stem

00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:56,020
cell hardening trusted certificates and

00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:58,350
there was a question in that meeting

00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:00,490
from dr. Nick who's wondering when

00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:02,830
passionate will support compiled

00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:04,150
packages and Dmitry said the support is

00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:05,920
going to Bosch right now that they'll be

00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:07,300
able to support that in the future so if

00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:11,110
you're interested or want to push for

00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:13,930
that you know who to talk to now other

00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:16,540
updates from the advisory board meeting

00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:18,270
as Eric's mom talked about Diego

00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:20,620
um he talked about how they're doing

00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:22,630
large-scale testing performance testing

00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:25,000
and he has to talked about how they're

00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:27,190
introducing a database service in front

00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,470
of their Etsy database and that's gonna

00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:31,030
enable them to like move to protocol

00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:33,820
buffers which would be higher

00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:35,230
performance you know so talked about how

00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:37,180
they're gonna they're continuing to work

00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:39,760
on supporting docker containers and

00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:41,410
things like that other big news you

00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:44,170
probably lattice now has built PAC

00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:45,580
support but to think was the last week

00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:47,320
but it was announced in that advisory

00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:49,480
board meeting which is monthly on this

00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:52,330
past week and all the other teams like

00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:55,210
mega cap de CLI also gave updates I

00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:57,040
found out that Megas the doesn't really

00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:59,170
stand for anything it's that it's that

00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,850
was s release integration team and maybe

00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:04,560
there was just the name that they used

00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:07,390
and and then both in the advisory board

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,430
meeting as well as especially this week

00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:11,530
in Cloud Foundry and there's a lot of

00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:13,870
really useful tidbits so if you were

00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:15,910
working with Cloud Foundry and need

00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:17,440
tools or just want to learn best

00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:19,660
practices I think this week in class

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,900
foundry is an awesome place to follow

00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:24,670
it's it's a blog post you can read it so

00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:27,450
for example this week they they give an

00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:30,220
example of managing interdependencies of

00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:32,530
foundry release jobs and how room and

00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:34,810
cost are from stockton wayne which is

00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:36,580
where dr. nick works sir found it

00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:37,930
wrote a handy script that you know takes

00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:39,770
all of the dependencies and makes a

00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:41,300
nicely formatted table out of them

00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:44,569
so there was a whole bunch more tips

00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:46,580
like that in the this week in Cloud

00:06:44,569 --> 00:06:48,250
Foundry so I recommend that if you're

00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:51,169
trying to get better at a Cloud Foundry

00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:52,789
um another kind of tidbit on how things

00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:54,650
were run this one came from the advisory

00:06:52,789 --> 00:06:58,130
board meeting I think is you know there

00:06:54,650 --> 00:07:00,470
was a crest form Cornelia I believe to

00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:02,300
add so when you're reading a mailing

00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:04,310
list thread you often want to forward

00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:06,139
that thread to someone and it's kind of

00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:08,300
ugly I've done this a lot to forward the

00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:10,099
thread itself and Gmail there was like a

00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:12,050
four word entire thread and then they

00:07:10,099 --> 00:07:14,690
get this huge thing that's not not

00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:16,460
actually really threaded so she asked

00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:18,740
for a link at the bottom of the thread

00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:22,460
that would go to the online archive and

00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:24,169
they're looking at adding that in cloud

00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:26,599
foundry after dark they talked about a

00:07:24,169 --> 00:07:29,569
couple of interesting users slash

00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:31,580
customers for example Jason Jackson's

00:07:29,569 --> 00:07:34,940
working with a group in Japan that has

00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:36,740
50,000 VMs I'm an openstack installation

00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:37,759
and they're using Cloud Foundry now so

00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:39,830
it has to be one of the largest

00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,449
OpenStack installations in the world um

00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:43,159
so just kind of interesting to hear

00:07:41,449 --> 00:07:45,349
about that and they also talked about

00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:46,699
who how I do runs Cloud Foundry and

00:07:45,349 --> 00:07:48,590
bare-metal which is something I know

00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:50,599
many people are interested in it came up

00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:52,699
in the financial sig in New York as well

00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:54,860
