	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
good morning this is stormy Peters VP of

00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:06,029
technical evangelism at the Cloud

00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:09,990
Foundry Foundation bringing you the

00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:11,880
Cloud Foundry morning edition good

00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:14,009
morning and welcome to Cloud Foundry

00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,630
morning edition so I was listening to

00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:18,180
Cloud Foundry after dark this morning

00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,920
and I realized that everyone might not

00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,449
have an hour and a half to catch up I

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,910
mean it's a great time to go meet the

00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:25,949
community talk to people but if you just

00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:27,420
want the Cliff Notes version that's what

00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:28,980
the Cloud Foundry Morning Edition it's

00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,840
gonna be gonna be about ten minute

00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,059
update summarize what they talked about

00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,500
as well as some other happenings and you

00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:36,480
can always follow up with any of the

00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,390
things that sound interesting to you

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:42,540
so last week Cloud Foundry was at Linux

00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:44,280
con open cloud container con and in

00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,230
Seattle Washington and we had a great

00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,640
booth it was fun for me because we had a

00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:49,230
lot of great people working in the booth

00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,820
had a lot of really good conversations

00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:52,980
and we had help from our member

00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:56,010
companies from century CenturyLink

00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:57,629
pivotal blue box cloud and we got

00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:58,949
questions we got questions all over the

00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:00,809
map we got a lot of questions that were

00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:02,489
like what is it and those people mostly

00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:04,140
wanted a t-shirt but they even learned a

00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:05,850
little bit about pod Factory in the

00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,680
process but then we also got some really

00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:08,970
great questions from people like big

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,280
companies that were thinking about using

00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:13,320
laundry and it obviously played around

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,880
with it and had some really specific

00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,110
questions about how it was working or

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,659
how they could use it differently and

00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:20,549
then to my excitement even got questions

00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:21,420
like can I help with the docs print so

00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:24,479
if you'd like to help with the docs

00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:26,520
print media we also had some really good

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,360
speakers and we had a couple of keynotes

00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,000
about cloud foundry

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,950
I'm Sam Ramsay the CEO of cloud foundry

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,390
foundation gave a keynote and he

00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:35,689
continued along his line of thinking

00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:37,680
from the Auslan keynote so more about

00:01:35,689 --> 00:01:39,270
prescriptive versus putting it all

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,220
together yourself and what that means in

00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:43,770
the space and how foundations play in it

00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:46,380
then Duncan Johnston a lot from cloud

00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,430
soft also gave a keynote another day and

00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,350
then a number of our member companies

00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:50,759
gave keynotes on different aspects

00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:54,210
different technical aspects of cloud

00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:56,700
foundry David person from nebari

00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:58,200
Software gave a talk and I really like

00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,060
to talk because it was pretty much like

00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,040
when can I get back to coding and he

00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:05,250
talked about how adopting cloud foundry

00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:07,079
had enabled his organization to move

00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,970
from like maintaining the infrastructure

00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:10,739
and from him wearing you know having to

00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:12,300
respond that you know 3m and figure out

00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:13,020
why things weren't working to an

00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,880
environment where all

00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,860
his developers could focus on code again

00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:20,010
and he talked about that transition to

00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:22,470
12 factor apps and micro services it was

00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:23,880
just tough fun and Chris Stirling from

00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:25,380
CenturyLink you have a couple of talks

00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,420
and he talked about configuration

00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:30,570
management and then he talked about on

00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:33,960
the lean method and using the Lean

00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:35,700
Startup method on cloud foundry on in in

00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:38,190
on platform as a service in general and

00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:40,680
then a couple talks from pivotal folks

00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:43,710
I'm so Ramirez solace spoke about cloud

00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,870
foundry and OpenStack which is only a

00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:47,970
hot topic but highly requested topic

00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:50,910
these days and then David's soul from

00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:52,410
pivotal also talked about containers and

00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:54,210
how containers work in cloud foundry

00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:55,980
there were a lot of talks on containers

00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:57,750
it was interesting to to see how cloud

00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:00,570
foundry manages those and how we

00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:02,580
approach that um so that that's why we

00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:05,880
were doing up in Seattle um you'll next

00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:07,200
see us in Berlin so November beginning

00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:09,750
in November we'll be at the Berlin

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,160
summit right now is the time to submit a

00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:13,890
talks if you'd like to join us please

00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:16,610
submit a talk and after that we'll be in

00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:19,890
China for the cloud foundry summit there

00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:21,390
um so moving on I was gonna sneak in on

00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:24,150
the evangelism update here because I

00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:25,980
focused a lot of that at high foundry so

00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:28,470
we are planning a doc sprints for

00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:29,790
September 30th there's actually been

00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:31,590
quite a bit of interest in it

00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:33,480
I have funding to bring a number of

00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:35,340
people to our offices in San Francisco

00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,959
and I think for those first one will

00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,450
focus on getting started with cloud

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:42,030
foundry there's some good documentation

00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:43,920
that's already there but I would like to

00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:46,650
really make it bulletproof because I

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,060
think and I'll talk a little later when

00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:50,370
people get started with cloud foundry

00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:51,930
the first thing they do is download it

00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:54,120
install it themselves even if they

00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:55,800
decide to go with a provider like IBM or

00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,480
pivotal later they always want to

00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,610
install it first so I want to make that

00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,650
process really awesome and we need

00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:03,720
everything from people who've never used

00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:05,370
or have used it a little bit who want to

00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,830
install it make sure that you know see

00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:09,420
how it flows to good doc writers to

00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:12,810
people are familiar with Cloud Foundry

00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:14,489
and actually develop on it so if you we

00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:16,950
need the whole gamut so if you'd like to

00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:19,560
come please let me know we're also gonna

00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:21,840
announce today or tomorrow probably that

00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,940
we're providing travel for meetups when

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,470
I started this job I know beam ups are

00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,850
important and I thought what meetups

00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:29,370
would need is

00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:31,110
funding for pizza and a place to meet it

00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:33,270
turns out most of them have a place to

00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:35,670
meet most of them have pizza and beer

00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:37,290
they might always need more pizza but

00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:39,630
what they really need is speakers so

00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:41,880
we're providing some process and some

00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:43,170
travel funds to move speakers from one

00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,820
place to the next so if you speak on

00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:46,470
climb foundry and want to travel a

00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:50,130
little bit and talk about it let me know

00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:52,260
or watch our blog other news that

00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:54,240
happened last week was Microsoft I don't

00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:55,680
know if you knew Microsoft is working on

00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,570
Cloud Foundry contributing to the

00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,190
open-source version and they have their

00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:01,470
second release of Cloud Foundry on Azure

00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:02,820
so you can check that out in the Cloud

00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:04,890
Foundry after dark

00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:06,360
pivotal said that they have a couple of

00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:07,800
customers who are putting that through

00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,280
its paces in a big way and really

00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,930
testing it out so that's exciting to see

00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:15,660
I'm speaking of cloud foundry after dark

00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:18,150
it's it's always every Sunday evening

00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:20,130
I'm you can join and it's run by Andrew

00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:21,660
clay Schafer who I knew his little ideas

00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:24,060
on Twitter long before I met him in

00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:25,530
person and they started out with this

00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:27,240
past Sunday I'll just give you a quick

00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:29,280
recap of it

00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,440
they started out talking about events

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,230
and they talked about how Sam's keynote

00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,630
had had evolved over time then they

00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:38,010
talked about the new pivotal CEO then

00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:39,960
really say much about him but they did

00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:41,790
mention that this release had been a

00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,320
good time for pivotal to announce that

00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:44,930
they had a hundred million dollars in

00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:47,010
sales this year just from Cloud Foundry

00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:49,080
and as pivotal is just one of the

00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:52,680
providers you know IBM and HP II and

00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:54,870
others active state also um release

00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,370
Cloud Foundry and this mark is getting

00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:58,650
pretty vague so that's pretty awesome

00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:00,530
for all of us that care about open

00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:03,870
source platform as-a-service

00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:05,190
with that pivotal has been hiring so

00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:08,910
they hired a couple new employees were

00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:11,400
on the call Bridgette and Jason we also

00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:13,050
had Matt curry from Allstate there

00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,670
they're also hiring that's all skip to

00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:16,830
him they're hiring

00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:18,570
they don't do remote working it didn't

00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:22,140
sound like so they're hiring at Chicago

00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:24,420
Arizona Charlotte's and Ireland and they

00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:26,610
were all talking about how it's hard to

00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:28,410
find experienced developers that are

00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:30,390
familiar with platform-as-a-service in

00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:32,660
cloud foundry in particular so it's a

00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:36,840
great skill set to be growing these days

00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:38,610
we also had someone from Asia on the

00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:41,120
call I believe that was Matt curry

00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:43,260
actually and they're talking about how

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,970
things might be different from Cloud

00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:46,710
Foundry users in Asia which is

00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:48,570
interesting to me because I with cloud

00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:50,250
foundry Berlin summit with the summit

00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:52,200
coming up in Berlin I'd had this

00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:54,240
conversation with Europe and they also

00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:57,120
thought that but then when everyone

00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,710
tells their stories it sounds it all

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,910
sounds very familiar like I was saying

00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:04,800
earlier and Colin said on that on the

00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:07,380
cloud foundry after dark people start

00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,450
out by trying to build their own paths

00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:10,980
and pulling all the pieces and playing

00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:12,840
with I mean really getting familiar with

00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:14,850
hop has works and then at some point

00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:17,910
they realized that they have a team of

00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:21,660
10 to 12 people that just maintain their

00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:24,720
own homegrown platform I think Colin use

00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:26,100
some funny word like that they're

00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,780
maintaining their own home-brewed thing

00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:29,669
and then they look at Cloud Foundry and

00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,860
either download the whole platform and

00:07:29,669 --> 00:07:33,840
use it in-house or go with one of the

00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:35,370
service providers so I think it's

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,600
important that people can play with it

00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:39,450
and that's one of the reasons cloud

00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:40,680
foundry the open source but it's also

00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:42,450
important to have the solution

00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:44,100
package as a whole so that like not

00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:46,140
every company in the world has to have a

00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:48,750
team of 10 to 12 people maintaining

00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:51,210
infrastructure and then going back to

00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:53,010
you that a keynote idea that that David

00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:54,750
person had nook you know talked at David

00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:56,520
person had you know then get back to

00:07:54,750 --> 00:08:01,350
writing their code and not maintaining

00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:03,810
this platform as well as did they say Oh

00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:06,390
Matt curry from Allstate had some really

00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:07,680
good points about what it's like for a

00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:09,330
company who's not on the software

00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,100
business to start contributing to an

00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:13,020
open-source software project and I'd

00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:14,850
love to talk more about that with him at

00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:17,760
some point because they had questions

00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:19,860
come up like can you trademark something

00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:21,540
that's not providing services externally

00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:23,430
should it be associated with the

00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:24,930
corporate brand of all states then how

00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:27,570
do you recruit people and I think your

00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:28,979
insurance company but yet you want to

00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:30,990
tie it to the big brand that you already

00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:33,060
have so you talked about how they're

00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:34,979
working on that how they created their

00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:36,810
github accounts how they contributing

00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:39,390
back already how they sponsor Cloud

00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:41,250
Foundry meetups and how they're building

00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:43,530
a brand around technology work and not

00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:45,089
just the industry that they're in so

00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:47,430
that was really interesting and I look

00:08:45,089 --> 00:08:48,629
forward to seeing more companies work on

00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:50,790
that

00:08:48,629 --> 00:08:52,769
when we talked a little bit about what

00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:54,089
art they talked I wasn't there I'm a

00:08:52,769 --> 00:08:57,569
little bit about like cloud native

00:08:54,089 --> 00:08:59,670
applications are what cloud native

00:08:57,569 --> 00:09:00,120
platforms are good for I mean they're

00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:02,220
really good

00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,990
obviously for cloud native applications

00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:05,100
like they work for legacy applications

00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:07,290
but that's not where you're gonna get

00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:09,720
your value-add and they talked a bit

00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:11,250
about how a contract is born and Claud

00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,980
founders prescriptive it puts things

00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:16,529
together for you and that's because they

00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:18,060
in the AMA expect well factored apps to

00:09:16,529 --> 00:09:19,740
get the most value out of it and that's

00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:21,209
because a lot of app developers have

00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:24,569
gone through a lot of pain to figure out

00:09:21,209 --> 00:09:25,709
what works really well so Andrew talked

00:09:24,569 --> 00:09:28,290
about how there's these enabling

00:09:25,709 --> 00:09:30,089
constraints so you have to do things the

00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:31,800
right way and then it makes the rest of

00:09:30,089 --> 00:09:33,089
the things easy for you and he talked

00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,459
about how like Twitter does that with

00:09:33,089 --> 00:09:37,110
our 140 character constraints and then

00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:40,439
you get this platform that that enables

00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:42,389
conversations they also talked about the

00:09:40,439 --> 00:09:44,430
Cloud Foundry summits and Colin

00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:45,990
Humphreys from cloud credo talked about

00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:48,089
how Club credo is gonna be offering

00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:50,009
training the first day of a cloud Condor

00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:51,870
summit and so there'll be three tracks

00:09:50,009 --> 00:09:53,850
of training the day time the first day

00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:56,610
of the summit and it's like Cloud

00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:58,709
Foundry for beginners like from zero to

00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:01,709
hero and then it'll be one that's like

00:09:58,709 --> 00:10:03,540
operations focused I think I'm mainly

00:10:01,709 --> 00:10:05,459
working on Bosch in that one and then

00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:08,129
there'll be a cloud native track for for

00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:09,779
developers so moving from legacy apps to

00:10:08,129 --> 00:10:11,639
cloud native and figuring out how to

00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:14,399
refactor your app into this twelve

00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:15,689
factor format and they'll be doing the

00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,439
same training at the Cloud Foundry

00:10:15,689 --> 00:10:20,790
summit in China and early December

00:10:18,439 --> 00:10:23,279
so Collins spoke a little bit more after

00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:25,220
that he talked about the structured

00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:29,550
versus unstructured the prescriptive

00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:30,870
debate and just again so that most

00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:32,879
people play with it and then end up

00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:34,100
wanting to use something that everyone

00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:36,089
else's figure out how to put together

00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:39,809
but he talked about how like when

00:10:36,089 --> 00:10:41,970
companies adopt that the a pad or Cloud

00:10:39,809 --> 00:10:43,709
Foundry it removes a constraint with

00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:45,089
deployment so it used to be like the

00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:47,100
roadblock was actually getting their

00:10:45,089 --> 00:10:48,779
application out the door and being able

00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:51,120
to deploy it quickly and securely and

00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:52,949
now they can deploy them boundary they

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,110
can deploy them quickly and securely as

00:10:52,949 --> 00:10:57,389
many times a day as they want and so now

00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:59,670
I have to figure out how many times a

00:10:57,389 --> 00:11:01,050
day should they be deploying it and how

00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:02,339
should they be managing that

00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:03,630
and then what's the next constraint

00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:05,370
what's what's the thing that's gonna

00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:07,290
hold them back next worse they focus

00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:09,180
their energy and I think there's a lot

00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:11,910
of good conversations that could happen

00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:15,110
in our user community around that um

00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:17,760
that would be really fun to foster um

00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:19,649
speaking of trying Cloud Foundry and we

00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,420
talked a little bit about lattice if you

00:11:19,649 --> 00:11:22,890
haven't heard about lattice it's a

00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:25,050
version it's kind of a version of Cloud

00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:26,850
Foundry it's its own product but it runs

00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:28,920
on a laptop so you can download it and

00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:32,339
deploy it locally and it's kind of like

00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:35,579
a mini Cloud Foundry and it allows you

00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:37,529
to just to create containers does to

00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:39,990
scale them to schedule them just kind of

00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:42,240
check out how things work and the new

00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:44,279
version has you can run build packs and

00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,810
droplets and James Boehner talked a

00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:47,430
little bit about this he also talked

00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:50,760
about how lattice is a place for

00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:52,829
experimentation so for example the TCP

00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:54,480
routing work that GE has been helping to

00:11:52,829 --> 00:11:56,700
build is in the latest version of

00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,079
lattice and it'll be there and tried out

00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:01,290
there for a while before it goes into

00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,670
Cloud Foundry so it's a place to also

00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:05,310
experiment some of the new technologies

00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:06,899
coming out they also had a conversation

00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:08,670
about whether our paths is the right

00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:12,300
term and I think it's really interesting

00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:14,190
that in the US I hear more people saying

00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:16,200
trying to move to cloud native not

00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:17,459
completely I gave a talk last week and I

00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,690
asked the audience who had heard of

00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:20,459
cloud native and not a single one of

00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:21,870
them had and then I asked who would hurt

00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:25,290
a path and like they all raised their

00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:27,750
hand um but to hear more cloud native in

00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:31,110
the u.s. it sounds like in year but Asia

00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:32,700
you you haven't heard that term yet from

00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:35,399
there they went on to talk about weather

00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:37,950
build packs so build packs is how Cloud

00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:39,720
Foundry recognizes it's all the

00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:41,760
information that needs to kind of looks

00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:43,649
like a poly rap but to run your your app

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,060
I'm still a build packs for like Java

00:12:43,649 --> 00:12:46,560
and there's build packs for Ruby and

00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:48,360
Bill packed for the different languages

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,890
and they talked about whether or not

00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:52,709
that would help organizations maintain

00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:54,570
multiple languages or whether it was

00:12:52,709 --> 00:12:58,470
still beneficial for organizations to

00:12:54,570 --> 00:13:00,329
try to move to a single language they

00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:02,940
talked a bit about Microsoft Azure that

00:13:00,329 --> 00:13:05,250
released last week and it was

00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:09,300
interesting to meet in the conversation

00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:11,100
because they talked about how Azur had

00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:13,050
features that cloud foundry didn't and

00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,910
how we might actually build those into

00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:16,640
cloud foundry

00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:18,680
or that in particular in a Bosch for

00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:21,170
example Azur has like what I called the

00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:23,330
anti affinity feature James was talking

00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:25,580
about it which which means that you can

00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:27,350
say hey all these these apps that I'm

00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:30,350
listing I love them or microservice I

00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:31,970
want them to run as Spurs as possible as

00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:34,100
opposed to like actually saying which

00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:36,320
Hardware you wanted to run on so that

00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:38,180
was kind of like I wonder if as pod

00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,700
foundry is used by more organizations

00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:41,960
and put it to more platforms it will get

00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:44,450
like the best of all the different

00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:45,890
patents that they've created and then

00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:48,320
they talked about vmworld that's coming

00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:51,260
up next week and I just want to remind

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,270
you that the Berlin confound Reese image

00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:55,370
is coming up in November and right now

00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:57,110
is the time to submit your paper we

00:13:55,370 --> 00:14:00,230
especially would like to hear anything

00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:01,850
about how you're using cloud foundry any

00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:03,800
challenges you've had or any best

00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:06,560
practices you've developed so that other

00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:07,880
people can learn from you so thanks for

00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,950
thanks for joining me for the cloud

00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:11,540
foundry Morning Edition if you enjoyed

00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:15,850
it please let me know and I will do it

00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:15,850
