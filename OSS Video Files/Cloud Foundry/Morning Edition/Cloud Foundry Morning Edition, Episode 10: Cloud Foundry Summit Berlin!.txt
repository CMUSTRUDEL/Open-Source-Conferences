Foundry summit Berlin where great things

00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:12,000
happened this week

00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:14,880

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,430
technical evangelism it has been quite

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,619
the week in the Cloud Foundry world so

00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:22,320
we had our Cloud Foundry summit Europe

00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:23,189
in Berlin which is super exciting and

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,260
I'm going to tell you more about that

00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:26,640
later and then along with that we had a

00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,960
whole bunch of news from the Cloud

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,760
Foundry foundation and some of our

00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,289
member companies just to give you a

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,690
flavor for it

00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:35,489
the Cloud Foundry foundation I'm just

00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:36,870
past our 15 member mark so there are

00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:38,820
more than 50 companies that are

00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,350
participating in Cloud Foundry and what

00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,420
I really think is really awesome about

00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:44,040
as a lot of them are user companies we

00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:46,980
have to be one of the few foundations

00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:51,539
where user companies and providers work

00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:54,510
super close together on things so part

00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:55,770
of that news was a susake on a Suzy well

00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:57,030
Suzy can have their conference as well

00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,910
but Suzy joined the Cloud Foundry

00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:01,559
foundation other news from Cloud Foundry

00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:04,559
foundation was that we move several

00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:05,970
projects from incubation to active

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,960
projects so things like support for

00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:12,090
docker and dotnet HP announced that in

00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:14,040
addition to supporting OpenStack they're

00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:18,659
also supporting their customers using

00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:20,640
Cloud Foundry on AWS and Azure pivotal

00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:22,080
and cloudBees talked about their

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,700
partnership between cloud native and

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,439
cloud bees and now they have enterprise

00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:29,340
class Jenkins for developers that are

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,960
working on pivotal Cloud Foundry we had

00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,390
a whole bunch of announcements around

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,759
Microsoft's Azur and I'll introduce you

00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:37,770
later in this talk to one of the

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:41,340
speakers that I talked about is Dora at

00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:43,530
the conference and let's see we

00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,479
announced a new logo for Cloud Foundry I

00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:47,369
think it's beautiful this is an addition

00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:49,200
to the Cloud Foundry rabbit and by the

00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:51,600
way that quad new rabbit name still is

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,420
to come out and one of the cool things

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,310
about the Cloud Foundry rabbit is that

00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,479
it has lots of different instances so we

00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,979
have a club honey rabbit it looks like

00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:00,840
an engineer we have one that looks like

00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:02,939
a ninja rabbit and we have lots of

00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,729
different flavors and so the name kind

00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:09,330
of has to hold that space and let the

00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:10,920
community create their own rabbits um so

00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,330
the dish is all that great news that I

00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:15,520
just blew past in ten seconds but I

00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:17,200
included all the links here both in the

00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,610
YouTube channel and in the blog posts if

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,810
you want to go read about any of them

00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:24,400
I'm just as lots of new members projects

00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:26,680
moving to active projects things that

00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,030
rain incubation with active things lots

00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,780
of announcements from our partners like

00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:34,090
pivotal cloud bees and HP at Microsoft I

00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:36,400
wanted to talk to you mostly about the

00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:38,740
the Berlin on the con foundry summit in

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,080
Berlin because it was a really fun event

00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:43,330
it started out with an unconference on

00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:45,430
Sunday moved into training on Monday

00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:47,440
morning in the conference kicked off

00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:49,600
Monday afternoon and went on Monday

00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,670
afternoon all day Tuesday and then we

00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,740
had a great party sponsored by pivotal

00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:56,110
on Tuesday night where everyone was

00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:58,140
really excited from the conference they

00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:01,000
even got me to sing karaoke which is not

00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:03,040
happened very often and one of the

00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,650
things that I think so our conferences

00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:09,880
our first year to do it in Europe and we

00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:12,490
got I think 461 people registered and

00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:14,590
like 95% of them actually showed up

00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:16,540
which is like just amazing what an

00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:18,340
amazing group of people and that's an

00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:20,410
addition to as I told you before we got

00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:21,640
hundreds of submissions hundreds of

00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:23,380
submissions lots of submissions I don't

00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,209
remember the exact number for very few

00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:28,900
slots we had a really awesome agenda for

00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:31,000
everybody to follow as well look in

00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,769

00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,540
all the partying and stuff I showed up

00:03:32,769 --> 00:03:35,860
for the nine o'clock keynotes and it's

00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:39,310
kind of expecting like not very many

00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:42,550
people crowded packed keynote hall so

00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:43,780
super engaged audience super fun glad to

00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:45,640
have all of you as part of our community

00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:47,890
and I'm really looking forward to doing

00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:51,370
the same thing in Shanghai and then it's

00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:54,100
Ana Clara in May so I wanted to tell you

00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:56,920
so I went around the conference and I

00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:59,110
interviewed people took my phone in my

00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:01,060
microphone and interviewed people and so

00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:03,130
I wanted to share with you a little bit

00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:04,680
about who I talked to and I asked

00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:07,780
everybody what their favorite part was

00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:09,280
and it's kind of fun to hear all the

00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:12,100
different favorite parts because we had

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:15,220
so many amazing parts I'm so so take a

00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:17,109
listen here and let me know what you

00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:18,940
thought in the conference I'm Alex from

00:04:17,109 --> 00:04:20,650
the pivotal London team

00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:23,220
and we kind of follow meats that we know

00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:25,600
we do drinks once a month in London and

00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:30,220
yeah so anyone in London come along we

00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:31,960
talk about Cloud Foundry so alex says he

00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:34,060
kind of runs the meetup but he actually

00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,710
runs a successful meetup so I asked him

00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:37,810
how someone could go about starting a

00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:39,580
meet-up find some good people that like

00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:41,440
to talk about cloud foundry and then

00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:43,600
drag them to a restaurant or a bar and

00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,670
then people will just gravitate around

00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:49,740
you if you you know have fun

00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:51,820
conversations and here go from there and

00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:53,260
asked everyone I talked to you with

00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:55,780
their favorite part of the summit was

00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:57,790
and what I really loved everyone loved a

00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:59,380
different part it was a fantastic summit

00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,740
with so many good parts it was hard to

00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:02,320
choose

00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:04,510
I already enjoyed the diversity lunch

00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,860
today I thought I was really good it's

00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:08,140
nice it has opened up to a wide audience

00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:12,160
as well and I really enjoyed the

00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:14,260
Lightning to a format of that next I

00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,540
talked to Tim Savage who helps comic

00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:18,250
relief a British charity deal with a

00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:19,990
whole bunch of donations that come in

00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:24,550
within a 7 hour window so they prepare

00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:26,140
all year for the 700 on a shoe and his

00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:28,390
job is to help make sure those donations

00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:29,830
come in smoothly with the least cost of

00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:39,610
overhead and that if anything goes wrong

00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:42,580
they continue to function yes I was

00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:43,030
talking about how we work with comic

00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:45,730
relief

00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:48,669
big UK charity who have quite an unusual

00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:50,650
problem they have to take over their

00:05:48,669 --> 00:05:53,530
boards telephone events they have to

00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:55,660
take donations over a 7 hour period it

00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:58,660
happens once a year we in effect

00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:58,960
flatline have no traffic for 364 days of

00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:01,590
the year

00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:04,390
we then peak and have to take up to

00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:06,100
10,000 credit card transactions a second

00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:08,169
for a period of maybe 20 minutes and

00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:10,360
then all the way back down again to 0 by

00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:12,220
2 p.m. and 2 a.m. in the morning and

00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:16,150
that's it and that's the problem we have

00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:17,710
to solve and as you heard on an earlier

00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:19,840
Cloud Foundry morning edition or perhaps

00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:22,780
you read it on the Internet Cloud

00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,950
Foundry networks with us or so and I

00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:26,140
think I'm saying is we're wrong as

00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:28,120
you'll see what their next Cloud Foundry

00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:30,970
summit attendee and speaker

00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:33,729
my name is kundina Paulo Gary and I am a

on Cloud Foundry project for Thatcher

00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:41,260
and today at the conference I spoke

00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:44,530
about deploying your first app on Cloud

00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:47,260
Foundry upon Asha the conference was

00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:49,030
very very exciting because I got to meet

00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:51,250
a lot of potential customers and

00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:54,100
existing customers and learn about the

00:06:51,250 --> 00:07:00,580
various Cloud Foundry scenarios looking

00:06:54,100 --> 00:07:01,840
forward to the next one I you know how

00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:03,610
easy to apply

00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,710
how many PM's do you need to deploy

00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:07,450
what's the roadmap what are the new

00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:11,350
things that are gonna support things

00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:12,940
like that and then this brave soul

00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:14,800
Raphael came up and introduced himself

00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:16,240
to me so I whipped out my microphone to

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,160
ask him what he liked about the summit

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,720
he attended the training in the first

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,310
day and we're gonna repeat this training

00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:24,310
in Shanghai and in other places

00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:26,140
um so hear what he has to say my name is

00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:27,850
Raphael I work for mendax in in

00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:33,419
Rotterdam I've been using cloud firing

00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:33,419
for a couple months yes my first segment

00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:40,210
so I mean the training class was given

00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:44,530
by cloud for you and it did a very good

00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:47,289
job I took the one on Bosch and we use

00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:49,390
blush a couple times and but they give

00:07:47,289 --> 00:07:51,430
us lots of more information about what

00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:52,960
we were doing we were actually like more

00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:55,930
trying it out in discovering on the

00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:58,330
stack and they actually well showed us

00:07:55,930 --> 00:08:02,440
around the proper way give us lots of

00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:04,210
useful stuff and here's Paula Kennedy

00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:06,250
from Claude credo not only did cloud

00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:08,950
credo organized the training in the

00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:10,630
first day but Paula as part of her user

00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:12,610
group activities also created an

00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:14,729
unconference to welcome people to Berlin

00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:17,500
on the first day and create some kind of

00:08:14,729 --> 00:08:22,440
free social time to talk about Cloud

00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:22,440
Foundry topics and they had a great time

00:08:27,789 --> 00:08:33,560
yes sure so we ran the unconference on

00:08:31,669 --> 00:08:36,320
Sunday I'm one of the co-organizers of

00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:38,740
the London paths user group so we run it

00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,599
in conjunction with the DAC user group

00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:44,149
here who are based in Zurich and also

00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:46,310
work in Berlin we were just looking to

00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:48,290
have an event before the summit started

00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:50,329
we wanted to get people together and be

00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:52,850
a bit more informal have a chat have

00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:55,279
some general discussions and it went

00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:58,310
awesome so we had over 100 people came

00:08:55,279 --> 00:09:00,880
we had seven sponsors who paid the costs

00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:03,350
and helped us to basically run the event

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,390
the topics were great the discussions

00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:07,279
were really good the vibe was really

00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:09,380
positive it was a really friendly

00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,970
welcoming event and we were just just

00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:13,720
thank anybody who came and everybody who

00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:16,370
participated it went really really well

00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:19,250
and they asked Paulo about her favorite

00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:21,110
thing about the unconference was I think

00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:24,040
my favourite lightning talk was from KC

00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:26,450
West he talked about cultural change and

00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:28,519
it was really it just had some great

00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:30,649
ideas about how we should look at

00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:32,860
different people's values and and when

00:09:30,649 --> 00:09:35,209
we're working together we should try to

00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:37,699
talk about what we agree on and our

00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:38,930
values and how we can really understand

00:09:37,699 --> 00:09:42,010
each other better and I thought his

00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:44,449
thought was absolutely fantastic an

00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:46,100
unconference is super popular and a

00:09:44,449 --> 00:09:47,600
great way to start out a conference kind

00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:49,640
of built a lot of community before the

00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,769
conference even started and so I asked

00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:53,149
Paula how do you go about organising UN

00:09:51,769 --> 00:09:54,410
conference and how do you select the

00:09:53,149 --> 00:09:57,260
talks and how does that happen

00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:59,000
and what we basically did was a kind of

00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:00,829
a format where I think you've got to

00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,089
have a post-it note and a sharpie and

00:10:00,829 --> 00:10:03,649
they came up and they wrote down

00:10:02,089 --> 00:10:05,510
whatever they wanted to talk about and

00:10:03,649 --> 00:10:06,890
then anybody who proposed the talk was

00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:08,480
given the microphone they had to stand

00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:11,180
up and say why they want to talk about

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,550
the topic what their kind of vision was

00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:15,589
for that topic and then essentially we

00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:17,779
drew a big grid on the board we had each

00:10:15,589 --> 00:10:19,490
of the ideas stuck on the board and the

00:10:17,779 --> 00:10:21,199
people could vote to say which one they

00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:23,240
were most interested in who ended up

00:10:21,199 --> 00:10:24,740
winning twelve separate discussions over

00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:26,300
the kind of a couple of hours that we

00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:27,649
had and people could vote with their

00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:29,240
feet so people came along to whichever

00:10:27,649 --> 00:10:30,620
talk they like the look of if they

00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,580
didn't like it they could leave

00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:33,620
and we have some really interesting

00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:34,910
discussions and some really great topics

00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:38,120
that were proposed and then with this

00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:40,040
best so in a previous Cloud Foundry

00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,900
Morning Edition I told you that iron IO

00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:44,060
joined the cloud foundry Foundation and

00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:45,800
they gave you like a 8 second maybe five

00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:47,660
second blurb on what they did so when I

00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,220
ran into Ivan I thought this is a great

00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:51,560
opportunity to hear what they did in his

00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:53,180
own words hello there my name is Ivan

00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:55,820
Dwyer I had a business development at

00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:57,590
iron dot IO we're a brand-new member of

00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:59,540
the Cloud Foundry foundation we've been

00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:01,970
working in a Seco system for a while and

00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:04,460
it was time to make it formal we are

00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:06,530
here in Berlin I'm very excited to meet

00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:08,540
a lot of the members of the ecosystem

00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:11,060
those building applications and those

00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:13,010
operating the platforms we are a

00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:15,170
developer tools provider focused around

00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:16,130
asynchronous workloads so all those

00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:18,680
things that happen in the background

00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:22,250
outside of applications or the company

00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:24,140
for that and of course I asked him what

00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:26,630
his favorite part of the summit was and

00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:28,010
he had yet another answer just goes to

00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:29,570
show you there were a lot of really

00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:32,180
awesome parts of the Cloud Foundry

00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:35,210
summit in Berlin it's always fun to see

00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:36,920
James and Josh banter back and forth at

00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:39,080
each other those guys have a really good

00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:41,660
rapport and when I after the after the

00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:43,070
session they I said that to them and

00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:44,750
they said well that comes from six years

00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:46,970
of collaborating in this world together

00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:48,770
so it's nice to see everybody that's

00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:50,750
very friendly in here everybody's

00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:52,280
collaborative it's really just kind of a

00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:56,030
warm and from the environment and it was

00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:57,740
happy to be part of it so my favorite

00:11:56,030 --> 00:12:00,560
part of the cloud foundry summit in

00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:02,210
Europe in Berlin was getting to meet

00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,790
everybody in person like a lot of people

00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:07,010
that I'd only met over email or Google

00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:09,170
Hangouts as awesome to get to meet them

00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:12,860
in person and listen to what they had to

00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:14,300
say and sing karaoke great fun but

00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,560
probably my favorite talk was the

00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,670
closing keynote which is by probably

00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,140
nobody else could tell you was their

00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:21,080
favorite talk I talk to people during

00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:23,210
the summit um and it was bye to you guys

00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:25,580
Simon and Daniel friends from your

00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:27,110
nature and they gave a great talk with

00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:28,280
some great visuals I think they were

00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:30,170
made by Daniel's wife who's like a

00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:32,120
visual designer and then it ended with

00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:33,980
like the skit or one was like you know

00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,390
how can we do this someone says oh we've

00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:37,250
cut foundry and he says Oh what about

00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:40,400
security you me says okok foundry does

00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:41,780
this it's a great skit so if you would

00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,250
like to see them talk you should invite

00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:44,090
them to your local meetup it would be

00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:47,060
well worth it

00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:49,340
so that wraps up a really awesome week

00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:52,070
