    BNY Mellon brought together two dozen chief technology officers from financial services companies to the Silicon Valley. They spent two days digging into common technology challenges and heard from industry experts like Cloud Foundry Foundation’s Sam Ramji. BNY Mellon’s CIO Suresh Kumar spoke highly of the their involvement with Cloud Foundry and the advantages it brings. The event was also the first in depth preview of the BNY Mellon’s NEXEN open source cloud software, based on Cloud Foundry!
    The Cloud Foundry Foundation is hiring! If you are a technical project manager and would like to be part of an awesome team and project, check out the Cloud Foundry project manager role.
    ProsocialLearn is a project in the EU that creates games to teach at risk children social skills like empathy, trust and cooperation. They speak very highly of Cloud Foundry as an open source, cloud based game platform!
    Is 18F competing with the private sector? Or collaborating with a number of individuals and corporations on an open source, cloud platform for everyone?
    The Berlin Cloud Foundry Summit is almost here! There will be an unconference ahead of time, training the first day and a meetup for meetup organizers the first night. More great keynotes and breakout sessions the second day!
    The Cloud Foundry Ninja Rabbit is here! And the Cloud Foundry Ninja Rabbit needs a name … Enter the competition now and we might have some swag for you if your name is chosen. Just tweet your name to @cloudfoundry with #ninjarabbit by October 31st!

00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,059
in the Cloud Foundry world and what's

00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:11,309

about what's coming up in the cloud

00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:20,820
foundry world's around you and I will

00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:25,949
include that you can also check out our

00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:27,869

00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:30,269
morning good afternoon good evening I'm

00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:31,949
stormy Peters VP of technical evangelism

00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:36,059
and this is the Cloud Foundry Morning

00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:38,040
Edition episode eight so this past week

00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:39,329
I went to the Grace Hopper women in

00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,129
computing conference in Houston

00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:44,160
I got to talk to a lot of people about

00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:47,190
Cloud Foundry I got my first stormy and

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,320
clouds joke which honestly had not

00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:51,840
occurred to me at all strange as that

00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,420
may sound and I got to explain a lot

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,270
about why why I believe Cloud Foundry is

00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:59,010
important for the future of the world so

00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:01,199
it's an open source cloud platform and I

00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:03,180
totally believe so it's I should back up

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,159
and say like I started working on the

00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,420
Linux desktop because I believed the

00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:07,770
genome desktop because I believed we

00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,320
needed a free and open source software

00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:12,030
desktop to have freedom to have control

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,280
of our lives and so developers could

00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,960
create awesome things from there I

00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,030
realized that all the apps are moving to

00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,470
the web and the web was not open and

00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,580
people couldn't get their data out and

00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,720
they couldn't see how things were

00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,430
working so they couldn't make sure they

00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,770
were secure so I went to Mozilla worked

00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:28,140
on open web and now I really think apps

00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:30,570
are moving to the cloud on this whole 12

00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,250
factor app micro services whether you

00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:33,509
write your own micro services I use all

00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:37,140
of those that are available across the

00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:38,850
internet developers are creating both

00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,770
bigger things in the sense of the

00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:42,990
problems they solve and smaller things

00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:44,729
in this and so the APIs is more simple

00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:46,860
and the micro services are simple not

00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:50,640
simple but like I'm smaller than not

00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:52,829
monolithic apps that needs a cloud

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,460
platform that is open source and

00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:58,380
available across many places so that

00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:00,270
developers have a freedom and choice to

00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:02,189
bring the best solutions to users to

00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:05,340
bring what users need so that's why I

00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:06,689
met Cloud Foundry then I got to explain

00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,569
that a lot last week so you got to hear

00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:11,940
it now there's also the other big event

00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:12,780
that happened very recently as BNY

00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:16,290
Mellon

00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:18,180
is a bank out of New York and and one of

00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:20,160
our member companies of the Cloud

00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:23,640
Foundry foundation brought together like

00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,200
two dozen a couple dozen CTOs chief

00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,240
technology officers to the Silicon

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,850
Valley and they spent two days digging

00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:31,319
into technologies and inviting key

00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:33,090
people to come speak to them about new

00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:35,400
technologies and one of the people they

00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:39,330
invited was our Cloud Foundry very own

00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,650
CEO Sam Ramsey and he was really excited

00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:42,569
about what he saw and heard there so

00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:45,750
there was a lot of support for Cloud

00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:48,180
Foundry BNY Mellon CIO Suresh Kumar

00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:49,620
spoke really highly of Cloud Foundry in

00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,660
front of the whole group and so it was

00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:54,269
really exciting to see or to hear from

00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:55,890
him what he saw about how financial

00:02:54,269 --> 00:02:57,930
services are getting into the cloud

00:02:55,890 --> 00:03:01,560
space and how Cloud Foundry can help

00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:03,660
them be BNY Mellon also did their first

00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:07,290
like external preview of some of their

00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:08,819
open source cloud software Nexen so I'll

00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:10,489
add more links on the blog about that if

00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:13,650
you want to see that

00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:15,420
other other news kind of accidentally

00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:18,269
found out from the one on the mailing

00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:20,519
list CF dev that there is a group in the

00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:24,299
EU working off some kind of grant money

00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:27,239
called pro-social learn that helps build

00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:30,510
games that helps kids learn about social

00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:33,510
skills so kids that are risk of social

00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:35,489
exclusion or lacking empathy or have

00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:37,860
like antisocial behaviors they can play

00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:40,980
these games that then teach them those

00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:43,500
behaviors and what was cool and why it's

00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:47,760
relevant to you is that they're actually

00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:49,079
exploring Cloud Foundry as as the one of

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,030
the technologies they're going to use

00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:53,250
and they said just awesome things about

00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:55,440
Cloud Foundry as a game platform and

00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:57,930
called it a de facto standard and like

00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:00,030
really awesome to see that Cloud Foundry

00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:03,320
are open source cloud software is being

00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:06,329
used to help kids learn social skills

00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:07,620
from government grant money in Europe

00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:09,450
just totally cool to see that stuff

00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:11,489
coming together and we didn't even know

00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:13,079
it was happening so I reached out to

00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:16,100
them hopefully we can interview them

00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:19,590
here or have a blog on them or something

00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:22,169
on that same so last week there's some

00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:25,110
big news at 18f the cloud gov work which

00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:26,380
is truly awesome and still it's also

00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:28,030
that at Grace Hopper

00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:29,620
week there was in there was an

00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:31,390
interesting article that said you know

00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:34,120
we need to view this with skepticism

00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:36,130
because as 18f competing with the

00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:39,430
private sector and I find this amusing

00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:42,250
because 18f is using open source foundry

00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:44,530
software to build their platform and so

00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:48,190
they are collaborating with all of those

00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:49,060
competitors and they're offering that

00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:51,550
the free and open source software

00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,330
version of it and if the government has

00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:54,460
a long

00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:55,840
the US government has a long history of

00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:58,150
using open source software in their

00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,310
solutions like Los Alamos National Labs

00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:01,480
uses Linux and builds on it and so I

00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:04,510
think this is just more of the

00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:08,410
government creating more public good for

00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:12,130
citizens so hopefully they continue to

00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:14,110
do awesome work there other news kind of

00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:16,930
more internal news we are hiring we're

00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:19,000
hiring a project a project manager so if

00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:21,280
you are a technical project manager

00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,250
interested and working on a really fun

00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,170
team there's eight of us totally awesome

00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:27,520
and I think I mentioned before people

00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:29,530
don't interrupt and people are super

00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,510
helpful one of the best teams I've ever

00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:33,220
worked on and we're hiring its project

00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:34,840
manager and you'll need to be technical

00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:37,420
you'll work with a bunch of member

00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:39,490
companies I'm across the board and be

00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:41,410
working you know very closely with the

00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:43,000
people committing code and making sure

00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:44,530
that you know schedules and plans and

00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,090
things aligned across all companies I

00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:50,320
mean if you're interested I'm take a

00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:53,500
look also a link on the blog and other

00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:55,780
news the Berlin summit is happening in

00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:58,090
like two weeks so if you haven't bought

00:05:55,780 --> 00:06:00,580
your ticket yet buy it now there's like

00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:02,860
an unconference on Sunday then a Monday

00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:04,990
morning there's a bunch of really

00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:06,760
awesome training geared at you know

00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:08,110
operators developers beginners

00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,090
experienced people so there's training

00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:12,700
for everybody and then the conference

00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:14,950
launches in the afternoon with some

00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:16,480
awesome like I said before we had so

00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:17,920
many proposals that we were able to put

00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,930
together a really awesome agenda of

00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:22,630
keynotes and breakout sessions over the

00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:24,280
next over that two days and then on

00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:26,980
Monday night we're going to have a

00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:28,990
meet-up for meetup organizers so if you

00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:30,850
will be in Berlin and you participate in

00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:33,190
meetups on a regular basis please join

00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:34,870
us for that it'll be after the event I

00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:36,070
think there's like a bar restaurant in

00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:37,360
the top floor of the hotel I could

00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:38,800
believe that's where it will be I'm

00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,390
emailing me if you'd like more

00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,300
information

00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:44,730
that and then I think I believe I spoke

00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:47,490
about before about PMC notes which is a

00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:50,190
github group or all of the the PMC's

00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:51,540
like post their updates they're starting

00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:53,070
to use a little more actively now so I

00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:56,190
highly recommend following that github

00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:56,970
project to get updates of a technical

00:06:56,190 --> 00:07:02,040
nature from each of the different

00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:04,140
projects and then I wanted to so we're

00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:05,760
working on certification for the code to

00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:08,040
make sure that anyone who says their

00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:09,780
cloud foundry is cloud foundry enough

00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,350
that any app developer could use them

00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:13,320
easily

00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:15,270
I'm also we're also exploring what

00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,920
certification means of an individual

00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:18,540
levels so how could you become cloud

00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:20,790
foundry certified so you could put that

00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:22,380
on your resume and take that from one

00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:25,350
company to the next so if you have

00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:27,060
opinions or ideas or want to discuss

00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:28,590
that please reach out to me now's the

00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,660
time because we're just starting to

00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:32,310
figure out what that will mean I'm so

00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:35,160
interested in having those conversations

00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:36,960
and then I saved the big news for last

00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,090
and you're probably wondering when I was

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,650
going to talk about it if you noticed at

00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:43,260
the beginning if you're watching this on

00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:45,300
YouTube there is a new logo there's a

00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:47,430
ninja rabbit there he's kind of been

00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:50,370
hiding in the corner but now he or she

00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:53,190
is for instance central this is our new

00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:55,530
logo for a community type stuff or the

00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:58,500
Cloud Foundry logo and this ninja rabbit

00:07:55,530 --> 00:08:00,990
means a name so if you would like to

00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:03,090

show you the ninja rabbit again at the

00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:36,870
end of this podcast so you can take a

00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:38,310
look at it and if you're listening while

00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:40,260
you're driving please don't look right

00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:42,630
now wait and you can look on the blog

00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:45,330
when you get back to your computer so

00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:47,370
submit your names and oh I just forgot

00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:49,560
meetups so I have a thing like that

00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:52,830
there's so I'm giving a talk I'm looking

00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:54,570
for more ways to capture

00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:56,310
where people are speaking about Cloud

00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:58,230
Foundry and where they're at so I have

00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:00,540
lots of great meetup data that I can get

00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:02,130
up from meetup comm and then I know

00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:04,740
about some things like I know that I'm

00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:06,450
giving a talk on Thursday at the SA P

00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:08,880
tech ed event which I'm very excited

00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:11,550
about giving a technical talk about what

00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,230
is Cloud Foundry with a demo and I know

00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:15,210
a few other people that are speaking I

00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:16,710
know in Sam speaking but I would really

00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:18,090
love to have a way that we go tell each

00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:19,800
other that we're speaking and so if you

00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:22,110
have a tool that you think is really

00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:24,120
particularly great for that let me know

00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:25,830
because I would like to do that but on

00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,200
the meetup front we have like seven

00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:30,030
meetups last Wednesday and I'm reaching

00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,720
out to all those meetup organizers to

00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:33,030
see how it went

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,130
if you were there let me know let me

00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:36,720
know what you thought of those and I

00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:38,700
don't think we have any night with seven

00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,530
this week but we do have four on

00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,580
Thursday so that's a pretty good runner

00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:43,040
up and there are like three different

00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:47,040
continents so if you're in Australia

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:49,260
North America or Europe you can go to a

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,670
cloud foundry event on Thursday if

00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:52,980
you're not on one of those continents

00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:55,500
check out the rest of them there's a few

00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:57,330
every night of the week I think so have

00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,310
a great week and I will catch you again

00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:01,020
next Tuesday good morning good afternoon

00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:04,190
good evening and you are listening to

00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:04,190
