the summit and all the things that come

00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:09,060
with the conference and then on Thursday

00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:11,610
by demand from the community there is a

00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:14,280
Bosch day Paula Kennedy is running that

00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:15,990

the things the Hyatt the hotel that's

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,400
right there at the conference center but

00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:40,740
those are going fast so get signed up

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,939
get your travel booked I also wanted to

00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,560
tell you since many of you are in the

00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:45,060
community we're trying something new

00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,549
this year at summits we're gonna have an

00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,979
ambassador program and ambassadors are

00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:51,479
going to be people in the community that

00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:53,310
really want to help welcome new people

00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:54,600
because sometimes it's you know you

00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:56,159
might go to those conference to learn

00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,290
about Cloud Foundry and when you get

00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,759
there you don't know anyone and you know

00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,810
you really had a question on Bosch and

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,560
you don't know what to meet you looks

00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:03,600
like you don't know whether community

00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,979
people working on their project look

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,099
like so we're gonna have ambassadors

00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:09,360
that are volunteering so if you'd like

00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:10,709
to volunteer to be ambassador please

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,930
reach out to me but they are

00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:15,510
volunteering to work throughout the

00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:18,420
and just be identified by a special

00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:19,950
lanyard or badge and to be available to

00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,640
answer questions or point people in the

00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:22,500
right direction

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,150
and so hopefully this is one way we can

00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,819
help grow our community and make sure

00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:28,620
it's welcoming to new people so if

00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:30,120
you're going to the summit for the first

00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,459
time know that they'll be ambassadors

00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,349
that will help you and if you are

00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:36,569
remember the community and want to help

00:02:34,349 --> 00:02:37,859
connect people and welcome people reach

00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:43,200
out to me and you too can be an

00:02:37,859 --> 00:02:44,700
ambassador let's see what else has

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,489
happened so you know that there's a

00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:50,010
monthly Cloud Foundry advisory board

00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:51,689
meeting they call it cab for short this

00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:54,750
month's meeting had both happened on

00:02:51,689 --> 00:02:56,849
April 14th and a huge thank you tell

00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:59,459
tauros in particular Roger struck cut

00:02:56,849 --> 00:03:01,469
off formal toros for taking the notes

00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:03,569
and if you go to their blog they even

00:03:01,469 --> 00:03:05,579
put like pictures of the project lead

00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:07,290
there so you can see who they are and at

00:03:05,579 --> 00:03:09,510
the end of every section with every

00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:12,209
update there's actually a link to the

00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:14,609
github repo for that project so not only

00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:16,439
is it an awesome meeting a great chance

00:03:14,609 --> 00:03:17,849
to ask your questions to get to know

00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:20,760
your project leads to get to know the

00:03:17,849 --> 00:03:22,079
community but if you have to miss it or

00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,299
if you didn't understand something

00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:25,769
there's really awesome notes on the alto

00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:28,109
ox blog that you can check out so I

00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:29,699
highly recommend that um just to give

00:03:28,109 --> 00:03:32,760
some highlights because you can go read

00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:34,349
all the notes and the toros blog like

00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,609
there was a Bosch update they're really

00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:38,879
excited about the Bosch day and it's

00:03:35,609 --> 00:03:41,870
coming up in May after the summit last

00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:46,979
day of the summit but they talked about

00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:48,509
things like you no longer need users no

00:03:46,979 --> 00:03:51,479
longer need to specify things like

00:03:48,509 --> 00:03:53,400
static IPS and load balancers and

00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:56,189
networks that's all done now all

00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,810
automated and Bosch they're continuing

00:03:56,189 --> 00:03:58,919
the move from Jenkins the conquerors so

00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:00,959
there's gave a lot of updates on what

00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:02,579
they're doing the logger Gator project

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,859
talked about how they're planning to

00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:07,049
deprecate collector and the legacy

00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:08,579
traffic controller endpoints so if that

00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:09,569
matters to you or you have opinions on

00:04:08,579 --> 00:04:13,470
that you can join it in that

00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:15,299
conversation the Cloud Foundry CLI which

00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:20,150
is actually led from DS from Fujitsu

00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:23,990
they launched multi language um a

00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:26,250
reference guide for multi language

00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:29,160
command-line support

00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:31,770
they also enable the Diego the Diego

00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,660
enabler plug-in they increase in

00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:36,540
performance on Metron by like double

00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:38,640
which is pretty awesome and they're

00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:40,430
close to releasing a new release that

00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:43,980
has a whole bunch of new features in it

00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:45,540
including TCP routes instant quotas and

00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:48,030
a bunch of other things that people from

00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:49,710
the community um have asked for so if

00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:51,720
you ask for something go check out see

00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:53,430
if it's in the release um if you're

00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,840
looking for a new feature look there if

00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:58,440
you have something you want the future

00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:00,810
let them know then they talked about so

00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:02,850
other projects give updates another one

00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:04,470
they give an update is Diego that's led

00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:06,360
by Erik mom from pivotal he's the

00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,770
project lead and they talked about how

00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:12,180
they added like the MySQL database

00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:15,030
support to the BBS component oh one of

00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:17,790
the other groups is looking for early

00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:19,290
bosch Windows testers so if you want to

00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:20,790
use bosch with windows and you are

00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:22,710
willing to help the beta test that would

00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:24,000
be really awesome um so there's a whole

00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:25,860
bunch I mean it's it's several pages

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,110
long of updates the meaning is an hour

00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:29,340
long if you're interested in keeping up

00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:31,229
with the latest in Cloud Foundry

00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:34,400
technical do's like I definitely

00:05:31,229 --> 00:05:36,630
recommend following that meeting the cab

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:40,140
other things that have been happening in

00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:42,150
the Cloud Foundry space um we announced

00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:43,830
a fellowship program so our first fellow

00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:46,229
is Abbey clearance from pivotal is

00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:48,720
joining the Cloud Foundry foundation for

00:05:46,229 --> 00:05:50,580
a year I think it's for a year it's just

00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,600
gonna be helping us with a lot of our

00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:55,710
industry relations she's gonna be

00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,810
setting up all the SIG's the special

00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:59,970
interest groups that make sure that

00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:02,070
company is enjoying quad foundry that

00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:03,419
don't have big teams of software

00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:05,430
developers like maybe there are a

00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:08,010
financial company or maybe their

00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:09,510
automotive company but they also have

00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:11,700
requirements and things they'd like to

00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:14,250
see in our open source cloud foundry

00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:16,220
project and so the SIG's are a way for

00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:18,780
them to get together to agree as a

00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:20,669
industry what the requirements are and

00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:22,260
to talk to others who are trying to use

00:06:20,669 --> 00:06:24,270
cloud foundry and learn from them and

00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:26,220
then we can take those requirements back

00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:27,660
to the project and make sure their needs

00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,130
are met because all of us working on

00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:32,669
Cloud Foundry we want to make sure that

00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:34,740
it solves the needs for all companies

00:06:32,669 --> 00:06:36,150
all industries everywhere everywhere so

00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:38,129
that everyone can develop apps and

00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:40,619
deploy them across multi cloud

00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:42,270
a multi cloud environment efficiently

00:06:40,619 --> 00:06:43,770
and effectively were we're all here

00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:45,119
because at some level we found some

00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:49,229
frustration with that process and we're

00:06:45,119 --> 00:06:51,089
making it better so that was a long

00:06:49,229 --> 00:06:52,679
random explanation to explain that we

00:06:51,089 --> 00:06:54,539
now have fellows and Abi's our first one

00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:56,219
so please welcome Abby and if you are

00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:58,259
interested in doing something similar um

00:06:56,219 --> 00:06:59,369
please come talk to us and be through

00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:00,769
your company in the cloud foundry

00:06:59,369 --> 00:07:03,599
foundation

00:07:00,769 --> 00:07:06,300
speaking of member companies i'm

00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,889
Swisscom announced with ari which i

00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,139
might not be saying that right as a

00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:11,849
customer so there was a feature in our

00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:13,559
blog as well as you know like the

00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:17,490
traditional press releases from their

00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:19,409
blogs but huge customer now using cloud

00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:20,759
foundry so another story that we can

00:07:19,409 --> 00:07:23,159
tell people in the industry to help

00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:24,689
explain how this is beneficial and how

00:07:23,159 --> 00:07:26,490
they can move and give them people to

00:07:24,689 --> 00:07:27,539
talk to if they have you know I don't

00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:31,439
want to talk to someone else who's done

00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:33,089
similar things other big news is how is

00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:34,800
only earlier this week I think it's just

00:07:33,089 --> 00:07:38,039
early err this week was the open stack

00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,839
summit and it got a lot of so we had a

00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:42,059
Cloud Foundry booth at the OpenStack

00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:44,159
summit really awesome we got a lot of

00:07:42,059 --> 00:07:46,649
traffic there was a lot of analysts and

00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:49,379
press meetings if you want to see a

00:07:46,649 --> 00:07:51,599
flavor forward it's like chip Childers

00:07:49,379 --> 00:07:52,979
and Abby Cairns are on the new stack

00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:56,639
podcast so you can go listen to that

00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:58,889
I'll put a link in there and we talked

00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,079
to a number of other analysts and news

00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:03,479
companies and I wanted to say a huge

00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:04,919
thank you to all the volunteers from our

00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:06,860
member companies who helped out at the

00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:10,559
booth I'm just to give you a idea

00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:14,939
quickly like Jason from GE Ronald from

00:08:10,559 --> 00:08:18,119
sousei I'm Edie and Karl from IBM Kevin

00:08:14,939 --> 00:08:21,419
from hazel caste Cote from pivotal role

00:08:18,119 --> 00:08:23,729
from tip code Daniel from VMware Ivan

00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:25,619
from iron IO all of these people that

00:08:23,729 --> 00:08:28,289
came and helped out at the Cloud Foundry

00:08:25,619 --> 00:08:29,849
booth and helped to all the OpenStack

00:08:28,289 --> 00:08:32,849
folks about the Cloud Foundry

00:08:29,849 --> 00:08:34,709
multi-cloud story and was really awesome

00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:37,500
so thank you all very much we could have

00:08:34,709 --> 00:08:38,939
done it without you if you're interested

00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,919
in going to conferences and representing

00:08:38,939 --> 00:08:42,750
Cloud Foundry um Austin's coming up in

00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:44,189
like two to three weeks and we need

00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:46,050
people to help with the booth there um

00:08:44,189 --> 00:08:48,079
so let me know if you'd like to help do

00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:48,079
that

00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:52,900
Oh in the cab call and I think in the

00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:54,430
last I've found a new morning edition I

00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:56,380
talked about how we're doing expert

00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:58,750
certification I'm so Tim Harris is

00:08:56,380 --> 00:09:01,840
working on that and what we're doing is

00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:03,250
creating like the traditional

00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,990
certifications you'd think about what

00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:07,150
someone takes a class and they study and

00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:08,500
they take an exam and then they get a

00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:10,360
label that says you were at Cloud

00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:12,790
Foundry certified developer you're at

00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,680
Cloud Foundry certified operator we're

00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:16,810
working on that and we really need

00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:19,360
people from the community contributors

00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:20,860
to help us out the next step is actually

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,300
called item writing which I should just

00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,830
means you write the questions so I

00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,750
already know what we want to have

00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:28,150
covered in the questions and now we just

00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:29,650
need people to write the questions and

00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:31,780
you're thinking how hard is it to write

00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:33,330
a question don't you know grammar some

00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:35,980
of the questions actually require

00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:37,300
figuring out how you would test that in

00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:39,460
the environment it might actually

00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:41,650
require creating a little sample app

00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:43,180
that they're gonna have to modify and so

00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:46,450
writing questions actually might mean

00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:47,380
writing code as well as the questions so

00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:50,010
if you like to help out with that

00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:52,450
we're looking for volunteers the first

00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:56,050
the first group is actually kicking off

00:09:52,450 --> 00:10:00,250
later today with the workshop and then I

00:09:56,050 --> 00:10:02,170
wanted to let you know about a series of

00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,950
blog posts that I'm writing and I

00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:05,050
thought I'd just give you a little

00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:06,880
preview of the first one I want to write

00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:08,650
a series of blog posts that explain the

00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,770
Cloud Foundry culture because I think we

00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:13,120
have a really unique culture book from a

00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:14,650
corporate perspective and from an

00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,680
open-source perspective so cloud foundry

00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:19,540
is is bringing the best of both worlds

00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,400
and creating a new way of working in a

00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:22,750
new culture and so I want to start

00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:25,390
telling people about that through blog

00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:26,740
posts so if you're interested in helping

00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:28,600
me with that you want to be interviewed

00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:30,280
you have a great quote for me you want

00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,710
to write one of the posts and that would

00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:35,230
be great but the first one that's coming

00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:37,780
out is about how God just like the

00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:39,160
summary about how Cloud Foundry works so

00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:41,920
I talked about how like if you want to

00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:43,210
be a Cloud Foundry contributor first you

00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,460
have to take an exam and you have to

00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:47,440
pass the exam and then you go work in a

00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:49,570
dojo and you spend six weeks and

00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,670
physically in a dojo pair programming

00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:53,830
with someone who's more experienced than

00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:56,440
you talk a little bit about how these

00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:58,089
dojos are sponsored by our member

00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:01,810
companies and exist and our members

00:10:58,089 --> 00:11:03,700
companies work locations so

00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:05,529
you have like a San Francisco one in the

00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:08,680
pivotal office we have a rally one an

00:11:05,529 --> 00:11:11,170
IBM office we have an EMC one in the in

00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:12,850
the Cambridge office so they're all

00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:15,700
around the world in our member companies

00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:18,100
offices and then I talked about how if

00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:19,720
you pass the exam and you go spend your

00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:22,060
six weeks in your dojo kind of what you

00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,950
commit to is spending a year working on

00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:27,130
Cloud Foundry afterwards that one your

00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:29,110
commitment but the test dojo and the

00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:32,320
one-year commitment are high barrier to

00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:34,029
entry but it's a really clear process

00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,650
you get a lot out of it and then the

00:11:34,029 --> 00:11:38,050
project gets at least a year of your

00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:39,580
time hopefully much more if you love it

00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:42,190
I mean that's really unique in this

00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:44,830
world and then the other world of open

00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:46,510
source in the world of corporations too

00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:47,920
don't usually work that way when they

00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:49,779
talk about a little bit about pair

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,339
programming I'm really curious to hear

00:11:49,779 --> 00:11:53,080
more stories from people who actually

00:11:51,339 --> 00:11:54,580
spend the whole day pairing if they'd

00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,620
like to be quoted or like to write about

00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:58,510
it I think especially in the open source

00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:59,980
world that's that's really unique and I

00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:02,080
know we've experimented a little bit

00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:04,390
with remote pairing and I'm curious

00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:06,610
probably unique in the programming world

00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:08,740
so I think I think that's something we

00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:10,150
bring to the table am i talking about

00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:13,300
the monthly cab calls which I already

00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:15,310
talked to all of you about that there's

00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:17,020
project leads that the red maps in the

00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:18,760
backlog and they're talking about how

00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:20,470
you do voting by representation of

00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:22,300
people contributing so companies have

00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:23,440
votes but they have votes based on how

00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:25,600
many people that have working on the

00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,930
project a little bit about the technical

00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,880
advisory board the tab so I just want to

00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:33,160
give like a start telling our story and

00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,900
I'd love for many people to help start

00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,880
telling our story even more than they

00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:38,380
already are so if you'd like to help

00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,690
with that or if you already have a blog

00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:43,000
post that we could help promote our link

00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:43,500
to to help tell the story that would be

00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,970
awesome

00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:48,010
so there was a lot going on I just

00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:49,750
covered a lot of stuff I'm gonna leave

00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:52,570
