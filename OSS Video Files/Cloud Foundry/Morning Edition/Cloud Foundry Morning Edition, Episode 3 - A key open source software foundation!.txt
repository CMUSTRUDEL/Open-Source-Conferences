00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:16,530
to join them it's gonna be around the

00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:17,880
internet-of-things as for news of what's

00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:20,580
happened in the last week I have really

00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:23,970
good news on CIO magazine came out with

00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:25,500
a list of the top top 8 open source

00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,480
software foundations in the world and

00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,760
Cloud Foundry foundation made the list

00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:31,110
and we're in really good company um the

00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,900
rest of the list is projects like the

00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:36,180
Apache foundation the Eclipse Foundation

00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:37,710
Free Software Foundation the software

00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,810
freedom Conservancy which I'm a board

00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:41,300
member of I think I said the lakes

00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:44,010
foundation I need a great list of

00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:45,420
foundations and it was really great to

00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:48,780
see that Cloud Foundry is a relatively

00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:51,900
new comer to the world made the list

00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:55,050
already other great news this this week

00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:56,880
is IBM acquired I'm strong Luke which is

00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:58,920
a node.js project for managing rust

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,050
api's and so that means we have more

00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,909
node.js core developers as part of the

00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:05,430
cloud founders community so welcome to

00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:07,440
all of you if you're watching us other

00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:10,229
news is kind of guarded from Twitter for

00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:11,850
the most part is um was implied that the

00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:14,640
Mercedes like the car Mercedes the

00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:16,170
Mercedes me app they bounced

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,090
new app that launched this week and

00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:20,069
supposedly it runs on Cloud Foundry

00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:22,170
that's really awesome if you have one of

00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:26,010
those cars and use the app you are now

00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:27,480
using a cloud foundry app to see what

00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:29,160
else does this bring spring one

00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,170
conference happened to in Washington DC

00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,540
and there were a lot of cloud foundry

00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:35,130
members there obviously and there was

00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:37,400
also Cloud Foundry training that

00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:40,260
happened before the conference started

00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:42,690
Sergey Alma taught that and I believe he

00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,709
had about 70 people in the room so at 70

00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:46,110
more people that know about Cloud

00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:48,390
Foundry if you're interested in training

00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:49,950
there is training at both of the summits

00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:52,590
cloud finder summit Berlin and cloud

00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:55,230
fund through summit Shanghai a couple of

00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:56,670
our members are putting that together so

00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:58,140
you can sign up for that when you

00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:00,180
register for the conference so maybe

00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:01,560
that is a draw if you or someone you

00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,690
know is looking to learn more about

00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,950
Cloud Foundry and before you start using

00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:06,269
it in your company or maybe your

00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:10,230
company's about to and you want to learn

00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:12,000
more other new someone asked when Diego

00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:14,040
would be generally available I'm so

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,620
Diego is a like a sub-project of Cloud

00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,690
Foundry that focus it's gonna replace

00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:21,840
some of the it's gonna replace like the

00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:23,880
DA plet DEA which always makes me think

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,310
of the drug agency but it really stands

00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,930
for a droplet execution agent and it

00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:30,480
also replaces like part of the health

00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:32,820
manager and some of the cloud controller

00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,860
so that's the Diego project is being

00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:36,180
developed by a number of different

00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:39,660
companies that are all part of the Cloud

00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:42,510
Foundry ecosystem so pivotal IBM cloud

00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:43,860
credo sa P are all working on it

00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:45,750
probably some others that don't know

00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,579
that and it's looking like it'll be in

00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:49,380
the in the you know generally available

00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:50,400
as part of the regular release within

00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:52,980
the next couple of weeks

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,480
according to James Bayer one of the

00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:57,060
pivotal product managers so that's

00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,130
really good news there's a lot of how to

00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:01,049
use that came out this week so there's a

00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:02,730
blog post on Cloud Foundry org about how

00:04:01,049 --> 00:04:04,890
to build on Cloud Foundry so if you

00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:07,799
write a code found your application and

00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:09,079
you want to Bill your users or they want

00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:11,220
to pay you for something

00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:12,450
there's the renowned events and cloud

00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:14,670
prodigy that will help you do that and

00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:16,500
there's a how-to with pointers to more

00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:19,500
documentation on on the Cloud Foundry

00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,820
blog if you want to run docker images on

00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,630
Cloud Foundry I know that's a popular

00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:25,650
project there's also there's also

00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:27,479
documentation that came out this week if

00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:28,690
you can't find it maybe I should attach

00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:30,580
these to the YouTube

00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:33,100
but if you can't find it in the YouTube

00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:35,010
channel or you're more than welcome to

00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:38,020
email me store me at Cloud Foundry dog

00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:41,950
there's also a video for a tutorial on

00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:46,720
on Python and data and Cloud Foundry IBM

00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:48,720
put out an app that does web RTC audio

00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,160
transcription so like it's a take coins

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:54,520
using Twilio and Cloud Foundry

00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:56,110
I'm so glad a lot of really good um good

00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:58,060
how to's and good tools for people

00:04:56,110 --> 00:05:00,580
developing apps so take a look for those

00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:02,800
or follow them if you're interested in

00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:05,380
learning more and then we had a couple

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:08,590
of good quotes and ones I like to see so

00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:11,710
so bad namond and twitter posted that he

00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:14,860
here she heard somebody say that they

00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:17,470
they they saw Cloud Foundry update 200

00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:19,120
production virtual machines in two hours

00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:20,530
something that if it had to do it

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,970
manually would have taken at least a

00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:23,290
week and would have been very

00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:26,880
error-prone so that was really awesome

00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:29,800
to hear and we get a lot of those quotes

00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,360
of people that do things within minutes

00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,160
or hours on Cloud Foundry that would

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,020
have taken them weeks and that's really

00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:38,350
rewarding to the entire project to know

00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:40,570
that we're making it impact and then the

00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:42,190
Cloud Foundry dojo in Cambridge is about

00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:43,450
ready to open if you go to Twitter you

00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:45,550
can actually see pictures of them

00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:46,570
putting the furniture in the room I'm so

00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:49,060
for those of you that don't know what a

00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:50,860
dojo is dojust kind of like a training

00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:52,690
center for Cloud Foundry so Cloud

00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:54,520
Foundry is based on pair programming

00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:55,840
so everything in Cloud Foundry has been

00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,240
developed with two people sitting

00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,890
together and they talked through what

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,210
the software looks like and then they

00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:02,200
talk through the testing you know how

00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:03,580
are we gonna know if it does what it

00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:06,160
does and then they write it all together

00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:07,840
I'm sitting together and sometimes

00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,370
sometimes they're actually literally

00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,440
sitting together and sometimes they're

00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:13,900
there different places in the world but

00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:17,080
they're actually working as a pair at

00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:18,550
the same time and so that's a para

00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,440
programming model and so the Dodos were

00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:21,880
created to help bring people up to speed

00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,590
in the project and provide them with

00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,060
people to pair with I'm so we have a

00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:27,280
number of dojos around the world and

00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:29,470
people commit to go to them for usually

00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,330
six weeks and you go there for six weeks

00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:33,730
and you learn all about Cloud Foundry

00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:35,350
development and you have a you have a

00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:36,910
partner typically you learn about a

00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:38,980
specific part of cloud founder because

00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:41,480
cloud founder is kind of huge and at the

00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:44,870
end of that six weeks you are a

00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:46,970
Foundry contributor and you are now

00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:49,580
ready to pair with another developer and

00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:52,160
actually work on production code so this

00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:54,170
new dojo is opening a Cambridge the EMC

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:58,940
group is sponsoring it so it's really

00:06:54,170 --> 00:07:00,440
awesome and then yeah so that that is

00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:02,390
the major news that I saw this week

00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,890
there's a lot going on if you have

00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:07,130
things that you want me to include in

00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:08,930
future Cod Foundry morning additions

00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:10,280
like if you have meetups or other things

00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:12,350
you want me to call out or talks that

00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:14,810
you've given feel free to email me again

00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:16,940
it's Tommy at Cloud Foundry org and

00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:19,220
don't forget to submit your talk for the

00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:20,840
Berlin and Shanghai summits and if you

00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:22,190
want to help with the documentation that

00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,780
would be really awesome

00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:25,640
the reason we're focusing on getting

00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:28,010
started Docs was because we believe most

00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:29,480
people who use Cloud Foundry start by

00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:31,250
downloading it and playing with it

00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,750
themselves even if they decide to go

00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:36,050
with a provider later so we want to make

00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:37,340
that process super easy so if you know

00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:38,900
