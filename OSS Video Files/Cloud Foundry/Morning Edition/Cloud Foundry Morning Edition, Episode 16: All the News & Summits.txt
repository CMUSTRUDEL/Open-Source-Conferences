00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:15,420

00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:17,730
Foundation good morning and welcome to

00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,260
Cloud Foundry morning edition um I

00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:21,150
always say that there's a lot going on

00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,160
but there really is a lot going on this

00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:25,080
time I've been on the road for the last

00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,869
couple weeks I'm hanging out with Cloud

00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:30,539
Foundry folks and cloud people cloud

00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:32,160
native people around the world um it's a

00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:34,890
couple weeks ago I got to go to the IBM

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,270
dojo launch in Raleigh was great fun

00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:38,100
except getting home so I should have

00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:40,559
just stayed there and for those of you

00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:43,860
that don't know what a dojo is a dojo is

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,840
a physical location where pairs of

00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,579
people that work on Cloud Foundry um can

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,920
come work on Cloud Foundry and quite

00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:51,989
often dojos are word new contributors go

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,780
to pair up with someone more experienced

00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:57,480
to become a Cloud Foundry contributor so

00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,789
IBM dojo lunch was a huge success

00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:02,609
standing-room-only lots of great

00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:04,170
speakers and a good party and the space

00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:07,500
is pretty fun we got to work there that

00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:09,330
day last week or this week this week I

00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,369
went to a collab summit the Linux

00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:12,689
Foundation collaboration summit I think

00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:14,400
it was Bill Weinberger said it was kind

00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:16,320
of like a high school reunion I kind of

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,479
felt like that all of my open source and

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,250
cloud friends were there so it was a

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,229
great fun to hang out with them and we

00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,670
had like eight Cloud Foundry related

00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:26,700
talks from Cloud Foundry foundation

00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:29,040
committers so we had like Kamala Jaime

00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,320
talking about cloud platforms we had

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,250
Colin Humphreys give a talk about like

00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,979
past five years

00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:38,250
I mean he had this slide from The Muppet

00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:41,189
Christmas Carol movie and he put all you

00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:45,000
know faces of Cloud Foundry leaders and

00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:46,770
it was pretty funny chip gave a talk by

00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,020
Karina Vost gave a talk on micro

00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:51,840
services there was a toxin cloud design

00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:54,509
patterns by sharath eat it talked about

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,399
unique a the EMC is working on that cows

00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:57,960
you talked about EMC and what they've

00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,630
learned along their path to be using

00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:03,090
Cloud Foundry

00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:06,479
ABI was on a panel to talk about

00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:08,280
outreach so and say I've had a keynote

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,440
so it was a great representation of

00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,819
Cloud Foundry and not only did all the

00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,440
Cloud Foundry folks get together but we

00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:14,510
also had

00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:17,060
meanings are a lot of beers or

00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:18,140
get-togethers with other cloud of folks

00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:21,860
that we hang out with the kubernetes

00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:24,680
folks the Google cloud folks went to the

00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:25,970
CN CF meeting talked about technologies

00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,980
that might be common that we could use

00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:30,950
all in all it was a really successful

00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:33,350
conference I highly recommend it next

00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:35,720
year for any of you that think it sounds

00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:36,980
like fun it was at a ski resort and we

00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,680
didn't get to go skiing so there was

00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:41,600
kind of a downside there other news that

00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,760
happened there is um I guess he started

00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,560
the week before but Tim Harris's are our

00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,510
newest cloud foundry foundation employee

00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:49,310
he's gonna be focusing on certification

00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:52,400
and he was there and got to meet a whole

00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:54,530
bunch of folks as well talking of

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,910
conferences and the other big news is

00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:57,620
the Cloud Foundry summit which I hope

00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:58,160
you're all planning to attend in Santa

00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:00,770
Clara

00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:02,060
it's like the week of the twenty I was

00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:05,180
fourth exact date so we could like the

00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:06,920
23rd 24th of May and we put out the

00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:08,960
calendar at the schedule this week I

00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:11,330
have a lot of really awesome talks we

00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:12,650
had like several hundred proposals

00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:14,720
submitted and we had to get them all

00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:17,239
down into like a two day two and a half

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,620
day conference so we had to turn down a

00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:20,510
lot of great talks but hopefully they

00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:22,489
show up at meetups and other summits in

00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:24,320
the future but there's a lot of great

00:03:22,489 --> 00:03:25,910
ones there if you want to go see what's

00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,920
there now and a few that are still

00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:29,750
wait-listed as we fill in some slots and

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,430
now we're working on keynotes so I'm

00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:34,850
excited about a couple themes in our

00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:37,070
keynote strategy one of the opening

00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:38,840
keynote is the government of Australia

00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:41,570
who's joining the government of Korea

00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,980
the UK in the US on being a government

00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:44,989
using Cloud Foundry she's totally

00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:46,519
awesome and we also have a couple

00:03:44,989 --> 00:03:48,380
science fiction writers talking again

00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:49,700
last year we had science fiction writers

00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:51,230
and we thought we'd carry that into this

00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,940
year and talk about science fiction

00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:56,120
turns into reality because that's what

00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:59,330
Cloud Foundry is doing and we also have

00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:00,620
a couple of community led events um so

00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:04,310
there's an unconference the day before

00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:06,500
as usual led by Dave and then on the

00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:08,209
Thursday after the Cloud Foundry summit

00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:10,130
well part of the summit but like in the

00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:12,980
separate event is a Cloud Foundry

00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:14,269
technical day focus on Bosch so you can

00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:15,590
you can register for that when you

00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:18,080
register for the summit so I highly

00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:19,760
encourage you to do that there are a lot

00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:21,440
of really awesome Bosch talks i'm

00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,700
submitted to the summit and i know

00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,590
there's a lot more people that want to

00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:26,000
talk so that should be a really

00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:28,639
some agendas while I think they're

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,639
leaving some time for conversations as

00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:33,169
well so it wasn't all conferences wasn't

00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:35,150
all events and we also had some really

00:04:33,169 --> 00:04:37,940
big news happen in the last couple weeks

00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:40,220
so we launched the technical advisory

00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:42,199
board I'm so this is a group of people

00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:43,760
that is going to very technical people

00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:46,729
we're going to focus on the long term

00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:49,610
technical strategy of Condrey which i

00:04:46,729 --> 00:04:51,560
think is really awesome so look to them

00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:53,630
I guess if you have questions or if you

00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,460
want things from them I'll reach out to

00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:57,620
them it's the the all the members are

00:04:55,460 --> 00:05:01,040
posted I'm gonna believe in the blog

00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:04,070
post on on Cloud Foundry I'm speaking so

00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,870
great news there it will work in

00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:07,850
partnership with the project lead so the

00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:10,010
project leads will still set kind of the

00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:11,360
the roadmap in the backlog but the

00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:14,630
technical advisory board sets the long

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,460
term strategy I'm speaking of blog posts

00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:18,169
we've had an awesome set of blog posts

00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:20,270
so thank you all who've submitted them

00:05:18,169 --> 00:05:21,440
and if you if you haven't written a blog

00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:23,120
post yet or if you haven't you have

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,010
another idea if you have or working on

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,479
anything technical anything kind of

00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:27,889
interesting kind of different or you

00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,660
just figure it out how to do something

00:05:27,889 --> 00:05:31,510
that you think at least a hundred other

00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:33,080
people will figure out or you know five

00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:35,030
reach out to me

00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,919
we love our guest blog posts we've

00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:38,510
probably noticed we have 100 day

00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:40,250
challenge from the Japanese Cloud

00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:42,110
Foundry user group which is awesome they

00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:43,700
were like a hundred apps I'm in this

00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:45,080
hundred day challenge and they're

00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,700
translating them into English and

00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:49,099
posting them on the blog little by

00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:50,539
little so a lot of interesting examples

00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:54,080
and things people can learn in that

00:05:50,539 --> 00:05:56,120
series and as well as a lot of other

00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,580
technical blogs there and I wanted to

00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:01,220
mention that we are going to add a

00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:02,990
planet type feature to the Cloud Foundry

00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:05,710
website um so we're gonna start

00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:07,580
aggregating Cloud Foundry related feeds

00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:10,099
from anyone who has a Cloud Foundry

00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:12,380
related a blog um so if you have one of

00:06:10,099 --> 00:06:13,280
those or your company has one and you

00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,930
would like to make sure it gets

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,130
aggregated in the planet which we'll be

00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:20,289
launching in the next couple of weeks

00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:24,560
next week or two please send it my way

00:06:20,289 --> 00:06:27,860
also news was also in the blog was a

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:33,500
VMware announced an open source the the

00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:35,900
photon platform Bosch CPI so the Bosch

00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,529
CPI lets you communicate with underlying

00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:41,939
I as

00:06:37,529 --> 00:06:45,139
and what they did was create create this

00:06:41,939 --> 00:06:47,879
photon platform CPI which lets you

00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:51,179
massively scale it like thousands or

00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:53,129
hundreds of thousands of objects so it's

00:06:51,179 --> 00:06:54,659
just another step in limit making sure

00:06:53,129 --> 00:06:56,549
that the developer can focus their app

00:06:54,659 --> 00:06:58,709
by helping Bosch scale to that that

00:06:56,549 --> 00:07:01,709
level I'm so really awesome technology

00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:03,179
they're good stuff I I also know that

00:07:01,709 --> 00:07:04,859
there's several different projects that

00:07:03,179 --> 00:07:06,569
are being worked on right now that are

00:07:04,859 --> 00:07:08,489
planning to open source by summit

00:07:06,569 --> 00:07:11,639
I'm sorry sure fingers but that happens

00:07:08,489 --> 00:07:13,439
and we get to talk about it there we

00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,879
also have I think since the last time I

00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:15,989
talked to you we've had several new

00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:17,399
members joined the Cloud Foundry

00:07:15,989 --> 00:07:20,339
foundation I think we're up to like

00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:23,189
fifteen nine or something proximity was

00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:26,659
the latest one to join so welcome to
