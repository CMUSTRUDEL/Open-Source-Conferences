welcome to the Cloud Foundry Morning

00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,319
Edition episode 13

00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:08,429

00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:15,210
Foundation good morning and welcome to

00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:19,020
Cod boundary morning edition episode 13

00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:22,140
in the first edition of 2016 before we

00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:24,779
start with 2016 like 2015 was an amazing

00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:27,449
year if you stop and look back so at the

00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:29,820
beginning of the year in January the

00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:31,769
Cloud Foundry foundation was founded the

00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,570
our birthday is unlike a week I think so

00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:34,559
be prepared for that so at the very

00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,840
beginning of the year we actually

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,940
founded the cod funded foundation and by

00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,610
the end of the year there were 53 member

00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:44,520
companies all using and contributing to

00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:47,070
Cod foundry and we have certifications

00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,370
so you can get cloud foundry certified

00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:51,690
cloud foundry from many member companies

00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:54,090
we also saw things like the industrial

00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:56,160
internet projects from GE and Bosch and

00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:58,350
Siemens we saw a number of world

00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,660
governments decide to use cloud foundry

00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:03,930
so like the US government the UK

00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:07,320
government South Korea I think Australia

00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:10,350
are all using cloud foundry so 2016 was

00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,820
a pretty awesome year in 2015 it was a

00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:14,939
pretty awesome year and I'm looking

00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:18,030
forward to 2016 so on that note if you'd

00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:19,979
like to meet everybody in 2016 the call

00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:21,450
for papers for the santa clara summit

00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:23,820
the cloud foundry summit that happens in

00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,869
santa clara is gonna be coming up soon

00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,340

00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:28,979
you'll see that call for papers come

00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:31,200
live i'm so watch for that we're

00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:33,659
expecting about 2,000 people there so

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,549
it's a big big party and a really good

00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:37,470
time to hear what other people are doing

00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:40,369
with cloud foundry share what you're

00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:42,810
doing learn from others learn together

00:01:40,369 --> 00:01:45,030
discuss things so definitely worth going

00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:47,970
to and they'll be training beforehand

00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:50,040
just like we had at the other summons um

00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:53,100
in other news the the cloud foundry

00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:55,740
advisory board met earlier this week and

00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,119
Al Toros took good notes and put them on

00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,500
their blog and it's where all the

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,259
project managers all the Cloud Foundry

00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:03,180
project managers get together and give a

00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:05,369
quick update so if you're interested in

00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:08,099
any of the cloud foundry projects or

00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:09,479
want more technical or more detailed

00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:11,370
updates than you're getting in this

00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,720
podcast those minutes are worth reading

00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,390
every month and there's a link to them

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,670
in the notes too

00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:18,790
and there's things like in and there's

00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:20,800
also heads-up on things that you can

00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:22,510
review and give input on so for example

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,600
there is a proposal for white labeling

00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:27,850
and in the user area and the UAA on the

00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:31,780
mailing list there's also a proposal to

00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:34,870
spin up a CF team to implement the

00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:37,120
persistence proposal then there's news

00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:38,830
like blogger gator is now a separate

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,750
Bosh release so it can be consumed by

00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:44,890
non Cloud Foundry Bosh Bosh instances

00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:46,990
then there's updates about things people

00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:49,420
contributed so like IBM contributed

00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:51,850
translations for the command-line

00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:53,680
interface so they added nine languages

00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:55,959
to the language is supported by the CLI

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,760
which is really awesome and so if you're

00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:59,260
interested in more detailed updates I'll

00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,240
give you the highlights when they come

00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:02,590
up once a month but for sure go check

00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,510
out that document there's a lot more

00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:07,030
detail in there

00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:09,310
there's also maltose is giving two

00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:10,840
webinars this week they might even one

00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:12,910
yesterday so I might be a little late

00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,370
there but they had regularly have

00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:17,140
webinars and I highly recommend them as

00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:18,550
a way to keep up to date with what's

00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:21,130
going on as well if you're looking for

00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:22,110
more information there's also always

00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:27,390
your meetups

00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:29,800
so the lanta meetup is happening and

00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:34,600
they have details on their website I

00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:36,340
think we had a number in the range of 30

00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:39,430
to 40 meetups in December with lots of

00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:42,130
parties we have a couple of events

00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:45,550
coming up at meetups so like the MC dojo

00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:47,610
is launching on Friday January 22nd if

00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:50,410
you want to go to that Meetup it's

00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:53,350
Friday January 22nd from 2:00 to 4:00

00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:55,180
you need to RSVP and they're launching

00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:57,550
their new dojo in Cambridge so pretty

00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:59,440
exciting another place for people to go

00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:01,810
and learn about Cloud Foundry for those

00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:04,269
of you might not know Dodos are a place

00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:06,370
where you can go for like six weeks and

00:04:04,269 --> 00:04:08,920
you get paired up with a more expert

00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:10,510
Cloud Foundry committer and at the end

00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,370
of the six weeks you were up to speed on

00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:14,380
Cloud Foundry and you are hopefully a

00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:16,299
committer so it's a great way to become

00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:18,220
part of the project there isn't the

00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:19,540
assumption that you're gonna be employed

00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,799
or working full time whether you're

00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:23,560
employed or not working full time on

00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:24,910
Cloud Foundry afterwards so you want to

00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,040
check into that if that's something

00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:29,200
you're interested in

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,660
and oh the other meetup I wanted to talk

00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:33,900
about is the meetup that's happening in

00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:37,450
London if you missed the Cloud Foundry

00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:41,440
summits in 2015 the London group has

00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:43,690
invited some of the best speakers and

00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,210
people who attended to come to London

00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:47,560
and do a repeat of their talks they're

00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:48,940
gonna record them so even if you missed

00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,760
the one in event you can still see them

00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:52,600
and that's gonna be on February 11th it

00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,480
sounds really exciting

00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:58,720
so don't miss that one and then there's

00:04:55,480 --> 00:05:02,350
an IBM dojo that's kicking off soon I

00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:04,860
just seen tweets and pictures but by

put that link in there I am going to

00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:20,470

00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:22,180
about cloud foundry there if you were

00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:23,680

00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:25,960
about cloud foundry there are two

00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,600
mailing lists you should know about one

00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:31,090
is CF speakers and one is CF meetup

00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:38,920
or if you're working in your talk and
