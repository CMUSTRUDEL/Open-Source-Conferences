20 my name is stormy Peters I'm VP of

00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:11,099
the developer relations at the Cloud

00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,330
Foundry Foundation I'm joined today by

00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:14,160
some of my fellow Cloud Foundry

00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:16,529
ambassadors and we'll have them

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,800
introduce themselves hi I'm Dan young

00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:23,279
engineer pizza relatively need a bunch

00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:27,630
of consultancy in the UK hey this is max

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:30,449
from IBM and I do a bunch of different

00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:36,660
things but mostly I work with different

00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:38,610
scenes hi my name is Joanna Chester with

00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,260
IBM I'm a program director of open

00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:42,510
technologies so I get to work on fun

00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:46,680
things like Cloud Foundry and OpenStack

00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:48,719
and all kinds of cool technologies well

00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,329
thanks for joining me Dan Joanna and dr.

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,100
max our goal here with the podcast is to

00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:54,960
bring you the news from the week so that

00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,190
you can find it keep up-to-date with

00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,739
what's happening in the cloud foundry

00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,940
the world I'm so dr. max we had a cab

00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:01,649
call this week you want to tell us just

00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:06,000
briefly what the cab call is and what

00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:10,110
happened yeah so thanks Tony I think

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,320
this is the you could say a community

00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:15,780
advisory board call that's what the cab

00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:19,820
stands for but mostly it's a it's an

00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:22,350
opportunity for people in everybody

00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:26,310
who's interested in a foundry obviously

00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:29,220
the community to call in and not only

00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:34,380
discuss and present anything that they

00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:37,950
have but also to get first-hand I guess

00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:40,380
Q&A with the p.m. so what we end up

00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:44,729
doing in those calls is we get the virus

00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:46,470
PMS of product managers around Cloud

00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:49,470
Foundry and this is not just one

00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:52,860
particular company every company so the

00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:56,759
PM's over and they are they are to

00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:58,979
pretty much answer questions present you

00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:03,990
know announce anything that's new that's

00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:08,849
interesting if your feedback give you

00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:11,099
feedback and so on so this this month so

00:02:08,849 --> 00:02:12,280
we do it once a month it typically

00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:14,980
happens I think

00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:18,700
second week of the month on Wednesday at

00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:20,110
8 a.m. Pacific time obviously this is

00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:24,160
not necessarily a good time for

00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:26,880
everybody around the world but it seems

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:30,220
to be a good time for different

00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:32,980
geographies I've worked with China I

00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:34,840
work with China every day and I know 8

00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:37,540
a.m. is ok for them because it's since

00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:40,209
the end of their day so you look at you

00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:43,989
up it's also a little bit challenging

00:02:40,209 --> 00:02:46,480
but it's it's not like 1 a.m. so I think

00:02:43,989 --> 00:02:48,480
that that's like that time slot works

00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:52,209
well and what ends up happening is we

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:54,880
kind of we used to do sort of status

00:02:52,209 --> 00:02:58,510
update but now it's mostly Q&A is we use

00:02:54,880 --> 00:03:00,850
a stock channel a lot to to exchange

00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:03,100
questions to make announcements each one

00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:04,690
so if you if you miss this one you can

00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,580
actually go to the stock channel and

00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:09,250
kind of go back and see some of the

00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:11,830
discussion that was happening but what's

00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:13,209
maybe one of them it's one of the baby

00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:16,480
that one of the highlights that happened

00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:23,260
at this one turn sure I think this time

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:27,640
amid Gupta who is the PM for I guess

00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:31,720
release integration mentioned a bunch of

00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:33,970
different components of the release that

00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:36,820
were extracted as Bosch releases so it's

00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:40,239
just for the layman person that's new to

00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:43,680
laundry this group release integration

00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:46,959
was tasked to do a better job of

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,269
breaking down on the skip release into

00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,640
smaller components that are more

00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:55,440
manageable so that you will be able to

00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:59,350
swap in swap out different components as

00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:00,609
quote unquote Bosch releases and they've

00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:03,040
made some progress and they've announced

00:04:00,609 --> 00:04:07,329
you know some of those that they've done

00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:08,739
I think you know certainly console

00:04:07,329 --> 00:04:11,430
release is one of them but probably the

00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:14,380
major one that they did recently was

00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:16,959
Postgres so if you use Postgres as your

00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:20,500
database there is now the beginning of a

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:23,200
release for that they also of course do

00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:26,210
creating bosch releases can be

00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:29,660
complicated depending on the software

00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:32,210
to doing and they do a good job of

00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:33,919
making sure that this is done the other

00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:37,250
thing that they are tasked to do which

00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:41,419
emit discussed is the fact that they are

00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:45,889
trying to get initial manifests for

00:04:41,419 --> 00:04:48,580
different clouds so if you're trying to

00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:52,039
get a foundry into a particular cloud

00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:56,660
journey AWS has always been sort of the

00:04:52,039 --> 00:05:00,080
cloud that most teams in a foundry used

00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:02,780
to test and therefore manifest for that

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:06,169
cloud is is very well available but

00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:07,550
there's increasingly support for

00:05:06,169 --> 00:05:09,199
different clouds and that's gonna come

00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:11,030
straight from them in terms of an

00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,910
initial manifest that you can use and

00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:15,289
multiply and this is this is I think

00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:18,229
it's big I mean for us

00:05:15,289 --> 00:05:20,509
IBM for instance we we support you know

00:05:18,229 --> 00:05:22,610
different clouds but software is our

00:05:20,509 --> 00:05:24,770
main cloud and we do the CPI we do

00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:26,630
everything so people come to us and we

00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:29,780
tell them hey this is how you do it but

00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:32,330
I think having it having not just you

00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:34,310
know AWS but software and Google cloud

00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:37,610
and all of the different other clouds

00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:42,320
upon which supports come from a team

00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:44,780
that is tasked to at least test some of

00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:48,349
them some I mean some aspect of Cloud

00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:51,500
Foundry into this cloud and then you

00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:54,800
know have a central place for tooling is

00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:57,740
there any great it's gonna save a lot of

00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,330
people's time I I'm hoping really

00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:02,090
important as part of the whole multi

00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:03,560
crowd push that it supports we're seeing

00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:06,590
a lot more cloud supported a lot more

00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:08,930
users using multiple clouds so yeah

00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:12,469
absolutely I mean it's it this this is

00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:14,120
oh you'll be I don't think it's the I

00:06:12,469 --> 00:06:16,969
mean I'm a bit biased because that's

00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:19,669
what I do I help the Bloch team and so

00:06:16,969 --> 00:06:21,860
on I think it's arguably the best the

00:06:19,669 --> 00:06:23,599
most important aspect of foundry when

00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:26,060
you compare it with the rest in addition

00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:29,240
to doing everything else that or the

00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:31,669
past do we also do this which is work a

00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:33,830
quest different clouds and we do it

00:06:31,669 --> 00:06:38,349
pretty much like that's unaccounted it

00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:41,349
was over 10 so that was that was that I

00:06:38,349 --> 00:06:41,349
think

00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:49,250
Eric was there too Eric is the p.m. for

00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:50,719
Segal and he did mention some of the

00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:55,550
progress that they've done in Diego in

00:06:50,719 --> 00:06:58,129
terms of not only supporting I mean

00:06:55,550 --> 00:07:02,210
they're doing some performance testing

00:06:58,129 --> 00:07:04,580
but also I think you know there was

00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:06,219
they've always been questioned every cab

00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:09,860
for the past three months

00:07:06,219 --> 00:07:11,810
what is the end of life of da and things

00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:15,919
like this and I think they discussed

00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:19,069
that it was fair to mention that

00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:21,529
essentially end of the year was kind of

00:07:19,069 --> 00:07:23,539
the target that people were and so

00:07:21,529 --> 00:07:25,819
people are interested in and finding out

00:07:23,539 --> 00:07:27,529
what happened and and following along

00:07:25,819 --> 00:07:28,610
they can come to the call and you said

00:07:27,529 --> 00:07:30,289
they could also should they go to the

00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:33,319
agenda or to the slack channel or worse

00:07:30,289 --> 00:07:35,810
they go to find no it's limits right I

00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:37,219
would say I mean I think it's gonna be

00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:38,120
you know you could listen to something

00:07:37,219 --> 00:07:39,889
like this

00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:42,620
like a podcast like this and get a

00:07:39,889 --> 00:07:44,839
feedback and get sort of one person's

00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:46,129
opinion on what happened but I really

00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:49,339
would encourage people to just join

00:07:46,129 --> 00:07:52,009
right I mean we do this every month you

00:07:49,339 --> 00:07:54,529
know if you have question you know email

00:07:52,009 --> 00:07:56,930
the list or you know store me or anybody

00:07:54,529 --> 00:07:59,210
in the community or me and we'll let you

00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:01,759
know when the next one is we always

00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:03,289
announce it and come in and join because

00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,060
there's a lot of people that come and

00:08:03,289 --> 00:08:07,250
babysit but certainly if you have

00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:09,830
questions you can and then I saw me

00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:13,479
saying you can always go back to the

00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:17,029
slack Channel and kind of read backwards

00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:19,069
from the last comment and see kind of

00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:20,629
the discussion that was happening and

00:08:19,069 --> 00:08:24,860
then of course you'll reach a time where

00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:26,449
you know be the previous one so yeah so

00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:28,849
that's that was maybe two highlights

00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:31,400
there's a lot more that happens but

00:08:28,849 --> 00:08:32,719
those were the highlights well thanks

00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,930
dr. max and thanks for running them

00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:39,169
every month too so everybody you can you

00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:41,329
can join them um so the community calls

00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:43,459
a cab cause a great place to get updates

00:08:41,329 --> 00:08:45,050
um the other meetings that happen

00:08:43,459 --> 00:08:46,970
regularly that are a good time to follow

00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:48,920
along it's a good thing about the cab

00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:51,360
cause you it's open for anyone to ask

00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:53,130
the the PM's questions

00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,390
the PM's themselves also have a meeting

00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:56,910
where they get together and talk about

00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:58,110
what they've done in the last couple

00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:00,000
weeks and what they're gonna work on

00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:02,820
next in the roadmap and those are called

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,769
the PMC meetings so the PMC run time

00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:06,810
meeting met in this past week and

00:09:04,769 --> 00:09:08,130
there's a link in the notes you can go

00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:10,440
see everything they talked about they

00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:12,510
talked about which tasks they worked on

00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,070
and which ones are next but one of the

00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:16,050
main things I think is important to

00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:18,930
point out is that there's an end a

00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:21,540
lifetime line for the the DEA back-end

00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:23,370
so the DEA DEA a back end is going away

00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:24,750
and there's no timeline for when that's

00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:26,670
gonna happen so it's probably important

00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:29,430
for a lot of people but there's also

00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:31,170
updates from the run time the run time

00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:33,269
PMC meeting actually covers a lot of the

00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:34,800
sub components of cloud foundry and so

00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:36,450
there's updates from the CLI team from

00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,850
the garden team the Diego team the

00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:40,230
routing team so it's a great place if

00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:43,529
you want to know what's coming

00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:45,269
technically to go follow along another

00:09:43,529 --> 00:09:46,680
great place to get updates on what's

00:09:45,269 --> 00:09:48,660
going on in the project is the mailing

00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:50,970
list and I think in particular this yep

00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,990
mailing list is really good dan do you

00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:54,600
want to give us an update on what

00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:56,310
happened there in the past week sure so

00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,100
yes a few things I picked up on I think

00:09:56,310 --> 00:10:02,640
max just mentioned one or two of them so

00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:05,100
I saw that the steer release release had

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,420
been sort of exploded a little bit and

00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,070
there was a couple of releases spinning

00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:10,290
out that so there's one for Postgres and

00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:13,199
there's one for Nats as well so how many

00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:16,529
announced those and and there was also

00:10:13,199 --> 00:10:19,740
some news service brokers contributed to

00:10:16,529 --> 00:10:22,529
the CF community hub organization so I

00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:25,050
think it was 1 2 s 3 and 1 for

00:10:22,529 --> 00:10:28,589
ElastiCache as well there's 2 a diverse

00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:31,980
services and they were written Roy and

00:10:28,589 --> 00:10:35,970
silver GPA and I think it is attributed

00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:38,220
accurately and there was also an

00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:40,649
announcement about the build packs PN

00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:42,600
changing which i think is quite a major

00:10:40,649 --> 00:10:45,420
event because is a very intensive roll

00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:48,029
and Danny Rosen's been doing that for a

00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:51,510
while but it's now that's the hand being

00:10:48,029 --> 00:10:54,060
handed over to Steven Levine who I

00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:57,060
believe worked on latticed previously

00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:59,730
and he's also has worked on the PCF dev

00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:01,770
team as well I think that's correct so

00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:03,600
those are sort of main things that I

00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:06,120
picked up on the mailing list and

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,740
and it also noticed fairly recently and

00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,330
this was because I was working with a

00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:12,030
customer we're doing the last up with

00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:15,300
concourse that and you can you can now

00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:17,940
use docker compose to get concourse up

00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:20,520
and running very quickly so previously a

00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:22,050
full version 1.6 you could use the

00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:25,620
vagrant box to get things running

00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:27,600
locally and then you could run a boss a

00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:29,430
botched employment if you wanted to if

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,950
you wanted to requester things and in a

00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:37,400
cloud and you now have the option of

00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:40,980
using docker auditory and actually

00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:43,680
running a concourse cluster purely in dr

00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:45,780
using dot composer this this is really

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,070
helpful for working in teams where you

00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:50,280
want to get up and running quickly go

00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:52,890
through and i'm really looking forward

00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:54,870
to the sort of more team-based and

00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:56,760
multi-tenancy features of concourse

00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:58,740
because having worked with it in

00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:01,200
enterprise environments now it's it's

00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:02,580
something we really need is oK you've

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,570
got one team up and running with common

00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,950
course but what happens with the next

00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:08,730
team and the next team in the next team

00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:13,290
so looking forward to seeing that

00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:15,060
product develop and really so excited

00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:17,820
about it because it's a lot of embossing

00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:19,710
and cloud foundry itself it's all formed

00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:21,570
a triangle of stuff that that really

00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:28,950
changes the way you can get things done

00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:30,480
so that's great yeah and we haven't

00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:32,390
announced it yet but engineer better is

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,920
going to be joining the foundation so

00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:37,050
yeah we're we're really excited about

00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:40,140
that and we're working with Scott on on

00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:41,850
sorting the membership out can expect a

00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:48,090
formal announcement hopefully quite soon

00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:50,190
so yeah that's big news for us it's

00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:51,810
great to see the ecosystem grow and see

00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:53,730
the Cloud Foundry foundation have more

00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:55,830
more types different types of companies

00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:58,110
involved and participating in the future

00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:59,460
of Cloud Foundry yeah yeah I'm looking

00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:01,350
forward to seeing and what the names

00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:04,500
appear quite soon as well if had some

00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:07,040
rumors about some big ones so yeah

00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,040
what's that

00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:14,360
I almost announced one last week that I

00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:14,360
wasn't supposed to so I'm glad I didn't

00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:20,760
all right well thanks tin and welcome to

00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:24,330
the foundation look forward to the noun

00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:26,610
sment thanks um so we usually cover

00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:28,500
events here and join I think you have

00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:29,910
been involved with with the Cloud

00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,640
Foundry days and a few events that are

00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:33,990
coming up you want tell us about them

00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:35,490
yeah I wanted to talk about these cloud

00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:36,810
foundry days because they're they're

00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:38,220
very really pretty cool I think the

00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:41,279
foundation has been creative about how

00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:43,560
to spread awareness in Asia so last year

00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:45,720
we had the Cloud Foundry summit in Asia

00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:47,670
last December and that was great to get

00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:50,190
and get an audience there to start

00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:52,680
building the awareness but that's hard

00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:53,940
because it's a huge continent to meet

00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,700
you trying to deck well right and a lot

00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:57,870
of people want to communicate with so

00:13:55,700 --> 00:14:00,120
what they've decided to do is take this

00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:01,800
approach of cloud 100 days well have the

00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:04,200
club under somewhat of course in

00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:06,300
September but in in the fourth quarter

00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:09,120
of the year we'll have 500 days and what

00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:11,670
this allows us to do is have these mega

00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,920
meetup structure days where you can run

00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:15,810
it in about a day the audience is

00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,790
smaller than a summit it's bigger than a

00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:20,399
meet-up we call the mega meet up

00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:22,410
sometimes and it allows us to get into a

00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,600
lot of different cities and not just one

00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:26,610
so we can touch so many more people so

00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,140
I'm gonna go through these these will be

00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:31,250
them in those as well but in case you

00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:33,540
want to jot these down in timeline order

00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:36,360
we're gonna have a clap on dirty day and

00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:39,329
Sydney and Melbourne and let's see

00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:41,790
October 18th to the 20th and then we're

00:14:39,329 --> 00:14:44,490
gonna go on up to 500 days Shanghai

00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:47,850
that'll be October 25th we'll have a day

00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:50,220
in Beijing that's October 27th Cloud

00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:52,350
Foundry day in Tokyo is scheduled for

00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:53,880
the week of November 6 so that they stay

00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:55,800
tuned to still that to me determined

00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:58,050
we're also planning a day in Hong Kong

00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:00,510
that'll be also the week of November 6

00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:02,459
so we have to finalize that and then

00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:04,470
we're also looking at Bangalore and

00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:06,570
that's a date to be determined and I've

00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:10,110
heard some other cities like Shenzhen

00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:11,820
China been mentioned as well and again

00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:13,470
this is just a great way to reach these

00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,880
communities in Asia reach a lot of

00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:17,430
different cities a lot more people

00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,110
they're a little easier to put on than a

00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:20,670
full-scale summit and we're putting

00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:23,130
these on because of the sponsors

00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:27,000
sponsors like IBM are gonna step up and

00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:27,900
run a day in Asia and to help these roll

00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,300
out throughout the

00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:32,940
fourth quarters so really excited about

00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:34,980
that approach awesome that sounds really

00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:38,700
exciting and so these these events are

00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:41,310
for local local community but if I if

00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:44,070
I'm a Cloud Foundry community member

00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:45,030
from somewhere else can I attend yeah I

00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:46,740
mean that's the beautiful thing about

00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:48,210
meetups as they're just open to

00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:50,280
everybody we want to reach people

00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:53,100
whether they use income or not and to

00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:55,550
help share the the wonderfulness of

00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:59,640
Cloud Foundry so yeah open to all

00:15:55,550 --> 00:16:00,750
awesome thanks Jenna yeah and then I

00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,370
think you you wanted to talk a little

00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:04,950
bit about what's the Condors summit's

00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:08,930
coming up really soon in Europe so this

00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:08,930
is September which is like next month

00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:19,410
yeah mainly one of the main things is

00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:21,510
there's gonna be a lot of training

00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:24,660
happening on the first day as as always

00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:27,090
I think there's four different courses

00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:31,290
you can choose from before Frankfurt on

00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:34,020
Monday so they'll be a beginner's hero

00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:37,020
to zero course I think there's a micro

00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:39,840
services architecture course and a kind

00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:42,480
of Bosch in everything else course I

00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:46,080
also just so I think that Apogee of

00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:49,370
running something around API first

00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:52,620
development for different courses

00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:54,810
engineer better running the beginners

00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:56,190
course any ions are involved and also I

00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:58,140
think pillars are doing some of the

00:16:56,190 --> 00:17:02,820
training as well so it's a collaborative

00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:04,530
effort to get people trained up and yeah

00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:08,339
you should check out the training page

00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:10,650
on the summit page to find out more and

00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:12,510
if anyone is interested in taking one of

00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:15,200
those training classes I highly

00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:17,760
recommend that you go sign up now

00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:20,010
they've sold out at every summit we've

00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:22,410
had and in China I actually got to play

00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:23,940
bouncer and try to get people out of the

00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:26,910
room that had come in who had not signed

00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:32,060
up so if you're interested in sign up

00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:34,740
now and also at the Cloud Foundry summit

00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:36,330
we're talking about having a hack day

00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:37,590
the Monday before so at the same time as

00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:38,790
the training if you're not going to the

00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:41,160
classes

00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:42,990
because you're probably already cut find

00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:45,180
a contributor or you didn't sign up in

00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:48,990
time you can come hack with us in the

00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:50,520
open space and we'll have experts on

00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:52,170
hand and you can work on any project

00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:54,000
you've been working on or you can start

00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:55,740
a new project I know some people from

00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,240
the containers team will be there I'm

00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:58,350
probably some people from llego team so

00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,880
if you're innocent helping with that I'm

00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:02,760
still looking for volunteers at this

00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:05,040
point and then I think there's also

00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:10,200
another event coming up soon

00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:11,670
dan yeah there's some I was recently

00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:14,250
found that there was gonna be an open

00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:15,840
stack day in the UK which is obviously

00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:17,220
always an interest to anyone using cloud

00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,470
foundry because there's quite a lot of

00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:24,900
them close links between those two

00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:27,000
worlds so yeah I've been invited I've

00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:28,700
been asked to speak at open start day in

00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,660
the UK which which is gonna be great so

00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:33,180
that's so she gave me in Bristol which

00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:36,530
is my hometown and it's being hosted at

00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:40,350
HP Labs and HP obviously a big

00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:41,850
contributor so with their engineering

00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:43,500
teams for OpenStack are based in Bristol

00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:47,640
in the UK and that they're hosting open

00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:49,410
state so there's I think it's kind of

00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:51,120
all the URLs rent your a list but if you

00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:53,720
search for it at UK you can get the

00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:57,330
designer page and registration for that

00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:59,340
and it's on the 15th of September so

00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:04,050
anybody in the UK I'd recommend that you

00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:06,060
go along that's coming up soon they're

00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:08,340

00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,990
