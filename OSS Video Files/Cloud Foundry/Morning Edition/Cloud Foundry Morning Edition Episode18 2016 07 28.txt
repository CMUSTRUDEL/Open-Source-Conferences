foundry Morning Edition is brought to

00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,779
you by the Cloud Foundry ambassadors so

00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:26,220
I'm gonna have them introduce themselves

00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:30,390
here hi I'm mark Carlson I'm the CTO at

00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:36,989
ECS team out of Denver Colorado my name

00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:38,399
is jeff Hobbs I'm a director of

00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:40,320
engineering at Hewlett Packard

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:45,180
Enterprise focused on cloud foundry

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:49,320
efforts I'm Luke wood jock an

00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:51,510
engineering director from EMC awesome

00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,949
welcome Condor ambassadors so with that

00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,780
we're gonna jump right into the news and

00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:57,390
this will be a weekly occurrence and

00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:00,570
you'll see these faces and other faces

00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:02,640
on the cloud foundry Morning Edition so

00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:04,680
we have some new members in the

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,460
foundation mark you want tell us bottom

00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:10,409
yes this month we've seen Cisco upgrade

00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:13,080
their long time membership to the

00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:14,520
Platinum level and basically increasing

00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,549
their stake and their commitment to

00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:21,240
Cloud Foundry as the foundation of many

00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:23,520
of their key cloud offerings also we

00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:26,729
have a new silver member Steve Greenberg

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:30,000
and resilient scale resilient scale is

00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:32,280
the name of the cloud native consultancy

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,509
that he's created and you can learn more

00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:38,610
about what they do at our scale dot IO

00:01:35,509 --> 00:01:39,840
and they love seeing startup startup in

00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:41,460
the space because usually the more

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,409
startups you have in a technology space

00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,720
the healthier it's getting so we have

00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:48,090
lots of really large enterprises which

00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,829
is terrific and a lot of support and if

00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:51,689
we start to see small companies also

00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:56,420
startup it means things are growing

00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:56,420
across the ecosystem actually awesome D

00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:01,890
so we also have technical stuff

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:08,350
happening like I've heard about Bosch -

00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:10,420
oh yeah so Bosch 2.0 is gaining momentum

00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:13,570
I think was one of the biggest changes

00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:17,370
there is the move to the cloud config

00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:20,380
section in the new box to do manifests

00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:23,170
Alexander gave an awesome talk at CF

00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:25,990
summit about about Bosch - oh and the

00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:30,880
evolution of it you can check that out I

00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:34,060
think on YouTube and that's about it

00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:37,300
there's some great Doc's out there under

00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:40,360
the BAS homepage that talk about the

00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:42,400
manifest v2 so you're just google for

00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:45,310
that then you should get some details of

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,710
how to how to work that how to work that

00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:52,450
out in your manifest but cool stuff and

00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:54,340
and good evolution of that tool you know

00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:56,050
all the summit talks are on on YouTube

00:02:54,340 --> 00:03:00,700
so if you missed any or couldn't attend

00:02:56,050 --> 00:03:02,770
three at once you got plenty of one so

00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:04,870
there's also some technical updates in

00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:06,760
the Capcom it just happened last week I

00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:10,500
think um Luke you want to cover that for

00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:13,240
us sure so the big news there is that

00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:15,580
Diego and garden were moved out of the

00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:22,120
Cloud Foundry incubator into cloud

00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:24,880
foundry org on yeah also associated with

00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,800
that is there's a mirror a repository

00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:30,310
mirror in front of github called code

00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:35,100
Cloud Foundry org so if you're importing

00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:38,170
those make sure to adjust your imports

00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:40,330
we're working on the DEA warden end of

00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:41,890
life there should be an announcement

00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:45,070
that comes out at some point in time

00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:50,280
soon so time to transition to Diego's

00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:54,460
now or do it very soon Diego officially

00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:56,760
supports relational data stores and then

00:03:54,460 --> 00:04:01,180
the percy effort which is a bringing

00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:03,220
persistence to diego has been in close

00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:07,680
contact with docker as they're using the

00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:11,830
docker volume plugins as the api and so

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:15,400
we're working with docker to shape that

00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:17,979
plugin i'm also another effort underway

00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:20,739
is container networking they've

00:04:17,979 --> 00:04:22,180
completed the basic forwarding over

00:04:20,739 --> 00:04:24,400
overlay networking

00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:28,830
an enforcement of a policies a simple

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:31,539
policy for containers on the same cell

00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:34,810
abacus product is now deployed and on

00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:37,240
all bluemix environments and the last

00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:42,759
piece of news here is that a Diego is

00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:45,190
going to be moving away from MCD awesome

00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:47,259
thanks look I think there's a trend the

00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:49,419
several the projects are moving from at

00:04:47,259 --> 00:04:51,310
CD but not some of them are gonna

00:04:49,419 --> 00:04:58,539
continue to use it I think logger Gator

00:04:51,310 --> 00:05:01,960
if I remember right um yeah awesome

00:04:58,539 --> 00:05:04,780
Thank You Luke the cab call is open to

00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,500
to everyone so if it's once a month I

00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:07,660
think for an hour

00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,580
um if anyone wants to hear directly from

00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:12,729
the project leads but if not we will

00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:14,169
give you the summary here it's don't

00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:16,030
know one thing to point out is that the

00:05:14,169 --> 00:05:17,919
Cloud Foundry organizations the

00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:20,889
foundation slack channel you can reach

00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:23,530
it slack Cloud Foundry dot org

00:05:20,889 --> 00:05:26,229
low RG and there's a channel within that

00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:28,570
slack account for the cab calls itself

00:05:26,229 --> 00:05:30,430
so you can announce your participation

00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:32,349
there and ask questions there and it's

00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:37,360
pretty good way to want to jump in and

00:05:32,349 --> 00:05:39,099
participate awesome good point and the

00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,169
one thing we'd like to do more of in the

00:05:39,099 --> 00:05:44,139
future is bring you trends that we see

00:05:41,169 --> 00:05:46,389
in the world um one of the big trends as

00:05:44,139 --> 00:05:49,240
multi clouds I'm mark you want to talk

00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:52,120
to that yeah just take a second you know

00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:54,430
in our projects out in large companies

00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:56,050
that are implementing Cloud Foundry you

00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:57,970
know in the early part you know over a

00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:01,360
year ago we saw most of those started

00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:03,880
out as as on-prem on various on-premises

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:07,240
infrastructure as a service offerings

00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:09,699
OpenStack and and vSphere but what we've

00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:11,889
seen kind of in the last three to six

00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:13,659
months is a move to you know in that

00:06:11,889 --> 00:06:16,479
time if a lot of times they would shift

00:06:13,659 --> 00:06:18,130
and also have a secondary implementation

00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,409
on a public cloud and that public cloud

00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:23,949
was almost always Amazon you know a year

00:06:20,409 --> 00:06:25,840
ago or so what we're seeing now is large

00:06:23,949 --> 00:06:28,060
companies beginning to do their

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,830
secondary or sometimes even their

00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:33,700
primary implementation of Cloud Foundry

00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:35,410
on Azure or on even Google compute which

00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,850
is you know relatively new to

00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:38,050
enterprise focus anyway there's

00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:40,720
certainly been around for a while but

00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:41,680
their enterprise focus is new and so you

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,970
know that's one of the things that I've

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,650
been writing about and thinking about a

00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:47,740
little bit is just how hard is it to

00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:49,420
build an application that's multi-cloud

00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:53,050
if you're going to go put that app

00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:54,520
directly into a public cloud offering

00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:56,620
and that's one of the the value props so

00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,660
I think Cloud Foundry offers is you know

00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:01,270
the ability to build your app on top of

00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:04,840
an abstraction layer and then let cloud

00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:06,910
founder ease you know CPI or other

00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:09,280
abstraction capability if you're not

00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:11,560
before me blush insulate you from the

00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,000
underlying api's of the cloud provider

00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,860
so that's you know that's just a

00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,500
movement in very large customers that

00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:19,360
we're seeing and and I think overall the

00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:21,280
Foundation's kind of well positioned in

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,910
Cloud Foundry is well positioned to

00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:27,010
capitalize on that until you're seeing

00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:29,410
people move to different public clouds

00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:32,920
and you multiple public cuts in addition

00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:34,540
to having something on prim yeah and I

00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:36,160
think the difference is and we you know

00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:37,990
we saw that most of it started with

00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,570
on-prem and then very quickly they might

00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:42,550
adopt Amazon Web Services a year ago I

00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:47,050
think what we're seeing now is that that

00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:48,940
secondary is is often Azure and we've

00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:52,170
even seen some very large customers

00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:56,530
begin to deploy on Google cloud platform

00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:58,450
awesome it's great to see cloud foundry

00:07:56,530 --> 00:08:00,670
work well across all of those those

00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:02,620
ecosystems all of us infrastructures

00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:04,300
yeah yeah there's still a lot of work to

00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:06,970
be done but I must rather be doing work

00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:13,540
to tune a CPI than build my own from

00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:15,160
scratch yep and so thanks for for being

00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:16,570
that things like cloud is a huge trend

00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:18,490
as other seed trends

00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:21,970
um feel free to send them to us or to

00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:23,680
join us on one column Jeff the

00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:26,020
foundation recently put out a container

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,750
report did you did you take a look at

00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:32,950
that indeed I did

00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:35,700
yes the the foundation engaged a company

00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:39,219
to basically do the first multinational

00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:40,870
review on opinion survey mmm where

00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:43,570
trends are going really around

00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:45,550
containers and it came up with you know

00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:48,160
a lot of good information and I think

00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:49,100
the first you know the the scale of the

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,500
survey itself

00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:53,089
was really nice and that respondents

00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:56,889
were screened so that you were getting

00:08:53,089 --> 00:08:59,600
core IT decision makers and influencers

00:08:56,889 --> 00:09:01,100
in companies that were minimum of 100

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,889
employees and people that had been

00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:07,790
minimum of 2 years an IT so they were

00:09:03,889 --> 00:09:10,730
really focus and size and got a good

00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:16,329
cross-section of those in the know

00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:18,500
driving their their internal work and

00:09:16,329 --> 00:09:20,420
additionally it was actually very evenly

00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:23,269
divided between North America Europe and

00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:27,380
Asia for almost 1/3 each so it is a very

00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:30,649
global survey and it showed that you

00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:32,329
know mostly for more than 50% it's using

00:09:30,649 --> 00:09:35,139
containers for application development

00:09:32,329 --> 00:09:38,779
then there's the the various breakdown

00:09:35,139 --> 00:09:42,790
in there and from the benefits people

00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:45,889
mostly see isolation as the the key one

00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:47,600
version control in consistent

00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:51,550
environments and you know lightweight

00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:56,930
small footprint also were highly rated

00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:58,399
but the key worries that growed with the

00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:01,279
grew with the increased container

00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:05,060
adoption were basically managing these

00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:06,410
containers at scale and if the half of

00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:08,860
the respondents said container

00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:12,350
management is very important followed by

00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:15,350
monitoring of them so there's a lot more

00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:18,439
detail in the report please go over to

00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:19,819
the Cloud Foundry blog in the community

00:10:18,439 --> 00:10:23,089
blog you'll find it there it was

00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:26,170
released in mid-june and titles of hope

00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:28,880
versus reality containers in 2016

00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:30,529
awesome thanks Jeff was it was a good

00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,750
read I thought what was interesting too

00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:34,639
is that most people wanted to use

00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:37,339
containers but not everybody had figured

00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:38,839
out how to do it yet so hopefully all of

00:10:37,339 --> 00:10:41,000
our work on Cloud Foundry helps them

00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:42,439
deploy and manage them or monitor them

00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,209
more effectively because there was a lot

00:10:42,439 --> 00:10:47,810
of companies that saw them as useful but

00:10:44,209 --> 00:10:49,459
hadn't figured them out yeah exactly I

00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:51,769
mean that's that's part of it is how do

00:10:49,459 --> 00:10:54,380
you bring in this this new technology

00:10:51,769 --> 00:10:56,630
and and of course Cloud Foundry has that

00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:59,149
nice prescriptive way of doing it that

00:10:56,630 --> 00:11:00,399
that companies like because it answers a

00:10:59,149 --> 00:11:02,660
lot of the questions they have

00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:06,889
internally

00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:09,319
cool thanks stuff so I think we're gonna

00:11:06,889 --> 00:11:11,019
wrap it up with events here um anyone

00:11:09,319 --> 00:11:14,420
can jump in with any events that they no

00:11:11,019 --> 00:11:16,009
spring one is next week I think I think

00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:19,730
a couple of you are going or your

00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:21,680
organization's are going yeah mad

00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:23,509
drop-off the call but all states got a

00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:26,120
couple of talks next week including one

00:11:23,509 --> 00:11:29,480
by Matt curry he was on earlier there's

00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:32,389
a number of users of either some of the

00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:36,050
the cloud native Java coming out of

00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:38,089
spring a group as well as cloud foundry

00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:40,220
customers as well and so it'll be an

00:11:38,089 --> 00:11:42,980
interesting you know show in terms of a

00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:44,689
mix of customer case studies and and you

00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:46,579
know technical talks and so certainly

00:11:44,689 --> 00:11:50,089
looking forward to that our groups given

00:11:46,579 --> 00:11:51,829
a talk on going from an application and

00:11:50,089 --> 00:11:53,870
turning it into a service broker and

00:11:51,829 --> 00:11:55,939
then in this case turning it into a tile

00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:59,720
to run in pivotal Cloud Foundry

00:11:55,939 --> 00:12:02,480
marketplace awesome and in the there is

00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:04,430
a Cloud Foundry booth fair and typically

00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,040
our booths are staffed by member

00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:08,750
companies and by ambassadors and so if

00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:11,750
you or someone who can help out with a

00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:13,339
booth that'd be great and if you're if

00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,930
you want to talk to an ambassador or a

00:12:13,339 --> 00:12:17,389
member company stop by the booth for

00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:20,269
their story I got one other addition to

00:12:17,389 --> 00:12:21,439
that I'd remembered our cut our group is

00:12:20,269 --> 00:12:23,660
going to be they're presenting on

00:12:21,439 --> 00:12:27,380
persistence and sort of the end end

00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:30,560
story we have an in addition to spring

00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:32,990
that allows you to use persistence in a

00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:35,720
spring-like fashion that's very clean

00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:37,670
from a developer's point of view so Paul

00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:40,430
warned from our groups gonna be giving a

00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:42,259
presentation on on persistence and Cloud

00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:43,240
Foundry tied together with spring and

00:12:42,259 --> 00:12:46,939
how they work

00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:49,399
intend this sounds good yep and

00:12:46,939 --> 00:12:51,649
encourage all you Cloud Foundry fans to

00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:53,600
support your cloud foundry speakers and

00:12:51,649 --> 00:12:55,459
go to their talks and tweet it and help

00:12:53,600 --> 00:13:00,410
spread the word that way and some

00:12:55,459 --> 00:13:02,449
supporting questions so other other big

00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:03,740
news the European summit is coming up

00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:05,689
it's not for awhile it's the end of

00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:07,339
September but this week I think this

00:13:05,689 --> 00:13:09,139
morning we just announced the the

00:13:07,339 --> 00:13:11,540
schedule with all the speakers and the

00:13:09,139 --> 00:13:12,500
keynote speakers it's really awesome as

00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,980
we were going through the call for

00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:17,260
papers and we found a paper

00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:18,430
the Dutch government I'm super super

00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,830
excited about that we did one of the

00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:23,440
Dutch government was using Cloud Foundry

00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:26,470
so there's a number of customers and

00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:30,220
member companies and users lots of great

00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:32,080
speakers if you go take a look there and

00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:33,340
registration is open early bird

00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:37,990
registration which is a pretty good

00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:41,590
discount I'm is up until August 2nd on

00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:43,840
the Cloud Foundry summit news we the

00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:45,820
foundation's announced that Cloud

00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,560
Foundry Asia which happened in China

00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:50,110
last year is going to be replaced by

00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:52,330
Cloud Foundry days and the goal there is

00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:55,360
to be able to reach into more countries

00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:58,150
within Asia it is a really big place so

00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,160
having just one summit I was really hard

00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:02,140
to get everybody there and so I'll have

00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,610
a series of Cloud Foundry days I think

00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:05,140
and I remember companies are gonna help

00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:06,940
put them on and I think there's a

00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:08,890
handful are already plans and we're

00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:12,010
still looking for a house I think we

00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:14,290
need a host for Tokyo I just look this

00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:15,430
up we need two more countries that we

00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:19,020
want to target in the first round that

00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:19,020
need host but there's a handful of plans

00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:22,530
thank you

00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:29,320
so if you'd like to speak at or help

00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:32,070
plan those we're looking for for help

00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:34,600
planning out the Cloud Foundry days Asia

00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:36,820
oops I've been continuing to go strong

00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,740
our meetups are always awesome there's

00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:41,380
been just 14 meetups in the past week

00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:47,760
I'm so they all over the world Europe

00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:47,760
Dublin London America like Denmark

00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:54,370
there's a number of them I actually got

00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:56,980
to attend the London one instead of the

00:14:54,370 --> 00:15:02,260
Denver one sorry mark so I spoke at low

00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:03,820
plug in London which is cool and then

00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:05,050
while I was in London the reason I was

00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,970
in London was doing a Cloud Foundry

00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:08,800
bread show so the foundation has been

00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:11,050
going to all the major sites where

00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,910
there's a large concentration of Cloud

00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:15,910
Foundry contributors and giving an

00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:17,560
update on the foundation and finding out

00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:19,300
if people have questions or what they

00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:21,550
want to contribute it's been a lot of

00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:24,340
fun we've done most of the North

00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:26,410
American sites and the European sites so

00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,790
I think it's been like Santa Monica San

00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:33,260
Francisco Toronto and

00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:35,000
London Cambridge we did not do rally

00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:39,410
since I just had their dojo lunch and we

00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:44,030
were there Waldorf in Germany and Sophia

00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:45,710
and Bulgaria and it's been a it's been a

00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:47,420
richness of you are at a site has a

00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:48,860
large concentration of confounded

00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:51,430
contributors and would like the red to

00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:54,500
know to come your way let us know and

00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:56,510
then two more event things and one is

00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,980
will always have a section for call for

00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:59,090
speakers so if you have a conference

00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:01,340
where you'd look to have a Cloud Foundry

00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:03,050
speaker let us know I'm a couple that I

00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:05,360
know that I have call for papers right

00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:06,500
now our container camp in London and I

00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,820
believe the garden team has already

00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,360
submitted their proposals so that's

00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:11,600
awesome

00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:13,760
and then there's an open IOT summit in

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,080
Europe run by the Linux Foundation and

00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:20,260
then we'll have those in the notes for

00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:22,340
this podcast and then last but not least

00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:24,350
for those of you that were at the Santa

00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:27,440
Clara summits and there was there was a

00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:30,350
wash day and the thought was what do we

00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,940
do with that Community Day and the idea

00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:33,590
was not to do another Bosch day but

00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:35,900
maybe do a conker's day and maybe do a

00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:37,340
good day maybe do something else and so

00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:38,570
what we're leaning towards right now and

00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:40,070
we're looking for people that want to

00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:41,390
help so if you want to influence it make

00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:44,600
it something else or make it more of

00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:46,310
that you can join is a hack day which

00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,770
would be building things on top of Cloud

00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:50,810
Foundry components and so may be focused

00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:53,000
around garden or Diego we'd have it that

00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:54,980
day before the conference people can

00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,330
come hack build things they can bring

00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:59,420
something that partially built and they

00:16:56,330 --> 00:17:01,220
want help with and then it'll be like a

00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:02,750
regular hack day where you everyone gets

00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:04,610
to them one at the hack day and then the

00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:07,640
best ones can present it on stage at the

00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:09,410
summit so that's a current thinking but

00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:11,000
it needs volunteers so it needs people

00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:16,100
that want to help like it's what they

00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:17,780
want to make it great any other news

00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:22,370
from anybody on the call or anything

00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:23,840
that anyone would like to share all

00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:25,790
right well this is your Cloud Foundry

00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:27,830
ambassadors group bringing you the Cloud

00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:32,230
Foundry morning edition and we hope

00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:32,230
