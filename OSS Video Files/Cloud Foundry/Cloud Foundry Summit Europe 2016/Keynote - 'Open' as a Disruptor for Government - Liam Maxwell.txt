thank you very much that was a

00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:07,589
fascinating talk because masses and

00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,300
masses to talk more about the way that

00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:10,889
they're working with aliens

00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,330
my name's Leah Maxwell I'm the National

00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:12,750
Technology advisor for the British

00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,940
government

00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,039
I was the CTO and today I'm going to

00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,310
talk a little bit about what we did to

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:22,279
change and how we use culture of

00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:24,840
openness to change what we were doing

00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:26,609
I've talked to lots of things where you

00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,590
go to conferences and you meet these

00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:31,170
startups and we were given this task of

00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:32,940
creating a start-up in government as it

00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:36,510
were and I end up saying that I'm a

00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:38,430
member of a tax collection and public

00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:43,500
service delivery startup we're in our

00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:45,840
400 pound of funding sort of finding it

00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,480
difficult to deal with agile as a

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,360
concept because so much of our life has

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,489
been structured and I do recall going

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,370
with my colleague then Mike Bracken we

00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:57,840
went to an agency of government and

00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:59,600
government it's great at creating these

00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,270
new log isms where they say you know

00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,710
everything should be agile and I

00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,210
remember going there and they they had a

00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:07,320
presentation they really wanted to

00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:10,650
please us and they've talked about

00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:13,770
absolution because they wanted to do

00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:16,590
agile but not that fast so it was a sort

00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:18,180
of agile and evolution together and you

00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:19,650
know blessed and they got there actually

00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,810
but it was one of those things where

00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:25,650
culture and and where the culture of

00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:27,060
change makes a difference and so let's

00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,579
talk a little bit about the challenge

00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:32,100
that we had to in order to face our

00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:34,140
change at that point and the challenge

00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,689
that we faced was this we were spending

00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:39,780
too much money okay so we were spending

00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:42,689
about 1% of the British economy on

00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:45,210
technology within government and that's

00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:47,490
although you hear about something it's

00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:52,110
amazing how much you can do with that

00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:54,450
and not get it right and so the we had

00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:56,700
the initial set of change controls which

00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:58,320
we brought in and obviously this was

00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,020
contentious but it meant that we could

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,360
get change moving by using a form of

00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,759
control and we had a very very strong

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:09,179
focus on what we wanted to do we wanted

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,770
to move away from paying large amounts

00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:12,640
of money but we wanted to move away from

00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:16,450
having a system that

00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:18,400
work okay we were Olympic great at

00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:20,380
having services that didn't work for our

00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,240
users and so one of the cool things we

00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:23,980
started to defy him as we would design

00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:27,070
services that were based around the user

00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:28,870
need and it's very rare to find a

00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:30,820
politician to stand up and say we will

00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:32,950
build services around our users but that

00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:35,110
was the core running principle of what

00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:36,460
we were doing with our there to build a

00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:38,140
digital government and that's a

00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:42,610
government based around the user need

00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:44,200
and we needed models we needed new

00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:46,959
models one of the things we were hearing

00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:48,730
where aliens and their change was that

00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,090
they needed to move fast you need to

00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:53,920
bring in the change of moving faster and

00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:55,810
the thing we found very quickly was that

00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:59,320
technology was moving much faster than

00:02:55,810 --> 00:03:02,260
we as a government could move so you've

00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:04,270
got to change your game it was actually

00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:06,640
starting to render us irrelevant because

00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:08,200
if we didn't change to help provide

00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,690
services for our citizens

00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,430
then our citizens would go and use other

00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:14,560
things it's rather like when you run the

00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:16,420
IT in an organization if you don't

00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,060
provide the services that people want to

00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:21,580
use they use shadow IT you find people

00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:23,560
using Gmail or hotmail to go and do

00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:25,750
their work it's the same thing if you

00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:28,600
don't move in that way it won't work for

00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:31,390
you and also you need to move away this

00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:33,730
cycle we had was move away and focus on

00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:35,920
your innovation on things that are new

00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:38,290
and things that need to move and stop

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:41,680
trying to innovate all the time with

00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:43,390
things which are common you see we had

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,850
designed ourselves in a particular shape

00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:47,980
where we kept on reinventing ourselves

00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:50,200
we kept on reinventing the common

00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:52,630
components that we needed to make work

00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,340
and also because we worked in a

00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:56,680
commercial and a government construct

00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:59,470
where we had interpreted the rules in a

00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:01,299
particular way we had done this we had

00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:03,730
actually managed to lock all of that

00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:06,489
inside a but black box procurement

00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:08,440
structure we tried to procure our way

00:04:06,489 --> 00:04:13,329
out of trouble and this wasn't gonna

00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:16,000
work and we came to realise that

00:04:13,329 --> 00:04:19,100
culturally we were facing what we called

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,830
the square of despair okay

00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:24,110
so all of these things were reasons why

00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:26,120
you shouldn't do things I've often

00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:29,960
talked about there being a Department of

00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:31,430
no okay we're working to public pensions

00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,530
Department of Health Department attacks

00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:35,270
there's a Department of no and part of

00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:37,640
it was the was these things these four

00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:39,880
things every time you wanted to change

00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:42,470
something people set up at the legacy

00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,940
every time that you wanted to change

00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:45,760
something you couldn't find the right

00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:48,710
people because we had spent 25 years

00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:51,770
outsourcing great people out of the

00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:53,690
Civil Service so we had to get people

00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:55,790
back in we recruited almost immediately

00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:59,270
200 great new people into the civil

00:04:55,790 --> 00:05:01,490
service at leadership positions we

00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:03,980
always found that security was cited as

00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:06,350
a problem so people go oh I can't do

00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:10,310
that because of security cloud computing

00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:13,370
and the ability to put your data into a

00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:15,260
safe cloud space is something that civil

00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:17,090
servants found culturally very difficult

00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:20,540
at the time but over four years we've

00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:22,250
moved I use Gmail for my email for the

00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:25,160
capital of his email for my department

00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:27,110
email now that was something which

00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:29,360
people couldn't understand how could you

00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:31,490
possibly do that but strangely you find

00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,960
that organizations that run cloud

00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:35,120
services are actually quite good at

00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,650
security and as long as you make sure

00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,380
you check with them and you make sure

00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:41,360
you up-to-date it's just as safe in fact

00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:44,480
many people who says just it's more

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,860
secure and also procurement we demented

00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,660
the whole series of rules which meant

00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:48,830
that it costs too much money to sell to

00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:50,450
the government and therefore if you were

00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:52,730
a small business or an innovative

00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:55,520
business why would you bet all of your

00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:58,010
funding to spend it on filling in

00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,980
procurement forms we were cutting

00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:02,510
ourselves out from the market and so

00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:04,940
technology is moving faster than we were

00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:09,140
we had to be free to keep up we had to

00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:10,550
change our shape so we did this the

00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:12,770
whole of government is built like this

00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:15,110
it's actually constitutionally built

00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:16,640
like this you have departments everyone

00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:18,380
is responsible in those departments and

00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,850
yet we had to move to a concept of

00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:21,830
platforms because there were common

00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:24,650
things that we were all doing now we be

00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:25,730
doing it for years with electricity you

00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:28,130
know we didn't go and have a

00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:29,990
departmental generator to build our

00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:32,000
electricity in but we had to do this

00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:33,970
with tech as well we had to move

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,080
to a platform based approach and

00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:38,270
conceptually that's very difficult

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,620
because the thing that means is that the

00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:41,560
member of one department is going to

00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:45,440
rely on the member of another department

00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:47,090
to help them and culturally that's

00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,380
massively difficult you'll find that

00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:50,680
within companies we'll find out within

00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:52,730
all organizations but it's one of the

00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,350
competing things it's one of the great

00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:56,360
changes that has happen is we're able

00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:59,600
now to help people just across

00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:01,700
government so we brought in a set of

00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:04,370
changes there's the mechanics of that so

00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:06,590
we agree to code of practice we agree

00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:08,120
design principles because the design of

00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:11,210
our services was right at the core of

00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:14,540
making them successful if we design them

00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:18,080
for officials to use they wouldn't work

00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:20,780
famously infamously a particular program

00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:23,330
I remember starting looking at the first

00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:25,610
cut of this huge waterfall project

00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:26,810
development which said developed a piece

00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:29,750
of software I had a look at the first

00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:32,650
release of it and it said question five

00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:37,550
are you pregnant

00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:41,389
question nine are you a woman

00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:43,400
we we had sort of failed to do things I

00:07:41,389 --> 00:07:45,139
was famously involved in in a program

00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:47,210
for farming subsidies and when I got

00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:51,009
there on the first day I said are you a

00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:54,229
young farmer question 10 question 38

00:07:51,009 --> 00:07:55,729
what is your date of birth these two

00:07:54,229 --> 00:07:57,979
things could have been done better we

00:07:55,729 --> 00:08:00,050
kept on asking questions we didn't need

00:07:57,979 --> 00:08:02,960
to ask the most famous one from he

00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:05,090
always being do you have a valid driving

00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:08,629
license and they officially movant he

00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:10,370
knows yes or no it isn't giving me the

00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:13,130
license number and where it was issued

00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:15,220
because you just need to know is it yes

00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:18,229
or no we can do much better

00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:19,759
we also committed to openness so one of

00:08:18,229 --> 00:08:21,530
the famous things we did was the open

00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,270
document format that we made sure that

00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:24,560
within the UK and within government we

00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:28,880
always recognized we will be able to

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:30,319
share documents using open standards we

00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:34,370
cut out a lot of friction that was the

00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:36,020
organization chart I inherited I'll

00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:37,760
leave that for you to think for a moment

00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:39,589
that was the organization chart I

00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,240
inherited can you imagine having to try

00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:43,700
and get a contentious policy through

00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:45,529
that and that's what we did we cut it

00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:48,620
out we decided we'd say look we focused

00:08:45,529 --> 00:08:50,720
on four main areas shared services ERP

00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:52,250
digital services mission IT those are

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,250
the things that only those departments

00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:56,959
can do and then huge boatload of common

00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:58,640
technology services all the things that

00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:01,790
we do common across government build

00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,440
that once and we expanded the

00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:05,089
marketplace for our suppliers so on the

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,120
left that was our supplier base of

00:09:05,089 --> 00:09:11,959
direct line of supply 85% of that huge

00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:15,140
number of spending was done by 12

00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:17,000
companies we had to expand so we grew

00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:18,290
our marketplace we opened up our market

00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,029
we made it easier to sell into

00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:21,709
government we made it easy so that small

00:09:20,029 --> 00:09:23,899
businesses could deliver innovative

00:09:21,709 --> 00:09:25,610
solutions to government and we made sure

00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:27,680
that we scaled that and now the digital

00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:28,070
marketplace is about a billion pounds a

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,959
year

00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:32,600
52 percent of that is small medium

00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:34,520
enterprises so the whole point of that

00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:38,899
was so we can get innovative supply

00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:41,390
chain and we are now a center of dish

00:09:38,899 --> 00:09:42,680
Lexington government the OECD have

00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:45,770
recognized that we work we were the

00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:47,209
first place within the OECD and in that

00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:47,899
so we changed how we treated our

00:09:47,209 --> 00:09:49,759
technology

00:09:47,899 --> 00:09:52,850
remember this transition curve

00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:56,109
we decided to go for that okay we can

00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:58,879
move and do common things together and

00:09:56,109 --> 00:10:01,069
the way that we did that change was we

00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:02,449
made things open this was one of the

00:10:01,069 --> 00:10:04,339
slogans we used right at the very

00:10:02,449 --> 00:10:07,189
beginning make them open then make it

00:10:04,339 --> 00:10:09,799
better open was our main tool of

00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:11,629
disruption and it's fundamental to

00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:15,019
everything that we've done everything

00:10:11,629 --> 00:10:16,399
boils back to four components you see if

00:10:15,019 --> 00:10:19,399
you're going to use the Internet

00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,779
it's a common resource so if you're

00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:22,549
going to use a common resource you need

00:10:20,779 --> 00:10:24,199
to have standards so we made sure we had

00:10:22,549 --> 00:10:25,669
open standards and we're very very

00:10:24,199 --> 00:10:27,949
strong on the fact that our open

00:10:25,669 --> 00:10:29,540
standards go through a huge peer review

00:10:27,949 --> 00:10:34,249
process with the community to make sure

00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:36,709
that they are truly open for us that

00:10:34,249 --> 00:10:39,589
then meant that we could use open source

00:10:36,709 --> 00:10:41,709
effectively and believe me introducing

00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:43,939
open source into government has been an

00:10:41,709 --> 00:10:46,899
interesting line in the interesting

00:10:43,939 --> 00:10:50,359
period because the opposition to it was

00:10:46,899 --> 00:10:52,129
absolutely fundamental to people who

00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:54,619
work in a risk-based environment where

00:10:52,129 --> 00:10:57,259
they see risk is a binary thing and the

00:10:54,619 --> 00:11:00,679
ability to cooperate was wasn't there

00:10:57,259 --> 00:11:04,819
but we introduced open because it made

00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:06,619
things better we looked a lot at Oriel

00:11:04,819 --> 00:11:09,019
just about open markets meant that we

00:11:06,619 --> 00:11:11,480
could open up to everybody so that we

00:11:09,019 --> 00:11:13,069
can have diverse markets so we can get

00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:15,470
the right innovation so that we could

00:11:13,069 --> 00:11:17,809
buy from the people that have the best

00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:20,959
ideas not the people that were best at

00:11:17,809 --> 00:11:23,239
filling in forms it's as basic as that

00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,499
and then also open data you will know

00:11:23,239 --> 00:11:25,730
that we were the first transparent

00:11:24,499 --> 00:11:27,470
government we were that we are the most

00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:29,389
transparent government on the in the

00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:32,600
world in terms of how much data we

00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:34,850
publish around what we do and we were

00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,079
very very key very very keen to make

00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:38,689
sure that we were open about our

00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:41,359
spending and how we got to where we got

00:11:38,689 --> 00:11:44,179
to but now we are very open in how we

00:11:41,359 --> 00:11:45,259
will interpret our policy and you'll see

00:11:44,179 --> 00:11:48,109
that our new Prime Minister is now

00:11:45,259 --> 00:11:50,509
looking at using setting our policy and

00:11:48,109 --> 00:11:51,559
then using open data to make sure that

00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:53,389
those policies are implemented

00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:55,339
particularly around things like the

00:11:53,389 --> 00:11:58,220
disparities in how you're treated by our

00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:58,980
system if according to race that's one

00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:01,980
of the cork

00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:03,269
opponents of our approach so it's at the

00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,829
heart of the approach the government is

00:12:03,269 --> 00:12:05,970
taking it's also at the heart of the

00:12:04,829 --> 00:12:07,290
approach that other governments are

00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:08,459
taking so there are four governments

00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:10,740
here then if you can spot which ones

00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:14,010
they are top left is probably quite easy

00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:16,380
so that was the beta for Gulf de il on

00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:18,690
the top right that's New Zealand's the

00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:20,579
bottom left if any of you from Estonia

00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:22,019
or now its glory to X Road from Estonia

00:12:20,579 --> 00:12:23,430
which is an open source approach to

00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:26,940
government and in the bottom right

00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:28,139
president Park geun-hye of Korea we five

00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:31,160
governments actually work together very

00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:33,149
closely you may notice that the top two

00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:35,600
components there look relatively similar

00:12:33,149 --> 00:12:38,040
they look quite similar to gov dot UK

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,899
there's a reason why they do that it's

00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:42,930
because they're based on got UK they've

00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:44,490
used the same code because governments

00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:46,740
don't need to complete like other world

00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:48,089
leaders we want to start and we want to

00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:50,579
create the same thing we want to be able

00:12:48,089 --> 00:12:54,360
to build a government that's based on

00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:56,639
the internet because it's the most

00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:58,170
effective it's the fastest way is the

00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,089
best way of building the services we

00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:02,760
need to build but it's also the way that

00:13:00,089 --> 00:13:05,670
meets ours users needs most effectively

00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:07,709
they don't want to know that they're

00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:09,360
dealing with the Department of Finance

00:13:07,709 --> 00:13:11,010
or the Department of chairs or the

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,750
Department of Agriculture to get their

00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:14,970
parking permit which in some

00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:16,920
circumstances it could be some of those

00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:18,810
used they just want to know that the

00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:21,389
government is there to work for them and

00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:23,399
so their approach of thinking how do we

00:13:21,389 --> 00:13:25,610
build a government of the Internet is

00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:30,029
right at the core of what we're doing so

00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:32,190
we use open to unlock change and the

00:13:30,029 --> 00:13:35,220
dynamic force behind them has been

00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:38,370
competition when we decided we wanted to

00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:41,459
build things for for government quickly

00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:43,380
simply effectively we made sure that we

00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:45,839
could use all the right suppliers that

00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:47,069
are available not just the ones that had

00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,019
previously been good at winning

00:13:47,069 --> 00:13:50,610
contracts we made sure that we use

00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:52,980
standards which meant that people could

00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:55,199
work together so that not everything had

00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:58,319
to be delivered by one organization but

00:13:55,199 --> 00:14:01,139
people could work in teams now what that

00:13:58,319 --> 00:14:02,880
meant was there are openness and our

00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:05,670
ability to start delivering drove

00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:08,130
competition and actually what that

00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:09,930
drives if you have true competition in

00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:11,910
the market as Sam was saying it drives

00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:14,460
the adoption of open source

00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:16,620
it also drives a high percentage of

00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:19,080
small business engagement which means

00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:20,850
that you get much more innovation which

00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:22,560
means that you're open to ideas which

00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:25,230
means that you're not the smartest

00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,190
person in the room because the smartest

00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:28,050
people in the room other people that

00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:31,080
come in to work with you to collaborate

00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:33,450
with you and of course it also means

00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:35,670
that we can start to change our shape it

00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:37,680
means that we can start to move to the

00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:40,950
concept of sharing because if we have

00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:43,230
standards and we can share it then means

00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:46,440
that we can move from silos where

00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:48,570
government is set to build itself into

00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:53,040
the use of platforms where we can share

00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:57,470
components and share what we have built

00:14:53,040 --> 00:15:00,980
together let's have a think about that

00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:05,610
what we've built together because

00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:07,710
governments generally don't compete now

00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:10,080
put up here two organizations

00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:12,630
okay on the left hand side the DVLA on

00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:16,890
the right hand side the sweden of the

00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:19,410
norwegian DVLA now it may come as no

00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:23,070
surprise to you but I have and we have

00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:26,460
no desire to provide services to the

00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:28,830
Norwegian drivers Association we have no

00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:33,330
desire to issue driving licenses in

00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:36,570
Norway famously I've rather infamously I

00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:40,490
said that we we have we no longer have a

00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:40,490
wish to collect tax in America

00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:52,510
it sort of moved on took a long time but

00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:56,590
if you think about it we're doing the

00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:58,300
same thing i driving license if you go

00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:59,650
through the same set of rules one of the

00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:01,240
things we've discovered as we opened up

00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:02,410
government and look to the size of

00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:04,210
government was that we were doing the

00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:06,610
same thing so many times within our own

00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:09,850
government we were issuing licenses in

00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:11,440
compute terms issuing a shotgun license

00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:13,900
issuing of fishing license aren't

00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,730
actually that different you give your

00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:17,200
name you give your data you go through a

00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:21,100
set of business rules you pay some money

00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:23,170
continue you're done and so why are we

00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:26,650
trying to continually reinvent the wheel

00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:29,080
in a particularly British way actually

00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:31,480
we should be able to share what we do

00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:34,410
and share the components of what we do

00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:38,590
because as government's we don't compete

00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:40,780
not for that and so we're now starting

00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:42,010
to work very closely with governments to

00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:43,840
do this and the government's that I

00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:48,190
showed you previously have also done

00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:50,020
that that if you're working in the tax

00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:52,090
system in Vietnam you're probably using

00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:53,950
some form of Korean code to help you get

00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:55,360
that moving if you're working in the

00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:56,710
health service in Finland you're going

00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,230
to start finding that the enterprise

00:16:56,710 --> 00:17:01,330
service bus across your services is the

00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:02,770
X Road in fact that the Finnish

00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:06,070
government has made the X road more

00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:08,800
secure has helped to develop it into a

00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:10,920
much better service and so we're

00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:14,860
actually looking much more at

00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:18,070
cooperation and collaboration we have

00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:20,080
open sourced all of our code we have

00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:22,510
open sourced our tooling we have open

00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:24,850
sourced our methodology so that you will

00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:26,710
find that other governments are able to

00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:29,380
start doing the things where we had the

00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:30,850
early battles and you'll see that in

00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:32,770
local government in the UK they are

00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:35,590
adopting standards to help them

00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:38,020
introduce better services for citizens

00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:39,340
if you look at the Australian government

00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:42,040
and the digital transformation office

00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:43,810
they started to take place use a service

00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:45,250
standard which looked very similar to

00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:49,150
the British service standard and that's

00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:51,280
great because it means that we together

00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:52,500
can actually work more effectively the

00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,330
biggest problem we have

00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:57,470
is that we can't find enough great

00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:57,470
people to come and work in government

00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:04,350
and so that's the motto we have we

00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:08,130
shouldn't try to do everything ourselves

00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:10,950
we can't that's where we ended up going

00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:14,610
wrong for many many years cooperation

00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:16,530
and collaboration is the way forward for

00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:21,780
us because we can make sure that what we

00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:23,100
work on is the work for the people but

00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,840
it also means that we can get the best

00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:27,180
services it's a completely different

00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:30,750
model we're not looking at spending $16

00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:32,580
billion pounds a year on proprietary

00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:34,620
technology to work in one particular

00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:37,410
part of a government we are looking to

00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:40,230
create services that work for everybody

00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:41,580
across the whole of our government so

00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:43,680
that we don't have to continually

00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:46,380
reinvent the wheel it's very basic it's

00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:49,020
very simple but that concept and the

00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:51,570
culture of delivering that is very

00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:54,990
difficult to win the argument for but

00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:57,690
we're getting there and I suppose the

00:18:54,990 --> 00:19:00,000
thing that is now galvanizing us is how

00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:02,910
do we use what we've got to remove the

00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,160
friction from government all the

00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:06,810
successful tech businesses all the

00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:09,090
successful new digital businesses are

00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:10,710
about taking away the broker removing

00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:13,200
the friction helping people do things

00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:15,300
quicker smoother simpler for them that's

00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,250
the aim we have in government as well it

00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:19,710
will reduce our cost but it will

00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:21,120
massively increase our uptake and I mean

00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:23,760
that we deliver the services that our

00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:27,020
citizens need and that's how we grow

00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:29,790
fast and as I leave you with one thought

00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:33,150
we started with this huge monolith

00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:35,850
delivering in silos we now find

00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:39,180
ourselves with a growth market called

00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:42,090
gov tech the life in tech which the UK

00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:46,860
exert cells that we now have and we

00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:48,630
built 500 business cases for companies

00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:51,450
to get involved with government to sell

00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:53,790
to government to deliver services that

00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:55,650
we wanted but built in the right way

00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:58,200
where we collaborate where we share

00:19:55,650 --> 00:20:00,690
where we can work effectively across

00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:03,030
platforms and work effectively across

00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:04,570
departments to deliver the services our

00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:07,060
citizens need

00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:09,760
and the big thing about that is that's a

00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:11,710
sustainable model and if you're starting

00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:14,020
to work and starting to look at a

00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:16,030
rules-based and trying to look at a

00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:17,350
service which allows you to work in a

00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:19,240
rules-based environment where people

00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:21,580
will want to work together then

00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:23,410
government mount well be for you you may

00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:25,630
have thought for many years not to do it

00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:27,910
but you may not find that government is

00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:30,040
actually a profitable market for you to

00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:34,050
invest time and effort to come and

00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:34,050
