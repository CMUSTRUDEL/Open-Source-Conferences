Description: 
	Keynote - Innovating Around The Digital Core - Marc Geall, SVP, Head of Platform Partner Ecosystem, GCO, SAP; Steffen Stang, Director MindSphere R&D and Product Management, SIEMENS; & Bernd Issler, VP, Cloud & Enterprise Software, Atos

Find out how SAP is extending its ecosystem of ISVs to help customers turn digital disruption to advantage by leveraging agile cloud applications built on Hana Cloud Platform. Hear from SAP, Siemens and Atos about the joint journey they are taking.

SAP is helping its customers and partners embrace digital disruption. Digital Transformation allows customers to re-think classical business processes and take advantage of new inputs and insights to scale their businesses more quickly. However, the pace of innovation in most industries can be so fast that only an open ecosystem approach to Bimodal IT stands a chance of success, and one that connects directly to the most relevant business data. 

SAP is leveraging an open platform strategy that allows customers to build new applications and extensions, run these side-by-side ecosystem partner innovation (offered as packaged SaaS applications), and all natively integrated to their back-end systems, whether in the cloud or on-premise.

	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,120
so I have the challenge of trying to get

00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:11,639
spit a keynote into two lightning talks

00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:15,389
and a fireside chat so bear with me so

00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:17,460
hands up who is he used a taxi or got a

00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:20,869
taxi as part of their their trip here

00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:23,130
over the last couple of days okay

00:00:20,869 --> 00:00:24,779
normally when I do this I do this in

00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,730
Orlando where most people had to wait

00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:29,760
for two hours for a taxi the night

00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:32,250
before so the the point here is that you

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,980
know digital disruption is is impacting

00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:37,140
every single industry right so you know

00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,059
the taxi industry hasn't changed in

00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,190
certainly in the last twenty years some

00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:43,050
would say in the last 200 years right I

00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:46,050
mean yes you used to get a horse and

00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:47,460
cart and now it's a it's a taxi but what

00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:50,219
are we seeing in the last four years

00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:53,520
uber has come from nowhere to disrupting

00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:56,579
an industry it's also disrupting

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,559
transportation logistics so it's seeing

00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:02,219
dramatic change and I think the the

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:04,920
point I wanted to make here is that you

00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:07,799
know change is happening everywhere as

00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,119
customers as partners we really need to

00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:11,930
sort of assess how digital

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:15,420
transformation will impact our business

00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:18,540
back in 2005 I was on a business trip in

00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,400
Boston and we drove past a blockbuster I

00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:22,680
don't know if everyone remembers

00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:24,450
blockbuster as the video store and the

00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,369
taxi driver sort of said to me said he

00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:28,740
knew I was a financial analyst he said

00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:30,689
would you invest in this business

00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:32,790
and I said no and he said why and I said

00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:34,770
because Netflix is going to basically

00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:37,829
take their market away at that time

00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:39,090
Netflix was shipping DVDs and the post

00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:41,310
if you remember now they've totally

00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:44,430
transformed that what he didn't realize

00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:47,009
was that his shield which he paid a

00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:50,009
million u.s. dollars for had just risen

00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:51,869
to 1.2 million in 2005 and is now worth

00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:54,600
about five hundred thousand dollars

00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:56,969
because uber has totally disrupted his

00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:00,810
marketplace right so this is the impact

00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:03,630
that this is having and you know from

00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:05,880
from from our perspective what we wanted

00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:09,300
to talk about and hopefully sort of

00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:11,879
discuss is is this is an ecosystem game

00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,360
right so digital transformation cannot

00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:15,640
be done by one vendor

00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,070
it has to be done by an ecosystem

00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,720
pulling together to enable companies to

00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:21,370
transform to change their business

00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:24,070
models to change their business best

00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:28,510
practice in a very agile and effective

00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:30,400
way this is this is one of my sort of

00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:32,140
favorite slides because I can look out

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,840
and say you know 40 percent of your

00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:37,780
businesses will probably be dead in the

00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,580
next 10 years you know we've we're

00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:41,500
seeing the the average age of

00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:44,040
organizations change quite dramatically

00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:48,610
right so they've fallen from 65 years

00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:49,930
for the global 500 of fortune 500 to 15

00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:52,540
years and it's soon going to be less

00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:54,070
than 10 right this change is having a

00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:56,440
huge impact as I mentioned on every

00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:57,190
particular business every type of

00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,530
opportunity

00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:03,130
everyone knows the stories around uber

00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:04,600
and Facebook and Airbnb right the the

00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:06,880
thick the benefit they had is they

00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,500
didn't have to escape legacy right they

00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,390
were all able to start afresh they were

00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:13,360
able to build out these cloud solutions

00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:15,420
these cloud scenarios they were yes able

00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,980
to take advantage of platform to

00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:20,950
digitally disrupt but they didn't have

00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:23,500
to escape legacy so how do we do this in

00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:26,440
the context of the business that we all

00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:28,420
operate in where we do have s AP is that

00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:30,190
at the backend or we do have oracle at

00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:34,540
the backend we do have a huge amount of

00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:36,070
of custom development applications that

00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:38,320
not only do we need to look at how do we

00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:41,019
migrate but how do we now extend and

00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:46,870
start to build these new business

00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:49,360
capabilities you're probably all

00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:52,570
expecting this to be a a metaphor around

00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,489
sort of to pace I T in terms of you know

00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:56,230
we need to manage the requirements of

00:03:54,489 --> 00:03:58,030
the business and we do that through an

00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:59,530
agile pace layer we do that with

00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:01,959
platform as-a-service we do that with

00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:03,730
Claire foundry but we need to keep this

00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:06,580
in the context of you know your

00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:08,590
rock-solid core your your your stable IT

00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:10,750
requirements where you need to really

00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:12,989
support the the business but keep it up

00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:15,519
and keep it up at an at a high level

00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:17,890
it's true in part really this has made

00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:20,979
memoir for me I'm sort of doing a half

00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:23,050
marathon and it's next Sunday and it's

00:04:20,979 --> 00:04:25,120
to remind me that you know to run fast

00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:27,070
or to run further I need to run fast

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,140
right so lean

00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:30,730
the analog is there in terms of you know

00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:31,990
we do need to think about how do we

00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:34,780
bring both of these capabilities

00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:37,570
together how do we make sure that as an

00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:39,580
organization we extend from the business

00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:42,760
data we extend from from that stable

00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:45,280
core but we get the benefits of pace

00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:47,140
layering we get the the benefit of this

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,570
sort of bimodal IT requirement the

00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:52,300
Gartner likes to talk about and this is

00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:54,280
something that that we think will enable

00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:58,740
customers to transform right if I think

00:04:54,280 --> 00:05:01,300
in the context of IOT or industry 4.0

00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:02,530
often its extensions of existing

00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,870
business processes right we're

00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:06,850
connecting to new data sources but we're

00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:08,980
using it still to optimize a supply

00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:10,990
chain or we're using it to better manage

00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:14,110
our inventory levels right so ultimately

00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:16,810
it is an extensibility play so this is

00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:19,750
why you cannot escape legacy you have to

00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:23,050
do this in the context of the legacy

00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:26,500
systems of the legacy capabilities as a

00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:30,990
customer you have and as ecosystem

00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:30,990
players we all need to take advantage of

00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:38,890
so if this is if digital transformation

00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:41,020
is ultimately extensibility game you

00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:44,160
need to connect to the business data

00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:46,120
right so I was in a session yesterday

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,950
where we were sort of going through

00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,870
daily or seven or eight Cloud Foundry

00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:53,350
customers all with very different use

00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:55,330
cases but the one similarity that they

00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:56,950
all had was they were connecting to

00:05:55,330 --> 00:06:00,430
their core they're consistent they're

00:05:56,950 --> 00:06:03,940
connecting to their core back-end so you

00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:06,850
know we we believe to build this bimodal

00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:09,400
promise you need to connect to the core

00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:11,530
business data but you then need to if

00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:14,050
you like do that in conjunction with

00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:16,360
this agility layer with Cloud Foundry as

00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:19,350
that business platform as a service this

00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:21,430
is much more than just integration or

00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:23,290
development capabilities right I know

00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:25,030
Gartner and others like to talk about I

00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:27,160
pass and a pass this really is about

00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:30,370
business platform as a service it's

00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:32,200
about having the comprehensiveness of

00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:35,440
API so you can get access to the content

00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:37,660
it's about decomposing industry and line

00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,880
of business expertise into micro

00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:40,420
services or into business ap is that you

00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:43,590
can read

00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:46,510
so that customers and partners can build

00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:49,390
these new use cases these extension use

00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:51,760
cases much much quicker so the agility

00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:53,680
layer needs to be done in the context of

00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:56,890
that of that stable core they stable

00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:59,160
systems you need I think at the first

00:06:56,890 --> 00:07:02,760
set of customers right I mean you know I

00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:05,050
on that every industry is being impacted

00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:07,900
so you know you need it

00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:09,430
you as developers as partners you need

00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:12,190
to know that there's a market

00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:14,320
opportunity to go after so you need to

00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:16,750
build on that you need to leverage the

00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:18,370
fact that the platform needs to be open

00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:20,980
it needs to be standards-based we would

00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:22,330
love to commoditize the infrastructure

00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:24,880
layer rights infrastructure should

00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:27,730
become a utility and then the value

00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,830
becomes the business capabilities and

00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:31,150
and the business api's that are made

00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:33,490
available through the platform and

00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:35,350
that's how we differentiate but we need

00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:37,780
to take advantage of the ecosystem right

00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:40,450
digital transformation is a platform

00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:42,070
network orchestration business model so

00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:44,500
you need those partners the challenge we

00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:46,480
have and the challenge I have is that

00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:48,310
all these partners are going through a

00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:51,190
transformation right traditional

00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:53,890
partners at sa P were resellers and

00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:56,500
systems integrators they all now need to

00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:58,380
build IP they don't all have the skills

00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:00,850
and the capabilities to build product

00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:03,760
and that's where we're sort of going

00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:06,760
through a reaction process to make to

00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:09,280
retool almost the ecosystem to deliver

00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:12,430
against that transformation opportunity

00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:14,260
and then we need to extend to new

00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:15,880
ecosystems and this is part of the

00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:18,250
discussion we will have with with

00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:20,740
Stephan and and burn which is how do we

00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:24,010
start to bridge IT and 80 right so back

00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:25,780
into we're in Frankfurt industry 4.0 IOT

00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:29,500
is a hot topic how do you start to

00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:32,410
bridge the gap between IT and 18 the

00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:36,160
benefit if we can do this is we can help

00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:37,780
our customers either Co innovate or

00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:40,000
innovate on their own that ultimately

00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:42,550
reimagine reinvent and run differently

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,830
right so digital transformation is about

00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:47,470
rethinking those legacy business

00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:51,100
proceeds are now doing stuff in a new

00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:53,080
way you cannot do that if your product

00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:54,010
development cycle is three five years

00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,290
and you have tenure

00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:58,690
ro is right this is a big difference big

00:08:56,290 --> 00:09:00,850
cultural difference recipe because you

00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:03,490
know we're not always known for that

00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:05,949
sort of agile type of of innovation and

00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:08,079
capability but this is this is what

00:09:05,949 --> 00:09:10,750
we're driving now this is the core

00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:12,399
message and the strategy to customers

00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:15,459
which is we now can give you that

00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:18,490
opportunity using Cloud Foundry to

00:09:15,459 --> 00:09:21,070
reimagine reinvent and run and you know

00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:23,500
running a run in a new way but we can't

00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:25,899
do that on our own we need to do this

00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:28,089
with the ecosystem because the pace of

00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:30,459
industries is changing too quickly that

00:09:28,089 --> 00:09:32,279
one vendor can't do this on their own

00:09:30,459 --> 00:09:37,690
they need to leverage the power of the

00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:40,510
diversity of the ecosystem and because

00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:42,310
of that the business model are changing

00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:44,740
right our business model is changing

00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:47,699
right if you yesterday you would have

00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:50,620
thought of SA P as a monolithic

00:09:47,699 --> 00:09:52,899
application vendor but really to be

00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:54,730
successful we have to shift our business

00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:56,440
model we have to shift our partnering

00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:58,690
model to drive that value for customers

00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:01,300
and we need to do that in the context of

00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:03,160
a platform business model so you know

00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,569
how do we bring in new customer use

00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:06,430
cases how do we bring in new data

00:10:04,569 --> 00:10:09,160
sources how do we transform the

00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:10,930
ecosystem to take advantage if we can't

00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:15,220
do that will not deliver that business

00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:17,350
value to the customer base so on that I

00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:18,720
want to flip from the presentation to a

00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:22,510
fireside chat

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:26,069
Bernese ler from Atos who's responsible

00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:26,069
for sort of digital innovation and

00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:37,600
and Stefan Spain who is responsible for

00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:42,549
the mine sphere which is one of our

00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:44,470
customers of HCP Clare foundry and what

00:10:42,549 --> 00:10:46,329
we wanted to do is was was run through

00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:48,759
this slide and sort of do some Q&A

00:10:46,329 --> 00:10:49,329
around this one slide hopefully this

00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:52,869
will work

00:10:49,329 --> 00:10:54,850
Stefan to kick us this is your slide see

00:10:52,869 --> 00:10:57,910
can you explain a little bit about maybe

00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:59,649
you know the type of 80 customers some

00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:01,809
of the use cases that you see

00:10:59,649 --> 00:11:04,689
specifically for mine sphere and how we

00:11:01,809 --> 00:11:06,970
bring IT and 80 together thank you for

00:11:04,689 --> 00:11:10,679
the introduction mark first of all this

00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:14,559
picture shows our vision what we want to

00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:17,410
accomplish with mine sphere Siemens is

00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:20,199
pretty strong in building industrial

00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:22,509
devices knowing how these devices are

00:11:20,199 --> 00:11:24,790
built knowing the data models around

00:11:22,509 --> 00:11:28,089
these devices and with this ecosystem

00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:31,660
based on cloud foundry we want to enable

00:11:28,089 --> 00:11:33,819
our end customers or machine builders or

00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:36,160
partners and certainly ourselves as

00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:40,199
Siemens to put applications on top of

00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:43,449
this let me give you some examples here

00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:45,819
today we already have applications for

00:11:43,449 --> 00:11:49,949
example in process control industries

00:11:45,819 --> 00:11:53,199
that we using a data collector to trans

00:11:49,949 --> 00:11:55,749
transmit control loop information and

00:11:53,199 --> 00:11:58,449
then providing in an application on top

00:11:55,749 --> 00:12:00,869
for our end customers just in dashboards

00:11:58,449 --> 00:12:04,720
how is the performance of their control

00:12:00,869 --> 00:12:07,569
plant really is and they can take this

00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:11,049
information and optimize the entire

00:12:07,569 --> 00:12:12,879
plant we also have applications or the

00:12:11,049 --> 00:12:15,999
effects on the drivetrain analytics

00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:19,029
where we increase up types of motors

00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:22,449
inverters you know in gearboxes though

00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:25,059
these are typical industrial assets all

00:12:22,449 --> 00:12:28,509
over you find it in all our industries

00:12:25,059 --> 00:12:31,389
you know pipelines posters control again

00:12:28,509 --> 00:12:34,139
whatever and we have such applications

00:12:31,389 --> 00:12:36,789
we provide a huge benefit but there's

00:12:34,139 --> 00:12:38,960
another interesting example just a

00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:42,320
couple months ago we released

00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:44,950
device what we call connector box it's

00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:47,990
an industrial small industrial device

00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:49,730
completely included with encryption and

00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:53,240
security for an end-to-end communication

00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:55,520
to the cloud and this is made as a

00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:58,850
business model form machine builders

00:12:55,520 --> 00:13:00,770
these machine builders can use this to

00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:03,290
develop their own digital services

00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:05,210
without any programming so you can

00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:08,090
within a couple of hours you can

00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:11,660
integrate this in your machine connect

00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:15,100
us to PLC's and have all the data in an

00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:18,680
application running in the cloud this is

00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:21,380
how we see it is how IT and OD comes

00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:23,690
together perfect and unburnt in terms of

00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:25,730
at sources perspective I mean what are

00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:27,560
you doing to bring itni tea together

00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:29,210
Marc so from our perspective will be a

00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:31,190
partner from from Siemens since many

00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:33,110
years and around minds for now obviously

00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:35,000
hosting the whole thing but our focus is

00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:36,980
obviously bringing the IT world in the

00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,140
out here all together so we basic rating

00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:41,270
are one of our first EPS we gonna put

00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:43,040
out is a manufacturing dashboard really

00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:44,600
taking the machine data really from the

00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,680
dirty machine the sensor data of our

00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,930
minds here and then bringing them

00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,150
together if let's say PLM mes other

00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:51,740
manufacturing that he data at the

00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:54,470
fingertips in the shop floor basically

00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:55,940
so that is now opens up a huge amount of

00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:58,160
it's a real-time data but also

00:13:55,940 --> 00:14:01,130
historical data which allows a much more

00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,840
powerful up-to-date situation on the

00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:05,300
machines based on the shop floor ok so

00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:07,310
really using your domain expertise in

00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:09,110
discrete manufacturing and using the

00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:10,730
data that's being generated and

00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:13,010
collected from from some of these IOT

00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:14,450
devices and and rethinking some some

00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:16,220
business from our perspective we also

00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:17,840
talk all this talk if the customers per

00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:19,100
domain really per use case basically but

00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:21,230
it's exactly the problem you try to

00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:23,620
address which is different in retail

00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:25,640
you're smart vending machines was a

00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:27,980
manufacturing with Siemens and the OT

00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:29,630
side or then utilities basically so we

00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:31,280
always start with to your 250 to use

00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:34,580
case what what type of problems do you

00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:36,890
really want to solve ok so you know we

00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:39,020
touched on you know platform is much

00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:41,420
more than application build and

00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:43,430
integration you know in the case of IAT

00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:46,370
it really becomes almost a data

00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:48,440
orchestration layer I'm Stefan in in

00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:50,420
your perspective what what does that

00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:52,300
mean in terms of potentially business

00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:53,980
model change and what a

00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:56,020
maybe the steps that we need to go

00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:57,640
through to actually deliver against that

00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:59,830
sort of business model change the

00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:01,870
business model changes certainly the

00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:05,740
most important part here I mean we

00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:08,980
cannot continue as we did in the past so

00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:12,100
we see this in that this will probably

00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:14,770
happen in three phases yeah right now

00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:17,950
since we started we are more in the face

00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:20,470
for our industrial customers to provide

00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:23,710
them with transparency and as I already

00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:27,130
mentioned with increasing uptime of

00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:29,110
assets but once we go forward I think in

00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:32,080
the second phase and if all the data we

00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:34,810
now collect and we can now combine and

00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:36,970
one data analytics on top we are then in

00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:39,550
the phase where we can provide real

00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:42,520
optimization to our customers and then

00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:44,770
in a frog face I'm sure we are really

00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:47,950
able to provide complete new business

00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:50,740
models like running as a service for

00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:52,510
almost everything them ok so ok so we

00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:54,280
need we need the transparency first in

00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:56,200
terms of what the assets are doing we

00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:58,210
can then can hope to optimize them and

00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:00,880
then we can think about transforming the

00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:02,560
business model and potentially going to

00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,000
outcomes based or as a service type is

00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:07,030
absolutely it always starts with

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,760
transparency and for many customers this

00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:12,520
is already a great value today ok

00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:15,610
and burn with Atos what are you doing

00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:17,350
around big data and yeah I mean one

00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:19,630
thing is it like this not with Cloud

00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:21,820
Foundry and in mind sphere and ACP

00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:23,890
enables a very fast let's say

00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:25,750
application creation so very fast you

00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:27,460
can show that it really works but then

00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:29,020
secondly fast it's not enough so that we

00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:31,390
can bring this this data which we

00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:33,640
generate immediately from the OT side

00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:35,860
together with the it's a manufacturing

00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:37,840
IT or Enterprise that you bring it all

00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:39,550
together that is not I think a

00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,990
capability which was not available in

00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:43,230
the last couple years it's now available

00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:46,150
and you can do very rapid application

00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:47,470
prototyping realization see if it works

00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:49,540
if it doesn't work you throw it away

00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:50,980
create a new one that enables a much

00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:52,720
much faster pace of innovation

00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:55,660
continuous innovation for the customers

00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,550
here okay so I mean I think that sort of

00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:59,200
leads onto the whole sort of point

00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:01,210
around sort of domain expertise right I

00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:03,900
mean at the top of mine sphere you have

00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:07,770
this ecosystem as well

00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:10,650
you know from from an OT standpoint you

00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:12,750
know are there any sort of big trends

00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:16,130
that you see or any sort of key

00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:19,140
capabilities that you want to deliver I

00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:23,460
mean certainly we we really want to

00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:26,670
enable our customers here and our OEMs

00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:29,640
and partners to easily use such an

00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:32,790
ecosystem and benefit from this

00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:36,540
ecosystem and and provide applications

00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:39,450
or new business models and digital

00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:41,700
services on top of it so this is clearly

00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:46,520
something which is completely new inter

00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:49,290
pares I think we always did run our own

00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:52,620
developments and now we have to open it

00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:55,470
up and in partnering more in really

00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:58,860
leveraging also the entire community for

00:17:55,470 --> 00:18:01,140
developers okay and but you know we

00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:03,480
touched on the expertise Atlas's

00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:05,730
expertise and in sort of manufacturing

00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:08,460
but you also have expertise in utilities

00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:10,080
and and other industries is there an

00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:11,910
opportunity to also bring those

00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,310
different industry sort of clusters

00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:15,870
together and get some shared value or

00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:17,400
some shared business value across the

00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:18,870
different industry types it's actually

00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,940
interesting point which we see happening

00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:23,130
now that obviously you start a very

00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:25,320
specific domain let's see manufacturing

00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:27,660
see what you can optimize but very often

00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:29,070
they do also have some problems which we

00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:31,110
already addressed maybe with retail

00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:32,790
customers so really some aspects of

00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,470
business processes we look outside

00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:35,910
specifically outside of the specific

00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:38,430
domain and see if there's lessons learn

00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:40,530
from other there's any utilities area so

00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:42,030
there's an interesting trend now that

00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:43,950
first of all of us you stay within your

00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:46,080
domain try to solve the problems at hand

00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:47,640
but then it allows you know to look over

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,040
let's say over the border and see what

00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:51,630
how maybe retail has addressed these

00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:53,220
problems in the past and then apply

00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:55,410
those lessons learned and and this is

00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:57,120
something that we see as well at sa P

00:18:55,410 --> 00:19:00,180
you know our business model has been

00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,620
very focused on you know 25 26 different

00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:04,350
industries but very specific

00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:06,150
capabilities right almost silos across

00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:09,960
industries and now what we're seeing is

00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:11,580
we're seeing you know how can we help an

00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,290
oil and gas company benefit from

00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:15,960
financial services or retail best

00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:17,610
practice and basically bring this as an

00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,650
agile application

00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:20,940
to that customer so that they can really

00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:22,530
get at some kind of system and

00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:23,910
differentiation or system of innovation

00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:26,429
and that's that's the value of the

00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:28,350
platform right that ability to to real

00:19:26,429 --> 00:19:32,280
architect or real castrates

00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:35,160
on and on on an ongoing basis I mean

00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:37,740
just just finally agility you know what

00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,760
what what what does agility mean for for

00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:41,640
use definitely

00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:44,190
it's a certainly important topic for us

00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:47,100
I mean coming from a traditional world

00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:49,290
of waterfall development and having

00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:52,320
product managers planning releases two

00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:54,450
to three years in advance we we started

00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:57,000
more than two years ago with a dis

00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:59,549
transformation in our company and sees a

00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:03,179
typical German engineering culture

00:19:59,549 --> 00:20:05,520
doesn't typically not allow any failures

00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:07,559
but we really establish the culture

00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:11,070
inside our development and product

00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:14,490
management teams learn fast fail fast so

00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:17,510
that we are now in a mode of having be

00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:20,190
weekly sprints having back locks

00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:23,730
priority driven by a product owner and

00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:25,710
this really helped us here to to speed

00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:29,610
up with all the development and

00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:31,740
innovation cycles okay and just I mean

00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:35,429
finally I mean I'd needed to get this in

00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:37,320
for sam multi-cloud is clearly important

00:20:35,429 --> 00:20:39,690
burn from from your perspective what

00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:41,910
what's the benefit of multi-cloud we

00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:43,559
multi-cloud classic fast as we can you

00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:46,080
know work with the customers develop

00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:47,850
those apps that run on a CPA to CP with

00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:51,240
manufacturing obviously focus on mine

00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:53,040
sphere with retail also many customers

00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:54,960
wanted on private clouds so busy any

00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:57,240
cloud variant you want busy with this

00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:00,360
app so if the Cloud Foundry capabilities

00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:05,309
we can enable perfect okay so just to

00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:07,980
wrap up you know as I mentioned we very

00:21:05,309 --> 00:21:11,460
much see digital disruption as this as

00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:14,309
this ecosystem requirement the value of

00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:16,250
connecting to the stable core connecting

00:21:14,309 --> 00:21:18,570
to your existing business processes

00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:21,600
extending those and rethinking them

00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:22,290
through agile innovation on on Cloud

00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,059
Foundry

00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:26,610
but ultimately the value is in the

00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:28,590
ecosystem and being able to for the

00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:30,510
ecosystem to really to adapt and respond

00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:33,630
to changes to drive that

00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:34,350
that customer value so on that Stefan

00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:36,030
thank you

00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:37,240
burn thank you and have a good day

00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:40,480
everybody a lot

00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,480
