Description: 
	Keynote: Confessions of a Cloud Foundry PaaS Product Owner: How to Create a Successful Devops Team in an Enterprise - Emma Hammond, Associate Director, Fidelity

Some would say successful devops is all about having the right tools. Emma Hammond believes it is all about people. It’s about trust & responsibility with the freedom to innovate, take risk & learn from failure. Much of this is alien to a traditional financial enterprise governed & protected by processes derived from years of operation – the ‘scar tissue’. Through the use of Cloud Foundry and software defined networks, Fidelity have been able to generate a new way of working to help mend these wounds and show the art of what is possible. Emma is very proud to have created the first devops team in Fidelity – their journey is worth sharing.

okay good afternoon everybody my name is

00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:09,019
Emma Hammond I'm the global powers

00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:12,780
platform owner at fidelity international

00:00:09,019 --> 00:00:13,710
just before we get started today I need

00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:17,070
to give you a little bit of background

00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:20,820
about fidelity we are a privately owned

00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:22,769
company founded in 1969 and in fact we

00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,859
manage over two hundred and seventy two

00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:28,050
billion dollars of money of our clients

00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:30,929
that range from sovereign wealth funds

00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:35,100
pension funds corporate banks across the

00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:38,160
globe we take our business very

00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:40,500
seriously as you might expect and in

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,530
today's market we're using our strengths

00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:46,680
to put technology and our customers at

00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:48,780
the heart of everything that we do like

00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,600
many companies fidelity is undergoing

00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:54,210
transformation we're starting to break

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:58,129
up the supertanker application releases

00:00:54,210 --> 00:01:01,170
the monolith very large applications

00:00:58,129 --> 00:01:04,739
moving away from siloed technical teams

00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:07,530
into paly skilled engineers encouraging

00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:10,650
our business to see that small changes

00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:13,950
done frequently and safely at low cost

00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:16,290
is where all the action is last year we

00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:18,810
were very lucky to present a summit on

00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:20,820
how we've deployed multiple cloud

00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:23,509
foundries across multiple different data

00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:27,030
centers using a software-defined network

00:01:23,509 --> 00:01:30,420
we now have over 45 applications running

00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:32,220
on our platform the next 20 minutes is

00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,650
designed to take that one step further

00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:36,390
and talk about the culture and the

00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:40,950
evolution of the team that run the

00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:43,700
platform we are a unique team at

00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:46,860
fidelity the first devops team

00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:48,600
responsible for the entire paas hardware

00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:51,600
and software stack with all its

00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:54,180
associated services look out for us

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,820
today we're all wearing these rather

00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:59,579
dodgy t-shirts in fact this there's some

00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:01,860
over there incidentally we're fairly

00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:03,570
here on mass today because we know that

00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:05,670
cloud foundry is going to be looking

00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:09,810
after things for us whilst her away but

00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:11,700
I think that's for another talk so it's

00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,140
my pleasure to be here today I'm very

00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:16,710
proud to be here

00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:18,660
a little bit nervous I probably tell my

00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:20,750
folks go to the foundation for giving me

00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:24,420
this opportunity to come and talk to you

00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:26,160
as global powers product owner at

00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:29,160
fidelity I find myself in a very

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,650
difficult position since writing the

00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:34,020
title of this talk because not only now

00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:37,050
have I got to stand up here and not trip

00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:39,750
over and not forget what I need to say I

00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:40,200
have to I guess come clean about a few

00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:44,489
things

00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:46,440
so the first confession is about three

00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:47,910
years ago when I was working in an

00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:50,700
infrastructure and architecture

00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:52,830
engineering team we recognized that a

00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:55,230
Cloud Foundry Pass was the next logical

00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:57,780
step in further developing our cloud

00:02:55,230 --> 00:03:01,950
strategy and our adoption of cloud-based

00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:04,110
agile software delivery at fidelity we

00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:06,870
came to this conclusion the head of our

00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:09,090
business and developer community and in

00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:13,170
doing so we put the cart before the

00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:15,540
horse so to speak typically I'm told

00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:18,709
that it happens the other way around the

00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:21,480
business want to have faster cheaper

00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:22,739
high-quality deliveries and they put

00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,350
that pressure on their development

00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:28,440
community for them to find an answer to

00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:31,230
that requirement so from the fidelity

00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:33,930
pass ops engineering teams perspective

00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:36,239
our journey therefore is very much based

00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:38,930
on showcasing the benefits of Cloud

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:41,670
Foundry the platform itself and

00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:45,209
encouraging adoption of that platform to

00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:47,549
our business and developer colleagues in

00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:50,160
reality the biggest challenge for us as

00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:52,590
a team that run the platform is not just

00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:54,810
the platform itself but is all about

00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:57,209
encouraging our developers to do the

00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:59,640
right thing to write good quality

00:03:57,209 --> 00:04:02,310
clouding applications that make the most

00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:06,989
of what the platform offers to have a

00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:08,850
good path experience so working with

00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:11,160
cloud foundry and the platform itself

00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:13,829
has turned everything that we know and

00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:17,400
have done to date upside down on its

00:04:13,829 --> 00:04:20,220
head so as engineers we had to be

00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:22,800
prepared to be disrupted to think

00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:24,930
differently about how we built it but

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,520
also compelled to want that cloud-based

00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:28,500
agile software

00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:32,250
livery enough to be the actual

00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:36,000
disruptors within our company so as you

00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:37,560
know passes this evolving ecosystem if

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,599
you imagine it in your hand

00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,729
bear with me on this one if you imagine

00:04:39,599 --> 00:04:43,770
it in your hand it's this special and

00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:46,860
pure entity it's this constantly

00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:48,720
evolving ecosystem if you enter into

00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,580
your past journey thinking that you need

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,800
never change then you're going to very

00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:55,470
quickly suffocate and kill your path

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:59,190
throwing all of its advantages away with

00:04:55,470 --> 00:05:01,409
it if you work in a brownfield site such

00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:04,319
as the one that we have at fidelity this

00:05:01,409 --> 00:05:05,970
becomes even more of a challenge so the

00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:10,530
first thing that we did was to start

00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:13,259
with a product owner okay so being a

00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:15,990
product owner for a strategic platform a

00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:17,819
financial company like fidelity wants to

00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:21,090
run all of its applications in the

00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:23,750
future I better know my stuff right okay

00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:27,750
so one might argue you need to know

00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:29,580
about SSL encryption you need to be a

00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:32,819
fully hands-on engineer and know about

00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:34,740
quorum algorithms cloud controllers it's

00:05:32,819 --> 00:05:37,800
true I do come from a programming

00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:39,840
background but the real kick I get from

00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,319
working in this industry for over 20

00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:45,599
years now is from building teams and

00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:47,490
challenging the status quo so depending

00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:50,310
upon how you look at it some people

00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:53,909
would say I'm a troublemaker some people

00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:55,889
would say I'm a strategist so I think it

00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:58,409
might be old age because unfortunately

00:05:55,889 --> 00:06:01,860
my brain can only take so much now so

00:05:58,409 --> 00:06:04,289
here's the second confession I leave the

00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:06,090
engineering of the technical stuff to

00:06:04,289 --> 00:06:08,880
those in my team who are far more

00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:10,800
capable than me in knowing exactly what

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,830
to do and how to do it to create the

00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,419
things that we need for the platform yes

00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:17,819
we have an engineering anchor in the

00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:20,370
team which is a swappable role but I'm

00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:23,819
not a hands-on engineer in fact it's

00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:26,009
safer that I'm not because my track

00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:28,349
record for forgetting passwords I can

00:06:26,009 --> 00:06:30,330
see you laughing my track record for

00:06:28,349 --> 00:06:32,699
forgetting passwords is indicating

00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:35,219
enough that I should back off let others

00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:38,130
in the team play to their strengths we

00:06:35,219 --> 00:06:39,360
are one team all equal bringing our own

00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:42,569
skills and

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:45,990
variance to the table - to be buying

00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:47,520
biscuits a lot of them listening to

00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:49,319
someone in the team when they've had a

00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,199
really bad day

00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:55,800
and generally being fiercely protective

00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:58,949
about the past service and my team so we

00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:01,379
can flourish amongst disbelievers so

00:06:58,949 --> 00:07:03,240
let's talk about disbelieving how does

00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:05,939
Cal foundry change the way in which we

00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:09,629
think about risk about security and

00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:11,639
about change in order to answer this for

00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:15,599
a positive future outcome we have to

00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:17,460
look at our past we have for years been

00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:19,620
constantly challenged to meet a vast

00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:23,189
amount of requirements from many other

00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:26,370
teams change management security risk

00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:29,310
audit production support service

00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:33,120
management disaster recovery the list

00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:36,689
goes on traditionally we plan changes

00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:39,210
days weeks sometimes months in advance

00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:41,099
and we plan these changes with lots of

00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:43,789
Excel spreadsheets I'm hoping this is

00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:46,319
resonating with many people in this room

00:07:43,789 --> 00:07:48,539
lots of Gantt charts which I've never

00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:50,819
quite understood and we do this because

00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:53,219
we believe that it D risks the impact of

00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:56,580
that change whilst we get everybody's

00:07:53,219 --> 00:07:58,589
approval to make it we believe that

00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:00,900
having a two-week lead time change on a

00:07:58,589 --> 00:08:03,690
production change somehow mitigates the

00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:05,759
risk of that change let's go one step

00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:09,839
further we'll make the change at the

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:12,270
weekend it's safer to do so right it's

00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:17,610
more cost-effective to do it we can

00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:20,099
still be agile right okay so I jest to

00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:22,289
be fair these teams believe they're

00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:24,300
doing the right thing and historically

00:08:22,289 --> 00:08:26,339
have evolved to be the very much needed

00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:29,939
safety gatekeepers of our production

00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:33,260
systems the safety created by previous

00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:35,909
experience of system failure human error

00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:38,669
the fear of something going wrong and

00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:41,880
perhaps dare I say it in some cases a

00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:43,140
general lack of trust this is what I

00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,990
call scar tissue

00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:47,850
it's the baggage this is the baggage

00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:48,620
that we carry around us from one place

00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:50,670
to the other

00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:52,589
it's the baggage that we have to

00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:53,010
consider to get from one side of the

00:08:52,589 --> 00:08:57,240
room

00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:58,950
to the other so we similar to lots of

00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:03,030
other companies address this by

00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:06,540
employing IT experts application service

00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:08,730
managers project managers we share the

00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:10,410
responsibility across multiple shoulders

00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:13,800
in the belief that to do so we are

00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:16,680
better protected we spend thousands of

00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:19,700
dollars on software we restrict system

00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:24,600
access we impose segregation of duties

00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:27,990
through role based access and in the

00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:32,700
process we've created thou shalt can't

00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:34,800
Ethos the Department of no exists yes I

00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,990
can resonate with that one in fact we

00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:41,640
have a fear of causing an outage and in

00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:43,830
fact perhaps even losing our job so the

00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:47,010
reality of disbelieving is that change

00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:48,840
is expensive our past is all about being

00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:51,240
fearful of change and it takes so much

00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:53,670
energy and cost to deliver something in

00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:56,490
production that sometimes 30 different

00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:58,590
people have agreed to we have systems

00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:00,990
that take weeks even months to get

00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:03,690
agreement for to make those changes from

00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:06,930
all of those interested parties the

00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:11,490
impact assess and de-risked sometimes

00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:12,270
it's deemed too risky to change I'm in

00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:14,670
disbelief

00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:16,980
it's a sad place to be in an otherwise

00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:19,050
exciting industry that we can't fix this

00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:21,300
issue when there is so much

00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:25,380
technological change and in a very

00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:29,190
competitive marketplace so the third

00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:31,260
confession I believe I believe it's

00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:32,910
possible to look through the lens in a

00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:34,740
different way to find an alternative

00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:35,480
solution that helps people from getting

00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:40,020
nervous

00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:42,060
we start small and we start simple we

00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:44,190
start by encouraging developers to take

00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:46,680
responsibility for their configuration

00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:49,320
and code in all environments working to

00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:53,580
a product owner model then we give them

00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:55,680
self-service we build trust we trust the

00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:59,010
technology we trust in its in its

00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:02,670
execution and we trust the team the

00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:06,029
ability to do this is probably the most

00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:08,620
important quality a product owner can

00:11:06,029 --> 00:11:10,660
over the past two years we've been

00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:14,110
looking to tip the traditional way of

00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:17,920
working upside down we have to free our

00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:19,810
minds like neo in the matrix so the

00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,880
fourth confession is that we have sought

00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:24,310
professional help we can't do this on

00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:26,800
our own so working with companies like

00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:29,470
pivotal and engineer better who've

00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,240
helped coach us we've been able to show

00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:34,089
our colleagues that through common sense

00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:38,140
and practical use of simple tooling we

00:11:34,089 --> 00:11:41,320
can challenge everything we can show

00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:43,660
that change is easy safe and cheap

00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:46,630
through simple steps of using cloud

00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:48,670
foundry and pipelines we can offer

00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:50,470
self-service to developers in both

00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:52,570
non-parole and production environments

00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:55,390
without losing control of our

00:11:52,570 --> 00:12:01,510
infrastructure without increasing risk

00:11:55,390 --> 00:12:04,360
or cost or audit ability or security we

00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:06,940
can trust cloud foundry to scale up to

00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:10,089
auto heal and alert when something goes

00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:11,740
wrong we can upgrade our cloud foundry

00:12:10,089 --> 00:12:14,620
platforms during the business day

00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:16,630
without impact this we can even do

00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:19,600
without asking any of the application

00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:21,730
owners for approval we offer the most

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:25,329
secure most up-to-date system at

00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:27,880
fidelity because of this we make

00:12:25,329 --> 00:12:29,910
production firewall changes to the path

00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:33,430
software-defined network during the day

00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:35,640
without a change ticket and we give this

00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:38,890
to self-service to developers and

00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:40,959
product owners it's no longer our

00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:44,170
configuration that we have to manage for

00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:45,940
them we give self-service to developers

00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:48,760
and product owners to deploy their code

00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:52,870
as well when they like it's no longer

00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:55,480
our deployment to manage for them we

00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:58,300
advocate a product team philosophy is

00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:00,670
the key to unlocking high quality

00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:04,270
responsive application and behavior to

00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:06,790
have the best house experience moving

00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:08,920
away from admin tasks driven by service

00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:11,320
and change tickets we can spend more

00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:14,890
time engineering cool stuff like chaos

00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:17,510
calico we run a multi-tenant shared

00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:20,029
platform on the same hardware

00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:22,730
you're safer running in a container so

00:13:20,029 --> 00:13:24,350
you can let it manage itself Cloud

00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:28,130
Foundry does what it says on the tin

00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:35,180
it's happy days and it all starts with a

00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:37,639
product owner okay so we are showing

00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:39,199
through example following best

00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:42,500
development practices that high quality

00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:45,130
code robust pipelines and a logical test

00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:47,990
coverage when combined with automation

00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:50,480
innovation and self-service are powerful

00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:53,660
allies to have when challenged by the

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,130
disbelievers the reality is is that we

00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:57,680
shouldn't have to dodge these bullets

00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:59,630
and if a developer and a product owner

00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:02,089
are willing to take responsibility for

00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:04,579
their application it becomes a winning

00:14:02,089 --> 00:14:07,639
combination to successful cloud adoption

00:14:04,579 --> 00:14:09,889
and agile rapid software development

00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:15,019
delivering quality functionality to our

00:14:09,889 --> 00:14:17,829
business so the fifth confession we do

00:14:15,019 --> 00:14:24,769
as developers do we eat our own dog food

00:14:17,829 --> 00:14:27,319
that was quite glamorous we take

00:14:24,769 --> 00:14:28,819
responsibility for the platform and we

00:14:27,319 --> 00:14:31,069
enable it to be serviced through these

00:14:28,819 --> 00:14:33,920
pipelines we treat infrastructure as

00:14:31,069 --> 00:14:35,779
code we do TDD through pairing in fact

00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,720
90% of what we do is done through

00:14:35,779 --> 00:14:40,310
pairing in this way we're able to very

00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:43,430
quickly share ideas and knowledge

00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:46,190
deliver higher quality products and keep

00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:48,769
our team size tight to a small and equal

00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:52,010
number whilst continually delivering

00:14:48,769 --> 00:14:55,449
MVPs refactoring our code asked whilst

00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:58,579
we learn how and what our customers need

00:14:55,449 --> 00:15:00,769
so how does running cloud foundry and a

00:14:58,579 --> 00:15:03,529
pass change the way in which we build

00:15:00,769 --> 00:15:06,680
teams I was lucky enough to be able to

00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:08,480
choose my team causing trouble scoured

00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:10,940
fidelity looking for the best

00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,290
like-minded team players who might not

00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:14,899
necessarily have all of the right

00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:16,639
technical skills but who had the right

00:15:14,899 --> 00:15:19,250
attitude and that they were able to

00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:22,420
leave their scar-tissue their baggage at

00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:25,069
the door some questioned my choices

00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:27,620
surely I would take the most experienced

00:15:25,069 --> 00:15:30,070
guy if I wanted to innovate and create a

00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:33,430
robust and strategic and fun

00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:36,430
he knew flat that funky new platform no

00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:38,410
I went looking for the lean travelers

00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:41,200
the ones who really wanted to make a

00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:45,310
difference I've watched the team grow

00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:48,070
I'm very proud and I've seen you grow

00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:50,440
each member of the team being genuinely

00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:52,630
excited about new technology and

00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:55,810
learning new skills working in this

00:15:52,630 --> 00:16:00,550
DevOps Minerva manner to achieve a high

00:15:55,810 --> 00:16:01,930
quality platform but there's a but rome

00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:03,640
wasn't built in a day and

00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:05,890
transformational change is very

00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:09,070
challenging and there are occasions when

00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:11,200
we really do feel like walking away we

00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:14,230
feel sometimes that we are a small voice

00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:16,390
in an otherwise crowded room so the

00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:18,850
sixth confession is all about patience

00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:20,740
today every company is currently at a

00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:23,830
different level of cloud adoption and

00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:25,360
agile development maturity some people

00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:27,940
get it some people don't

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,850
the reality is that a company such as

00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:32,950
fidelity is changing it may take us a

00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:35,890
while to achieve but we've made a great

00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:38,020
start and Cloud Foundry and being part

00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:40,060
of an open-source community and through

00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:42,370
building partnerships with others have

00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:45,760
greatly helped us and will continue to

00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:47,530
help us on that journey so one thing

00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:49,150
that would definitely greatly increase

00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:53,350
our levels of a patience and

00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:56,080
understanding we talk about empathy to

00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:58,990
successfully evangelize change within

00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:01,120
our enterprise as a ping-pong table we

00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:04,120
don't have one yet so maybe that's an

00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:06,459
extra confession so I'm drawing to a

00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:09,760
close so before I find a very very large

00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:12,910
tuna tonic my penultimate confession is

00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:15,400
that it's okay it's okay to get things

00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:17,620
wrong and it's okay to change our minds

00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:20,500
if we're strong enough to admit that we

00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:23,290
got it wrong we can learn and adapt we

00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:25,300
gain more strength through knowledge if

00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:27,750
we accept that it's okay to change our

00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:31,150
minds we end up delivering something

00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:35,020
quicker as we made a decision based on

00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:38,200
the information at that time in this way

00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:40,750
we can try things very quickly and we

00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,700
can learn from them most importantly we

00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:44,400
can in a

00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:46,440
this alternative way of working in an

00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,340
otherwise traditional enterprise gives

00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:52,050
us as a path ops team tremendous agility

00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:56,010
enabling us as a team to switch tracks

00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:57,750
quickly and cheaply so my last

00:17:56,010 --> 00:18:00,210
confession

00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:02,070
perhaps a strange one when we are

00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:06,450
supposed to be and required to be

00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:09,900
professional at all times is that we

00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:11,760
have fun and we do have a laugh some of

00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:13,890
us spend more time at work than we do

00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,990
with our families and at home so we

00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:17,640
really ought to make it count so if

00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:19,110
you're not having fun you're probably in

00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,840
the wrong job

00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:34,160
so it seems customary to close

00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:36,570
presentations in this way so thank you

00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,010
you've been a very kind audience there's

00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:39,540
been no booing or at least I haven't

00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:40,950
heard it down here and you haven't

00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:42,810
thrown anything that's at least not
