Description: 
	Keynote - A Team of Women are Already Leading the Olympic Transformation. Will Cloud be the Catalyst for Greater Diversity in IT? - Ursula Morgenstern, Global Head of Consulting & Systems Integration, Atos

Thanks to cloud, analytics and mobile technologies, the Olympics is being transformed into a global connected experience through a centralized cloud model.  This transformation is being led by an outstanding team of senior women at Atos.  Unfortunately, the diversity gap, in particular the gender balance, remains stronger in IT than in other industries. 

Research is showing that diversity including gender diversity has a positive impact on corporate performance. 

Will open and collaborative technologies such as cloud create the pull for women and minorities to â€“ at last - extend their contribution to IT and, further, to enterprise innovation and performance?

when the first olympic games in the modern era were held in 1896 the only

00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:15,719
way to experience them was by being physically there in athens live of the

00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:18,020
events

00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:26,000
fast-forward to 1924 and the Olympic games were first broadcast live on radio it

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,470
wasn't until 1948 that the live events first broadcast I directly

00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:33,470
into peoples homes on TV

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,180
2016 marks in many respects the culmination of the Olympic Games journey

00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:59,879
of more than a century rio 2016 will be an olympic games that many consume live

00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:02,879
through digital channels

00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:10,710
this scale of progress doesn't happen by chance it is the result of vision and

00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:15,630
hard work for us the Olympic Games the perfect example of human achievement

00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:21,750
powered by technology and as worldwide IT partner we are proud to enter the

00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:25,950
Olympic Games securely into a fully connected and digital experience

00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:47,350
good morning the Olympic Games the biggest sporting event in the world

00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:55,990
10,500 athletes 23,000 journalists fifty thousand volunteers

00:01:55,990 --> 00:02:02,590
300,000 members of the Olympic family think 20 times the football world cup

00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:08,920
the olympic games are watched by four billion people

00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:13,390
worldwide and the results of the olympic games are brought in less than

00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:22,000
zero five seconds to the world by Atlas technology it is a fairly signal height

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,459
you know high-visibility event and it attracts a certain type of people we are

00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:33,580
in rio de janeiro we had 400 security events per second attacking the olympic

00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:39,760
games with no impact to the games itself and that is actually doubled the number

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:46,360
of London where we had about 200 events per seconds think about setting up and

00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:52,720
running the olympic games like setting up a company in seven years from zero

00:02:52,720 --> 00:03:00,519
to 200,000 employees operating for 16 days for the Olympics and 11 days for

00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:11,320
the Paralympics 24 by 7 with 4 billion people watching and we do that every two

00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:18,610
years for the winter and summer games in completely different geographies atlas

00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:23,019
has been part of the olympic games since 1992 in Barcelona and we actually

00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:29,140
started of with clients of a technology the first time in Barcelona and it's in

00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:35,170
rio de janeiro the cloud found its way into the Olympic squad we ran some of

00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:42,400
our none critical games applications on the cloud and in PyeongChang in south

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,970
korea for the winter games into those in 2018 all of the Olympic Games

00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:53,990
will be delivered over the cloud and it that will help to of course provide

00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:59,150
easier information access to the athletes to the journalists to the to

00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:05,060
the Olympic family but also of course make it a better customer experience to

00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:10,010
everybody watching rio de janeiro was the most connected games ever

00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:16,100
we actually had more people consuming the olympic games by a social media then

00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:23,330
through a traditional TV broadcasting technology truly a world-first but we

00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:28,820
also not using technology only for customer experience cloud technology is

00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:33,710
changing the way how we prepare and test and monitor and deliver the olympic

00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:37,670
games just for those of you who are interested into testing we are testing

00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:48,290
every games 200,000 hours before and the start day with the opening ceremony from

00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:54,410
and what will change for example testing now we now for PyeongChang we are

00:04:54,410 --> 00:05:02,270
holding a virtual lab or virtual venue in our cloud and so we can start to test

00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:08,240
the configuration the equipment the the setup of the venue technology and

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,100
imagine how bigger relief is that is for the team which is responsible for

00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:18,290
the beach volleyball venue which normally set up just weeks before the

00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:23,570
game start with technology being one of the last things being allowed into the

00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:28,760
venue itself reducing compressing our time to test to

00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:37,250
sometimes days so we now can pre-test into the cloud in the cloud so you might

00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:42,560
wonder what has diversity to do with olympic games and perhaps with a cloud

00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:49,700
the last three olympic games have been delivered by female chief integration

00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:55,250
officers on the left side you're seeing Marta she has been delivering the Sochi

00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:55,930
games

00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:01,330
and she is now the CEO of our major events team next to me you see Michelle

00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:07,030
hiren she was not only the deputy of cheif integration officer in Beijing she

00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:11,830
was running the london games she was running the rio games and after a

00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,419
well-deserved break

00:06:13,419 --> 00:06:19,840
she will be in december in Tokio getting ready for 2020

00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,729
40 percent of our major events team is female management team senior management

00:06:24,729 --> 00:06:29,560
team is female running one of the most hard profile technology projects in

00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:40,240
the world so why does diversity matter does it matter for business again we

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:48,160
have many many studies which show that diverse companies outperform their

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:53,229
peers here a recent study of McKinsey the top quarter of gender diverse

00:06:53,229 --> 00:06:58,150
companies out perform their peers by fifteen percent and of

00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:02,979
course correlation doesn't mean causation that's understood but there's

00:07:02,979 --> 00:07:07,300
enough studies to say that we can assume that a diverse leadership diverse

00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:15,490
company its output is providing some form of competitive advantage so have we made

00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:21,400
progress we have been speaking about technology diversity for many many years

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:29,050
this chart is showing us through the colors of the country's the percentage

00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:33,639
of women in senior management position and with the arrows showing you the

00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:40,360
trend between 2009 in 2015 and what we can see here is that yes in Russia

00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:44,169
indeed the one the country has forty percent of women in senior management

00:07:44,169 --> 00:07:49,750
unfortunately going down in the Western world about twenty to thirty percent of

00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:57,699
women in senior management position but clearly a lot of red so the answer is we

00:07:57,699 --> 00:08:03,220
have made some progress but definitely slow and limited to date

00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:09,880
and of course diversity in a business that is not only a matter for business

00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:14,230
itself it's also of course the society in which we grow up in which we live and

00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:19,900
definitely the values and belief systems in society influence of how we you know

00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:27,070
how how diversity can play out and and can be brought to bear in a company in

00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:32,979
addition to values in the society we also of course know about unconscious

00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:38,140
bias and that plays a huge role we all like to hang out with the same type of people

00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:43,060
we like to hire and promote people which are similar to us and the unconscious

00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:51,010
bias is preventing us to spot an inequality occurs and again

00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:54,310
equality doesn't mean we need to be all the same and the working environment

00:08:54,310 --> 00:09:03,850
needs to be needs to cater for equality as well we talk about senior women

00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:09,760
like of her board representation in the technology industry but if you look at

00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:16,000
the three challenges which women have in the corporate world you know we can

00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,800
break it out down in we are unable to enter we're stuck in the middle and we are locked

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,360
out of the top if you look at the technology industry in comparison to

00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:32,260
other industries our biggest problem is actually to attract women the average of

00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:37,180
entry-level roll across all industries is forty-five percent we attract

00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:42,490
thirty-seven percent and of course that's linked to the fact that we do not

00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:46,810
have enough girls studying you know math and science subjects that we don't have

00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:52,180
enough you know women and taking up engineering degrees and technology

00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:58,510
degrees limiting the pool of women we have access to and if you all

00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:04,420
continue to hire based on you know the recruitment criteria needs to have

00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:08,080
studied needs to have a technology degree need to have an engineering

00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,250
degree

00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:14,050
guess what we will not make a big progress in regards to diversity in the

00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:15,139
technology industry

00:10:15,139 --> 00:10:23,089
so one for example one of the programs our some of our people here youngster or

00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:30,199
graduates running the UK is the female graduates is called IT meet high tea in

00:10:30,199 --> 00:10:36,799
a nice hotel with British tea as one would have they are inviting the female our female

00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:42,470
staff is talking to female students about what technology jobs we can offer

00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:52,639
and of course we are looking at in Atos how we can for example broaden our

00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:58,040
skills pool by retraining people reskilling people by reaching out to

00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:02,179
different degrees but also by reaching out to high schools and offering

00:11:02,179 --> 00:11:09,949
internship programs from the very start the second topic which we all discuss

00:11:09,949 --> 00:11:18,350
often is pay gap according to the World Economic Forum in average men earn

00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:25,009
$20,000 women eleven thousand dollars in the world and just to cheer you up

00:11:25,009 --> 00:11:32,239
it will take us 113 years if you continue at this pace to close the pay

00:11:32,239 --> 00:11:39,619
gap and of course there are many reasons for that one of the reasons of course

00:11:39,619 --> 00:11:45,319
women work more often part-time jobs women join industries which have

00:11:45,319 --> 00:11:53,929
lower-paid roles like nursing and hospitality and women are

00:11:53,929 --> 00:12:01,730
impacted by the children years women over 40 never catch up on the gap on the

00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:07,819
pay gap which develops in that time would using the technology industry as

00:12:07,819 --> 00:12:13,369
you can see on the left side we pay more so we pay well but still twenty percent

00:12:13,369 --> 00:12:20,509
less pay for women and that's again a UK statistic then we do but you know that

00:12:20,509 --> 00:12:23,539
it's you know it's similar we have stated you know data across the world

00:12:23,539 --> 00:12:27,450
but very similar to what we see across the world 20 percent

00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:33,600
unless the only positive i take out of this as a senior executive the pay gap

00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,920
is clearly not widening when i reach the top of the industry in

00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:43,320
comparison to some of the industry's other industries so i was wondering so

00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:48,480
clearly we still have a problem as far as diversity is concerned and of

00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,680
course it takes time it as i said it takes time to make these changes and i

00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:59,610
was wondering whether cloud companies actually having a positive impact on

00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:04,800
diversity so I couldn't find data points across the whole

00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,420
industry so we were looking at the big names in the cloud industry and we're

00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:13,320
trying to think okay what's the percentage of women in this industry and

00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:19,350
indeed the numbers are slightly higher so i would say that the cloud the true

00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:24,150
cloud companies have about thirty percent of women in their business so

00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:29,790
five percentage points more than the average technology industry but

00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:36,750
clearly yet not the gender parity which were looking for and I must say I heard

00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:42,180
from and cydia that we have reached gender parity in our cloud foundry

00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:47,790
team in India we have fifty percent of our team of women and fifty percent of our

00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:53,220
our team is men and that carries on into the leadership team which i think is a

00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:56,730
fantastic achievement of of the team and our company

00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:09,080
as such cloud is is really you know it enables us clouded technology is

00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:13,490
driving the digital workplace we can work anywhere we can work remotely we

00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:20,060
can and resource share and it's also of course driving different ways of working

00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:24,440
we heard about agile working how important it is agile working is

00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:28,520
particularly successful if you have multi skilled teams again in diverse

00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:33,200
teams because it allows us to bring the ideas into the process very fast and do

00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:37,790
the learn fact that you know learn filling fast and also cloud is enabling

00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:43,880
businesses to have a global reach fifty percent of the consumers are women

00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:51,080
across that you have culturally diverse consumers and believe me cloud adoption

00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:57,590
and buying behavior varies and is different between men and women and

00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:01,880
between different cultures so again surely as cloud companies or companies

00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:05,960
operating in the cloud diversity should matter

00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:12,440
so what else can you know what can we do what works what can be learned

00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:16,640
from companies we have done it the single most important point is

00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:23,270
commitment business change change only happens when people commit senior people

00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:27,650
but everybody else in the room as well lookout for a woman in your

00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:34,220
business and see how you can help her practically really helped her to achieve

00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:40,550
her career goals explain her the world of working from a male perspective go to

00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:45,950
high schools talk to your children and explain them the fantastic jobs we have

00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:53,510
in the technology industry and don't forget to look at your numbers because

00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:57,560
look at your hiring statistic look at your recruitment statistic look at your

00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:03,589
promotion statistics there can you see inequality and then go and unlock

00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:10,940
the biases can be simple processing it can be simple you know looking at at you

00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,560
know how many women do

00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:17,900
we actually asked to be put forward to promotion interviews and what your

00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:23,600
unconscious bias I heard yesterday a story of a very well-known technology company

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:30,020
in the UK run by female co she insisted that they are looking at a diverse

00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:34,850
pipeline of recruitment for their graduate internship programs and all

00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:40,640
those going well till the moment the job offers were made the diverse pipeline

00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:47,180
turned into male officers only showing you how deep-rooted our unconscious

00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:52,760
biases are looking for people who are similar to ourselves and of course learn

00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:57,440
from others what we have found everybody's interested to share and

00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,460
often we actually willing to come together to change the technology

00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:11,480
industry together i have talked about diversity in general diversity so far

00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:21,319
and coming back to the study which showed here at the beginning think about

00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:23,360
ethnic diversity as well

00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:28,400
top quartile ethnic diverse companies are outperforming their peers by

00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:35,810
thirty-five percent and it should not surprise you there for that our team of

00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:44,000
rio de janeiro contained 23 different nationalities cultural diversity is

00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:51,470
planned into the way how we prepare operate and deliver the games and for us

00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:56,270
diversity doesn't stop there for me and for the team

00:17:56,870 --> 00:18:02,929
many of the fond memories and you know remind other where the remarkable

00:18:02,929 --> 00:18:11,750
achievement of the Paralympics athletes during Rio 2016 and again for us that is

00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:18,890
another angle on diversity and again if you're operating in the cloud

00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:23,120
that you're not making your systems you know accessible making them

00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:23,690
easy

00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:30,860
too consumed by a wide variety of people by an aging consumer base is

00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:36,230
critical again for all of us and to succeed in business in the long term

00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:44,389
so how would I conclude diversity matters and diversity matters from a

00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:52,700
business perspective a diverse workforce should give every company a competitive

00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:59,899
advantage should give you better access to a diverse global consumer base so my

00:18:59,899 --> 00:19:07,970
advice to you if you want to outperform your peers simply get yourself a

00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:15,169
diverse workforce so thank you very much and thank you very much to the

00:19:15,169 --> 00:19:18,169

00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:24,360
and my thank you very much to count cloud foundry to give me this

00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:27,630
