Description: 
	Public Cloud Foundry Platforms in Europe: What Have We Learned and Where Can We Go Next? - Moderated by Dan Young, EngineerBetter

Public Cloud Foundry platforms form an essential part of the ecosystem and a useful on-ramp for new users. This panel will explore the operational lessons that have been learned from running CF at scale and find out how enterprises are using public CF for production apps. What features would service providers like in CF and what would users like to see from their providers? Finally, what non-technical factors are at play in the often complex European market and how can the community work to build better public PaaS for this region?

To discover more about public CF come and meet Marco Hochstrasser (Head of Cloud Platform, Swisscom), Julian Fischer (CEO, Anynines), Jonathan Matthews (Principal Engineer, M&S Digital), Dominic Harries (Lead Developer, IBM Bluemix Garage) and Colin Humphreys (CTO for Cloud, Pivotal). The panel is moderated by Dan Young (CEO, EngineerBetter)

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,970
okay this is a panel discussion about

00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:08,880
public cloud foundry platforms in Europe

00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:11,370
and it's really intended to be useful if

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,650
you are thinking about using public

00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:16,619
commenter platform public cloud laundry

00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:18,840
or you are operating your okhla own

00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:20,580
Cloud Foundry and you would like to

00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,800
learn from some of the people that do it

00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:25,260
at scale

00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:27,920
so before we start can you put up your

00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:34,800
hands if you're already using a public

00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:36,450
cloud foundry pass okay take note

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,040
panelists so you can respond the

00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,770
property to audience and when you put up

00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:44,510
your hand if you don't use one but you

00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:44,510
operate your own cloud foundry instead

00:00:45,289 --> 00:00:51,840
okay right I'm gonna ask the panelists

00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,250
to introduce themselves but before that

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,840
mascara special make a special mention

00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:58,109
for the ones who couldn't make it so

00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:00,539
holy Cummings from remix garish sadly

00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:03,000
couldn't be here Bridgette from pivotal

00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:04,979
and Rebecca from re anything from

00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,799
CenturyLink couldn't come so look

00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:10,020
forward to having them on a future panel

00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,880
so my name's Dan young I work at a cloud

00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,340
foundry consultancy called engineer

00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,930
better and I have used a number of

00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,479
different public cloud foundry providers

00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:22,680
so I have opinions of my own I will now

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:26,159
let the panel introduce themselves hello

00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:29,310
I'm Jonathan Matthews despite what it

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:32,130
might say in your apps in your schedule

00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:35,520
I do not represent any large UK retailer

00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:36,000
here today I'm a independent cloud

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,869
foundry

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:44,340
integrator I've used all of the people

00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:45,840
on this panel so - I've used products

00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,630
provided by all of the people on this

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,360
panel today and have opinions about all

00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:52,390
of them and some of the people about

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,909
this on this panel

00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:57,940
as well but I'm sure will not come on to

00:01:54,909 --> 00:02:01,030
the house today so yes I am if you like

00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:03,700
the slight voice of the customer in this

00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:06,250
scenario thank you

00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:09,789
I'm Jorgen Fisher CEO of any nights and

00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:14,680
we started as a platform and our also do

00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:16,680
consultancy around fly foundry I'm Colin

00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:20,830
Humphries I'm CTO for clout at pivotal

00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:22,390
we don't have a public European has at

00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:24,340
the moment but we're giving it a lot of

00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:28,360
thought we do have a public past

00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:30,070
operates out of the u.s. my name is

00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,290
Marco Strasser I'm running the cloud

00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:34,330
development moon Swisscom our system is

00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:36,880
a Swiss service provider and we run a

00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:38,800
public offering of cloth laundry as well

00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:43,480
as a couple of enterprise offerings

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:46,480
around them hi I'm Dominic Harry's they

00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:49,030
work at the bluemix garage in London for

00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,760
IBM and wicker I'm Qaeda bomb slightly

00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:53,680
on the user side I guess of the public

00:02:51,760 --> 00:03:03,370
cloud using bluemix with customers to

00:02:53,680 --> 00:03:05,290
run projects okay so if I was to look at

00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:07,900
my first question is going to be some

00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:10,690
operations related I think so if I was

00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:13,209
to look at all the different API

00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:16,900
versions Park until API versions if you

00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:18,970
go to an CF API bluemix.net somebody's

00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:22,180
written her app which shows you these

00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:23,799
they're all different now that would

00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:27,370
imply that there may be some challenges

00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:32,190
in deploying Cloud Foundry at scale

00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:32,190
why are they different that's a special

00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:41,590
why is yours different

00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:45,010
you mean the platform did the versions

00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:46,239
of the api's that are being used on your

00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:49,150
platform so if you compare that with

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,829
pivotal and with bluemix and they're all

00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:54,130
different they're all slightly different

00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:56,260
versions well actually only thing that's

00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:58,989
different on our platform is the data

00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:02,750
services so but despite of that it's

00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:05,630
just the regular clownery

00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:08,870
so that's they don't set the question I

00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:11,960
was just looking and what what

00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:13,310
challenges might you have when deploying

00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,840
technology that means you can't always

00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:16,340
just run the late session you won't

00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,290
appear to have different Cadence's of

00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:21,530
deployment and upgrade I'm wondering if

00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:24,110
that I possibly know as a consumer I've

00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:25,660
interesting understanding why you have

00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:30,110
the particular cadence that you have

00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:32,630
providers so yeah one thing I'd like to

00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:35,210
see around their cloud foundry community

00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:38,990
is to organize well let's say a delivery

00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:41,000
cadence and well it's maybe a release

00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:45,320
management that it makes it easier to do

00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,180
that because as a public as an offering

00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:49,760
based on open source my family you have

00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:52,400
to manage that yourself so of course you

00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:54,290
have to provide a CI pipeline go through

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,640
testing all the the components you want

00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:56,990
to buy it a certain version and see

00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,610
whether it works with all the other

00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:00,380
components you might have other

00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:03,140
providers don't health for example our

00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:04,630
billing system that takes usage data and

00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:08,870
translate it into something that we can

00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:11,419
generate invoices from so yes that's

00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:13,370
that something would be desirable and it

00:05:11,419 --> 00:05:15,320
of course it is a certain burden because

00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:17,870
you have to organize that and consumes

00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:22,300
resources that could actually be shared

00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:22,300
with other platform providers as well

00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:28,970
talk about a pivotal Web Services the

00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:30,890
pivot web services runs the kind of

00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:32,720
latest the very latest version the

00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:34,580
bleeding edge so built Web Services

00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,560
you'll get I haven't heard the other

00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:37,700
api's last time I did check if two Web

00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,070
Services was ahead of all the other

00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:42,080
providers so we're running the latest

00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:43,370
versions we test it before it goes to

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,830
pivot to web services but then it runs

00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:48,169
as a service in pivotal web services

00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:50,150
before it goes into PCF which is our

00:05:48,169 --> 00:05:51,530
product that you installed on Prem so

00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:53,060
you have that additional layer of kind

00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:55,070
of testing with thousands of users

00:05:53,060 --> 00:06:00,979
before it becomes part of the on Prem

00:05:55,070 --> 00:06:03,500
product yeah so we we do it almost the

00:06:00,979 --> 00:06:05,290
same we run roughly two to four weeks

00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:09,530
behind the official release which is

00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:12,410
roughly second or third after after PWAs

00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:14,450
goes knife and we try to be very very ad

00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:15,550
hoc and for various reason there are

00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:18,160
CVEs there's

00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:19,870
the issue so you need to be very much on

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,419
the release which is heavy for uses

00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:24,490
because sometimes ApS which is our

00:06:22,419 --> 00:06:26,199
billing parts need to switch as as Julie

00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:28,720
mentioned so you have challenges there

00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:30,940
but I think we we really focused on

00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,330
having a system to really upgrade very

00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:33,340
fast

00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:35,110
because we I think this is our duty to

00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:36,580
be on track it's an open source product

00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:38,590
we will find box we will find security

00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:44,940
issues we need to be very very much on

00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:48,729
track and this is where you focus on so

00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:50,560
bluemix is massive I think it's got more

00:06:48,729 --> 00:06:52,000
users than any other public cloud

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,250
platform so we have to do a bunch of

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,590
scalability it's adding twenty thousand

00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:58,360
users a week yes so there's a lot of

00:06:56,590 --> 00:07:00,120
scalability testing and that kind of

00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:02,440
thing and I know there's a bunch of

00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,870
custom security staff and other

00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:07,120
integration things that go in the other

00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:09,880
interesting thing about bluemix is that

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,190
we have kind of single tenant

00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:14,889
environments and local environments that

00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:17,229
we manage for our customers and so then

00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:19,780
they get kind of a bit of choice about

00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:22,900
when they upgrade so if you know there's

00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:24,550
a specific event or a specific load that

00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:26,590
they need at a certain time of year they

00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:28,990
can postpone the upgrade just to make

00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:30,610
sure everything stays so there there's a

00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:36,490
window that customers get to choose

00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:37,630
where they upgrading and I think you

00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,729
keep going over there I've got much fun

00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:43,000
yeah

00:07:38,729 --> 00:07:45,310
so what feature do you not have that you

00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,039
wish you had as a provider in cloud

00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:49,210
pounded what is it that it might be

00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:51,909
something that is coming down the road

00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:53,110
that isn't here yet or something that is

00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:54,819
not even conceived of yet

00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:56,740
what would completely change your

00:07:54,819 --> 00:08:05,169
ability to operate at that sort of scale

00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:07,330
or would help the business I think so

00:08:05,169 --> 00:08:10,539
this is something that's coming the

00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:12,490
ability to have kind of this kind of

00:08:10,539 --> 00:08:16,659
seamless deployment to multiple

00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:19,330
availability zones so we have patterns

00:08:16,659 --> 00:08:23,110
to do that which require a bit of manual

00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:25,360
work we have some services in beta

00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:27,399
there's a CDN service engagement that

00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,930
kind of thing which help to help

00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:32,289
developers to do that but have

00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:34,599
kind of a single CF push and magically

00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:39,610
everything just works would be great

00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:41,169
obviously it's very difficult I think as

00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:43,330
we talk about public club boundaries I

00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:45,430
think the it's also important to see the

00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:47,670
essence why do we need public providers

00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:50,710
in Europe why is Cloud Foundry

00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:52,060
worthwhile to run publicly and I think

00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:55,360
it's important for our customers to move

00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:58,210
workload around to select which country

00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,490
they want to save the data if they need

00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:02,200
to and this is obviously why we build it

00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:04,470
up in Switzerland there are certain

00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:07,060
customers who want to have it there and

00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:09,160
what is missing there and what I think

00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:11,680
we we can really leverage ourselves as a

00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:14,110
group and I mean we are competitors to a

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,430
certain kind but I think next up we

00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:18,430
should aim and what I'm really missing

00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:20,529
is that we heavily share our services

00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:23,260
and our service market places that we

00:09:20,529 --> 00:09:25,120
heavily go forward and say okay you can

00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:26,380
get old whatever services in this clown

00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,480
in this clown and we just share it

00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:32,080
together to give the customer the full

00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:35,020
experience of a public mesh of cloud

00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:39,820
foundries in Europe I think this is the

00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:41,080
biggest myths I see I think the biggest

00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:44,709
feature I think coming down the pipeline

00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:46,089
it's gonna be the isolation segments

00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:47,980
have some you've you know talked earlier

00:09:46,089 --> 00:09:50,410
on that gives you the ability to run

00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:52,150
apps on a separate set of infrastructure

00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:53,830
so I could see for public cloud

00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:55,870
providers you could have a customer

00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:57,279
who's using Cloud Foundry quite happily

00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:58,860
and then has some apps that need to be

00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,940
essentially on their own set of

00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,620
infrastructure so you could then allow

00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:04,480
customer to burst out to their own

00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:06,310
infrastructure for a particular app so

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,350
you gives you the isolation of a set of

00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:10,900
runtime components but it means that the

00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:12,790
customer doesn't have to pay for all of

00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:14,230
the control vain because the control

00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:15,760
plane can be kind of part of your core

00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:17,410
Cloud Foundry so they give you this

00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,500
benefit finger to isolate particular

00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:21,550
workloads that's required so yeah I

00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:25,570
think that's gonna be useful for public

00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:27,370
pass providers so I totally agree that

00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:29,320
more the data center awareness is

00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:32,500
something that should be part of Cloud

00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:35,290
Foundry at Sunday as it is a motivation

00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:38,829
for many Cloud Foundry users or adapters

00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:39,279
to go for multi region strategies that's

00:10:38,829 --> 00:10:40,700
true

00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:44,030
I'm also agree

00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:46,760
to my first opinion that data services

00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:49,850
are important to have a certain set of

00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:51,710
common data services so that users can

00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:53,750
develop against the cloud from any

00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:55,850
platform and that there's ensured that

00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:57,230
you can just take this application and

00:10:55,850 --> 00:11:00,290
run it somewhere else as well

00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:04,240
and yes

00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:06,020
that's basically my thoughts on this I

00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,110
have a go answering this question

00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:10,940
correct well yeah I was about to ask you

00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:12,770
what what's the best thing and the worst

00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:16,400
thing from the user perspective about

00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:16,790
using public cloud foundry in question

00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,560
yeah

00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:21,980
previous research is that the biggest

00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:24,590
missing thing as a consumer public CF in

00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:26,060
in Europe is we have I think four

00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:28,580
providers here only two of whom are

00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:30,170
actually technically if you want to get

00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:50,650
your lawyers involved really you I

00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:50,650
believe for me or not that's another one

00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:00,590
so long story short there from a

00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:03,320
consumer perspective the thing I want

00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:04,610
more I want is more more in you

00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:07,220
providers who I can point out and go

00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:09,080
this is definitely in scope of things

00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:11,870
like PCI this is definitely in scope for

00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:14,720
personal data things where I don't have

00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:15,740
to cross any potentially what's the

00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,720
difference between the EU and your a

00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:19,880
boundaries things like that

00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:22,940
and then I forgot the question you asked

00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:24,760
me I said what what was the best what is

00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:26,780
the best thing and the worst thing about

00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,950
depending on the public cloud vendor

00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:30,760
provider for your life instead of

00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:34,010
operating your own the best thing is

00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:35,960
service that I'm sure everyone who

00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:39,860
consumes public CF is aware of that as

00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:45,080
being a huge win the the worst thing I

00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:48,050
think is mitigating the difference in

00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:49,730
support the difference in transparency

00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:50,410
that you get from different providers in

00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:53,410
the case of

00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:55,060
problems happening perhaps not

00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:57,970
intentional difference in transparency

00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:59,079
but just the effect of how their support

00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:02,129
works in the way that they communicate

00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:04,360
that with the public that has been a

00:13:02,129 --> 00:13:10,480
significant issue for the organizations

00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:11,560
that I work with I realize we're sound

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,970
live in a furious agreement at the

00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,860
moment on this panel I just noticed

00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:18,310
something I wanted to pick up on maybe a

00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:20,079
little bit contentious so we're talking

00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:22,029
about services different services in the

00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,050
providers and Julie DeMarco mentioned

00:13:22,029 --> 00:13:25,600
how they think we should have a common

00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:27,399
range of services now also pivotal sales

00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,379
pitch the pivotal services you can

00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:30,790
deploy from piece yeah you can deploy

00:13:29,379 --> 00:13:32,680
them to any iron provider that you want

00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:34,810
so you have this kind of layer above

00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:37,060
your eye as you can put data services

00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:38,620
down wherever you want but I wouldn't

00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:40,600
want to sit on this panel icky use IBM

00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:42,850
of trying to differentiate by their

00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:45,040
services and you lock you into IBM's

00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:46,000
powers by providing the services that

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,379
are behind there you know I wouldn't

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:53,319
want to say that but if that was said

00:13:47,379 --> 00:13:55,060
how would I be on respond to that so I

00:13:53,319 --> 00:13:57,550
would say I don't know what you're

00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:59,980
talking about if you talk about cloud if

00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:02,560
you're talking about Cloudant that that

00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:04,839
runs on AWS in this year if you're

00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:17,500
talking about composed or i/o that runs

00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:19,810
on not today and stay tuned I did want

00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:21,610
to touch on it on on the motivations of

00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:23,350
the different providers being in the

00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:25,269
market because I think that's it helps

00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:28,240
users to understand that so they can

00:14:25,269 --> 00:14:29,529
make better decisions so um I think

00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,410
Colleen might have alluded there to some

00:14:29,529 --> 00:14:33,519
other motivations allegedly that IBM

00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:36,189
would have which is you know we've got

00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:38,170
this big market where this marketplace

00:14:36,189 --> 00:14:41,589
of middleware services and the past is

00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:44,290
kind of a way of reaching that but

00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:48,819
pivotal obviously are using the very

00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:51,160
latest code in PWS and John what did we

00:14:48,819 --> 00:14:53,470
discover yesterday in there in the

00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:56,430
training things were a little bit wobbly

00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:56,430
maybe sometimes

00:14:57,150 --> 00:15:06,150
absolutely see the keeper here yeah

00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:09,690
absolutely see the benefit to do dog

00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:11,100
fooding the the product on before big

00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:13,350
enterprise customers get there okay

00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:17,450
coming down but it's um we certainly

00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:19,740
couldn't see any signs of that the

00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:22,920
slight wobbliness yesterday being

00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:25,339
recognized anywhere although to be fair

00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:28,290
that was that was a relative outlier

00:15:25,339 --> 00:15:30,320
basically pure ly talking about PWS

00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:33,380
there we don't generally see that as a

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:36,480
as a problem but we definitely did see

00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:38,400
we didn't get information coming forward

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,430
about that I'm sure you would get if you

00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:43,920
were paying big big enterprise bucks but

00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:45,930
it was definitely interesting an

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,600
interesting day yesterday give him given

00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:51,360
the context of eliciting universal okay

00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:53,460
I can yeah I I wasn't then a train

00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,560
yesterday I mean and obviously PW as I

00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:57,750
mentioned earlier does run the latest

00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:00,240
and greatest code we put it to extensive

00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:02,520
testing via concourse you know so it's a

00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,740
heavily tested before it goes out but

00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:07,440
you know we do have like bugs will

00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:08,670
emerge I can say you know I was seven II

00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,160
had been a pivotal for seven months

00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:13,050
prior to that I was I used PWS

00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:16,560
extensively as a customer and in my

00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:18,779
experience it was the most stable public

00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,950
cloud foundry you know and we're looking

00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:22,110
potentially are bringing it to Europe

00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:22,680
running pdbs in Europe but as I said

00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:24,390
earlier

00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,920
Peter s does run the latest and greatest

00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:27,180
that means if you're paying for PCF you

00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,920
get something that's far more heavily

00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:31,050
tested you know it's gone through far

00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:32,910
more in terms of you know has all the

00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:33,900
security fixes everything else you can

00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:36,240
possibly get into there to make it a

00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:39,110
good as possible so obviously a pivotal

00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:41,940
where we have but the PCF is our focus

00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:42,320
PWS is something we use to make PCF

00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:45,810
better

00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:48,089
so yeah the I guess the message there is

00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:50,790
that it's not it's not meant to be a

00:16:48,089 --> 00:16:53,820
profit-making venture it's it's kind of

00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:55,650
a it's a very useful service but it also

00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:57,209
helps pivotal actually get out there put

00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:57,630
the module put a great try before you

00:16:57,209 --> 00:16:59,550
buy

00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:02,760
you know and it's fantastic for really

00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:05,520
but we we wore the code we ship we run

00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:08,770
as a service before you run as a service

00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:10,900
but our focus is PCF

00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:13,449
so one of the customers I've been

00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:15,579
working with had an incredible statistic

00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:17,829
where they said they'd it was their

00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:20,890
Christmas food ordering website and they

00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:22,420
had moved from a situation where they

00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:24,699
are spending ninety eight thousand

00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:25,959
dollars on Hardware just for that you

00:17:24,699 --> 00:17:28,030
know that short three month period of

00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:29,260
the year and then they moved to a public

00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:32,050
cloud foundry provider in Europe and

00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:34,390
they are spending $200 so and my

00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:35,500
question would be how is anyone making

00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:37,600
any money out of that

00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:39,970
what what kind of scaled you need to be

00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:45,100
running at for that to be a viable

00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:48,190
business so I've been through the belly

00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:52,090
of Darkness with public offering at any

00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:55,120
night so we started it at a hosted

00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:56,830
vSphere cluster and moved to a self

00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:01,080
hosted OpenStack which was the most

00:17:56,830 --> 00:18:03,730
horrific thing I've ever done and

00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:06,880
calculating prices against Heroku the

00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:09,400
largest competitor to challenges are in

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,740
offering a Cloud Foundry platform with

00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,740
no domain-specific differentiator such

00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:17,350
as being an IOT platform or something

00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:18,580
which is first when Heroku came up it

00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:21,309
was seven years ago

00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:22,840
I think then there was a way for there's

00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:25,210
this something you everybody looked at

00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:27,820
it just like the hype around docker is

00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:30,730
today and you will not get this second

00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:33,670
wave so you have to find your self a

00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:36,490
marketing that has more you know other

00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:38,770
other points of Attraction and the

00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:41,290
second is infrastructure so

00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:45,850
infrastructure in general is a very hard

00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:49,690
topic and our value proposition used to

00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:52,450
be 100% European currently our target

00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:54,340
sits on at AWS because we were unable to

00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:57,550
find a trustworthy infrastructure

00:18:54,340 --> 00:19:00,010
provider being entirely operated in in

00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:02,740
Europe not being held by a u.s. holding

00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:04,990
company that offers us infrastructure as

00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:07,750
a service so we can build a platform on

00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:09,940
top of it the calculation from a cost

00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:12,610
perspective with the surface that

00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:14,890
OpenStack allowed us allowed us to be

00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:18,400
competitive with Heroku from day one

00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:20,890
even at a very small scale so from from

00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,090
an economical point of view I'd say it

00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:24,549
is possible

00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:26,529
is that let's say the smaller data

00:19:24,549 --> 00:19:29,500
centers use infrastructure-as-a-service

00:19:26,529 --> 00:19:31,570
and put a cloud firmly on top of it and

00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:33,630
make a valuable business out of it in

00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:36,279
case they are entirely focused on that

00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:39,669
we've been distracted distracted by

00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:44,400
consulting business also and if they

00:19:39,669 --> 00:19:44,400
manage to get the infrastructure stable

00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:51,789
so maybe chew on your first point we are

00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:54,340
happy to help you with the

00:19:51,789 --> 00:19:57,880
infrastructure you know we are a non you

00:19:54,340 --> 00:20:02,559
country but in Europe you like every UK

00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:04,210
provider maybe let me know we can find a

00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,720
price like now and we also run an

00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:06,970
openstack

00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:10,000
which obviously helps us bring the costs

00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:12,190
down it was not easy a lot of people

00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,159
here in the room probably you think of

00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:17,679
these days right now it was hard but I

00:20:15,159 --> 00:20:18,909
think it's worthwhile the public

00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,100
offering was for us especially in the

00:20:18,909 --> 00:20:23,679
beginning it was clearly intended to be

00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:25,450
a business card to show that we are a

00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,770
cloud provider that we have passed in

00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:29,169
the market and also to push the Cloud

00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:30,850
Foundry message our main market was at

00:20:29,169 --> 00:20:34,260
the enterprise offerings where we have

00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:37,029
dedicated cloud foundries fully fully

00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:38,500
virtual private where we encapsulate

00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:40,480
network and all accept this was our

00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:42,970
target what we saw in the last six

00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:45,850
months is that the public our public

00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:48,640
environment really grew and we are on a

00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:50,919
stage where we serve we it's way bigger

00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,350
than we ever thought it will be and also

00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:56,350
the the revenue economics really work

00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:58,690
work and we also see quite a lot of non

00:20:56,350 --> 00:21:01,480
Swiss customers you know for whatever

00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:04,000
reason put their in tailoring don't you

00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:10,779
countries but it's fine we're happy to

00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:13,649
get it I'd say the kind of cost per hour

00:21:10,779 --> 00:21:17,799
is one cost that you'll have in public a

00:21:13,649 --> 00:21:20,049
lot of IBM's customers obviously enter

00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:21,549
into more comprehensive agreements

00:21:20,049 --> 00:21:24,190
around what they're providing around

00:21:21,549 --> 00:21:27,700
support around services all that kind of

00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:30,370
thing which i think allows that basic

00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:33,940
cost per hour to be very competitive but

00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:35,200
also partly as a calling card to maybe a

00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:37,809
single tenant

00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:40,620
until that kind of thing but also as

00:21:37,809 --> 00:21:43,539
just something which opens you up to

00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:45,639
services that may be chargeable or

00:21:43,539 --> 00:21:49,029
support that may be chargeable this one

00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:50,860
so at those twenty thousand new users a

00:21:49,029 --> 00:21:52,809
week what proportion of those are

00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:54,909
startups because obviously bluemix is

00:21:52,809 --> 00:22:02,380
quite focused on startups that's a good

00:21:54,909 --> 00:22:04,419
question I wanted to tell you but we we

00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:07,299
work in the biggest I think the biggest

00:22:04,419 --> 00:22:09,519
startup colocation environment in the

00:22:07,299 --> 00:22:13,389
world and we work in Moorgate that's

00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:16,600
where our office six and we've had some

00:22:13,389 --> 00:22:18,730
really great successes with startups

00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:20,440
coming along using the platform it's

00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:23,019
very easy to get started with the built

00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:25,299
in DevOps and things like the Watson

00:22:23,019 --> 00:22:27,370
services which allow you to spend

00:22:25,299 --> 00:22:29,559
pennies for stuff that you would have

00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:33,580
had to have you know a massive contract

00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:35,440
with a big supply for before I guess the

00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:37,960
same question to the others did you the

00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:40,570
other providers here are you seeing more

00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:42,190
larger enterprises starting to say we

00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:45,909
don't need to run our own cloud

00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:47,830
boundaries because so we see both but we

00:22:45,909 --> 00:22:49,960
see more enterprising we see we see

00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:52,659
actually more enterprise developers

00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:56,260
which are kind of stick with the

00:22:52,659 --> 00:22:58,750
internal IT situation and then moving to

00:22:56,260 --> 00:23:00,909
our cloud so for instance two months

00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:03,519
after we launched our public cloud one

00:23:00,909 --> 00:23:07,600
CEO of a bank in Switzerland Cole called

00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:09,990
me or to ask me if we can shut down the

00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:12,850
organization which some of his team did

00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:14,350
the we should stop his team pushing apps

00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:18,210
to our cloud because they're not allowed

00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:20,799
to it was a very nice conversation I

00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:22,330
should have recorded it but I think we

00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:25,179
have we have quite a lot of

00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:27,130
organizations which which are really big

00:23:25,179 --> 00:23:30,510
organizations where some developers

00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:32,320
really try to to have an easy way still

00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:34,090
deployments with somebody have a very

00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:37,149
easy way to use cloud and that's where

00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:40,539
they come so we see but it's it's I

00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:42,220
would say half half row okay yeah I

00:23:40,539 --> 00:23:44,559
think we found it quite interesting how

00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:45,550
a lot of our big enterprise customers

00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:48,310
they have

00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:51,610
you know VMware or OpenStack on Prem

00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:53,530
goodbye PCF to deploy onto it there to

00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:55,180
put onto it and then interestingly

00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:56,530
Quayle from you know that either hit

00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:58,510
capacity limits is what they can have

00:23:56,530 --> 00:24:01,180
one pram or some of the reason they

00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:05,170
can't scale anymore and then they'll

00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:06,730
just found you on Amazon so just scaled

00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:07,990
out and that's where we see a huge

00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:09,910
amounts of value where all of a sudden

00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:11,620
they were they were used to hitting some

00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:14,440
kind of a capacity limit and now they

00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:16,420
can just be like PC f1 AWS will scale

00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:18,040
that out the apps were in exactly the

00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:20,290
same the data services aren't exactly

00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:22,120
the same so we're kind of we've removed

00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:23,290
that friction between the you know you

00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,610
know to take workloads from one

00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:26,830
infrastructure and put it down on

00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:30,910
another one we haven't seen a lot of

00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:33,670
people going from you know on pram to

00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:35,380
running their own Cloud Foundry on AWS

00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:37,750
you then starting to use a public cloud

00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:39,760
provider as well I haven't seen a huge

00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:41,140
amount of that but maybe that's because

00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,580
you know that's not really being our

00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:43,780
focus it's I think it's more going the

00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:48,610
other way people will try out Cloud

00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:51,070
Foundry on p WS they enjoy it and then

00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:58,930
like to install PCF either one prank or

00:24:51,070 --> 00:25:01,450
on AWS so I'd say that the the size a

00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:02,650
cloud phony makes make sense to be on

00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:06,100
premise

00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:07,390
you know how big should accompany be so

00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:09,820
that it makes sense to use your own

00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:12,580
Cloud Foundry I'd say that it's it's

00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:13,990
surprisingly small so you can make use

00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:17,400
of a cloud phone in a certain

00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:20,980
circumstances being dedicated however

00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:23,230
the cloud is about sharing so when you

00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:25,420
look at at Amazon at a certain time they

00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:27,910
just open up their infrastructure to be

00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:31,960
used by others so what's the big value

00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:34,990
in using Amazon Amazon has a chain even

00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:36,850
let's say unlimited capacity from our

00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:38,620
perspective as a small organization when

00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:40,780
I'm running a fifty people company here

00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:43,420
like just wait a smallest company

00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:46,210
represented on the board I guess so

00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:48,550
for us Amazon is unbelievably big where

00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:51,460
our infrastructure had around let's say

00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:54,520
two terabyte of RAM so in a custom on

00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:56,870
boards a small platform your question is

00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:59,270
how much of elasticity

00:25:56,870 --> 00:26:01,550
you actually need and the same thing is

00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:03,380
when you run dedicated claw ponies

00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:05,330
within your data centers how big is your

00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:07,040
infrastructure how much of that

00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:09,410
infrastructure is taken by your Cloud

00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:12,380
Foundry and how much elasticity do you

00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:13,550
need within the run time and within the

00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:17,120
infrastructure part of your

00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:19,970
infrastructure so with that the question

00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:22,190
it could be that you have to order new

00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:25,400
hardware because you hit a boundary

00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:27,980
because there was user growth and it hit

00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:30,410
you unexpectedly so in that case on

00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:32,840
Amazon you possibly be able to just use

00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:35,600
more resources because they just have

00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:37,640
more free space and that's a calculation

00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:41,390
everybody has to do are you big enough

00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:44,780
to make use and to benefit from the

00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:47,300
platform within that boundaries of your

00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:49,070
data center or your core location is

00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:50,900
there any audience questions because

00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:53,510
before we reach end I should really

00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:54,710
check who's got burning questions for

00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:58,809
the panel because we've got the

00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:58,809
microphone anyone at all

00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:04,960
Alex do you have one you did

00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:11,000
think safe harbor yeah

00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:23,360
GWS

00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:31,400
so I think the question was does pivotal

00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:34,610
plan to offer the services from PCF on

00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:36,409
PWS separate yes we do we're looking at

00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:38,000
that they're kind of we're making them

00:27:36,409 --> 00:27:38,570
incrementally more more available to

00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,340
customers

00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:45,799
so we're very much doing that but that's

00:27:43,340 --> 00:28:04,370
taking a while I admit but we are yet

00:27:45,799 --> 00:28:06,320
that's definitely happening now I think

00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:08,360
the question was does the we're also

00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:14,120
going to run the tiles from other

00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:17,059
companies on a PWS I think that's maybe

00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:18,770
happening but I don't make a commitment

00:28:17,059 --> 00:28:19,700
right now we're agile I'm saying I

00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:21,770
wouldn't dream of making a commitment

00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:25,039
it's certainly something when we learn

00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:26,630
from running our other PCF tiles on PWS

00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:28,220
and then if that successful would then

00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:32,289
look maybe with our partners to bring

00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:32,289
you know their offerings as well

00:28:42,039 --> 00:28:45,649
that's a great question and it does play

00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:47,510
towards the title of the talk which is

00:28:45,649 --> 00:28:49,750
what can we what can we do next how can

00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:52,429
we really improve this marketplace maybe

00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:54,559
just touching on what Marco said so it's

00:28:52,429 --> 00:28:57,980
you know that positive sum game aspect

00:28:54,559 --> 00:29:05,620
of working together as a community to to

00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:08,230
improve things I think that more

00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:10,970
visibility about how one can

00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:12,919
transparently or both easily migrate

00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:15,200
across different public providers would

00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:18,559
be from a consumers perspective really

00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:20,600
useful there are there currently a

00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:22,940
couple of some challenges that we we

00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:25,100
face so I think that would probably be a

00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:27,620
a good thing for the whole community of

00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:29,870
public provider public consumers to be

00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:31,399
able to say we can take a bit of service

00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:34,100
here and a bit of service there and not

00:29:31,399 --> 00:29:36,380
have to hugely care about the

00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:41,630
distinction between them outside of the

00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:43,399
services layer I totally agree so taking

00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:45,590
the perspective of the clock on the

00:29:43,399 --> 00:29:48,200
end-user I want to set up as a cloud

00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:50,750
phone UCLA on my computer I want to set

00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:52,580
the target deploy an app and I want to

00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:55,340
do the same thing by just changing the

00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:58,070
target that's my desire and I don't want

00:29:55,340 --> 00:30:00,740
to care about the versions or whatever

00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:02,630
when I have a manifest file specifying

00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:04,940
the dependency tree of my app I want to

00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:06,590
do CF push and not worry about anything

00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:09,440
else that's the main motivation why I

00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:12,110
use a public path and Kinley there's so

00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:14,210
much heterogeneity that they there's so

00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:17,059
many differences between the platforms

00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:20,149
that this is impossible right away and I

00:30:17,059 --> 00:30:24,440
think that is improved that's there will

00:30:20,149 --> 00:30:25,700
be a benefit for the end-user I'm

00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:27,080
probably gonna bounce this subtly

00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:30,350
differently so what I would love to see

00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:33,620
happen within a year would be some large

00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:36,950
European companies take part in South

00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:40,610
Factory dojos have more core committers

00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:42,799
to Cloud Foundry from Europe and bring

00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:45,230
in the Platinum members Gold members to

00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:46,519
the foundation of cloud factory from

00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:48,679
European companies I know you've got a

00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:50,179
few I'd love to see more of them I'd

00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:51,980
have to see far more you know other

00:30:50,179 --> 00:30:52,660
companies getting involved far more core

00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:56,110
committers

00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:58,390
like Cloud Foundry is ours so that's

00:30:56,110 --> 00:31:01,570
invest more in it as people that's put

00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:06,670
more people on to it let's just help it

00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:07,960
grow I think also goes in the rection of

00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:10,750
growth but I think we just need more

00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:12,820
providers as well I know a couple of

00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:14,440
providers which will probably look one

00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:17,080
will probably launch already this year

00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:19,300
and maybe one other I know next year

00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:20,890
early next year so this is cool but I

00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:22,240
think we need more so it's a good

00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:23,710
business to be in if there's anyone who

00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,390
wants to start a car thumbs yeah yeah

00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:28,360
you recommend it I think I think we

00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:30,490
should we should we should make it very

00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:31,990
easy for service providers in Europe

00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:33,850
which are that he came in two countries

00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:35,620
to launch something like that founded

00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:37,570
and this also goes in the direction like

00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:39,490
how small does it felt for need to be to

00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:43,540
run it by yourself yeah it can be very

00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:45,940
small but it's where are you hard to run

00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:47,830
it you know it's very hard to run it

00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:49,450
yeah you need you need very very good

00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:51,250
engineers you need two people who know

00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:54,070
how the upstream works you need very

00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:56,080
very fast cycles and security updates

00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:59,020
you need you need you have your hands on

00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:01,980
that stuff and I think this is very

00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:04,950
important so size is not the only thing

00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:08,590
PCF helps with all of that okay so one

00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:09,820
okay that's it we're finished and

00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:10,780
there's any more questions I think we're

00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:13,780
probably keeping everyone from their

00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:16,510
coffee so Tom did you have something

00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:20,200
else joins about no I was just saying a

00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:23,860
long a similar line I think the seamless

00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:26,290
transition so that you can have some

00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:28,300
stuff already in AWS or some stuff you

00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:30,400
want in public cloud some stuff you want

00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:33,640
in a single tenant cloud or on-premise

00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:35,830
just a good story for how you can easily

00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:39,280
connect those things and work with what

00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:41,110
people already have okay great thank you

00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:42,890
very much to our panelists and I don't

00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:45,579
come

00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:45,579
