it is fantastic to see all of you today

00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:07,319
about 10 months ago in Berlin we had a

00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,820
gathering of about 450 people for the

00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:11,280
Cloud Foundry summit Europe the first

00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:13,110
one ever ten months later I'm happy to

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,660
say that we are sold out we sold out a

00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:18,720
week ago there are over 700 of you

00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,470
registered and in attendance today so I

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,050
think we're going to have an

00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:24,720
extraordinary two days of openness of

00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:27,779
collaboration and sharing information

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,090
and ideas openly so first let me do an

00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:32,850
exercise please raise your hand if you

00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:34,680
were at the Berlin summit all right keep

00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:35,850
those hands raised and raise your hand

00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,320
if you've been to the Silicon Valley

00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:38,969
summit in Santa Clara Oh

00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,460
some people have both hands up that's

00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:42,840
pretty awesome all right so those of you

00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,309
who don't have your hands raised look at

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,989
the people with their hands raised they

00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:47,640
are your experts they will help you

00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:49,530
understand things okay go ahead and put

00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,570
your put your hands down now if you're

00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,829
new we're gonna reverse the exercise so

00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,809
if you're new and this is your first

00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:56,239
silicon valley's your first Cloud

00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:58,800
Foundry summit please raise your hand

00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,120
all right so all of you who raised your

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,160
hand before look at look around the

00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,470
people with their hands raised make eye

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,119
contact I know we're introverted but

00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:08,119
make eye contact and commit yourself to

00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:10,830
help somebody out all right thank you

00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:12,630
one of the key things to who we are as a

00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:14,460
community is we are open and we're

00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:15,780
inclusive I've found that this has been

00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,780
the greatest privilege of my

00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,869
professional career to lead such a

00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:23,850
collaborative and helpful set of people

00:01:20,869 --> 00:01:25,710
in that spirit I've stolen a great idea

00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,909
from Robert piercing some of you may

00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:29,670
have read zen and the art of motorcycle

00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:32,159
maintenance we're through a journey

00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:34,500
across a country and fixing his

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,150
motorcycle long way kind of walks you

00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,310
walks with the reader through the

00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:40,250
experience of Zen I feel very similarly

00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:42,540
about my favorite platform Cloud Foundry

00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:45,619
those of you who have seen this image

00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:48,509
before know as an N so it's Zen

00:01:45,619 --> 00:01:50,700
calligraphy which indicates open this

00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:52,920
emptiness nothingness to me it's also

00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:56,100
inclusion which is all about what we're

00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,630
doing here today I want to talk a little

00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,070
bit about open source and why we play

00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:01,140
this game and then I want to talk about

00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:03,990
what Cloud Foundry is and where we're

00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:06,689
going as a platform so open source is a

00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:08,399
positive sum game if you're familiar

00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:10,229
with game theory which many of you are

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,069
you know that there are two types of

00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:13,100
games we can play

00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:14,840
we can play zero

00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:18,260
some games in which in order for me to

00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:19,490
win you have to lose those are kind of

00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:21,770
interesting but they're not

00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:23,990
transformative last time I was in Europe

00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:26,450
was the beginning of July where - I

00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:29,000
think our collective shock the Germans

00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:31,760
lost to the French in the Euro Cup so

00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,990
that was kind of astonishing but you

00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,060
know they'll just come back and play the

00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:37,070
same game again next year so this is

00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:39,380
just kind of win and loss some people

00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:40,970
are happy some people are sad more

00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:42,980
exciting and more transformative are

00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:44,780
positive some games where the more of us

00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:47,090
who play the game the better the game

00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:48,740
itself becomes those of us who've been

00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:50,180
business for a long time sometimes are a

00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:51,920
little bit baffled by positive some

00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:53,270
games but I think the best way to

00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,860
understand this is something that we're

00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:57,740
all born playing which is the game of

00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:59,180
love the more that you give the more

00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:01,040
there is available the more that will

00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:02,750
return to you there's no limit to the

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,690
number of participants in that game that

00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:08,570
can make it better so I'm inspired by

00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:10,250
the writing of Robert Wright about 10

00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:11,870
years ago I read a book that transformed

00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:14,000
my thinking about economics and

00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:16,340
civilization this is a book he put

00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,650
together called non zero the logic of

00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:20,840
human destiny rather boldly he asked the

00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:22,730
question is there actually a direction

00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,620
in which human civilization is trending

00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:27,350
and he came back having done his

00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:29,600
research surprised and said yes in fact

00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:31,340
the history of civilization is a history

00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:34,190
of positive some games played at larger

00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:36,470
and larger scales so the scale of the

00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:40,070
game he offered is how many people can

00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:41,420
you call self instead of other as human

00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:44,330
beings we really like to draw a very

00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:49,190
bright line between self and other me

00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:51,410
them good bad trusts no trust what we

00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:53,210
really want to do is create an

00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:54,770
elimination of that boundary and have a

00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:56,260
lot of people in our circle of trust

00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:59,780
that lets us to play these

00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:00,950
transformative positive some games we

00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:03,200
generally start out with the smallest

00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:05,600
possible scale right self equals family

00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,700
blood is thicker than water you will

00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,650
engage in transactions with your family

00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:11,680
probably without counting how much money

00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:14,030
you spent doing so who owes who what

00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,950
right this is the general basic

00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:17,989
structure of a positive sum game you

00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:20,420
don't keep score you're just all trying

00:04:17,989 --> 00:04:24,140
to win together now that's a simple

00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:25,610
polity like this term it's a very clean

00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,540
description of how we organize ourselves

00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:29,780
and how we give

00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:32,690
power to each other may be the earliest

00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:33,770
strong policy was a tribe many people

00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:37,730
here are familiar with the Dunbar number

00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:39,740
about 150 150 people that you can be in

00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:41,200
simultaneous relationship with now you

00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:43,250
might be able to know a thousand people

00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,660
LinkedIn tells us that if you don't have

00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,280
two thousand connections you're not even

00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,720
really trying so you could probably

00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,490
remember their names now with the help

00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,700
of technology but who can you really

00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:55,130
care about and be in conversation with

00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:57,620
as we go through civilizations history

00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:59,780
we find that the more people that can

00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:02,830
play a positive sum game the better they

00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:07,070
compete with smaller groups so chiefdoms

00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:10,250
exceed and consume tribes city-states

00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:12,860
exceed and consume chiefdoms and are non

00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:14,660
nation states then are born out of

00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:16,670
city-states and these transitions are

00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:18,650
usually very uncomfortable there's

00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:20,570
usually a lot of chaos because this idea

00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:22,790
of giving up Authority and trusting more

00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:24,820
people to be in a positive sum game with

00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:26,870
you it's very emotionally challenging

00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:28,990
perhaps we're on our way to a world

00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:33,260
state I suspect we're living through a

00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:35,000
reaction to this sense of greater unity

00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:37,010
and greater connection right now and

00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,710
hopefully our politicians and our

00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:41,210
citizens will take us into a place

00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:45,410
that's more aligned with the long arc of

00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:46,970
history here's a positive sum game that

00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:50,240
almost all of you are practicing right

00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:52,520
now right self equals company you've met

00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,840
somebody on a plane who is working for

00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,850
the same company that you've never met

00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,500
you share almost no affiliation at all

00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:57,980
but somehow you both work for the same

00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,080
employer

00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:01,700
it's a fairly a historical construct

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,290
when we played around with just for a

00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,480
couple of hundred years certainly not

00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:06,650
something that we've done for thousands

00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:09,530
you immediately think I can trust this

00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:11,360
person I can engage in positive some

00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:13,280
transactions with them I can tell them

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,310
about confidential information we can

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,950
create a new partnership so that has

00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:20,630
progressed over time and now we see that

00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:22,760
the world is largely influenced by

00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,930
multinationals so these are companies

00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,400
that have figured out how to play a

00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:28,310
positive some games with an enormous

00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:31,310
number of people this has also created a

00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:34,220
huge asymmetric power base that caused a

00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:36,140
reaction in the 90s the basis of

00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:37,820
software competition was one in which

00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:39,350
the companies that could organize

00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:40,580
themselves to have the most money in the

00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:43,189
most employees were in ever

00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:45,110
really the ones who who prevailed right

00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:46,400
if you can take 5,000 engineers and put

00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:47,960
them on a single project and they all

00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,939
work for you then you're gonna beat

00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:52,310
every other company but then something

00:06:49,939 --> 00:06:56,930
really strange happens we came up with a

00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:59,030
new policy self equals project so if you

00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:01,009
were a Linux developer working on the

00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:02,389
kernel or working on a distribution it

00:07:01,009 --> 00:07:06,199
didn't matter what company you work for

00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:07,849
you felt a self-identity with anybody

00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:10,310
else working on Linux you were all the

00:07:07,849 --> 00:07:13,129
same band of rebels didn't matter if you

00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:15,680
worked for IBM or HP or red hat or a

00:07:13,129 --> 00:07:17,330
start-up you felt like wow we're all

00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,400
part of this Linux community so we

00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:20,930
learned a great deal about what would it

00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,669
mean to have some different kind of

00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:25,430
affiliation that was not your nation

00:07:22,669 --> 00:07:27,319
that was not your corporation it's open

00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:30,530
source right we align ourselves to

00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:32,750
projects bringing ourselves together

00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:35,150
right bringing unity around a particular

00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:36,500
project increases as we increase the

00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:39,860
number of different types of people that

00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:41,539
we want to interact with and support in

00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:44,509
Cloud Foundry we think about developers

00:07:41,539 --> 00:07:46,610
users providers and operators all coming

00:07:44,509 --> 00:07:49,819
together having unity and affiliation

00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:52,009
around the project the team from

00:07:49,819 --> 00:07:53,870
Swisscom is here Swisscom is a great

00:07:52,009 --> 00:07:56,479
example of a provider right who has

00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:58,610
participated in this circle bringing out

00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,229
a side of the software that we wouldn't

00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:02,060
have seen if we were simply trying to

00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:04,250
build software and sell it in the

00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:06,860
traditional way everyone participates in

00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:08,659
the circle without developers you have

00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:10,909
no apps without users the apps have no

00:08:08,659 --> 00:08:11,240
value without operators the apps won't

00:08:10,909 --> 00:08:12,949
stay up

00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,180
and without providers you won't have an

00:08:12,949 --> 00:08:16,219
infrastructure to run them on so it

00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:19,000
requires all of us notice that we're all

00:08:16,219 --> 00:08:21,080
on the circle nobody's in the center

00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,690
nobody's excluded nobody's on the edge

00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,860
so it's about inclusive inclusiveness so

00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:28,639
that we're all playing the same game

00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:30,409
that's what Cloud Foundry is for foundry

00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,510
is also a platform and platforms

00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:33,529
themselves are positive some games so if

00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:35,810
you're familiar with the structure of a

00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:37,789
platform it's an inverted pyramid a

00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:39,560
massive inverted pyramid quite the

00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:41,899
opposite of our old common sense of how

00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:43,399
we create power rather than sitting on

00:08:41,899 --> 00:08:45,500
top of the pyramid and lording it over

00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:46,790
everyone our job is instead to be a

00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,010
servant leader and sit at the very

00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:51,140
bottom supporting products services

00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:53,600
solutions and users most importantly

00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:55,670
being able to bring in users to get

00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,959
value out of the entire solution but we

00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:59,270
also know software is tremendously

00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:01,399
tricky it's very hard it has to be

00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:04,130
custom fit to every different situation

00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:06,319
so this idea of creating a platform that

00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:08,000
can be provided run everywhere and be

00:09:06,319 --> 00:09:10,579
modified then many people in the chain

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,649
is incredibly important this is also how

00:09:10,579 --> 00:09:14,870
we think about sustainability and how

00:09:12,649 --> 00:09:16,760
money should flow in a platform economy

00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:18,319
the smallest amount of money should be

00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:20,000
flowing down to the platform the

00:09:18,319 --> 00:09:21,890
greatest amount of money opportunity and

00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,949
employment should be at the upper levels

00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:27,140
of the pyramid so if we think about this

00:09:24,949 --> 00:09:28,699
idea that the more people we can support

00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:29,810
the greater the platform the people that

00:09:28,699 --> 00:09:31,819
we're supporting is actually the

00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:34,880
technical measure of how important the

00:09:31,819 --> 00:09:36,560
platform is as we increase the number of

00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,260
people in the platform we get another

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:42,279
benefit platforms drive network effects

00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:44,149
so those of you who use your telephone

00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:46,279
automatically know what a network effect

00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:47,690
is there's a great joke which says the

00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:52,880
greatest salesperson in human history

00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:54,800
was whoever sold the first telephone how

00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,750
useful is a phone that you can't call

00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,459
anybody on well as soon as you have the

00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,600
second phone at least you can call one

00:09:58,459 --> 00:10:02,449
person by the time you have the third

00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,399
telephone you can call three and quickly

00:10:02,449 --> 00:10:06,740
you get N squared effects red Metcalfe's

00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:09,410
law and network effects everybody starts

00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:11,360
to come in most interestingly people who

00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:12,860
don't have phones then get told offline

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,660
hey you should really get a phone why

00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:16,699
should I get a phone so we can talk to

00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:17,660
you so you end up with these external

00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:19,940
subsidies where everybody is

00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:22,279
recommending the system so platforms and

00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:24,230
network effects are the basis of how we

00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:28,069
think about most of them successful

00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:31,310
modern asset light digital businesses so

00:10:28,069 --> 00:10:32,930
if you think about uber or Airbnb if you

00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:34,399
think about eBay you think about these

00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:36,829
different systems which create

00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,300
multi-sided markets duolingo is a great

00:10:36,829 --> 00:10:40,880
example for those of you who have heard

00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:43,790
of it those were said in a detail by a

00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:46,130
few people at MIT Geoffrey Parker

00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:47,810
Marshall Van Alstyne and sangre Sangeet

00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:49,310
Chowdhury they're part of the MIT

00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:52,579
Institute for the digital digital

00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:54,260
economy what they found was very simple

00:10:52,579 --> 00:10:56,449
they walked away from all this and said

00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:58,790
all these platforms have figured out how

00:10:56,449 --> 00:11:00,890
to create massive Network effects to be

00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:02,600
able to create environments where more

00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:03,560
suppliers bring more suppliers more

00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,960
suppliers bring more

00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:08,150
consumers and sometimes consumers and

00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:10,400
suppliers will switch sites so those are

00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:11,840
very powerful so the more people we can

00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,430
include the greater Network effects

00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:16,220
hopefully this is giving you a sense of

00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:17,960
why mathematically not just ethically it

00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:19,910
makes tremendous amount of sense to

00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:22,970
create markets out of positive some

00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:25,190
games if we look specifically at who we

00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:26,960
want to include in Cloud Foundry the

00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:28,490
more of each of these that we include we

00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:31,070
have found that we get more and more

00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:32,750
excitement involvement and execution on

00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:34,850
the platform which is really what we

00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:37,130
shouldn't measure by is this working is

00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:38,390
it serving people one of the people who

00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:40,220
I think put this together

00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:43,460
most intelligently was kosher Swami

00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:46,010
Nitin this was in late 2009 he's now the

00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:48,080
emeritus chief scientist of Accenture

00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:50,060
this was just one of eight things that

00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:52,070
he wrote trends that are changing our

00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:53,540
world and then he retired so you just

00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:55,250
get an imagination of this just being

00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:57,230
one topic first person to really put

00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:59,240
this together thoughtfully so he talks

00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:01,670
about an ecosystem of mutually

00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:03,680
reinforcing technologies many of you

00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:05,480
have super computers in your pocket

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:09,200
right some of you are even using them

00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:11,870
with signatures that is a part of a

00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:14,000
system of reinforcing technologies some

00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:15,740
of the other things might be lightning

00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,420
cables or other cables that plug into

00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:19,040
the phone sometimes you upgrade the

00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:20,839
platform itself improve the capability

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,880
the camera the apps that sit on the

00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:26,360
phone all of those are really this this

00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:28,220
little set of red triangles those enable

00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:31,160
us as users to come and adopt the

00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:34,160
platform make it real it reduces our

00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:35,750
risk so here's a question how many of

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:39,020
you in the last six months have

00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:43,070
recommended an app on your phone to

00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:44,600
somebody else show of hands okay so

00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:45,650
those ones that were not shy I suspect

00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,600
that every single person in this

00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:48,890
audience because you're technologists

00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,660
and you chose to come to a technology

00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:52,459
conference you're probably just a little

00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:53,750
bit evangelical you probably want to

00:12:52,459 --> 00:12:57,020
give away a little bit of knowledge and

00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:58,280
make a recommendation so let me ask you

00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:03,050
this how much did you get paid to make

00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:04,370
that recommendation in fact could you

00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:06,080
have been paid to make the

00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:09,260
recommendation with that if cheapened

00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:10,880
the exercise if the company could have

00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:12,170
paid you could they have afford to pay

00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:16,370
you for their recommendation would that

00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:17,420
have scaled almost certainly not you

00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:19,820
gave them what's called

00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:21,140
an external subsidy if they couldn't

00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:23,210
have afforded this but you gave them

00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:26,120
part of what benefits this kind of

00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:28,400
network effect and I think as humans we

00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:31,190
live out of two main drives right hope

00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,930
and fear so probably a little bit of you

00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:34,100
was stimulated by hope like I have this

00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:36,170
really cool thing I want to show it to

00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:38,030
you but one of the most important parts

00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:39,920
of SWA manhattan's curve is this idea

00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:43,610
that as the technologies reinforce

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:46,250
themselves they reduce risk for adoption

00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:48,020
and that goes back into the circle so

00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:49,820
one reason why you recommended that app

00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:52,070
is because you really like it and other

00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:53,870
people using it make it more likely the

00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:56,570
app will survive it reduced your risk

00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:58,490
both for the app you're using and for

00:13:56,570 --> 00:14:00,860
the entire platform the phone that you

00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:03,140
are on so this is a really important way

00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:05,180
to think about platforms you may be able

00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:07,370
to be building a platform business or

00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:09,380
you may simply be engaging in foundry as

00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:13,010
a platform either way these are the

00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:14,510
physics of modern platforms so this is a

00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:15,740
pretty good standard right one of the

00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:17,120
things we think about platforms of

00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:20,500
standardization anybody think this is a

00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:23,210
good standard and Kant doesn't like Bob

00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:25,460
you know largely unchanged since the

00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:28,160
late 1800s when it was invented it's got

00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:30,650
about 40% more efficient recently

00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:33,940
outlawed by countries like Australia for

00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:35,840
being in efficient and waste generating

00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:38,960
this is maybe a more interesting

00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:41,150
standard to me this is a platform this

00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:42,440
is a pretty opinionated platform in fact

00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:45,050
if you don't have something that will

00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:46,430
fit exactly into that holder then you're

00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,900
not going to get any electricity the

00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:50,540
contact won't complete and nothing will

00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:52,880
happen but once you standardize on that

00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:54,500
platform then we can have many very

00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,830
different opinions about what goes into

00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,820
it

00:14:54,830 --> 00:15:02,120
so here's a compact flourescent to see f

00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:04,400
see what I did there all right so even

00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:06,380
more interestingly here's an LED light

00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:08,240
bulb right so we're in a moment where

00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:10,520
there's a massive Reap platforming of

00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,140
light bulbs going on across the world in

00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,730
the next five years something like 80%

00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:15,770
of the commercial light bulb fleet just

00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:17,210
in North America will be replaced the

00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:20,360
most fascinating thing about this is

00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:22,460
it's a computer so those of you who are

00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,720
here to talk about industry 4.0 with

00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:25,400
other people and participate in that

00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:29,990
track think about the Internet of Things

00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:31,220
here's a thing right it's an LED it's an

00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:33,310
integrated chip

00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:36,470
we're adding sensors for temperature

00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:37,970
we're adding mesh networks so each one

00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:40,910
of these things plugging into that old

00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:44,770
standard platform can bring a completely

00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:47,510
new world to bear so in that sense of

00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:48,980
creating a standard platform we are

00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:50,900
trying to create the same thing for you

00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:52,490
with Cloud Foundry so last year we

00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:55,340
launched Cloud Foundry certification

00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:58,640
cloud finders certified 2016 we took the

00:15:55,340 --> 00:16:01,010
step of time stamping it later this year

00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:03,050
we will announce the standards for Cloud

00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:05,690
Foundry 2017 and we expect all of our

00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:07,820
certified platform providers will

00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:11,240
support the new standards including

00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:12,800
Diego anybody here heard of Diego so

00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,950
you'll hear a lot more about Diego at

00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,160
this conference Diego's awesome right

00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:18,680
super-modern

00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,870
incredibly scalable and open and

00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:22,640
connected to all of the most modern

00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:24,530
advancements in containers and in fact

00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:27,170
we're at the forefront contributing

00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:29,090
things like services and advancements in

00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:31,330
how we attach storage to containers

00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:33,680
there's a lot of opportunity for us here

00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:35,780
we take that and standardize the

00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,730
platform at the bottom of this system

00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:40,610
this platform ecosystem then what we're

00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:43,040
hoping to do is create an open mutually

00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:44,960
owned industry-wide platform for all of

00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,550
you no matter whether you're a platform

00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,380
provider whether you're a developer

00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:50,810
building products services or solutions

00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:53,030
or if you're a user depending on this

00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:57,610
platform to deliver your experiences day

00:16:53,030 --> 00:17:00,530
to day excitingly we're bringing a posse

00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:02,360
so today we're announcing that cisco is

00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:05,120
the most recent signatory to the

00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:06,110
platform standards for cloud foundry so

00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:10,130
they're launching a cloud foundry

00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:12,530
certified Cisco Cloud Cisco platform

00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:15,980
today joining our other 10 anybody here

00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:18,920
a spinal tap fan okay so just to be

00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:22,850
clear how many certified providers do we

00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:25,060
have now 11 it's like 10 but it's one

00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:25,060
more

00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:29,360
once we've standardized that platform

00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:31,880
where are we going with it all what we

00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,500
want to do is open up an entire world of

00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:35,870
packaged services and packaged apps

00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:38,630
those of you working on Cloud Foundry

00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:42,050
today know that it is the best platform

00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:44,270
for custom applications right consider

00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:44,820
the consistency the coherence your

00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:47,130
ability to

00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:49,320
datecode many times a day many times an

00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:51,720
hour and put it directly in productions

00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:54,899
fantastic almost all of that code is

00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:57,389
handwritten in IT shops or by services

00:17:54,899 --> 00:17:59,490
companies that you're engaging in the

00:17:57,389 --> 00:18:03,360
future just like you could think about

00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:05,639
Apple or Windows or any any kind of

00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,169
known stable platform you have third

00:18:05,639 --> 00:18:09,269
parties bringing in packaged

00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:11,460
applications package services you want a

00:18:09,269 --> 00:18:13,320
database grab a Cloud Foundry compatible

00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:15,840
database you want an app grab a Cloud

00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:17,460
Foundry compatible app talk to the s AP

00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,529
folks who are here about their vision

00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:21,299
for the ecosystem it's tremendously

00:18:19,529 --> 00:18:23,250
exciting we're in the beginning of a

00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:25,379
20-year revolution of what cloud

00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:27,419
platforms can be and we are creating a

00:18:25,379 --> 00:18:30,450
space for innovation around the platform

00:18:27,419 --> 00:18:32,759
and sustainability so let me close with

00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:34,409
a few few statistics this is kind of our

00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:37,250
Cloud Foundry brag book just in the last

00:18:34,409 --> 00:18:39,000
12 months we've had over 31,000 commits

00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:40,590
almost two and a half thousand

00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,049
contributors and perhaps most

00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:45,809
importantly 130 core committers these

00:18:43,049 --> 00:18:48,570
are the men and women who spend 40 hours

00:18:45,809 --> 00:18:50,850
a week building the best code in the

00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:53,580
industry that runs a discrete

00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:55,019
distributed system for you our newest

00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:57,539
dojo in fact was announced yesterday

00:18:55,019 --> 00:18:59,610
where core committers will come and

00:18:57,539 --> 00:19:01,889
train and be added so s AP is now

00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:03,269
running a dojo and Waldorf bringing new

00:19:01,889 --> 00:19:05,039
core committers to the cloud finder

00:19:03,269 --> 00:19:06,690
community and this stems from the good

00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,669
work that s AP has been doing with Susa

00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:11,190
focused on the OpenStack CPI but going

00:19:08,669 --> 00:19:13,700
far beyond that into work on garden and

00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:16,860
many other components of cloud foundry

00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:18,659
we also have been growing the number of

00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:20,490
platforms that we support so most

00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:22,529
recently we added support for a VMware

00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:24,330
photon but the key thing to understand

00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:26,370
here and if you don't know it yet is a

00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:28,889
subsystem called Bosh and I don't mean

00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:30,870
Bosh the industrial company with the Bo

00:19:28,889 --> 00:19:33,120
SCH I mean Bosh B oh Sh

00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:34,830
the basic outer shell those of you who

00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:37,019
don't know where the term came from I'll

00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:39,210
give you a hint it's like bork from

00:19:37,019 --> 00:19:40,620
Google but plus plus right just

00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:43,320
increment the R and the G that's an

00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:45,360
exercise for the reader it bashas what

00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,740
it's our platform for platforms right

00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,210
this is what gives us the multi cloud

00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:51,019
capability so we can support all of

00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:53,309
these different clouds and let me let me

00:19:51,019 --> 00:19:56,180
greatly appreciate Google who's here

00:19:53,309 --> 00:19:58,160
today announced their Bosh CPI and

00:19:56,180 --> 00:20:01,240
the the fact that Cloud Foundry runs

00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:04,970
extremely well on Google cloud platform

00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:06,860
we have grown to 65 member companies 195

00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:08,870
user groups over fifty thousand

00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:11,030
fifty-three thousand individuals as part

00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:12,920
of a Cloud Foundry community and 132

00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:14,810
cities in 56 countries it's tremendously

00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,990
important that we hold this as a global

00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:22,310
movement we need to help all of us

00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:24,050
succeed are the membership of the

00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:25,700
foundation has grown I think this is

00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:28,040
this is an important slide to me perhaps

00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:29,840
not an important slide to everybody but

00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:33,440
it is the foundation as a neutral body

00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:35,360
that owns the codebase that owns the

00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,340
trademark on your behalf our job is to

00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,960
be the circle that brings all of you

00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:41,030
together so this is the number of

00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,580
companies that keep coming in and saying

00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:45,800
include me in the circle so we have 17

00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:49,460
new members in 2016 five news this week

00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:53,510
a SETI software Bosch comcast hex add

00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:55,220
and Qi oh we are on a tear as a

00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:59,120
community and I'm very grateful to lead

00:20:55,220 --> 00:21:01,130
it and let me let me mention Siemens and

00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,620
then close so we've included included

00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:05,090
the industry 4.0 IOT as a theme for this

00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:07,420
conference for the first time it's

00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:10,250
incredibly important Siemens is a

00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:12,470
example of a leader choosing IOT and

00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:14,900
Cloud Foundry so mine sphere is the

00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:17,240
Siemens cloud for industry leveraging CF

00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:19,070
is a key technology strongly recommend

00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:21,380
you find out more about it attend their

00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:23,810
sessions this is where the rubber meets

00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:26,030
the road a horizontal generic platform

00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:29,570
meeting the needs of heavy industry

00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:31,070
day-in day-out one of the key reasons

00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:32,690
they chose cloud foundry was because of

00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:34,760
the multi cloud environment giving them

00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:38,990
choices to be able to run on many clouds

00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:41,180
at the same time collectively just

00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:42,710
clothes our vision that brings us

00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:44,180
together and makes us a community is

00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:46,160
this we see a world of cloud computing

00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:47,660
that is ubiquitous and flexible it

00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:49,520
supports multi cloud application

00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:51,740
environments it's portable and

00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,880
interoperable enabling users to go over

00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:54,520
they want this is actually a

00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,690
revolutionary concept in cloud computing

00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:58,670
that the users should have control of

00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:00,020
where their applications come and go and

00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:01,730
finally one that's vibrant and growing

00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:03,440
and underlies a massive and growing

00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:07,160
ecosystem of applications and services

00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:09,510
as a community we are pragmatic diverse

00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:11,520
and respectful this is a tremendous

00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:12,750
personal importance to me because it is

00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,580
the shape of the community is how we

00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:15,930
treat each other that determine whether

00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:18,090
or not this is a place that we want to

00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:19,710
play the game or it's a or if it's a

00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:20,900
place that we want to leave for me it's

00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:23,460
a place that we want to play the game

00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:25,470
we're focused on exchanging practical

00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:27,450
experience prototypes Trump theories

00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:30,030
were diverse and inclusive of people

00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:32,450
across race gender orientation and

00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:34,350
lifestyle and finally we're respectful

00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:35,910
we're committed to listening of

00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:38,220
thoughtful and honest perspectives and

00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:39,690
frequently we need to be quiet so that

00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:41,640
other people can speak it's not about

00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:43,110
being the loudest voice in the room but

00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:45,090
about being able to listen to the

00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:47,130
quietest voice in the room with that

00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:48,510
thank you welcome to the cloud foundry

00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:56,160
summit thank you for being here

00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:56,160
