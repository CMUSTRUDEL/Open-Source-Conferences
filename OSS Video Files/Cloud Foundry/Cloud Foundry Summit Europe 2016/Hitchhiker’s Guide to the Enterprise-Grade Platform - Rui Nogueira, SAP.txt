Description: 
	Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Enterprise-Grade Platform - Rui Nogueira, SAP

This presentation guides you through SAP’s journey to build a PaaS with enterprise-grade qualities on top of Cloud Foundry. Like on every journey there are beautiful experiences, but as well lot’s of challenges until you’ve reached your destination and incorporated all the customer requirements.

Auto-scaling of apps, 2-factor authentication mechanisms, security in general, certification, managing vulnerabilities, connectivity to the IaaS layer, etc.

But hey: don’t panic! You’ll hear the uncut version of all the nice, the good and the bad that SAP is facing during that journey together with several large enterprise customers and maybe even learn from SAP the answer to life, the universe, and everything.

- so so I actually already even so they

00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:10,640
started just right now before this

00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:16,229
session multi-cloud deployments

00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:18,960
important for us also with without

00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:22,049
country and the very prominent other

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:26,009
topics part so where i will talk about

00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:28,590
other topics so before going now into

00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:30,450
the challenges that SAT faced let me

00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:32,100
just explain briefly whereas AP is

00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:36,600
coming from so that you also understand

00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:40,049
what what our strategies so as ApS

00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:43,049
focusing on on business applications for

00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:46,710
quite some time so since 1971

00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:49,740
so as old as I am we have yes I know I

00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:51,380
look older we have around 20,000

00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:55,950
developers in research and development

00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:59,219
at s AP and our goal right now is really

00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:03,240
help customers with their digitization

00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:04,860
that we always hear around IOT or in

00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,140
Germany industry in oil which is

00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:10,979
something totally different and IOT I'm

00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:13,260
just kidding and if you hear AP normally

00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:15,709
you don't connect it directly with

00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:18,150
with with cloud offerings right but

00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:22,189
we're not really new in the business so

00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:24,329
I put here some some dates about

00:02:22,189 --> 00:02:26,819
products we have in place for different

00:02:24,329 --> 00:02:29,730
purposes so which we started with

00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:34,319
success factors of company we acquired

00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:37,890
around human capital management a rebar

00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:39,510
for business networks 2012 we came up

00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:42,780
with our own platform as a service

00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:44,670
offering for texting the requirements

00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:47,609
from from our customers so our own path

00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:50,790
with the Hana cloud platform and then

00:02:47,609 --> 00:02:53,940
yeah it goes along Hybris conquer known

00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:58,349
as a ps4 Hana so another business suite

00:02:53,940 --> 00:03:00,209
completely in the cloud and I mean while

00:02:58,349 --> 00:03:02,220
you are seeing this and also maybe with

00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:05,459
the history who of you knows is a P at

00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:08,129
all maybe just raise your hand okay I

00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:10,019
always make a test question who asked

00:03:08,129 --> 00:03:12,959
you didn't know ASAP before could you

00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:15,900
also raise your hands okay well if you

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:20,069
didn't pay attention to my question okay

00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:23,129
good so and I mean coming from from a

00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:25,560
company that is also known for mostly

00:03:23,129 --> 00:03:29,609
on-premise applications so we had a long

00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:31,590
way so and also I had to evolve with

00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:34,760
regard to how we were set up in how we

00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:37,079
worked right so I put here some some

00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:39,329
just some passwords but it really means

00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:41,459
a substantial change also in how as ap

00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:44,849
develop software right so we came from

00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:48,239
water model waterfall model to a gel

00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:52,470
development and our going over to DevOps

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:55,079
right and our applications we are moving

00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:58,199
away from creating this big ASAP

00:03:55,079 --> 00:04:00,540
monolith with a lot of power and cycles

00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:03,359
of one year or release cycles of one

00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:07,139
year half a year over to micro services

00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:09,120
and also deployments of our products on

00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:13,049
bi-weekly basis yeah and we are and we

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:16,799
are keep on changing from physical

00:04:13,049 --> 00:04:20,039
service via virtual service over to two

00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:22,710
containers and then also now container

00:04:20,039 --> 00:04:26,400
frameworks and the the the journey keeps

00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:26,710
on going right from a data center to

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,650
hosts

00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:31,660
environments to to cloud environments

00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:34,000
that we have to to set up really to also

00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:36,069
tackle the requirements again from our

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,990
customers that they have to run their

00:04:36,069 --> 00:04:44,130
businesses and a lot of work also moving

00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:48,130
from proprietary tools that si P

00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:50,590
develops open over to usage and

00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:54,699
contributions to open source and in

00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:56,919
standards so quite a long a long way so

00:04:54,699 --> 00:04:58,900
and what do we need to ensure during

00:04:56,919 --> 00:05:01,539
that journey so our customers of course

00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:04,870
still want to run their business on on

00:05:01,539 --> 00:05:06,940
top of what we are doing but they want

00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:10,030
to have of course everything should be

00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:13,419
still fast secure so exclamation mark

00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:16,630
secure scalable not disruptive so you

00:05:13,419 --> 00:05:19,180
don't want to use new stuff right and

00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:22,090
suddenly your business that keeps your

00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:24,580
business running stops working because

00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:28,440
si P has done an upgrade you don't want

00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:31,479
to have that we need to support 24 by 7

00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:33,250
every day and also ensure and ensure

00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:35,530
depending on the requirements also from

00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:38,080
different industries traceability of

00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:39,490
everything that is done auditability so

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,580
whenever changes are done in the in the

00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:44,590
backend changes are done in the database

00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:47,620
you need to know who has done it who has

00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:49,900
access to these systems certification is

00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:51,789
also a big topic so you need to have

00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:56,229
certain certifications for certain

00:05:51,789 --> 00:05:59,229
industries and while doing that what do

00:05:56,229 --> 00:06:02,620
we do so we we try to focus really on

00:05:59,229 --> 00:06:05,440
those parts of our technology which we

00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:08,650
feel is differentiating compared to what

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:12,880
others are doing and really engage in in

00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:14,500
standards and open-source to leverage

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:18,039
what is out there and also to contribute

00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:19,810
back what we think the is also useful to

00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:22,300
the community and we have a lot of

00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:24,930
learnings from from that right so while

00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:28,419
doing this there's a lot of stuff so

00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:31,960
there you have multiple options so

00:06:28,419 --> 00:06:33,729
either you let others have the same

00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:36,310
experience I put a quote here from The

00:06:33,729 --> 00:06:38,139
Hitchhiker's Guide to the galaxy I've

00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:39,490
just had an unhappy love affair so why

00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:41,379
don't I don't see why anybody else

00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:45,129
should have a good

00:06:41,379 --> 00:06:46,659
or you try to be a good open-source

00:06:45,129 --> 00:06:48,759
citizen and contribute back your

00:06:46,659 --> 00:06:50,379
learnings and and and share it with

00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:54,099
others so that they can can leverage

00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:56,319
that so but we don't do it that

00:06:54,099 --> 00:06:59,050
standalone right just contributing for

00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:02,460
for contributing it's it's rather a

00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:05,650
strategy around co-innovation

00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:08,229
open-source and standards so we try to

00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:09,849
learn from customers what they need so

00:07:08,229 --> 00:07:14,440
tomorrow there will be also a keynote

00:07:09,849 --> 00:07:16,360
forum from Marc Gill responsible for

00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:19,060
partnering it is AP and you will learn

00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:21,940
there also what we are doing for example

00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:27,669
with Siemens for so who of you did watch

00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:28,690
today the keynote from Sam Ramsey ok now

00:07:27,669 --> 00:07:34,840
again the test question who if you

00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:37,960
didn't ok ok so good one so at the end

00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:40,000
of the summit Sam put cement on one

00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:42,400
slide right so with with their IOT

00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,919
platform line sphere so that platform

00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,360
for example was built together with sa p

00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:49,000
with the Hana cloud platform underneath

00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:51,340
and we are using that that co-innovation

00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,960
with the customer to really know what

00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:56,500
other requirements from from big

00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:58,330
customers in the IOT space and to learn

00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:01,089
from from them what they need and then

00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:04,659
to incorporate this into our our

00:08:01,089 --> 00:08:06,789
products also may be using partners to

00:08:04,659 --> 00:08:09,460
join the efforts and then actually

00:08:06,789 --> 00:08:12,520
contribute technology that is the refill

00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:15,279
is is useful to the open-source

00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:16,659
community back to the open source

00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:19,659
community so that people can leverage

00:08:16,659 --> 00:08:22,900
they can even bring more requirements

00:08:19,659 --> 00:08:24,759
into that and then concentrate on what

00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:28,240
is actually differentiating us from from

00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:31,930
others and just to put here some some

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,589
numbers of contribution or total number

00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:36,729
of contributors

00:08:32,589 --> 00:08:39,279
that's this Lewis line here is it blue I

00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:45,670
have color difficulties it is blue right

00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:47,260
so some so something around 30 30

00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:50,319
contributors we have right now so we

00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:54,160
learned today how much contributors do

00:08:50,319 --> 00:08:56,370
we have at the Cloud Foundry commute

00:08:54,160 --> 00:09:01,750
anyone paid attention to the number from

00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:04,690
from Sam who knows remembers 130 right

00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:06,160
so although you say well we have 20,000

00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:07,870
developers in research and development

00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,000
and only 30 i contributing to Cloud

00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:13,510
Foundry but again I mean we are trying

00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,730
to use the the platform and to fill it

00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:17,560
with the requirements from our customers

00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:20,530
and partners and building up on that

00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:22,300
right and we didn't reinvent another

00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:23,980
platform as a service offering right we

00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:27,640
are taking our Cloud Foundry which is

00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:29,680
already very rich feature set and try to

00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:32,260
leverage there and contribute back what

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:36,130
we feel is is also useful for the

00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:39,370
community okay so now trying to go back

00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:45,160
to to Cloud Foundry so what are our

00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:49,350
learnings for example with regards to to

00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:53,110
speed so when setting up a cloud foundry

00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:56,050
instance you are wondering okay how to

00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:58,990
set this up in the fast way and for that

00:09:56,050 --> 00:10:01,930
we actually worked on something we

00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:03,700
called service fabric so it's written

00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:10,750
with the K it's no typo it's a German

00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:15,190
public yeah it's not English it's it's

00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:18,790
German and English both not penned

00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:21,910
parallel right so what are the

00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:25,500
challenges that we faced when now

00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:25,500
setting up a cloud foundry instance

00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:32,110
normally you don't have any default

00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:34,630
services up and running off the shelf in

00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:36,010
Cloud Foundry so every provider needs to

00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:38,320
really take care of that to set this up

00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:40,630
in a in a in the fast way so that you

00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:44,650
can provide the services either to your

00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:48,430
fellow colleagues at your company or to

00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:50,950
your customers and partners and also the

00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:53,680
service broker API doesn't really really

00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:56,140
help you a lot with provisioning

00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,850
technology it's very open right but with

00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:59,800
very open it means it's very flexible

00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:01,480
and with very flexible you can do

00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,520
whatever you want but yeah it's it's

00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,870
difficult to do to find out what you

00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:08,650
want right if there is nothing that you

00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:12,160
can take to to copy and paste

00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:14,110
the it's also necessary to have backup

00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,180
and restore capabilities built-in which

00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:17,620
are not available yet so something that

00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:20,020
we struggled with that we need to also

00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:22,000
provide to to our customers because they

00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:25,890
have very high requirements in that in

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:29,170
that area and also the cloud controller

00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:30,760
the controller model is really very

00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:34,180
minimalistic and doesn't provide you any

00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:37,300
means for version control so our

00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:40,540
requirements for a proper solution were

00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:43,120
to easily set up backing services so

00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:46,720
that ideally you just click on the

00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:49,180
button or run a command it should be

00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:53,260
inexpensive for development and in

00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:57,310
testing of course reliable isolated and

00:11:53,260 --> 00:12:00,040
in an high availability cluster usable

00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:02,500
for productive usage quite important for

00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:04,540
us so that it it's not just a test

00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:07,150
environment which actually works but is

00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:11,590
really something you can also deliver to

00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:14,950
to customers yeah focus on a few

00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:17,290
provisioning technologies to to ease the

00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:19,690
development and operations of that compo

00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:23,560
of these components provide backup and

00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:26,220
restore and also to provide the

00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:29,380
possibility of having multiple versions

00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:31,150
of your services available and then you

00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:34,420
simply select I want to have this

00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:37,360
version of that version in my in my main

00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:41,440
offering and that's it right and for

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:44,170
that yeah we worked at s IP with the

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:47,589
service public with K remember it's

00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:51,670
German to provide now a generic service

00:12:47,589 --> 00:12:55,300
broker and and in the Bosch release it

00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:59,020
supports provisioning on on docker and

00:12:55,300 --> 00:13:01,630
swarm and there is also possibility to

00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:05,350
use existing talk rubbish releases with

00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:07,510
the service for brick there is also a

00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:09,790
very generic dashboard available that

00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:11,890
you can use to find out ok what are the

00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:13,750
what are what is the URL of my service

00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:15,400
what is the user and password so

00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:17,410
something very basic that you don't have

00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:21,040
to do on your own which you simply can

00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:22,959
reuse there is also the positive

00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,509
to have an automated stem cell and

00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,949
release update so whenever you have you

00:13:25,509 --> 00:13:28,480
find out there are for example some

00:13:26,949 --> 00:13:33,759
security issues some security breaches

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:37,720
that you can fastly exchange them in

00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:39,910
automated way also providing you with a

00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:41,680
possibility to backup and restore and we

00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:44,980
provide that with the service for brick

00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:48,000
right now for open stick and on AWS it's

00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:50,860
on its way so and we are also open to

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,750
other layers underneath and there is

00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:55,420
also an Operations tool available and

00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:58,350
for those of you want to try out so it's

00:13:55,420 --> 00:14:01,779
available on github since a few days

00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:06,810
github comes let s AP service public

00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:09,870
broker and I'm just checking the time

00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:14,079
okay yeah I you still awake who's awake

00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:17,550
okay who's sleeping okay good I will try

00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:22,360
to hurry up so I put here a little

00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:25,660
picture to a very nice picture which of

00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:27,880
course you understand immediately but

00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:31,630
just to explain a little bit so the this

00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:33,819
service fabric broker is providing you

00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:37,420
here an extension to the to the cloud

00:14:33,819 --> 00:14:39,430
controller and also the possibility to

00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:40,870
actually add a plug-in to your

00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:43,360
command-line interface so that you can

00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:46,269
also use the service fabric direct

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:50,889
directly via the command line interface

00:14:46,269 --> 00:14:54,040
API so extending actually the API and

00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:55,630
then underneath you see here the

00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:59,410
different provisioning models that you

00:14:55,630 --> 00:15:04,230
can use then for either docker instances

00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:08,170
or putting here the the services on Bosh

00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:10,180
so while we were talking briefly about

00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:14,319
about the infrastructure as a service

00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:15,519
layer I find it quite interesting when I

00:15:14,319 --> 00:15:17,500
was discussing with the colleagues who

00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:20,790
are working on another project called

00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,790
cloud foundry Oh

00:15:28,589 --> 00:15:34,750
any of my colleagues here who knows if

00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:36,430
not come to the booth and I will try to

00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:38,500
get the right person I'm not the expert

00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:45,550
in all of these technologies I can't

00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:47,410
tell you okay so what I found

00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:51,779
interesting when when looking into the

00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:54,190
the infrastructures that there is a nice

00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:56,020
it's not a quote from The Hitchhiker's

00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:59,230
Guide to the galaxy but it's actually

00:15:56,020 --> 00:16:02,500
from the OpenStack documentation on

00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:04,360
Cloud Foundry saying the requirements so

00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:07,029
to know whether or not your Cloud

00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:09,130
Foundry installation runs for example on

00:16:07,029 --> 00:16:10,420
OpenStack the requirements listed here

00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:12,399
are considered necessary but not

00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:14,680
sufficient for posh to be able to use

00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,529
your OpenStack deployment if you cannot

00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:18,370
perform any of these tasks successfully

00:16:16,529 --> 00:16:20,140
Bosh will not work

00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:22,149
however satisfying all these

00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:26,620
requirements does not ensure that Bosh

00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:29,260
will work so it's either so you you

00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:31,060
stick to what is necessary and then you

00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:33,820
think you are fine but no it's not right

00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:36,420
so meaning while validating the the

00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:40,470
infrastructure you might find out that

00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:44,829
it doesn't work so the challenge is that

00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:47,680
ASAP also wants to run one Cloud Foundry

00:16:44,829 --> 00:16:51,640
installation in in various data centers

00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:53,890
and the question is will now this

00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:56,800
installation run on the customers or

00:16:53,890 --> 00:17:00,520
partners OpenStack distribution right

00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:01,740
and if you using the the tooling which

00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:05,110
is available right now you have a very

00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:06,640
hard time to understand that the errors

00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:09,209
messages you're getting back from from

00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:13,240
Bosh so you need to have a deep

00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:16,569
expertise and what we wanted to have is

00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:19,929
actually the possibility to have no deep

00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:22,179
Bosh expertise for that it should be

00:17:19,929 --> 00:17:26,290
easy to use and to also have error

00:17:22,179 --> 00:17:29,290
messages with actionable descriptions

00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:32,290
right and for that we have also open

00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:35,740
sourced the Cloud Foundry OpenStack

00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:39,130
validator and it actually will

00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:43,870
respond to the question will it run on

00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:45,880
my OpenStack installation there is an

00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:48,850
executable and also a configuration file

00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:52,840
that you can set up for for your Cloud

00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:55,990
Foundry environment and you will

00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:58,120
actually get also actionable hints also

00:17:55,990 --> 00:18:01,950
for non Bosch expert let me try like an

00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:06,309
increase yes I can I love my Mac so

00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:10,420
these are the error messages you get for

00:18:06,309 --> 00:18:12,220
example your OpenStack using TCP I can

00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:14,860
create large disk large this could not

00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:17,050
be created so it tells you if your are

00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:19,240
using deff stack you need to manually

00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:22,390
set a larger backing file size in your

00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:24,130
local RC so under needs also another

00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:28,090
another failure right so you're getting

00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:32,380
really actionable hints on what to do to

00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:34,150
avoid these error messages or to make

00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:40,720
the the environment actually work on

00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:46,750
your site so another doing okay with the

00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:50,620
time so another source of surprises also

00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:53,080
security so another quote from

00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:54,580
Hitchhiker's Guide to the galaxy nothing

00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:56,920
travels faster than the speed of light

00:18:54,580 --> 00:19:01,450
with the possible exception of bad news

00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:03,010
which obeys its own special laws so as

00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:04,570
ap as well all the customers and

00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:09,070
partners who are running their

00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:12,580
businesses they are very they don't like

00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:15,850
risks right so and with the with the

00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:19,980
Cloud Foundry setup you might get into

00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:23,320
the issues that attackers might be

00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:24,880
listening to a network traffic between

00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:26,440
the notes right and if they have the

00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,860
right to lling right they might get

00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:33,820
maybe passwords usernames going between

00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:35,920
the notes so what we wanted to do is

00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:39,420
actually to encrypt all the traffic

00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:42,280
between the notes so that even if the

00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:45,429
attackers are listening that they just

00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:49,470
get gibber ish or Portuguese or whatever

00:19:45,429 --> 00:19:49,470
so things they don't understand

00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:56,830
if there is something which which

00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:59,650
although you took care of it really

00:19:56,830 --> 00:20:01,420
drops or doesn't work anymore or there

00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:04,600
is a security breach anyways between in

00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:07,660
this encryption that you can dynamically

00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:09,540
reconfigure it so that without the

00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:12,520
downtime you just set up another

00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:16,750
algorithm and then these the security

00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:19,000
breaches is it's closed and also it

00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:24,160
should have no impact on scalability

00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:27,309
meaning if you want to run this in in

00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:31,090
multiple instances so that this

00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:33,820
encryption doesn't really hinder you on

00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:37,480
scaling broader so it doesn't need a lot

00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:41,580
of of resources so that's why I say he

00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:45,130
came up with the Bosch release for IPSec

00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:47,770
so it actually is doing exactly that so

00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:50,080
encrypting all the communication inside

00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:53,800
a cloud foundry deployment between the

00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:55,809
notes and can also be used on as a core

00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:59,800
deployment right and it actually works

00:20:55,809 --> 00:21:12,850
in a way that it's using encryption on

00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:15,100
the tree on the kernel no no it's it's a

00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:17,110
network it's a network protocol that is

00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:19,210
available as as a Bosch release that you

00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:22,210
can take then and deploy then in your

00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:25,929
your Cloud Foundry insulation so it is

00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:36,100
using what you learn oh from IPSec also

00:21:25,929 --> 00:21:38,410
in in the Cloud Foundry setup yes yes

00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:40,150
exactly exactly and you're doing the so

00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:42,960
you're using what is already existing in

00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:45,670
the Linux kernel

00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:50,130
okay now the legendary other topics

00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:53,559
things that we also are working on and

00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:55,809
and identifying how to actually leverage

00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:58,360
that also for the Cloud Foundry

00:21:55,809 --> 00:22:01,760
community so we are looking into

00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:04,340
lifecycle management of of

00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:06,460
applications so we are currently trying

00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:08,630
to define standards for creating these

00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:10,970
package cloud foundry apps so that you

00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:13,400
can deploy them in different locations I

00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:16,010
think Sam also talked about that today

00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:17,770
in this Kinney's keynote and you should

00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:20,690
be able to actually talk take these

00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:23,780
applications and deploy them on any of

00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:26,450
those platforms recertified platforms so

00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:30,410
that's that's the idea we are already

00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:33,140
using it inside sa p4 blue-green

00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:35,270
deployments to ensure that there is

00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:38,540
always a productive system up and

00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:40,880
running and we are currently finding out

00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:43,670
how to bring this now to the foundation

00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:48,980
and actually do a co development with

00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:52,760
the community what we are also currently

00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:56,170
ramping up along with with a big

00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:56,170
partners with IBM and orange

00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:03,320
collaborations around auto scaling and

00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:07,250
auto sleep of applications so put in

00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:10,520
here the the github links to these to

00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:13,360
these projects so again not trying to

00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:16,190
reinvent the wheel again but instead

00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:19,060
getting bigger partners into the boat

00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:22,460
also getting their requirements into our

00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:24,470
into our standard and then really

00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:27,950
leveraging that and contributing back to

00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:31,070
the community so that others don't have

00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:33,080
to go in to discuss again or think again

00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:37,040
how do we do an auto scale on cloud

00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:39,050
foundry how we insure how to sleep to to

00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:44,450
ensure we don't spend too much money on

00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:45,830
putting machines up and running on a

00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:48,560
landscape which really cost us money

00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:52,430
right so trying to put here a standard

00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:55,370
in place that others can use and last

00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:58,040
but not least also working in in in

00:23:55,370 --> 00:24:01,910
Diego and Abacos around around metering

00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:03,560
and the Diego framework putting here

00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:05,390
also a number of full-time committers

00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:08,720
that are working on this

00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:12,310
so also trying to push what is done now

00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:14,630
in the community with and put in our

00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:15,230
requirements that we know from customers

00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:18,169
and partners

00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:23,929
so this also finds its place in to the

00:24:18,169 --> 00:24:26,510
standard so that's it what I wanted to

00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:31,360
go through with with you who is still

00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:46,070
awake okay

00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:51,950
so opening up to questions yes backup

00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:53,510
and restore yeah so I think I mean

00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:55,309
backup and restore is something we need

00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:58,279
to broke I mean for us it's a no-brainer

00:24:55,309 --> 00:25:00,919
I mean we we have it today from from a

00:24:58,279 --> 00:25:03,200
Cloud Foundry perspective I'm not sure

00:25:00,919 --> 00:25:05,179
if we are providing anything there I

00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,889
mean we I discuss it briefly in the

00:25:05,179 --> 00:25:09,440
service for quick so it's available

00:25:06,889 --> 00:25:14,450
right now so there are basic

00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:17,210
requirements we we tackle with with the

00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:22,010
service topic to provide an easy way to

00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:24,260
do backup and restore its for OpenStack

00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:26,750
it's there for AWS it's on its way I

00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:31,070
can't really tell you now for AWS when

00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:33,049
it will be there but I mean - yeah yeah

00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:35,149
I mean what we are I mean what I wanted

00:25:33,049 --> 00:25:37,490
to bring across here is actually we are

00:25:35,149 --> 00:25:39,500
already working on this ASAP right so

00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:42,110
for most of the things I have shown you

00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:44,659
here we already have a solution built in

00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:48,740
into our products so what we what we try

00:25:44,659 --> 00:25:51,470
to do is to put these efforts into the

00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:54,230
community back so that something can be

00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:56,330
reused right and for before the service

00:25:54,230 --> 00:26:04,750
topic there is now already something for

00:25:56,330 --> 00:26:04,750
for OpenStack any other questions

00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:18,540
yeah so lifecycle management of

00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:20,670
applications right yeah so the idea is

00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:23,820
that you package your applications in a

00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:25,140
way where you say ok if you if you use

00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:27,720
the standards for lifecycle management

00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:31,110
it can take an application and deploy it

00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:33,480
on any other certified cloud found

00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:35,490
insulation of course it will then depend

00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:38,300
right so if you're if you are writing an

00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:41,700
application which uses proprietary

00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:43,740
technology of course you can't move it

00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:46,050
right because the prior technology is is

00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:48,360
somewhere else I don't know how this

00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:50,820
will be tackled in this in this in this

00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:52,560
standard but the the goal is really I

00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:55,310
mean from a from a user perspective to

00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:58,020
know ok if you put the stamp here

00:26:55,310 --> 00:27:01,530
lifecycle management according to Cloud

00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:04,830
Foundry standard XYZ you can move it to

00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:06,770
another platform maybe there are will be

00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:08,910
some rules that you should not use any

00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:11,160
proprietary technology underneath

00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:13,560
because then it's yes and if I it's not

00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:16,500
possible it's mainly around everything

00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:20,390
around the lifecycle management into

00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:20,390
package things yes

00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:32,940
puh good question and come to the booth

00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:35,800
and I will find the right person for you

00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:36,250
yeah because I mean so who a few knows

00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,110
Hana

00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:40,210
can you raise your hands I'm a very

00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:41,550
active person oke whoever does not know

00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:44,230
Hana

00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:46,630
yeah don't be shy yeah so so Hannah

00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:48,309
isn't in memory database and it's not

00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:50,650
only in in memory database it's it's an

00:27:48,309 --> 00:27:54,490
appliance so it's it's a big machine

00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:58,300
with certain capabilities to run in a

00:27:54,490 --> 00:28:01,179
database in memory and I mean just that

00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:04,480
that set up is already a platform on its

00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:07,840
own and this this whole platform is also

00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:10,809
available on our path offering so

00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:12,400
whether or not IPSec is already used in

00:28:10,809 --> 00:28:13,840
Hana it's something I can find out for

00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,640
you just just come by the booth and I

00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:18,850
will get the right person or just call

00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:21,490
the colleague yeah but as I said I mean

00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:24,340
from from the beginning what we really

00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:27,790
need to cover is everything around

00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:31,600
requirements about security and and in

00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:34,600
cloud and as you know also European

00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:37,120
companies are very conservative with

00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:41,130
regards to cloud so that that's why also

00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:41,130
security here plays even a bigger role

00:28:48,509 --> 00:28:54,369
No so it's it's a platform as a service

00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:57,039
offering I don't want to bore you now

00:28:54,369 --> 00:28:58,389
with with product specific stuff so the

00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,519
Hana cloud platform is really a pass

00:28:58,389 --> 00:29:02,919
offering and what we are using it for

00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:05,590
it's really - as a possibility to extend

00:29:02,919 --> 00:29:07,090
other solutions it could be an essay pr3

00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:11,649
system which is running somewhere on

00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:13,480
premise it could be a database from

00:29:11,649 --> 00:29:16,210
another vendor where you want to expose

00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:18,340
certain data into the cloud right but

00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:20,649
it's it's not substituting on-premise

00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:23,440
system it's it's rather a platform for

00:29:20,649 --> 00:29:25,600
us to to integrate with other systems to

00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:27,039
extend other systems or yeah to build

00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,200
new applications on top of it it's not

00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:30,909
to substitute others because as IP

00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:39,999
didn't had a Platt platform as a service

00:29:30,909 --> 00:29:48,269
offering before further questions okay

00:29:39,999 --> 00:29:51,279
with that set thanks and don't panic

00:29:48,269 --> 00:29:53,259
but there is one thing I forgot to tell

00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:57,309
you because I told you you would

00:29:53,259 --> 00:30:01,960
actually learn the formula for answer

00:29:57,309 --> 00:30:09,129
for life the universe and everything so

00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:11,559
okay so it's easy just come in join our

00:30:09,129 --> 00:30:15,100
s AP booth it's booth number four and

00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:17,559
you can find out to gather with the SLP

00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:19,600
colleague so the answer is again 42 and

00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:22,919
if you want to get in contact with me

00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:24,309
