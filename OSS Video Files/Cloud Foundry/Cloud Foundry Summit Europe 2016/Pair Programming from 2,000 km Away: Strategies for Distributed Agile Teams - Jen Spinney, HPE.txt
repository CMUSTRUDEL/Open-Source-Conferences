Description: 
	Pair Programming from 2,000 km Away: Strategies for Distributed Agile Teams - Jen Spinney, HPE

Cloud Foundry development is driven by several tenants, agile development, test-driven development and of course pair programming. Pair programming is seen as working best when the pairs are right next to each other working on the same computer in the same room, but what do you do when your pair is hundreds and perhaps thousands of miles away? The Diego team has several members who are not located in San Francisco, so remote pairing is part of our daily workflow. This talk will touch on the tools we use, the process we follow, and how we get the most out of a remote pairing situation. Andrew and Jennifer will also look at the drawbacks most often faced with remote teams and discuss a few strategies the we use to combat issues and to keep the remote team members engaged and productive and have a truly distributed agile development team.

hello it's 4 o'clock so I guess we'll

00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:06,359
get started

00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:08,069
this is pair programming from 2,000

00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:13,410
kilometers away strategies for

00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:15,870
distributed agile teams if you were here

00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:17,340
in the last talk welcome back if not my

00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:19,350
name is Jen's Finney I'm a software

00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,689
engineer at Hewlett Packard enterprise I

00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:25,230
work on the Diego team I'm a full time

00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:27,449
contributor I work from Seattle

00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:29,039
Washington right now there's no one else

00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:31,230
on the Diego team in Seattle Washington

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,200
so that means this is my life I do

00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:39,090
remote development every day eight hours

00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:42,510
a day I want to talk a little bit about

00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:46,289
what I'm going to talk about here Diego

00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:48,930
is an agile distributed team in some

00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:52,289
ways those words agile and distributed

00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:54,059
are kind of clashing and a lot of people

00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:56,820
say that agile can only be done in a

00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:58,079
co-located way but I think the Diego

00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,430
team has worked out a couple of

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,320
strategies that I think are working

00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:03,390
pretty well for us and in terms of doing

00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,320
distributed agile engineering and so

00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,119
that's what I'm here to talk to you

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,520
about we're going to talk about the

00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:11,670
tools we use the procedures that we use

00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:16,830
and our team culture what we do to make

00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:19,290
it work so who is Diego we're made up of

00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:21,090
nine engineers and one product manager

00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:23,580
we're made up of three different

00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:25,950
companies right now that's pivotal IBM

00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:28,170
and HP II but it's been other companies

00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:30,570
as well in the past or a constantly

00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:32,250
rotating team in general in the Cloud

00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:35,340
Foundry core people are switching

00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:37,650
between teams every couple months we

00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,920
have engineers in three time zones the

00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:43,079
max time zone difference is three hours

00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,729
that's the US East Coast and the u.s.

00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:47,970
west coast has a three hour time zone

00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:50,909
difference we have five cities that we

00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:54,000
work from San Francisco Seattle New York

00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:55,979
Raleigh Regina and we've become

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,680
increasingly remote more and more remote

00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:00,060
over time and so I think over time we've

00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,340
also been building up this muscle about

00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:07,049
how to do agile development and I think

00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:10,679
we're in a pretty good spot right now so

00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:12,720
what is agile there are tons of books

00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,710
about this tons of internet flamewars

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,660
about this

00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:17,460
I don't want to give you the definition

00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:19,080
of agile because I'm sure I'm gonna be

00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:20,280
wrong in some way or someone's gonna

00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,230
think I'm wrong and I don't know if I'm

00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,580
gonna be able to give you a definition

00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:25,020
that everyone's gonna agree with so I'd

00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:27,330
rather not like go into what is agile

00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:29,640
what is big a agile is Lily agile I just

00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:31,980
rather talk about how we do agile on the

00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,390
Diego team and in cloud foundry in

00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,670
general like what that looks like for us

00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:38,000
and I can tell you exactly how we do

00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:41,400
development and what principles we use

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,200
so we do a type of agile it's called

00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,140
extreme programming but I think even

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,430
that when maybe not doing exactly

00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:49,350
extreme programming but our own brand of

00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:51,780
it so I'll tell you exactly what our

00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:53,730
principles are what agile development

00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:57,090
means to us and then I'm gonna go

00:02:53,730 --> 00:03:01,710
through and go through this list I'm

00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:03,500
going to first explain what each of

00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:08,570
these principles are and how this works

00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:10,650
in a normal co-located environment and

00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:12,750
explain each of these principles and

00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:14,460
then I'm gonna revisit and I'm gonna go

00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:17,430
through and talk about what all these

00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:21,980
mean in a remote atmosphere and what we

00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:25,980
need to change so the most important

00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:28,620
aspect of our team culture is pair

00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:31,170
programming all code on Cloud Foundry is

00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:34,710
pair programmed that means we have one

00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:36,540
computer - mice - keyboards - mirrored

00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:39,180
monitors so we have two engineers

00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:40,980
working eight hours in a day sitting

00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:43,910
next to each other working together on

00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:46,800
the same machine on the same problem

00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:48,780
typically we have roles called a driver

00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,430
and a navigator so the driver is the

00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,700
person actually doing the typing in that

00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:55,050
moment and clicking and stuff like that

00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:57,210
the navigator is the person that tells

00:03:55,050 --> 00:04:00,480
them in kind of broad strokes what to do

00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:03,030
next the larger vision and kind of

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,890
guides the next steps and these roles

00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:06,900
are changing frequently like it can be

00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:08,820
just like within a minute you know you

00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,950
can switch back and forth or it can be

00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:12,330
you know for an hour there's one person

00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:14,070
has to drive our Navigator it's just

00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:17,400
kind of how you feel with that person in

00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:19,020
that moment so we work a 40-hour week

00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,359
that means eight hours of pairing every

00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:23,610
day and in the ideal world in a single

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:25,470
timezone team that means that we have

00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:27,010
everyone come in at the exact same time

00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:29,110
so at 9:00 a.m.

00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:31,120
start and at 6:00 p.m. we leave and we

00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:33,730
all go to lunch at the same time ago at

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,830
lunch at 12:30 this is not to be like

00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:37,270
strict for the sake of being strict this

00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:39,190
is so that we can maximize the amount of

00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:41,470
time that we're actually spend spending

00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:46,960
doing pairing as opposed to working on

00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:49,440
code in a solo way so this is an example

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:53,410
pair programming station here we have

00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,670
two monitors - - two keyboards in this

00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:57,010
case we actually have a third monitor in

00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:59,050
the middle this is just one example

00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:01,210
setup they all kind of look basically

00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:02,740
like this we have two monitors side by

00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:04,540
side the developers are either going to

00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:07,150
be standing or sitting right next to

00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:08,920
each other and you can customize it a

00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:10,270
little bit on the team like individual

00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:12,280
teams or individual people might have

00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:14,170
slight preferences like in this example

00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,490
we have a third monitor to have slack in

00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:17,530
the middle but that's you know these

00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:19,780
details that really matter so much on

00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:21,520
the Diego team people love their

00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:22,960
individual keyboards and mice so the

00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,280
first thing that happens usually at the

00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,710
being of the days everyone takes their

00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:28,180
own Mouse and runs you know to wherever

00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:29,680
station they're going to be and plugs in

00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:31,000
their Mouse and their keyboard because

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,870
everyone needs to have their own special

00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:38,470
one so the first thing we do every

00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:40,240
morning is stand up the people go around

00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:42,790
the room one person from each pair will

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,460
say very briefly what they did the

00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:46,690
previous day and we decide what the

00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:48,820
pair's are gonna be for that day so

00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:51,370
generally we switch pairs every single

00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:53,080
day sometimes you might stick with a

00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:54,340
person for two days in a row but

00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:57,090
anything longer than that at least on

00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:59,140
the Diego team is it's just not done

00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:01,420
because we have a large enough team for

00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:04,690
a smaller team maybe you'd have to do

00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:06,640
that more often so then the pair's are

00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:10,240
assigned for that day and this is

00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:11,230
usually up to the anchor the banker is

00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,060
the person that's been on the team

00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:15,160
usually the longest and so they just

00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:16,570
kind of orchestrate this meeting and we

00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,280
have a couple of roles that we assigned

00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:20,050
to certain pairs so we have someone

00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:22,300
that's we have a pair that's the

00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:23,860
interrupts that's the pair that other

00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:26,530
people from outside the team can tap on

00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:28,060
the shoulder and interrupt with random

00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:28,930
questions throughout the day we have

00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:31,180
someone that's responsible for

00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:33,070
monitoring the build and another pair

00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:35,530
that's responsible for monitoring github

00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:36,700
activity and stuff like that and so just

00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:40,090
as a reminder I'm going through right

00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:40,569
now what it looks like in a co-located

00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:42,909
or

00:06:40,569 --> 00:06:44,199
this is sort of the ideal situation of

00:06:42,909 --> 00:06:45,159
how we do development and then after

00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:46,629
this I'm going to come back and we're

00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:47,860
going to talk about what it's like when

00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:50,770
you add the remote element to it and

00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:53,369
what parts need to change so at the end

00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:56,770
of stand up this is our result we have a

00:06:53,369 --> 00:06:58,119
whiteboard that has all the pair's

00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:01,509
listed out and the tracks they're going

00:06:58,119 --> 00:07:03,669
to be working on that day it'll have the

00:07:01,509 --> 00:07:06,249
roles that each pair is gonna do so this

00:07:03,669 --> 00:07:09,849
way we have this whiteboard on display

00:07:06,249 --> 00:07:12,309
in the Diego work area someone from

00:07:09,849 --> 00:07:14,080
another team can come by in person and

00:07:12,309 --> 00:07:16,360
look at this board and say oh I have

00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,619
something a question related to the SSH

00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,909
track or something like that I guess

00:07:17,619 --> 00:07:20,800
I'll to go talk to these guys that are

00:07:18,909 --> 00:07:22,629
working on SSH or I have just a general

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,029
interrupts so I'm going to go bother the

00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:26,649
interrupt pair and stuff like that and

00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:28,629
so usually this is generally on display

00:07:26,649 --> 00:07:30,369
for everyone both people in the team and

00:07:28,629 --> 00:07:35,229
outside the team in the Diego pairing

00:07:30,369 --> 00:07:37,839
area another huge aspect of our culture

00:07:35,229 --> 00:07:41,199
is test-driven development or at EDD for

00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:43,419
short you may have heard the term red

00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,769
green refactor the idea being that first

00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:46,959
thing you do when you set out to do a

00:07:44,769 --> 00:07:49,119
work item we also call that a story is

00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:51,909
you write a failing test or a red test

00:07:49,119 --> 00:07:54,189
so this makes sure that the test you're

00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:57,159
writing is actually testing what you

00:07:54,189 --> 00:07:59,050
mean to test so you're testing what the

00:07:57,159 --> 00:08:00,579
story actually requires and you're not

00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:03,849
letting your own implementation guide

00:08:00,579 --> 00:08:07,449
what you end up implementing in the end

00:08:03,849 --> 00:08:08,680
you don't like drift so you at the very

00:08:07,449 --> 00:08:09,939
beginning when you start you say this is

00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,619
what's required and so you write a test

00:08:09,939 --> 00:08:13,029
and you have it clear in your mind this

00:08:11,619 --> 00:08:14,649
is what's actually required in order to

00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:16,599
deliver the story it also makes sure

00:08:14,649 --> 00:08:18,249
that you don't write your test

00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:19,419
afterwards and you accidentally write a

00:08:18,249 --> 00:08:22,569
bad test that would have passed

00:08:19,419 --> 00:08:24,969
trivially and in general we want to only

00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:26,619
be writing code that makes test pass if

00:08:24,969 --> 00:08:29,680
we have code in there that didn't make

00:08:26,619 --> 00:08:31,119
some test move from failing to passing

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,039
then we don't really know that that test

00:08:31,119 --> 00:08:36,099
that code is actually tested and if

00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:37,750
someone were to go and refactor that no

00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:41,620
test would break and we're in a kind of

00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:43,479
a unmaintainable situation so on

00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:45,310
refactoring in general we only want to

00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:47,850
refactor when all the tests are green

00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:50,589
that is when all the tests are passing

00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:52,529
so we don't want to have a broken test

00:08:50,589 --> 00:08:54,449
and then start doing some

00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:55,889
random little method changes here and

00:08:54,449 --> 00:08:59,850
there because we don't know that what we

00:08:55,889 --> 00:09:01,230
actually changed was broke anything or

00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:04,290
not because some of the tests were

00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:06,540
failing anyway and so the in strict TDD

00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:09,149
we say only write code if it makes a

00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:11,759
test pass and so the result of this is

00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:17,100
that you have sorry and the result of

00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:18,959
this is that you have a lot of concise

00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,459
code because the code should only be

00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,499
there in order to make a test pass and

00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:24,600
it also means you have a ton of tests

00:09:22,499 --> 00:09:25,980
because it means that for every bit of

00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,540
code you want to write you need to have

00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:30,420
a test that corresponds to it so you end

00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:33,660
up with a ton of tests and pretty

00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:36,209
concise and maintainable code another

00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:39,089
key principle of our team is shared code

00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:41,519
ownership so there's no one person or

00:09:39,089 --> 00:09:44,009
one pair that's responsible for a

00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:46,949
section of code the entire team owns the

00:09:44,009 --> 00:09:49,079
entire code base and this is helped a

00:09:46,949 --> 00:09:50,040
lot by our frequent pair rotation the

00:09:49,079 --> 00:09:52,800
idea is we don't want to have

00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:54,809
information silos where one person just

00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,910
you know knows one area really well and

00:09:54,809 --> 00:09:58,949
then that person gets sick and you know

00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:00,509
then we're like what do we do that print

00:09:58,949 --> 00:10:02,250
that knowledge is in that person's head

00:10:00,509 --> 00:10:03,750
so that's why we try to always be

00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:06,449
rotating pairs so everyone has eyes on

00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:08,220
it and everyone is contributed to it you

00:10:06,449 --> 00:10:10,980
know because the idea is like more

00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:15,439
people's input can catch more bugs and

00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:18,329
prevent sort of one particular person's

00:10:15,439 --> 00:10:19,889
specific style from showing through too

00:10:18,329 --> 00:10:22,620
much and everything is a little bit more

00:10:19,889 --> 00:10:24,480
standard so we also share a

00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:26,040
responsibility and blame that means so

00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,410
you know we don't point a specific

00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,879
developer and say like you know his code

00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:31,259
broke everything or something like that

00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:33,329
because everything's our code like every

00:10:31,259 --> 00:10:35,490
line of code is probably written by four

00:10:33,329 --> 00:10:37,230
engineers over the course of like you

00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:38,670
know if a particular story takes two

00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:40,649
days to write you know maybe that's

00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:44,970
three engineers or four engineers that

00:10:40,649 --> 00:10:46,769
have worked on it another key principle

00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:49,319
for us is continuous integration and

00:10:46,769 --> 00:10:51,059
release continuous integration or CI for

00:10:49,319 --> 00:10:53,730
short this is the idea that we're

00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:56,040
constantly integrating our code our

00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:58,170
develop branch into our master branch so

00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:00,750
we always check in directly to a develop

00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:03,420
branch through git and then it goes

00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:05,040
through a huge series of tests to make

00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:06,120
sure the code is stable and doesn't

00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,430
break any existing

00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:10,290
chené allottee and then when it's ready

00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:13,470
when it's passed all those things it

00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:15,930
gets merged into master our master

00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:17,850
branch is meant to always be solid

00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:19,830
validated code the idea is you can

00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:22,110
always release from master at any point

00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:23,670
in time and so this means that we can

00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:27,150
release frequently whenever we need to

00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:28,410
for any reason and the master branch has

00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:31,920
always kept clean and we don't push

00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:34,820
directly to master this is our pipeline

00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:37,020
it's pretty overwhelming right now but

00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:38,400
basically when you push to develop on

00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:41,130
the Diego team your code is going to

00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:43,290
enter from the left-hand side and then

00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:45,450
go through all these boxes each box is

00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:47,310
either a test or a deployment step or

00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:49,500
something like that and once it passes

00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:51,000
all these things you can see there's

00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:53,339
some red right now which is not you know

00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,990
that's not great but once it passes all

00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:56,310
these things it comes out on the

00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:58,980
right-hand side and it's been merged to

00:11:56,310 --> 00:12:01,310
develop and it's ready to be made into a

00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:04,020
final release that can be published

00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:06,360
another key aspect of our development

00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:08,520
culture is regular retrospectives so

00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:10,200
every week we get together as a group we

00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:12,779
talk about what went well what didn't go

00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:15,690
well in the past week this is absolutely

00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:17,490
key to our entire process because the

00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:18,810
team dynamic is constantly changing

00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:21,240
because we're always bringing in new

00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:23,279
people and we need to always be adapting

00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,990
to our current engineers and learning

00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,850
and making ourselves the best team we

00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:28,440
can possibly be we got to make sure that

00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:29,760
if we made a mistake this week that's

00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:34,140
fine we just gotta make sure we don't

00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:35,760
make that mistake again next week so in

00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:38,100
general the way the retrospective works

00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,050
is we have a white board with three

00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:42,270
columns we have the good discuss and bad

00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:44,459
column the first 10 minutes of the Retro

00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:47,190
everyone has a marker people go up to

00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:49,140
the board they write things in all three

00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:51,089
columns whatever comes to mind

00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:52,440
and then the next 50 minutes are spent

00:12:51,089 --> 00:12:55,290
actually going through all those two

00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:56,700
topics and discussing them and creating

00:12:55,290 --> 00:13:01,589
action items out of that that are going

00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:04,890
to be done in the next week the last

00:13:01,589 --> 00:13:06,720
thing that we do is collaborative story

00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:09,120
estimation so we have a weekly meeting

00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,150
where we look at everything in the

00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,920
backlog that we haven't talked about yet

00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:16,050
so we have this backlog and tracker and

00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:18,720
our p.m. creates new stories and he

00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:21,090
writes acceptance criteria down

00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,280
and then we as a team the engineers come

00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:25,230
together we talk about the acceptance

00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,610
criteria there it's not it's our

00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:28,320
opportunity as engineers to give

00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:29,430
feedback to the PM and say we don't

00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,710
really agree with this acceptance

00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:33,330
criteria or we can talk about the

00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:34,590
implement the broad implementation

00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:36,330
details and how we're going to do this

00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:38,250
so we kind of get all on the same page

00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:42,120
as a team before one pair goes off and

00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:43,950
goes to implement it then we we point

00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:47,100
the story we estimate the story with the

00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:50,190
Fibonacci numbers the point of story

00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:52,350
pointing is twofold one is so that we

00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:55,080
have some velocity estimates so we can

00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:57,630
say well we know in general we can do

00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:59,370
about like 15 units of work in a week or

00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:01,220
whatever it is and then when we see how

00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:03,780
much work we have left until a certain

00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:05,190
feature is done then we can say well I

00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:06,840
guess it'll take a month to do that

00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:10,680
feature because it has that many sorry

00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:12,420
complexity points the other advantage of

00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:15,150
doing this collaborative story

00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:18,060
estimation is just a chance for us all

00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:19,620
to sit down as an entire engineering

00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:21,840
team and talk about something at a broad

00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:23,700
level and make sure whoever the pair is

00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:26,160
that picks it up is kind of doing what

00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:30,480
the entire group had in mind for

00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:33,110
implementation so that was just the

00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:35,220
principles that we use in a normal

00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:36,960
co-located environment that's just the

00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:39,300
way that we work on the Diego team and

00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:41,820
in Cloud Foundry in general so now I

00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:44,310
want to go through and talk about what

00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:45,810
changes with remote development what

00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:48,060
parts of these stay the same what parts

00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:50,040
need to change some parts are totally

00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:51,750
unchanged like the TDD test-driven

00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,670
development that doesn't matter if your

00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:55,470
remote or local shared code ownership

00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:57,090
same thing is just a philosophy and

00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:58,740
continuous integration doesn't matter

00:14:57,090 --> 00:15:01,260
but there are some other things that

00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:02,850
need to be modified the most obvious one

00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:04,350
is pair programming so we're not

00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:06,780
actually physically sitting next to each

00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:10,290
other anymore we have a couple different

00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:12,180
tools that we use for this for Windows

00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:15,450
and Mac there's a tool called screen

00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:17,520
hero this shares your entire screen it

00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:20,550
gives you two cursors and it gives both

00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:23,310
people control over clicking on things

00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:26,580
and typing things in general it works

00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:29,460
pretty well for us the downside is that

00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:30,510
it doesn't have a Linux client so and

00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:32,000
some of the people on our team have

00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:34,640
Linux machines so for

00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,320
we use a different combination of tools

00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:38,360
depending on what we're doing that day

00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:41,090
if we really do need to share the full

00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:43,220
screen then we might use like Google

00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:47,210
hangout screen share or a peer in screen

00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:49,430
share or and we have an edition of that

00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:51,680
we have like a voice element as well

00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:54,200
because screen hero also provides voice

00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,700
on top of screen sharing so usually we

00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,710
have to do like a two pronged approach

00:15:55,700 --> 00:16:00,830
we have one tool for screen sharing and

00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:03,770
one tool for voice it we also use chrome

00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:05,660
remote desktop the other thing that we

00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:07,640
more commonly do if we don't really need

00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:10,010
to share the screen for that day is to

00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:12,860
use T MUX that I'll just share the

00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:14,630
terminal and that works pretty easy and

00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:16,220
that's also pretty good if we have one

00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:17,150
person that has a bad connection for the

00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:18,950
day or something like that

00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:25,040
to mix a lot faster than sharing the

00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:26,510
entire screen stand-ups so we don't have

00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,310
that physical board anymore that

00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:30,440
whiteboard where we have the actual

00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:32,060
Polaroids of the team members faces and

00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,710
stuff like that but instead we have a

00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:36,890
Google spreadsheet where we've uploaded

00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:38,450
the Polaroids of everyone's face and in

00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:39,920
a way the spreadsheets actually a little

00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:42,860
bit nicer I think this is one thing

00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:45,320
that's probably even better than it used

00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:46,760
to be because we can do analytics on

00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,650
this afterwards we can see

00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:50,120
oh man that person's pairing way too

00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:51,560
much for that person or that person and

00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,860
that person never pair together and we

00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:55,940
can kind of like after the fact look at

00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:59,390
trends and make sure that we're actually

00:16:55,940 --> 00:17:03,020
pairing people together with a correct

00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:05,350
distribution and this is also you know

00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:09,319
fully it's totally public anyone can

00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:11,870
sorry anyone can view it and we can put

00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:12,949
our pairing roles here as well in

00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:14,630
general I think this has actually been

00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:19,370
an upgrade from the co-located solution

00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:20,780
that we had before for the retros we

00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:23,209
don't have a whiteboard anymore so no

00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:24,709
one has markers as going up any more we

00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:28,670
just use a Google Doc spreadsheet it's

00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:30,850
pretty simple the only slight

00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:32,570
disadvantage I guess is the people in

00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:33,650
you know who are actually in the

00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:35,840
conference room because we still have a

00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:37,100
couple that are in San Francisco in a

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,630
conference room they have to like pass

00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:40,100
around a keyboard to each other so

00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:42,530
everyone can type in the spreadsheet but

00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:44,240
that's not really so bad so the retros

00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:45,830
have been pretty unaffected we just go

00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:49,000
I'll get on to a voice call or

00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:51,380
a video call usually that's pretty easy

00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,200
story pointing that's similar we're all

00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:58,880
in a big video call together one change

00:17:54,200 --> 00:18:01,100
that we made was to start making sure

00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,710
that all items to be discussed that day

00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:05,630
are tagged with the IPM label this means

00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:06,620
we can just click on that label and it

00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:09,200
brings up everything that we're going to

00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:11,360
talk about doing that IPM when we were

00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,440
first doing this we would you know say

00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,820
things were like well we're talking with

00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:15,890
this story kind of scroll halfway down

00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:18,080
and when you see that then you know it's

00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:19,190
the one that starts with this but so

00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,309
that was a small thing that we did that

00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:24,710
made a lot easier make sure that we make

00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:26,299
sure the cameras on because we point

00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:29,210
using our fingers we hold up a number of

00:18:26,299 --> 00:18:32,299
finger to say how many points we want to

00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:34,389
allocate to that story otherwise it's

00:18:32,299 --> 00:18:39,110
not really that different than in person

00:18:34,389 --> 00:18:40,429
one challenge in general this applies to

00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:42,080
pairing but it applies to really

00:18:40,429 --> 00:18:43,940
everything about how the team runs is

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,070
dealing with the time zone differences

00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:48,110
so I can mentioned we have people on the

00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:50,210
east coast of the US and the west coast

00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:53,059
of the US so it's a three hour time zone

00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:56,480
difference when we first started having

00:18:53,059 --> 00:18:57,710
a large East Coast presence we just kind

00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,720
of kept doing things the way we were

00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:01,840
doing it before where we'd say well our

00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:05,000
stand-up is at 9:00 a.m. West Coast time

00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:07,130
but that meant that you know the East

00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,899
Coasters had three hours where they were

00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:10,700
on line and it was part of their workday

00:19:08,899 --> 00:19:12,169
but they didn't know who they were

00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,789
working on they would maybe grab what

00:19:12,169 --> 00:19:14,779
they were working on the previous day

00:19:13,789 --> 00:19:15,559
but it wasn't really clear what they

00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:18,049
were supposed to do

00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:20,630
so we started doing these times own

00:19:18,049 --> 00:19:22,789
specific sync ups so we have a 9:00 a.m.

00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:23,960
East Coast sync up for the East Coasters

00:19:22,789 --> 00:19:27,350
and then a 3:00 p.m.

00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:29,090
West Coast sync up for the West Coasters

00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:30,440
and this is a chance for us to talk to

00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:32,450
there are people in our time zone and

00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:34,130
say like oh you're working alone I'm

00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:36,350
working alone let's get together in pair

00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:38,750
and join tracks and it's a time for us

00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:39,889
to reallocate the different pairing

00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,809
roles because you have that interrupts

00:19:39,889 --> 00:19:43,399
role and the build role and stuff and so

00:19:41,809 --> 00:19:45,230
making sure that we have people that are

00:19:43,399 --> 00:19:46,669
covering all of those roles and this is

00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:48,260
not as long as stand up stand up sprit e

00:19:46,669 --> 00:19:51,830
quick but this is even quicker this can

00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:53,929
be just two minutes literally the

00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:56,240
downside is you know we're not hitting

00:19:53,929 --> 00:19:58,490
on a % pair program anymore pair

00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,370
programming anymore we try and I think

00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:03,429
the sync ups helped a little bit

00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:04,660
but you know it's inevitable when we

00:20:03,429 --> 00:20:07,210
have the situation that there's gonna be

00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:08,860
like three hours on either side we're in

00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:11,320
a lot of cases there's gonna be people

00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:13,450
soloing for three hours a day it's not

00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:16,720
uncommon now so it's a little bit of a

00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:18,309
downside of doing the time zone across

00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,160
time they're across time zone

00:20:18,309 --> 00:20:23,410
development but it seems to be working

00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:27,580
all right for us we're gonna continue to

00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:29,500
see how it goes but so far it seems like

00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:32,170
not pair programming 100% of the time

00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:37,570
hasn't seemed to be a huge issue for us

00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:39,910
yet there's also just a general want

00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:41,830
willingness of the team to do remote

00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:43,630
development the team has to actively

00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:45,520
work towards us it has to be an entire

00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:48,429
team buy-in from the remote people and

00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:50,350
the people if you have people in one

00:20:48,429 --> 00:20:52,300
like central office they have to be

00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:53,950
super conscious of the remote people and

00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:56,980
it has to be something that people are

00:20:53,950 --> 00:21:00,130
actively working towards so the input

00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:02,260
there's a lot that kind of rests on the

00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:04,960
in-person people so in this case it's

00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:06,820
the San Francisco people you know things

00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,530
like speaking into the mic having only

00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:11,230
one conversation going at a time when

00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:12,790
you're in a meeting and when you have

00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:14,170
someone interrupting on the phone or

00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:16,059
they're making some sort of gesture that

00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:18,850
they want to interrupt you kind of give

00:21:16,059 --> 00:21:20,260
them a little bit more of the ability to

00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:21,490
interrupt then you might give them if

00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:23,590
they were in person because you

00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:25,390
recognize that it's harder there's some

00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:26,800
lag time there's you know it's harder to

00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:29,290
read body language and stuff like that

00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:30,760
and so because it's harder to interrupt

00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:32,290
and be part of that conversation when

00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:34,150
you're remote as someone that's not

00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:35,890
that's not remote it's your

00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:37,570
responsibility to make sure that that

00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:40,540
person has the stage and is given a

00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:41,980
voice and you know if if not in that

00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:43,720
moment when they're interrupting then

00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:44,980
you say okay hold on one second Jen

00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:47,170
we're gonna let this person finish and

00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:48,640
then you but you you acknowledge them

00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:50,650
and you actively give them the stage

00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,929
because you realize that you know as the

00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:54,970
person in San Francisco for example you

00:21:52,929 --> 00:21:57,840
have a bit more control over who gets to

00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:57,840
talk and stuff like that

00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:01,929
the West Coasters in our case so we have

00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:04,630
the West Coasters that work for three

00:22:01,929 --> 00:22:06,360
hours at the end of the day where the

00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:10,320
East Coasters have already signed off

00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:12,760
the West Coasters need to be aware to

00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,470
write down their story progress at the

00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,850
end of the day

00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:16,890
so after they've worked that additional

00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:18,480
three hours they need to update what

00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:20,610
they did on the story and be very clear

00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,500
I got exactly this far my work in

00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:24,600
progress is on this branch for this repo

00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:26,340
and that way an East Coaster can come in

00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:29,070
in their extra time in the morning they

00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:30,929
look at what progress their Parra made

00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:32,580
from the day before for example and they

00:22:30,929 --> 00:22:34,559
can just pick up from where they left

00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:36,570
off and there were just like lots of

00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:39,179
small things you can do this is part of

00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:41,880
just like building up empathy for the

00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:43,740
remote people and the wanting the

00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:48,299
willingness and the desire to have a

00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:50,250
remote team sorry so for example saying

00:22:48,299 --> 00:22:52,140
like instead of saying the meeting

00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:53,669
starts at 11:00 a.m. you might say the

00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:56,370
meeting starts in two hours these are

00:22:53,669 --> 00:22:58,409
small things they just notice over time

00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:59,730
he might catch yourself doing oh yeah I

00:22:58,409 --> 00:23:01,530
just said 11 a.m. but that doesn't make

00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:02,880
any sense to that person but you know by

00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:04,620
saying something like it starts in two

00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,330
hours it just kind of like makes it

00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:07,919
clear that you know everyone's on the

00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:09,480
same playing field and you know it's not

00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,860
like you're trying to say one timezone

00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,970
is the right time zone or something like

00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:13,500
that

00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:15,000
but like I said it has to be a team

00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:17,070
priority and people have to want to do

00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,110
this and there's a lot that rests on the

00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:22,890
people that are in person if you do have

00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:26,010
like an in person core there also

00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:27,900
challenges that we face in person

00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:29,880
interrupts are tough and by in person

00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:33,210
here I mean San Francisco I'm in in our

00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:35,370
case because we have a large many of the

00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:37,559
core cloud foundry teams are all working

00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:39,179
out of San Francisco so when I'm pairing

00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:40,830
with someone that's in San Francisco and

00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:44,700
someone else from another cloud foundry

00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:48,150
team comes by and interrupts my pair at

00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:49,770
first you know a year ago my paranoid

00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:51,750
have muted the mic you know because he

00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:52,980
thought it was rude to be talking to me

00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:55,770
and talking to someone in person at the

00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:56,850
same time but we learned over time it's

00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:57,780
actually better not to meet the mic

00:23:56,850 --> 00:24:00,840
unless you're talking about something

00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:02,250
like private to your company you know

00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,780
you want to keep that mic on just so

00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:05,850
like the remote person feels more

00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:07,289
included even though I can't interrupt

00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:08,520
the person in real-time and say

00:24:07,289 --> 00:24:10,470
something

00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,940
it still feels nice to be able to hear

00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:14,070
what that discussion is and I have some

00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:15,240
context oh that the Cappy team just came

00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:17,659
over and asked that question it just

00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:20,580
helps to keep them mic on

00:24:17,659 --> 00:24:21,960
obviously ad-hoc discussions are just a

00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:24,000
natural part of software development

00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:26,669
especially when you have everyone in an

00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,909
open shared space working together side

00:24:26,669 --> 00:24:28,649
by

00:24:26,909 --> 00:24:29,970
side you know you over here some other

00:24:28,649 --> 00:24:31,379
pair mentioned something and you kind of

00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:32,609
interrupt me like oh wait I have an idea

00:24:31,379 --> 00:24:34,320
about that and then you start talking

00:24:32,609 --> 00:24:35,970
and then you go to a whiteboard and

00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,619
obviously that parts a lot harder when

00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:39,210
you have in a remote person but there

00:24:37,619 --> 00:24:40,499
has to come a time when you have that

00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:42,570
then you have remote people where you

00:24:40,499 --> 00:24:43,919
say like hold on let's just pause this

00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:46,919
is turning into a little bit of like a

00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:50,399
design discussion or a meeting let's

00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:52,229
actually get a conference room and call

00:24:50,399 --> 00:24:53,849
you you know and tell people if they

00:24:52,229 --> 00:24:56,639
want to come join the call they can just

00:24:53,849 --> 00:24:58,710
call in at this number this might look

00:24:56,639 --> 00:25:01,249
like a joke but no ping-pong sewing in

00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:04,049
San Francisco they have ping pong tables

00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:05,639
and it's a great like break in the

00:25:04,049 --> 00:25:07,229
middle of the day you've been pairing

00:25:05,639 --> 00:25:08,629
you're focused and you say like let's

00:25:07,229 --> 00:25:11,369
just take a 15-minute ping-pong break

00:25:08,629 --> 00:25:13,529
and it's fun but it's also pretty useful

00:25:11,369 --> 00:25:14,940
to actually get up and be standing and

00:25:13,529 --> 00:25:16,049
doing something physical and be doing

00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:17,580
something with your pair that's not

00:25:16,049 --> 00:25:20,460
programming I think it's actually really

00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:23,460
healthy it's a healthy part of like our

00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:24,479
day and so it's unfortunate you know

00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:26,129
when you're pairing you don't have that

00:25:24,479 --> 00:25:28,529
when your remote pairing you don't have

00:25:26,129 --> 00:25:30,450
that and there's a it feels a little bit

00:25:28,529 --> 00:25:31,710
less casual or less familiar sometimes

00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:33,239
like when you're in person with someone

00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:35,940
sometimes you feel like you can joke

00:25:33,239 --> 00:25:36,979
around more you can be more casual but

00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:38,729
when you're on the phone suddenly

00:25:36,979 --> 00:25:41,340
especially if you've never met the

00:25:38,729 --> 00:25:44,190
person in person before it can feel a

00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:44,999
little bit more formal and so that's

00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:46,440
just something you have to be conscious

00:25:44,999 --> 00:25:48,269
of and something I try to be conscious

00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:49,979
of so I try every time I meet someone

00:25:48,269 --> 00:25:53,399
new over the phone I try to be really

00:25:49,979 --> 00:25:56,489
like friendly and casual and let's like

00:25:53,399 --> 00:25:58,499
let's not make this too stiff or boring

00:25:56,489 --> 00:25:59,519
or formal because I have to you know I'm

00:25:58,499 --> 00:26:01,649
working with the person for eight hours

00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:04,799
I want to feel like you know we're human

00:26:01,649 --> 00:26:06,149
it's not just developers and obviously

00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,409
there's problems if you have like a slow

00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:09,269
internet connection or something like

00:26:07,409 --> 00:26:11,340
that but usually we can get around those

00:26:09,269 --> 00:26:14,849
like using T mocks instead of a full

00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:17,999
screen share so but other than that I

00:26:14,849 --> 00:26:19,619
would say that pair promote pair

00:26:17,999 --> 00:26:21,659
programming and remote agile has gone

00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:24,419
pretty well for us and as someone that's

00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:26,429
doing remote agile like I think it's

00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:28,559
actually working really well I go down

00:26:26,429 --> 00:26:30,509
to San Francisco every couple months as

00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:32,940
well but I don't feel like there's a

00:26:30,509 --> 00:26:34,259
huge huge difference between when I'm

00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:36,389
working with people in person and when

00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:38,099
I'm remote and I think part of that is

00:26:36,389 --> 00:26:40,120
just due to the amount of effort the

00:26:38,099 --> 00:26:44,760
Diego team has put into

00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:48,090
making and making all these changes are

00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:48,090
there any questions

00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:05,130
much much to hoping you can it's much

00:28:02,919 --> 00:28:05,130
easy

00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:21,149
yeah yeah I agree with pretty much

00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:23,940
everything you said so quick summary is

00:28:21,149 --> 00:28:25,559
the Google Spreadsheets for retro means

00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:27,119
you can write in the spreadsheet the

00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:30,090
entire week not just the retro time and

00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:32,429
that's a nice advantage and you can use

00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:35,070
a peer in for quick interrupts appearing

00:28:32,429 --> 00:28:36,450
as a voice chat a video chat and you

00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:38,039
know it's nice to actually see video not

00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:41,549
just calls so you can see people's face

00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:43,049
and I forget your Oh ping pong breaks

00:28:41,549 --> 00:28:45,330
you know you have to remember when

00:28:43,049 --> 00:28:46,889
you're doing remote pairing to always be

00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:49,980
taking breaks because it might feel a

00:28:46,889 --> 00:28:51,330
little bit it doesn't come as naturally

00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:57,809
as when you're in person and like the

00:28:51,330 --> 00:29:05,340
ping pong break is available any more

00:28:57,809 --> 00:29:06,509
questions um so the team so the question

00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:09,029
is how often does the team meet in

00:29:06,509 --> 00:29:10,350
person well it changes because the team

00:29:09,029 --> 00:29:11,580
changes all the time and so for

00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:13,109
individual people there are some people

00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:14,879
that really can't travel that much you

00:29:13,109 --> 00:29:17,009
know they have young kids or you know

00:29:14,879 --> 00:29:18,269
it's just not possible for them to be

00:29:17,009 --> 00:29:20,519
traveling that often so they might not

00:29:18,269 --> 00:29:25,470
travel very much at all to meet with the

00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:26,700
rest of the team we have maybe every six

00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:29,159
months to a year

00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:31,799
these inceptions where we kind of get

00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:34,470
together and talk about the team's

00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:36,869
direction and what the next big large

00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:39,389
tracks of work are gonna be I did one

00:29:36,869 --> 00:29:41,340
inception remotely and it was very tough

00:29:39,389 --> 00:29:43,919
the inception is a full-day long meeting

00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:45,389
and I found it was just in terms of the

00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:46,980
actions and stuff like that it was just

00:29:45,389 --> 00:29:49,590
very very hard to be a remote person for

00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:51,539
that so the next inception that we did I

00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:53,039
made it a priority to be there in person

00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:54,690
and we got the one I think at that point

00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:56,879
there was only one other remote person

00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:59,759
we got him to come in as well so we

00:29:56,879 --> 00:30:00,359
synchronized that but in general we

00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:01,799
haven't

00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:03,389
there aren't many times when we say

00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:06,090
everyone is going to come and get

00:30:03,389 --> 00:30:07,440
together at one time and it really

00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:08,369
depends on the individual person and

00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,899
like I said the team is constantly

00:30:08,369 --> 00:30:12,059
changing so it really depends on the

00:30:09,899 --> 00:30:14,220
people I try to go every two months or

00:30:12,059 --> 00:30:15,600
so other people come and you know go to

00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:18,499
San Francisco either never or a

00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,499
different cadence

00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:28,470
so the question was about bigger time

00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:31,470
zone differences on the Diego team

00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:33,990
itself no so we haven't had people on

00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:36,720
the Diego team well we've had people

00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:40,860
that work on a specific sub component of

00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:44,100
Diego that are kind of a self-contained

00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:46,950
team working in Europe for example but

00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:48,810
we're not doing direct pairing you know

00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:51,990
we're not assigning pairs across like

00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:53,460
Europe and the US we work very closely

00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:55,890
with garden and garden is based in

00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:57,240
London so you know we're conscious of

00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:58,410
these things we always you know have to

00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,750
you know make sure like if you have

00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:02,450
garden questions or if we have a cross

00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:04,920
team pair that we want to do with garden

00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:06,480
you usually we got will get a u.s. East

00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:08,070
Coaster to do that cross team pair and

00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,750
we need to make sure we prioritize that

00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:11,760
in the morning and stuff like that but

00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:13,290
you know it's tough when you have large

00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:15,090
time zone differences to actually do

00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:20,060
true pairing it becomes harder and

00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:20,060
harder yep

00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:36,690
so the question is about team size and

00:31:33,539 --> 00:31:40,619
so the Diego team right now has nine

00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:41,279
devs and we that's the largest the team

00:31:40,619 --> 00:31:44,070
has ever been

00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:46,049
I think it's been five devs in the past

00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:48,539
or something like that so that's the

00:31:46,049 --> 00:31:50,850
team that we've worked with but you know

00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:52,590
the larger Cloud Foundry organization as

00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:54,559
a whole is obviously much larger than

00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:56,669
that I think there's like 130 core

00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:58,289
contributors and so like I said for like

00:31:56,669 --> 00:32:00,029
garden and stuff they all work in London

00:31:58,289 --> 00:32:02,159
and so we we work with them but they're

00:32:00,029 --> 00:32:04,049
not in the same exact team as us so our

00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:13,529
team is quite you could say it's quite

00:32:04,049 --> 00:32:16,080
small with nine developers the question

00:32:13,529 --> 00:32:18,090
is how come we can do pair programming

00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:21,539
when we have an odd number of developers

00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:23,820
yeah nine is not the ideal number and we

00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:26,039
try not to have odd numbers but at the

00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:27,990
point at which you get to nine

00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:29,970
developers that's quite a lot that's

00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:32,909
it's very big for a Cloud Foundry team

00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:34,110
and so it at that point there's almost

00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:36,360
there's always some reason that

00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:38,610
someone's going to be out that day and

00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:40,259
so even if we had eight developers you

00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:41,789
know someone's probably gonna be soloing

00:32:40,259 --> 00:32:43,200
that day just because someone has a

00:32:41,789 --> 00:32:46,230
doctor's appointment someone sick

00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:49,700
whatever yeah obviously nine is not

00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:49,700
ideal for a pair programming team

00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:58,380
question is when we're doing solo

00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:01,950
programming do we do any code review

00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:06,450
after the fact actually we don't if I'm

00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:09,210
solo programming usually I mean usually

00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:10,590
I don't work on an entire work item solo

00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:13,170
usually it's like I'll start with

00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:15,420
someone and then someone goes you know

00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:17,640
they leave for the day and you know I

00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:19,680
I'm still working and then I'll just

00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:21,240
finish it up on my own so you know there

00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:22,770
is some amount of pairing that goes into

00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,420
pretty much every story like there it's

00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:27,750
rare the entire story will be done by a

00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:30,230
single person via so we don't have any

00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:30,230
code review

00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:42,770
so the question is about a having a

00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:44,090
scrunt we're not doing scrum but do we

00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:48,260
have like a scrum like like a scrum

00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:50,659
master you mean like we have so we have

00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:53,440
two special roles on the team we have

00:33:50,659 --> 00:33:55,370
the PM there the like project owner

00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:57,169
essentially they're the one that does

00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:59,270
the acceptance they write the stories

00:33:57,169 --> 00:34:00,799
and actually test that things are

00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:03,110
accepted and then we have the anchor

00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:04,730
which maybe you know I don't know that

00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:07,429
much about scrum but the anchor might be

00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:08,990
doing more of the scrum master type

00:34:07,429 --> 00:34:11,330
stuff like they do a little bit more of

00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:13,490
the day-to-day like they've run stand-up

00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:14,510
they run the retros and stuff like that

00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:18,109
but there isn't really that much that

00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:19,550
needs to be done there so we're we're

00:34:18,109 --> 00:34:21,530
about five minutes over I think there

00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:23,270
are more questions I have a little bit

00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:25,280
of time if you want to come up after the

00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:27,040
fact but I think I'll let the rest of

00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:30,960
you go now

00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,960
