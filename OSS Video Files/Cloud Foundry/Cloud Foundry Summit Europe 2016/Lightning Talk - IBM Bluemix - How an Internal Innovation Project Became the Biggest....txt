Description: 
	Lightning Talk - IBM Bluemix - How an Internal Innovation Project Became the Biggest Cloud Foundry Service in the World - Simon Moser, Sr. Technical Staff Member and Dr. Max, Scientist, Architect, and Engineer, IBM

It's quite a story: in 2012, a bunch of developers in need of a platform where they can quickly push some applications without having to order infrastructure starting playing around with Cloud Foundry. A few years later, this project became commercially known as Bluemix, and with around 1 million users and hundreds of thousands running applications is probably the largest Cloud Foundry certified service in the world today. One reason for its popularity is Bluemix' great service ecosystem - which was fueled by technical contributions from and to the community and therefore serves as a great example how an open source community and a resulting service ecosystem impact each other.

About Michael (aka dr.max) Maximilien
My name is Michael Maximilien, better known as max or dr.max, and I am a computer scientist with IBM. At IBM Research Triangle Park, I was a principal engineer for the worldwide industry point-of-sale standard: JavaPOS. At IBM Research, some highlights include pioneering research on semantic Web services, mashups, and cloud computing, and platform-as-a-service. I joined the IBM Cloud Labs in 2014 and work closely with Pivotal Inc., to help make the Cloud Found the best PaaS.

	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,859
so welcome everybody to this year's

00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,490
start foundry summer in Europe my name

00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:08,189
is Simon

00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:10,530
this is dr. max and we're here to tell

00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:14,400
you a little bit about Clark family and

00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:19,109
about bluemix so what bloomix bloomix is

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:21,990
the IBM offering that we created as a

00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:24,199
start from an internal development thing

00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:28,050
people wanted to just be able to push

00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:29,820
apps very quickly and by now actually

00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,180
became the largest our founding service

00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,920
in the world I think so we're having

00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:37,680
20,000 new users per week we're running

00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:41,190
four hundred twenty thousand new apps

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:44,070
per month we have hundreds of services

00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:47,460
in the bluemix service catalog and we're

00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:50,100
literally having 7 billion more than 7

00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:54,300
billion service API calls in the month

00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:56,219
all that we accomplished in within a few

00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,920
years starting off basically from the

00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:03,239
greenfield and how we got to that max

00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:05,820
will tell you right so of course I'm

00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:09,869
just one member of a larger team and

00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:12,150
some of them here and I'm only we only

00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:14,520
have four minutes so I can only cover a

00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:16,530
subset but what I want to say is that

00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,250
it's been really good a really good

00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:18,840
symbiosis

00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:21,570
you know what symbiosis mean it's like a

00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,400
relationship you know and organism so

00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:26,610
let's talk about some specific so for

00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:29,430
instance services you have services last

00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:31,409
year when we launched bluemix or a year

00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:33,000
and a half ago yes one of the things

00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:36,060
that happen is that we needed to add

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,920
services for analytics and those

00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:41,100
services as you probably know it take a

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,470
lot more than 60 seconds to provision

00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:47,490
and to get ready so what we did is we

00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:49,500
worked with pivotal our partners and we

00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:52,380
added asynchronous operations to

00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:55,200
services and this was kind of something

00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:57,450
that started I think in January and by

00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,630
March I was basically embedded to the

00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:02,280
team and we had a working version the

00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:03,990
other thing that's important is equity I

00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,969
was able to bring in somebody from the

00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,509
bluemix garage to help so this is one

00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:09,420
example

00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:11,580
another one is services keys so the

00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:13,620
bluemix platform has a container

00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:16,200
services

00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,629
set of service that are independent of

00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:21,780
Cloud Foundry but these needed to talk

00:02:18,629 --> 00:02:24,870
to the same CF services that we had in

00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:27,299
the past or that we have and what we did

00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,950
with collaborating with pivotal again is

00:02:27,299 --> 00:02:30,659
to add services keys and what's

00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:32,640
interesting about services keys in terms

00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:35,310
of the development effort is I started

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,989
it and then I have a team in China where

00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:38,970
I needed to work with them so what I did

00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:41,579
is I went to China and essentially got

00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:43,230
them to complete the work working with

00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:46,019
pivotal so this is another example

00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:48,030
within three months we got done another

00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:51,000
one that's sort of close and dear to my

00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:52,700
heart is Bosh mainly because that's the

00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,079
project I contribute the moisture

00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:58,519
probably not as much as dr. NIC but

00:02:55,079 --> 00:03:01,590
almost I'm trying to compete with him

00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:03,329
external CBI so you heard Sam talk about

00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:06,150
the fact that Bosh supports all these

00:03:03,329 --> 00:03:06,840
clouds well guess what it wasn't like

00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:09,720
this before

00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:12,329
all of those clouds the code for the

00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:14,909
clouds were embedded in the director so

00:03:12,329 --> 00:03:17,489
what I what we did and I contributed a

00:03:14,909 --> 00:03:18,989
little bit to that is to help you know

00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:20,489
Demetri in Moorea and the rest of the

00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:23,370
team to essentially figure out how to

00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:25,949
remove the CPI and then part of this was

00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:28,590
to kind of self-serving we needed a new

00:03:25,949 --> 00:03:31,409
CPI so I went ahead and started created

00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:33,540
that and now that sort of flourishing

00:03:31,409 --> 00:03:34,620
other things of incubation so for

00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,480
instance abacus we're actually

00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:39,090
collaborating with s AP on this one

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,829
where we it's the metering engine for

00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:43,769
cloud foundry

00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:46,169
another one is swagger it's essentially

00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:49,470
trying to provide standard description

00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:51,120
for services in cloud foundry HP ISO

00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:53,970
should interest so we're looking at the

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,340
v3 API is for instance for this and

00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:57,900
there's a few more so can't really talk

00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:01,620
about all of them but one of which that

00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:02,909
Simon leads is the bit services so the

00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,530
final thing that we're going to talk

00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:06,780
about is the bit service which is an

00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:08,849
incubation project that is really scoped

00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:11,180
around managing bits it has a service

00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:16,199
CAF service specific abstraction of

00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:18,000
objects doors clearly defined API and it

00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:19,620
comes with batteries included for open

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,180
source codes which means the most common

00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:24,719
object stores are actually already

00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:26,590
supported out of the box I want to

00:04:24,719 --> 00:04:28,630
conclude this talk with really the less

00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:30,340
learned like we started like we have a

00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:32,350
strong open source collaboration as we

00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:34,240
just showed we have been building this

00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:36,100
for a few years now have been working

00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,370
with Cloud Foundry for for a while

00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:42,400
and there are a bunch of things that we

00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:44,139
learned on our way right first is you

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,520
need if you want to run a cloud travel

00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:48,400
you definitely need to have a reliable

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,229
is particularly if you run its scale you

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,910
need to monitor you need to automate you

00:04:50,229 --> 00:04:55,630
need to analyze and you need to repeat

00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:57,190
because the operational things is the

00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:59,080
most critical part when you run

00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:01,570
something like that you've got to be

00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:04,600
prepared for the weirdness because I can

00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:07,630
tell you by it by a fact that if you do

00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:10,210
something if you repeat a task 600 times

00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:13,120
for 600 VMs there's gonna be one that's

00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:14,530
feeling for no apparent reason right so

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:19,360
there is some of these things that

00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:22,539
happen last lesson learned is many small

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:25,750
deployments are much better than having

00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:28,900
one big deployment so if anyone wants to

00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:30,400
grow at scale keep that in mind and last

00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,780
but not least and this is why we're all

00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,669
here this is why we're here for the

00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:36,430
conference open source collaboration

00:05:33,669 --> 00:05:37,600
works alright this is the proof bluemix

00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:39,070
is the proof that it works because

00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,470
without the open source community

00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:43,810
without the work that we have been both

00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:45,880
investing as well as putting into the

00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:48,400
open source community nobody would be

00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:50,500
standing here so thank you very much for

00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,700
listening have a great conference talk

00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:55,180
to you soon

00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:55,180
