	Diversity Lunch & Program - Tracy Miranda

The 7 Habits of Highly Diverse Communities
IoT is transforming our societies. But how do we ensure we don't end up solving IoT problems for just the elite, or a tiny percentage of society? Fortunately there are diverse communities out there we can learn from. This talk distils 7 habits learnt from these communities and a framework for sustaining diverse IoT communities. The more diverse our IoT communities the more secure and resilient society will be.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,130
hi good afternoon everybody just before

00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,799
I get started I just wanted to share

00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:09,210
something I'd came across on my it was

00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:13,040
actually on my Twitter feed a little

00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:16,890
while ago and it was a sentiment that

00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:20,550
for gender equality it's not about

00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:23,130
having the next female Steve Jobs or the

00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:26,609
next female Elon Musk but it's actually

00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:33,170
more about having lots and lots of women

00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:35,550
who are mediocre middle managers so in

00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:38,640
the idea is that we just want to get

00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:40,920
more people into tech so based on that I

00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,960
thought well to do my bit for gender

00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,379
equality I'm gonna come up and I have to

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,610
give a mediocre talk

00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:52,140
yeah just kidding this is gonna be

00:00:47,610 --> 00:01:04,680
awesome so i'm tracy miranda and let's

00:00:52,140 --> 00:01:06,630
talk about diversity okay so one of the

00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,210
things has been great to see coming into

00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:12,080
cloud foundry and into the community is

00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:15,650
just a theme of digital transformation

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:18,680
that's affecting all the industries

00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:21,360
insurance and even government's and

00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:23,580
taking that even further with when we

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,640
talk about the Internet of Things and I

00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:30,479
work a lot in this area that is just set

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,790
to transform all our societies and yes

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:35,490
there's no doubt to me that Cloud

00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:39,840
Foundry is going to be you know a big

00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:43,189
part of that so these are the driverless

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:48,659
pods you have at London Heathrow Airport

00:01:43,189 --> 00:01:50,780
so as a smart cities summit and they

00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:54,720
were talking about how Amsterdam has

00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:59,040
driverless boats and how Moscow has all

00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:00,780
their snow removal vehicles are all

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,409
connected up so they can man into snow

00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:06,810
clearance just through an app so it's

00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:08,670
clear that Internet of Things is just

00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,310
going to transform everything it's going

00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:13,860
to transform how we get to work it's

00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:15,390
going to transform how we cut our grass

00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,390
it's even going to transform things like

00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:21,360
how we play with our kids so the

00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:24,360
question I have for you is how do we

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:27,960
make sure when we're building is that

00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:32,630
we're not just solving problems for the

00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:32,630
elite for the privileged or for the rich

00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:39,990
and we have some cautionary tale from

00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:42,690
other industries in genetics

00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:44,880
you've got the Human Genome Project and

00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:47,370
clinical trials and this is really

00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,860
interesting TED talk I came across where

00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:52,140
they're talking about how you know 96%

00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:54,810
of clinical trials are all done with

00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:57,530
genes of European descent and you know

00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:59,640
genetic studies affect health and

00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:02,489
different people react to different

00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:04,020
things based on their genetics so I find

00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:06,180
something like that you know it's pretty

00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:08,430
shocking and it's something that has to

00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:10,020
be changed but we're not going to worry

00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:11,850
about that industry there are people

00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:16,010
working on that but we're gonna say what

00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:19,640
can we do in our own tech communities

00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:24,810
I'm so I've been working in tech for

00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:26,670
over 10 years now and it's it's a bit of

00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:28,500
a shame to say that in those 10 years I

00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:32,190
haven't really seen that much of a

00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:35,700
change in terms of the makeup of who's

00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:38,190
who's building tech and so the questions

00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:41,190
we ask you know how how can we change

00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:43,290
perceptions and how do we gain the

00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:45,060
critical mass and Ursula had some really

00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:48,780
good points in the presentation this

00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:51,299
morning so one of the things we've seen

00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:53,610
is you know whatever we've been doing

00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:57,180
for the last ten years is it's not

00:03:53,610 --> 00:04:02,220
really working but one thing that we

00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:03,890
know does work is diversity champions so

00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:06,500
as anyone here considered themselves

00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:11,489
diversity champion for their community

00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:14,220
yeah great excellent so actually what I

00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:17,549
what I'd like is I like for everybody in

00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:20,489
this room to from this moment consider

00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:22,710
yourself a diversity champion for your

00:04:20,489 --> 00:04:25,680
community not just for Cloud Foundry

00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:27,780
open-source community but for where you

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,540
work where

00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:31,860
maybe you in the institution or even

00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,870
your virtual communities you know you

00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:36,990
can be the diversity champion for a

00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:39,180
slack channel no we just need more

00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:40,410
champions out there so you know that's

00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:42,510
that's the one thing I'm gonna say

00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:46,380
you're all now officially diversity

00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:49,919
champions right and what these seven

00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:53,550
habits are is really about a framework

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:54,510
for how can we sustain diverse tech

00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:57,750
communities

00:04:54,510 --> 00:05:00,030
what's our thinking going to be and it's

00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:02,550
not prescriptive but it's more about

00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:04,919
just getting into that mindset and

00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:07,320
keeping in mind that the more diverse

00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:10,020
our tech communities then you know the

00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:13,260
more resilient and secure our societies

00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:13,860
will be so what are we all going to do

00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,870
together

00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:17,790
start with habit one and you've you've

00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:22,020
also got these on your tables that I'll

00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:26,430
go through them one by one okay

00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:30,450
habit one be self-aware so this is about

00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:34,590
saying who's in our communities and more

00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:40,850
importantly who's not and another

00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:43,800
element of this is what privileges

00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:46,820
enable people to become part of the tech

00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,810
communities to build these things and

00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:52,590
we'll come back to this idea of

00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:54,300
privilege but one of the things I want

00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:55,669
to make a point here is that you know if

00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:58,350
we don't have this critical

00:05:55,669 --> 00:06:00,720
self-examination we run the danger of

00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:06,840
having communities that are start to

00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:10,820
have problems Facebook has a diversity

00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:14,100
problem at its Menlo Park headquarters

00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:19,110
it's got five thousand five hundred

00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:23,130
employees mostly men off those they've

00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:26,789
got about 81 people who are black so

00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:28,260
that's less than 2% and earlier this

00:06:26,789 --> 00:06:32,000
year in February Mark Zuckerberg

00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:34,680
actually had to call in the whole campus

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,710
to address them because it turned out

00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:41,490
that some people had been graffitiing

00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:44,970
anti-black live black lives matter slow

00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:47,069
around the campus so black lives matters

00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:50,190
is the civil well it's the rights

00:06:47,069 --> 00:06:52,199
movement in the US where you know black

00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:54,930
people are trying to get the justice

00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:58,500
they should be entitled to but some

00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:59,910
employees at Facebook who perhaps are in

00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:02,130
a privileged position to not even

00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:06,840
appreciate the issues kind of saw that

00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:09,030
as only black lives matter or black

00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:11,460
lives matter more and so they took

00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:14,780
offense at this and there was a real

00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:17,190
lack of empathy there and just you know

00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:19,979
starting to see the lack of values in

00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:23,810
the community so we don't to get to that

00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:29,940
point which brings us to have it to

00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:32,639
which is promoting shared values so I

00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:35,610
have two kids two kids in car seats as I

00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:39,720
like to say and I let them out of their

00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:42,330
car seats sometimes but they go to this

00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:45,389
school and the school has this idea of

00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:47,490
what they call a values led education

00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:50,849
and I didn't really pay much attention

00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:54,120
to this until there's one day I was

00:07:50,849 --> 00:07:56,400
getting ready for we were all going to

00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:58,169
go to a friend's wedding and everything

00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,990
was running slow and as you get to get

00:07:58,169 --> 00:08:02,969
on the road so I started barking at the

00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:06,030
kids you know hurry up get your things

00:08:02,969 --> 00:08:09,080
on move faster and then my five-year-old

00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:11,969
at the time he turned to me and he goes

00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:16,080
mommy you're not showing the value of

00:08:11,969 --> 00:08:18,570
patience that really stopped me in my

00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,849
tracks cuz well a he was right but be I

00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:23,490
was just taken aback by the language he

00:08:20,849 --> 00:08:24,599
was using and it sort of came down to

00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:27,090
this thing they were doing at their

00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:30,090
school where every month they would

00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:32,729
focus on a value so this month is

00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:36,510
confidence but it would be things like

00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:38,190
self-control empathy courage and the

00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:39,599
really nice thing about it is that they

00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:41,969
would embed that throughout their

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,579
curriculum so they would weave it in in

00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:46,320
a non preachy way and the kids would

00:08:44,579 --> 00:08:48,660
really sort of get on board with that

00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,610
so they would you know one would say to

00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:53,190
another you know don't give up show the

00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:54,900
value of determination or even better

00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:55,380
they would you know call out their

00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,480
teachers

00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:58,980
it so yeah I like when they call out the

00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:04,440
teachers much more when they call out me

00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:07,190
so um so it got me thinking like can we

00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:10,470
do more in this in our tech communities

00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:13,050
for a long time Tech has been about the

00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:15,030
tech and we sort of ignore the people

00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:17,550
who are doing this and ignore the fact

00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:20,070
that people come with a lot of baggage

00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:23,930
and we all have different values coming

00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:26,820
into it but this has starting to change

00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:29,100
so if you think about it we already

00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:30,900
promote the value of respect and this

00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:34,710
has been happening more and more

00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:36,300
communities Cloud Foundry you have your

00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:38,070
code of conduct up there I've got the

00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:41,370
eclipse we have a community code of

00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:45,210
conduct in addition and the idea is to

00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:49,050
say put respect front and center and say

00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:50,970
this is what we're about so the other

00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:52,830
thing I was really happy to see at this

00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:54,960
conference is just there's a lot of

00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:56,670
weaving in of empathy so I've seen that

00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:59,670
in few of the keynotes and some of the

00:09:56,670 --> 00:10:01,530
presentations but I challenge you to say

00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:05,220
well how can we do more of that how can

00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:07,080
we bring in other values put them up

00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:09,300
front and center and say look this is

00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:11,610
what we're about and this is what we're

00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:13,560
gonna you know hold each other to and

00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:15,450
call each other out on and then just

00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:21,240
promote that so we do have that sense of

00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:23,030
just shared values okay have it three

00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:26,730
we're gonna pick up the pace here a bit

00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:28,050
so learn and grow together loads of

00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:30,170
things are changing

00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:33,120
take for example something like gender

00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:36,240
once upon a time we thought it was just

00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:38,100
simple you know binary thing but now

00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:42,990
we're learning more and more and it's

00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:47,040
important we do that together and habit

00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:48,180
for be open and inclusive so openness is

00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,520
about transparency

00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:54,210
you know how transparent are our system

00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:57,000
and inclusivity is is about real

00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:59,580
inclusivity you know is there a path for

00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,190
every sort of person to join into our

00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:04,340
community and be part of it at every

00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:04,340
level

00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:11,920
okay so with these two habits learning

00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:13,779
and growing together I thought we could

00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,889
do some learning and growing together

00:11:13,779 --> 00:11:19,059
right now

00:11:14,889 --> 00:11:21,430
and to keep it open and inclusive I'm

00:11:19,059 --> 00:11:24,879
going to get some of you involved okay

00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:26,559
so what we're going to do going back to

00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:29,009
this idea of privilege we're gonna play

00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:34,529
the privileged game who likes games

00:11:29,009 --> 00:11:37,420
nobody got some okay so what this is is

00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:39,369
there's an idea that a college professor

00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:42,999
was trying to teach his class about

00:11:39,369 --> 00:11:46,689
privilege by using a wastepaper basket

00:11:42,999 --> 00:11:50,050
and some crumpled up paper but we're

00:11:46,689 --> 00:11:51,910
gonna do the tech version of that so I

00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:53,829
had these great ideas of how I was going

00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:55,179
to make you know a smart privileged

00:11:53,829 --> 00:11:59,170
bucket which is going to have some

00:11:55,179 --> 00:12:00,790
sensors some LEDs it's going to upload

00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:03,040
things to the cloud after the

00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:04,720
presentations yesterday are trying to

00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:09,129
think how I could get Cloud Foundry into

00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:11,290
that not quite there yet but in the true

00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:15,069
spirit of agile we're going to have our

00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:16,329
MVP which I'm going to bring out and the

00:12:15,069 --> 00:12:20,069
tech this is just a bit of distraction

00:12:16,329 --> 00:12:20,069
but I'll tell you what we're gonna do

00:12:20,309 --> 00:12:28,050
right so we've got our bucket and we've

00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:34,209
got some balls and I'm gonna get some

00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:37,779
volunteers so what we're gonna make it

00:12:34,209 --> 00:12:40,089
interesting so let's say the simple idea

00:12:37,779 --> 00:12:42,189
is I'm going to give a few of you some

00:12:40,089 --> 00:12:45,730
balls and if you can throw your ball

00:12:42,189 --> 00:12:47,639
into the bucket then you would be

00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:49,959
entitled to something in this community

00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:53,049
let's say you can stay for the rest of

00:12:49,959 --> 00:12:54,639
the day perhaps right and if not maybe

00:12:53,049 --> 00:13:01,230
we're gonna ask you to leave because

00:12:54,639 --> 00:13:04,059
well okay so but the only catch is that

00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:08,619
in order to get it in you have to stay

00:13:04,059 --> 00:13:11,249
where you're seated right so I'm gonna

00:13:08,619 --> 00:13:11,249
give

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:24,440
and do we have any let's go a bit

00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:40,070
further away now and I'm gonna come to

00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:42,440
you guys over here health and safety

00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:44,930
they are going to be projectiles flying

00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:54,440
around and I'll skip another one here to

00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:56,900
anyone at the table right and we're

00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:59,150
gonna say that the bucket is gonna live

00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:13,460
over there and the cephus is gonna

00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:14,779
cooperate okay so let's just see how

00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:18,680
everyone's gonna do I'm going to ask the

00:14:14,779 --> 00:14:20,150
table with the red balls here to go

00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:23,839
ahead and have a go and see if you can

00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:30,680
get to stay yeah to win you only have to

00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:37,520
get one in oh yeah you've got your one

00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:44,720
in whoa great okay so we're gonna just

00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:47,110
toss this out right now and everyone

00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:55,279
please watch your heads

00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:59,000
I'm gonna stand way over here can you've

00:14:55,279 --> 00:15:02,120
been warned no libels okay so can we get

00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,490
people at the orange table orange to

00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:11,080
throw throw the balls in and see what we

00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:11,080
can get yeah

00:15:13,059 --> 00:15:30,159
oh okay okay

00:15:27,419 --> 00:15:31,629
the next habit is give everyone a voice

00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:32,769
so I'm going to ask the people who've

00:15:31,629 --> 00:15:35,019
been throwing balls if you could

00:15:32,769 --> 00:15:36,969
actually come up here and everyone who

00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:38,859
got a ball in if you could stand on that

00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:40,359
side and if we could get a few people to

00:15:38,859 --> 00:15:49,569
stand on there so you didn't get a ball

00:15:40,359 --> 00:15:51,819
in so god we're gonna get y'all so yeah

00:15:49,569 --> 00:15:56,259
if you if you got the ball in stand on

00:15:51,819 --> 00:15:58,689
this side and you are our community rock

00:15:56,259 --> 00:16:03,639
stars you have achieved something great

00:15:58,689 --> 00:16:06,339
and all right so I'm going to talk to

00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:08,889
the guys who you know have done well in

00:16:06,339 --> 00:16:14,049
this challenge and go well was that easy

00:16:08,889 --> 00:16:15,879
for you yes and you seem to have a

00:16:14,049 --> 00:16:17,259
really good technique there is that

00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:19,629
something you've been working on a lot

00:16:17,259 --> 00:16:21,609
no it was just in despair of the moment

00:16:19,629 --> 00:16:24,099
excellent so you're just a natural

00:16:21,609 --> 00:16:27,159
talent is that right and now I'd like to

00:16:24,099 --> 00:16:29,229
ask would you guys consider would anyone

00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:35,289
be willing to maybe write a book about

00:16:29,229 --> 00:16:36,969
your techniques yeah I write a book

00:16:35,289 --> 00:16:41,049
about how not to throw in the bucket

00:16:36,969 --> 00:16:42,519
from 1 meter away okay now I'm gonna

00:16:41,049 --> 00:16:43,899
give everyone a voice and we're going to

00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:48,149
talk to some of the folks yeah do you

00:16:43,899 --> 00:16:48,149
want to just come in a bit yeah I guess

00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:55,389
so um do you not want to stay at the

00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:58,809
Cloud Foundry summit today I tried

00:16:55,389 --> 00:17:00,549
really hard okay

00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:03,419
let's talk to someone else did you try

00:17:00,549 --> 00:17:06,129
really hard I gave it my best effort and

00:17:03,419 --> 00:17:09,809
do you think you could do something

00:17:06,129 --> 00:17:09,809
differently next time to succeed

00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:15,909
and these guys over there going to write

00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:20,230
a book about how to do it would you like

00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:21,429
to buy their book yes yes you feel so

00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:23,019
much better do you think that will make

00:17:21,429 --> 00:17:27,699
a difference to you actually getting it

00:17:23,019 --> 00:17:29,470
in the bucket so what do you think it's

00:17:27,699 --> 00:17:32,669
going to take for you to get a ball in

00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:35,080
the bucket and stay a lot of training I

00:17:32,669 --> 00:17:37,419
think those guys over there are the

00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:40,600
people to talk to and you came really

00:17:37,419 --> 00:17:45,130
really close how did that feel still

00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:47,889
like failure so yeah I'm gonna recommend

00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:50,049
to all you guys that well you know you

00:17:47,889 --> 00:17:52,240
talk to these guys because they know how

00:17:50,049 --> 00:17:55,200
to do it and get some tips from them and

00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:58,389
maybe you know maybe buy their book and

00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:02,289
maybe better luck next time okay alright

00:17:58,389 --> 00:18:13,049
and and thank you so you guys alright

00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:15,850
everyone give them an applause okay so I

00:18:13,049 --> 00:18:18,580
think what we're trying to get at here

00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:22,510
is is we call it the privileged bucket

00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:26,470
because it's clear to everyone in the

00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:28,649
room that everyone at this table is it's

00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:31,330
way easier for them to get the ball in

00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:33,399
but for them you know everyone is

00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:34,779
focused on what's between them and the

00:18:33,399 --> 00:18:36,309
goal so they are kind of looking at the

00:18:34,779 --> 00:18:38,350
buckets and they are saying well I'm

00:18:36,309 --> 00:18:42,220
gonna get it in and I'm gonna do my best

00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:43,990
but the people who just have more

00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:46,889
obstacles between them and the bucket

00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:49,510
could represent a job it could represent

00:18:46,889 --> 00:18:52,149
funding it could represent a promotion

00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:53,980
for them they there might be things that

00:18:52,149 --> 00:18:55,630
are preventing them from even though

00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:58,590
they might be even better throwers and

00:18:55,630 --> 00:19:01,000
the people here you know it's just

00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:04,179
they're not gonna get the ball in unless

00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:07,929
we address that so in terms of giving

00:19:04,179 --> 00:19:10,870
everyone a voice sometimes this means

00:19:07,929 --> 00:19:13,059
speaking up sometimes it means just

00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:16,269
shutting up and letting other people

00:19:13,059 --> 00:19:18,820
talk and also advocating for others if

00:19:16,269 --> 00:19:21,250
you're in a position of authority your

00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:24,220
position where people listen to you you

00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:25,059
know advocate for others if you're the

00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:27,309
ones close to the

00:19:25,059 --> 00:19:29,830
pocket and you can see things aren't so

00:19:27,309 --> 00:19:32,080
fair you may advocate for the people who

00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:33,700
are further away say look we need to

00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,139
change the system we need to move the

00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:38,169
bucket we need a bigger bucket

00:19:35,139 --> 00:19:39,850
you know just everyone needs to have a

00:19:38,169 --> 00:19:42,059
voice and find a way for them to be

00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:42,059
heard

00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:48,509
okay habit six acknowledged biases we've

00:19:46,629 --> 00:19:52,240
seen a lot of this at the keynotes

00:19:48,509 --> 00:19:57,990
Daniel talked about the present bias and

00:19:52,240 --> 00:20:01,779
Ursula talked about unconscious bias and

00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:05,200
we've had bucket bias as well and one of

00:20:01,779 --> 00:20:08,139
the ones I like to bring up is something

00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:12,279
called fundamental attribution error and

00:20:08,139 --> 00:20:15,249
it's a term psychologists use the

00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:17,619
experiment goes that they'll take two

00:20:15,249 --> 00:20:20,019
groups of basketball players who are

00:20:17,619 --> 00:20:24,610
equally good and they'll get them

00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:27,610
shooting hoops one set will be in a very

00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:30,129
well-lit gym and one set will be in a

00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:33,639
very poorly lit gym so the ones in the

00:20:30,129 --> 00:20:36,759
pole elite gym will just miss more often

00:20:33,639 --> 00:20:38,830
and they asked people to rate which

00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:42,340
group of basketball players they thought

00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:45,580
was better and people will go well the

00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:48,749
first group but people aren't very good

00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:51,220
and we have a bit of a blind spot about

00:20:48,749 --> 00:20:53,499
environment so it's hard for people to

00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:55,779
go and say oh well actually I can tell

00:20:53,499 --> 00:20:58,720
that it's dark in that room so they're

00:20:55,779 --> 00:21:02,259
just as good as that group but we need

00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:05,169
to fix the environment and I feel like

00:21:02,259 --> 00:21:06,879
that in tech a lot that people will come

00:21:05,169 --> 00:21:09,369
and they'll look at it and say oh well

00:21:06,879 --> 00:21:09,879
you know it's maybe it's only men doing

00:21:09,369 --> 00:21:12,399
it

00:21:09,879 --> 00:21:14,409
so therefore the women must not be good

00:21:12,399 --> 00:21:19,059
at it rather than saying well actually

00:21:14,409 --> 00:21:21,759
we need to fix the environment so it's

00:21:19,059 --> 00:21:23,289
just a blind spot to be aware of that we

00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:25,240
have to look more carefully at the

00:21:23,289 --> 00:21:29,590
environments and underlying causes of

00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:31,990
things and if we do that then it's

00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:32,470
probably obvious to us where we can fix

00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:35,409
it

00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:38,909
so that comes to the point of investing

00:21:35,409 --> 00:21:38,909
and investing in equality

00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:43,240
for this I'm not gonna tell you how to

00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:47,550
do it but I'm gonna give you some

00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:47,550
analogy from the world of cycling and

00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:52,980
sometimes you know if you're cycling in

00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:55,630
the city it can be really dangerous and

00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:59,410
dealing with roundabouts is one of the

00:21:55,630 --> 00:22:01,300
worst things you can do and sometimes

00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:02,680
cities will deal with it by saying oh

00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:04,780
well you know this is our level of

00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:08,140
investment we're gonna put a sign up and

00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:10,450
we're gonna say onus is on you now to to

00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:12,340
be careful but you know that doesn't

00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:14,320
work for everyone it doesn't work for

00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:16,630
visually impaired people you're not

00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:20,170
likely to want to go cycling there with

00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:21,910
a child so instead of doing that sort of

00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:25,200
investment we need to talk about real

00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:29,800
investment anyone here from Amsterdam

00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:32,080
yeah so this is Amsterdam's answer to

00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:36,400
cycling across roundabouts and that's a

00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:39,100
suspended bike circle so anyone can get

00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:41,530
across the roundabouts there you can you

00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:43,540
know in Amsterdam lots of different

00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:45,700
people cycle parents are more likely to

00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:47,410
cycle with their kids and the whole idea

00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:49,690
is that you know they're investing in

00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:51,550
infrastructure for everyone and that's

00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:54,160
what we want to be doing in tech as well

00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:57,790
and we know it costs money but we know

00:22:54,160 --> 00:23:00,670
it's really really worthwhile so I'll

00:22:57,790 --> 00:23:03,880
leave you with that and these are our

00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:06,880
seven habits and in your new role as

00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:08,920
diversity champions I hope it's

00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,450
something you can take and share with

00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:14,190
your communities and just come up with

00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:17,680
ways of how we can do this together so

00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:20,530
with that we've come to the end and I'll

00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:22,270
leave you to discuss your topics and I

00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:24,700
look forward to hearing some feedback

00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:26,740
and just some ideas we can all we can

00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:28,570
all share and learn together so thank

00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:33,359
you very much

00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:33,359
