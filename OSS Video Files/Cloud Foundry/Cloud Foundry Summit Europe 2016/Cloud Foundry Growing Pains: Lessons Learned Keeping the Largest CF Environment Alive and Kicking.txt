Description: 
	Cloud Foundry Growing Pains: Lessons Learned Keeping the Largest CF Environment Alive and Kicking - Michael Maximilien, IBM

Bluemix is the largest CF environment by far. It is also arguably the one with the most usage and users. Come to this talk to hear from the World Wide DevOps and development team who answers the call when things go wrong and who also help keep Bluemix up to date and running. 

We plan to share what we have learned in the past year as we grew and encountered unexpected failures and how we dealt with them.

About Michael (aka dr.max) Maximilien
My name is Michael Maximilien, better known as max or dr.max, and I am a computer scientist with IBM. At IBM Research Triangle Park, I was a principal engineer for the worldwide industry point-of-sale standard: JavaPOS. At IBM Research, some highlights include pioneering research on semantic Web services, mashups, and cloud computing, and platform-as-a-service. I joined the IBM Cloud Labs in 2014 and work closely with Pivotal Inc., to help make the Cloud Found the best PaaS.

okay so I'm max and today I'm going to

00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:09,690
talk about what we've learned operating

00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:11,610
bluemix the sad part is that a lot of

00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:14,160
the people operating bluemix are in the

00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:17,100
audience so they probably could join me

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,980
and give that talk but I'm here

00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:22,859
representing them so I'll do my best

00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:25,369
another person that is not here that

00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:28,529
I've done this talk with before is Matt

00:00:25,369 --> 00:00:32,820
with you he's actually part of the IBM

00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:36,420
China lab and he he's the lead developer

00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:40,559
for our CPI who this talk kind of covers

00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:43,410
what I've learned indirectly being the

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,329
open source bezel with working with my

00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:47,399
colleagues here and then the product

00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:49,710
manager on the back here which is well

00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:53,520
the director Fabio doesn't have the long

00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:54,690
hair but that's it alright let's get

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,899
going

00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:59,940
this should be fun and interactive so

00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:02,820
feel free to stop me obviously I've got

00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:05,100
a deadline to stop and then you guys got

00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,799
to go to lunch so if if the discussion

00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:09,420
gets too much then we'll move it but ask

00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:11,220
question I've given this talk before and

00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,860
it was interactive and you'll see why it

00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,939
has like this this format that helps it

00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,170
okay

00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:18,450
so let's get going so first thing is

00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,890
what's bluemix I'm not gonna bore you

00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,619
too much but you know it's important to

00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:26,490
kind of like set the stage of this it's

00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:28,200
a certified pass well we were getting

00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:29,640
there I mean there's other aspects of

00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:33,240
the certification that we still need to

00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:35,850
get but you know it's a moving process

00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:39,540
and our intention is to definitely

00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:41,430
support that I'll share some published

00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:45,060
statistics that Simon Moser my colleague

00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:46,680
mentioned today and keynote is that it

00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,450
has well first thing we didn't mention

00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:52,049
is that we have tweaked kinds of

00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:54,720
deployments so one is public dedicated

00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:55,710
and then the last one is private public

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,009
is what you get when you go to

00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:04,439
bluemix.net dedicated is essentially a

00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:06,420
slice of a software environment for

00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:09,000
particular customer so we have different

00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:11,489
customers so the customer gets its own

00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,830
but we manage it for them and then

00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:17,520
private is on-premise so very similar

00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:20,340
two pivotal PCF in some ways in order

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,930
companies on that do so as Simon

00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,060
mentioned this morning we have over a

00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:25,680
million registered users so these are

00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,600
the public numbers if you want to know

00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,820
more talk to Fabio I'm not allowed to

00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:32,430
say more than that but it's it's getting

00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:35,250
pretty big we have five hundred plus

00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:38,850
thousand running apps and hundreds of

00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:42,750
services and we use software now it's a

00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:46,380
source of strength and pain but let's

00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:49,410
leave it at that we've also looked at

00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:51,240
OpenStack as a potential alternative at

00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:52,890
OpenStack has easy choice too so don't

00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:55,610
get me wrong so it's everybody has

00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:58,760
issues when you start operating at scale

00:02:55,610 --> 00:03:02,190
and it's a worldwide team right

00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:04,050
developers and also DevOps so a lot of

00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:06,480
our colleagues here in Germany in

00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:08,220
bootleggin essentially do a lot doing a

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,650
lot of the development so there are no

00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:13,260
room here but we have also people doing

00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:16,370
DevOps like for instance in Roma we also

00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:19,440
have people in North Carolina as well as

00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:22,650
in China so it's all over the world it's

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:26,910
a worldwide effort so what have we

00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:28,650
learned all right so in the US there's

00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:30,900
this guy called Dave Letterman who is

00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:33,390
now retired but he used to love doing

00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:35,130
top 10 list and those work pretty well

00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:37,709
especially when you have like a short

00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:38,910
amount of time and a very focused set of

00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:39,900
things that you want to talk about so

00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:41,940
that's what I'm gonna do

00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:44,310
so we're gonna use top 10 that's why

00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:47,370
it's sort of interesting for you if you

00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:54,590
have questions we're gonna go from 10 to

00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:54,590
1 ok so number 10 I call this change so

00:03:54,620 --> 00:04:00,060
fabulous team and a lot of other people

00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:06,420
essentially have this tight change

00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:08,850
request process it has its bad parts and

00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:11,340
you'll now see kind of the format of

00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:13,290
each one of those top 10 so I start with

00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,360
the bad I talk about the good and I talk

00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:18,900
about the lessons so what's bad about

00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,609
this obviously it makes it slow right we

00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:23,490
have to go to a tight change process

00:04:20,609 --> 00:04:26,190
where people like fabula Whichard and

00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:29,100
others have to essentially approve

00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:30,990
any chance to the system right that can

00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:33,690
make it a little bit hard but we're a

00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:35,250
huge company remember we are 300

00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,690
something thousand people and I don't

00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:38,640
know how many works on bluemix but it

00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:41,790
seems like all 300,000 work on blooming

00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:43,590
sometimes and then because it's

00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:45,300
worldwide well you know people in the

00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:47,820
middle of their sleep what do you do you

00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:50,160
have to deal with it right so that's a

00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:52,380
problem but there are some good things

00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,150
so what is good about it is that if

00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:55,920
somebody in Roma decided well they're

00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:58,260
gonna make a change and they figured it

00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,790
out before it actually gets a prove it

00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:01,530
actually has to go to the US and and

00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:03,540
also the guys in China have to be to

00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:05,580
take a look and then people are

00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:08,550
travelling right so before it actually

00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:11,220
happens there's this process that

00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:12,990
essentially sort of cold acid and make

00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:15,780
sure that it can actually make it good

00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:18,210
so what it does is it limits any problem

00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:20,640
it makes it slow to adopt new changes

00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:22,590
but it can limit things and there are

00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:24,590
more eyes reviewing it right so that's

00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:27,810
sort of good so what we found is that

00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:30,300
definitely if you're doing a large team

00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:31,980
like we do if you can't afford if you

00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,870
can afford not to do a large team

00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:35,490
obviously do that right if you can have

00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:39,060
everybody in San Francisco like pivotal

00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:42,120
does more power to you IBM we can right

00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:44,520
we're I with international for a reason

00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:47,160
we're global and we are a very large

00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:54,380
company so we have to go worldwide

00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:54,380
that's just the way it is yes yes

00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:03,400
yeah and obviously there is gonna be

00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:05,439
that too right there are customers that

00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:09,639
like this they are happy to screw them

00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:15,310
so that's number ten number nine audit

00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:18,879
checklist so what we do in some ways is

00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:21,129
we audit things a lot obviously it comes

00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:24,699
with the bad part so what it is is that

00:06:21,129 --> 00:06:27,909
some of them are manual and it can be a

00:06:24,699 --> 00:06:30,249
long time to sort of check those but the

00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:32,169
good part is that using canary bass

00:06:30,249 --> 00:06:34,330
deployment which you know it's sort of a

00:06:32,169 --> 00:06:35,889
feature of Bosch it helps because then

00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:37,479
you can sort of run your deployment and

00:06:35,889 --> 00:06:41,499
verify other things not quite working

00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:43,749
and then you can back-trace and we do

00:06:41,499 --> 00:06:47,039
some audits for address you know at

00:06:43,749 --> 00:06:49,389
steady state so in some ways its

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:51,460
operating the system and then verifying

00:06:49,389 --> 00:06:54,430
as it's running that things are working

00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:56,499
so the lesson here is that we've

00:06:54,430 --> 00:07:00,069
actually ended up creating our homegrown

00:06:56,499 --> 00:07:02,500
tool called dr. it comes from the China

00:07:00,069 --> 00:07:05,169
team that essentially allows you to some

00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:07,509
in some sort it's getting there do a

00:07:05,169 --> 00:07:10,000
continuous monitoring and then audits of

00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:11,830
all of the deployments so in many ways

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,080
you can think I can't reveal the numbers

00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:16,810
but you can imagine we have X number of

00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:19,360
customers that have private and then X

00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:23,560
number maybe x square number dedicated

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:25,930
and then you know public which is a

00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:30,159
smaller number and all of these go to a

00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:31,839
same tool so that you know the teams all

00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:36,839
over the world can kind of get a view of

00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:36,839
it now number eight

00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:43,689
checking write log checking and

00:07:40,659 --> 00:07:46,899
monitoring the bad part of this is that

00:07:43,689 --> 00:07:48,999
because we are such a large environment

00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:51,669
or such a lot set of environments the

00:07:48,999 --> 00:07:53,889
log would it's very quickly so you end

00:07:51,669 --> 00:07:56,289
up with like a problem and if you don't

00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:59,229
catch it you might lose it in some in

00:07:56,289 --> 00:08:01,149
some sense so a large amount of data

00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:03,310
it's in the terabyte how do you keep it

00:08:01,149 --> 00:08:06,159
how do you manage it obviously you know

00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:07,690
better cloud would help things like s3

00:08:06,159 --> 00:08:09,969
for instance you can keep large amount

00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:11,529
but over time it becomes

00:08:09,969 --> 00:08:14,829
also impossible right so what happened

00:08:11,529 --> 00:08:17,199
two years from now it becomes an issue

00:08:14,829 --> 00:08:18,939
bloomix already already has operation

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,879
about a year and a half now so it's

00:08:18,939 --> 00:08:23,439
getting close to that and then how do

00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:25,749
you separate you know how do you query

00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:28,539
over those blogs so that's a huge issue

00:08:25,749 --> 00:08:30,819
that we've sort of experienced the good

00:08:28,539 --> 00:08:32,740
part here is that logger Gators the the

00:08:30,819 --> 00:08:34,389
way it's sort of designed it doesn't

00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:37,360
always work okay so don't get me wrong

00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:39,639
here but when it works or at least the

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,769
design point is to allow streaming and

00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:45,430
allow different sinks so when you do

00:08:41,769 --> 00:08:48,610
that then you can use that data to your

00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:50,500
own set of tools to do you know the kind

00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:52,060
of query that you would need so I've

00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:54,129
seen a pivotal working with them for

00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:56,910
instance that we've used block as an

00:08:54,129 --> 00:08:58,779
example but at IBM we have our own one

00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:01,689
solution so it's not really a solution

00:08:58,779 --> 00:09:03,129
to you but it's a lessons learned that

00:09:01,689 --> 00:09:07,000
you definitely want to start introducing

00:09:03,129 --> 00:09:10,600
some level of log you know tooling early

00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,490
because as your system grows it can

00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:15,040
become an issue how do you Deepak right

00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:18,910
it becomes upon all right so moving

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:21,879
along number seven I actually like Drake

00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:23,949
a lot I don't think he's always kind of

00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:25,779
like sad but that was a sad face of

00:09:23,949 --> 00:09:27,850
Drake that I thought that was cool so

00:09:25,779 --> 00:09:29,470
what is this is washing it ruse the

00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:31,420
reason I say this is because I have

00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:33,160
actually contributed a full line of code

00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:34,990
in washing it you can just go to the

00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,730
repo and you'll see so I'm not

00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:38,769
complaining about it but I'm saying

00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:41,709
there are some issues with new stuff and

00:09:38,769 --> 00:09:43,660
for instance in the case of washing it

00:09:41,709 --> 00:09:47,370
it can become and I think we're solving

00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:49,480
this now to recreate a director and

00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:51,279
certainly because it was in development

00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:53,259
we've had the lots of frequent updates

00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:55,540
we're keeping keeping up with that was

00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:57,639
an issue for us obviously that may not

00:09:55,540 --> 00:10:00,939
be an issue for smaller companies but as

00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:04,449
a large company with a history of being

00:10:00,939 --> 00:10:06,040
very good at keeping you know we deliver

00:10:04,449 --> 00:10:07,569
something to a customer and then 20

00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,740
years later if as long as they were

00:10:07,569 --> 00:10:12,550
still paying the bills I mean we'll

00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:14,829
support them right and it's a great

00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:16,509
thing but it's also a source of pain so

00:10:14,829 --> 00:10:19,870
when you're in that mindset it can

00:10:16,509 --> 00:10:22,300
become an issue when with frequent

00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:23,650
updates the good part is that in general

00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:25,720
abortion it has been

00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:27,610
I mean it's moving towards the new boss

00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:30,940
CLI if you haven't looked at that you

00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:35,440
should it's gonna be a single binary and

00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:37,210
it really works well and we've also as

00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,480
part of this introduced external CP is

00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:42,640
which as we mentioned today is

00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,790
essentially the source of growth for

00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:47,430
this movement which is Cloud Foundry if

00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:49,420
you think about all the other clouds

00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:51,490
paths

00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:53,950
none of them have this one feature that

00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:56,830
we have which is we can work across

00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:59,560
different clouds and as far as I know

00:10:56,830 --> 00:11:01,540
it's close to 20 now and then today I

00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:04,029
just right before this came from a talk

00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:06,220
of multi CPI where we have a CPI made a

00:11:04,029 --> 00:11:09,279
CPI to talk to multiple clouds so it's a

00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:12,100
great source of truth of strength for us

00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:14,980
and we definitely love that so the key

00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:17,140
is to you know deal with better you know

00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:19,120
planning for for things like changes

00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:23,290
it's important for you to do that

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:26,260
you know otherwise you you you you run

00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:28,209
into some issues alright next one is

00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:31,690
what I call custom software this is

00:11:28,209 --> 00:11:33,610
actually a super important one what that

00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:37,060
is is you want to make sure that you

00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:39,670
have custom releases so in other words

00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:41,230
if you want any piece of code in your

00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:44,170
organization to be part of the

00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:47,110
environment whether it be install on a

00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:49,420
stem cell on on all the VMS or you want

00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:51,100
to have them as a separate deployment

00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:56,589
like say for instance a service

00:11:51,100 --> 00:12:00,760
don't try to I would say use bosch adopt

00:11:56,589 --> 00:12:04,360
it and embrace it so what I mean by this

00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:06,940
is like some people at IBM we've created

00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:09,130
our own hacky stem cell and then we put

00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:11,050
a little agent running in there and then

00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:12,910
we said well maybe some of those

00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:14,709
deployments we should have our own job

00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:16,660
and it doesn't really work with Bosch

00:12:14,709 --> 00:12:20,589
when you start doing this you start

00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:22,510
breaking the the abstractions and it

00:12:20,589 --> 00:12:25,360
becomes much harder for you to upgrade

00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:27,339
and to keep the system healthy so create

00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,890
your own custom software so first thing

00:12:27,339 --> 00:12:32,440
is the custom software is gonna happen

00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:34,300
when you're a large company that for

00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:37,150
instance we have a security release at

00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:37,430
IBM because the security guys think they

00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:39,770
know

00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:42,860
and probably maybe they do I don't know

00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:44,660
but they have their own release who am I

00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:46,250
to say I'm not an expert in security so

00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:48,110
I have to just deal with that right so

00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:49,070
they create their own release so that

00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:51,860
that's gonna happen

00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:54,020
you can try to big things in the same

00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:56,300
cell usually a bad idea

00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:58,220
create your own release at it these days

00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:00,260
Bosch has this thing called add-ons

00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:03,980
where you can easily you runtime config

00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:07,160
and deploy those custom bits into all

00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:09,649
VMs so definitely want to do this so of

00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:11,990
course with external CPI and co-located

00:13:09,649 --> 00:13:15,410
releases you kind of solve this problem

00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:17,120
right and of course there's a lot more

00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:20,540
information these days about creating

00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:24,440
releases which was an issue so Maria who

00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:27,950
is like the top you know essentially

00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:30,410
committed for Bosch in at pivotal she's

00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:33,380
written really great presentations about

00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:35,120
how to create releases so I urge you to

00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:36,680
go there towards the end I have a couple

00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,300
slides to point you to where to go but

00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:40,880
if you go to Bosch in it you'll see on

00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:43,760
the top of Bosch in it there's a way to

00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,080
there are some pointers door slides but

00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,550
definitely you wanna you want to create

00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:49,990
your own release it's not easy but the

00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:54,010
point is there's more information now so

00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:59,810
simple lesson do not have your own

00:13:54,010 --> 00:14:02,480
custom sim sell custom Bosch custom CPU

00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:04,580
no cost use the extension points so the

00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,950
CPI is an extension point the release is

00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:08,360
an extension point but don't try to do

00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:11,740
more than that because then you can

00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:14,810
survive with the rest of the system

00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:18,320
number five this is an important one

00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:20,329
it's kind of still working progress is

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:23,930
that power DNS is actually an issue

00:14:20,329 --> 00:14:27,620
right so we highly recommend you not use

00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:30,320
power DNS but we don't really have a

00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:30,589
good alternative yet we're still working

00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,570
on it

00:14:30,589 --> 00:14:35,240
but let me talk about what's bad about

00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:37,279
it so first is that it's single point of

00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:41,270
failure so it's very hard to do a che on

00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:43,160
it and we don't really have a solution

00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:45,470
so if you're deploying on a cloud that

00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:48,560
has a DNS solution then obviously you

00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:50,220
use that otherwise you you you gonna

00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:53,519
have a bad day

00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:55,949
the good thing is as I mentioned some of

00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:59,279
those ayahs reported and we're also

00:14:55,949 --> 00:15:01,139
working on a power DNS that solution for

00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:03,360
Bosch where we're essentially using

00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:06,449
local DNS so all of the VMS will have

00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:09,810
all information in sync of all the other

00:15:06,449 --> 00:15:15,120
VMs now that doesn't solve a full non

00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:17,279
dns deployment of CF because CF uses as

00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:20,069
part of it like discovery especially

00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:21,689
Diego discovery of services and they use

00:15:20,069 --> 00:15:23,370
console and you can't really replace

00:15:21,689 --> 00:15:25,740
console but there's various discussion

00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:28,379
in the open-source community to see how

00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:31,139
to do this so you may still be able to

00:15:28,379 --> 00:15:35,009
use those other DNS solutions but maybe

00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:37,319
the platform will have a power DNS last

00:15:35,009 --> 00:15:40,709
solution you know basically batteries

00:15:37,319 --> 00:15:42,750
included so the lessons learn is you

00:15:40,709 --> 00:15:47,189
really do have to think it's a general

00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:49,649
lesson of any node in the system that is

00:15:47,189 --> 00:15:52,439
not designed to be a che because when

00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:54,930
you do that it's true it will prevent

00:15:52,439 --> 00:15:57,389
you from going in the future so be

00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:59,880
careful of that and it can become very

00:15:57,389 --> 00:16:01,620
hard to remove I mean this is based on

00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:06,750
our experience we're still struggling

00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:10,529
removing power DNS usage and before is

00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:12,600
update security update are important and

00:16:10,529 --> 00:16:14,880
they're painful but you got to do them

00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:18,560
right why is that

00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:21,709
well obviously the internet as you know

00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:24,089
unlike some orange person in the u.s.

00:16:21,709 --> 00:16:26,459
it's not a source where you want to go

00:16:24,089 --> 00:16:30,149
and think that show us any information

00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:33,389
it's actually exactly where you know a

00:16:30,149 --> 00:16:35,339
lot of bad guys bad girls are coming and

00:16:33,389 --> 00:16:36,720
trying to attack your system so this is

00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:40,439
nothing new right you should all know

00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:42,360
that so what happens is that there are

00:16:40,439 --> 00:16:45,000
CV is pretty much weekly you're not all

00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,529
aware of them but I can tell you chip

00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,389
and the rest of the calc laundry

00:16:46,529 --> 00:16:51,059
Foundation and virus folks at pivotal

00:16:48,389 --> 00:16:53,399
and on IBM inverse other companies we

00:16:51,059 --> 00:16:55,800
know about when there is a CV and those

00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:58,699
happen pretty much weekly on average I

00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:01,199
mean sometimes you don't get them and

00:16:58,699 --> 00:17:03,809
what happens when you do get those is

00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,410
you have to be able to get to security

00:17:03,809 --> 00:17:06,180
end but there

00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:07,680
costly but you still have to deal with

00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:10,680
it because the last thing you want is to

00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:12,810
be hacked in and then you be in the news

00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:15,300
that you know your system like what

00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:17,910
happened to Yahoo it's unfortunate it's

00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:20,280
like you're struggling and they just got

00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:22,710
hit by this massive you know security

00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:25,110
bridge you don't want this to happen to

00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:27,600
you so what does the Bloch team do about

00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:31,200
this well they essentially released new

00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:33,960
stem cells and new releases frequently

00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:37,440
and recently they've been going to a

00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:40,230
hardening of the entire system for

00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,300
security and obviously as I mentioned at

00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:44,100
IBM we have our own security videos so

00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:46,860
you definitely want to take this very

00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:49,800
very seriously and follow the guidance

00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:52,470
so this if there's one thing you want to

00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:53,790
remember from this talk is definitely

00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:56,850
make sure if you're going to go into

00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:59,820
production being able to deal with that

00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:03,810
it's very important we did come up with

00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:06,840
a way to essentially make it faster to

00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:09,870
even update the OS and call OS reload

00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:11,490
it's also a source of virus pain but

00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:16,380
this is one maybe advantage of that

00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:18,000
feature number three Multi blush

00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:20,550
deployment so this is still something

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,830
we're struggling with but it's certainly

00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:25,440
in a push that you should think about so

00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:28,170
what this is is that when you start with

00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,060
one boss director it becomes essentially

00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:34,160
your bottleneck and potentially your

00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:35,850
spawn as well and when you start going

00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,010
especially when you have multiple

00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:42,120
environments that becomes a problem

00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:43,950
right so having a way to do multiple

00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,990
deployment with Bosch that's definitely

00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:48,240
so this is essentially you do one boss

00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:50,010
and then you create other bosses for

00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,830
your order deployment so that when one

00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:54,090
fails you don't lose the entire system

00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:55,350
we've seen the director fail I mean

00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:58,260
we've seen pretty much every failure

00:18:55,350 --> 00:19:00,690
that you can think of in the book some

00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:02,490
of it self-inflicted but some of it also

00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:04,350
because the software has problems it's a

00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:06,810
big piece of code right so there are

00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:09,260
issues so divide and conquer right

00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:11,670
that's the obvious solution so

00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:14,460
definitely we consider your deployment

00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:16,090
strategy there are a different sort of

00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:19,059
best

00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:22,929
practices certainly Demetri is a source

00:19:19,059 --> 00:19:25,270
of great knowledge he's seen a lot of it

00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:27,279
because he talks to everybody so you

00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:30,490
want to sort of hone into what he

00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:32,590
discusses on slack for instance but

00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:34,659
experience with other things so as you

00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:37,210
have your deployment try other things

00:19:34,659 --> 00:19:38,740
don't just be stuck on your own style

00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:41,860
deployment there are other ways to do

00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:45,580
things that may be better for you number

00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:49,720
two this is something we've learned from

00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:51,100
our colleagues and Italy and you know

00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:53,049
it's it's kind of interesting because

00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:58,510
you see cultural things from different

00:19:53,049 --> 00:20:03,730
places kind of you know filter into a

00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:05,740
worldwide team I know talking to Fabio

00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:08,110
and the rest of the team is that a lot

00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:10,149
of the deployments never work 100% of

00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:11,860
the time so you do a deploy and you

00:20:10,149 --> 00:20:13,750
think you're gonna do like thousands of

00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:15,600
VMs and you're like okay I'll come back

00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:18,100
tomorrow and then it feels half way and

00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,809
then you think well when was the last

00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:22,840
time the whole deployment actually did

00:20:19,809 --> 00:20:24,990
work can't even remember that so what do

00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:27,640
you do

00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:29,200
alright so you have to address the

00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:31,360
failures and then obviously continue so

00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:34,059
blush allows that model but the point is

00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:36,820
that it's never gonna be 100% successful

00:20:34,059 --> 00:20:39,610
and the guys in Rome like maybe with

00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:42,130
their cool attitude yeah feels just

00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:42,549
restarted nope want like don't stress

00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:44,440
about it

00:20:42,549 --> 00:20:46,450
right and that's the key is that the

00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:48,700
system is so large and there's so much

00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:52,059
especially for big environments there

00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:56,789
will be failures don't expect the fully

00:20:52,059 --> 00:20:59,320
pristine 100% just work perfect right

00:20:56,789 --> 00:21:00,850
like my camera is perfect German

00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:04,890
engineering doesn't always work like

00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:04,890
that it fails and then you kind of do it

00:21:06,149 --> 00:21:11,740
so Bosch will help you with that and

00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:13,960
even when the system is failing halfway

00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:14,649
it's still usable so don't stress too

00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,750
much about it

00:21:14,649 --> 00:21:18,700
so embrace failure in some ways right

00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:20,919
and that was the point that Simon made

00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:23,140
today this weirdness it's gonna happen

00:21:20,919 --> 00:21:28,059
and you just have to adopt it as part of

00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:29,650
your culture so trusted tool failures

00:21:28,059 --> 00:21:31,840
are going to be part of the system

00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:34,870
and sometimes they don't work perfectly

00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:38,380
the first time and it's okay right as

00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:42,130
long as it works in the end and number

00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:44,530
one is to backup your director DB often

00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:46,480
and a lot okay why do I put this at the

00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:48,490
end it's an obvious one well because

00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:52,330
I've experienced it personally so last

00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:55,210
year trying to go on vacation Friday

00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:57,520
this is a story I'll finish with I think

00:21:55,210 --> 00:22:00,040
it was like Thursday and I'm took Friday

00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:02,350
off I get a call like 4:00 a.m. in the

00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:05,440
morning Chris Farris tells me we need

00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:07,720
your help buddy the whole bloomix is

00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,670
falling apart and you think it's boss

00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:12,700
now Michael Frankel in the back actually

00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:15,040
does a lot of that sort of firsthand and

00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:17,170
he's very good at sort of identifying

00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,910
where the problem is and I guess maybe

00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:20,470
I'm not sure if he was the one

00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:22,360
identifying where it was in Bosh but

00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:25,990
anyways it got down to me and I know of

00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:28,120
course I'm going on vacation so you know

00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:29,080
what do you do for am Chris calls you

00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:32,920
well I'll deal with it

00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:35,230
so I'm getting ready to go to the to the

00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:37,390
airport in San Francisco got my laptop

00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:41,020
I'm going to the code I've got very

00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:43,360
little bits of logs to go by and then on

00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:45,550
the plane I kind of have a aha moment to

00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:48,400
see where the problem was and of course

00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:49,929
I get back and identify two lines of

00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,340
code and Bosh where we're not checking

00:22:49,929 --> 00:22:53,050
for an error in the go code and

00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:56,140
potentially that's what happened what

00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:57,940
what in the symptoms was that disc on

00:22:56,140 --> 00:23:00,400
the director where the director keeps

00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:03,700
all its data disappeared so now we have

00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:05,020
a director in a deployment and they

00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:07,300
don't know about each other because the

00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:10,030
data just disappeared

00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:12,670
so first is identifying it and of course

00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:18,070
what do you do about that all right so

00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:22,000
at the in the end you know the disc got

00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:23,590
lost so when you disconnect the director

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,429
form its deployment there's not much you

00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:29,559
can do although we kind of came up with

00:23:27,429 --> 00:23:32,200
some clever thing to do the guys in

00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:34,720
China so I'll talk about that obviously

00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:36,880
how do you solve this or how do you

00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,710
prevent this from happening becoming a

00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,600
problem is to battle right you backup

00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:42,190
your director database so when something

00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,299
like this happens then worst case you

00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:47,379
know you can always go back to

00:23:43,299 --> 00:23:49,869
all back up but any VM that has that was

00:23:47,379 --> 00:23:52,299
created since the backup you lose those

00:23:49,869 --> 00:23:52,629
and discs and so on so that's a real

00:23:52,299 --> 00:23:54,700
issue

00:23:52,629 --> 00:23:58,539
the problem with backup was that it was

00:23:54,700 --> 00:24:01,419
very slow for us so when we have a large

00:23:58,539 --> 00:24:03,159
system the backup took forever before

00:24:01,419 --> 00:24:04,899
the first backup got done we were

00:24:03,159 --> 00:24:08,409
already doing the next deployment so

00:24:04,899 --> 00:24:10,330
it's used useless right so what what

00:24:08,409 --> 00:24:12,399
what what happened is we worked actually

00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:14,259
the team from Rome work with them with

00:24:12,399 --> 00:24:16,149
the Bosch team to make the backup come

00:24:14,259 --> 00:24:17,739
in faster and partly it's because we not

00:24:16,149 --> 00:24:19,989
backing up any information about blobs

00:24:17,739 --> 00:24:21,369
because they're kind of in a separate

00:24:19,989 --> 00:24:24,100
place then we can remove you can

00:24:21,369 --> 00:24:27,369
recreate them which is good

00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:30,609
now some I asked for instance AWS has a

00:24:27,369 --> 00:24:32,320
way to snapshot disks so if you can the

00:24:30,609 --> 00:24:34,179
best thing to do is to take your disk on

00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,190
your director and snapshot it so that

00:24:34,179 --> 00:24:37,779
way the eye as is doing the backup for

00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:41,009
you in addition to maybe Bosch backup

00:24:37,779 --> 00:24:43,600
right so one solution we came up with

00:24:41,009 --> 00:24:47,529
it's kind of a clever one from the guys

00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:50,559
in Beijing is to have it's to modify the

00:24:47,529 --> 00:24:54,129
dummy CPI and we play the deployment so

00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:56,950
think of it this way you have a director

00:24:54,129 --> 00:24:59,200
who no longer knows about the deployment

00:24:56,950 --> 00:25:00,669
but you have the deployment and when you

00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,850
have the deployment you can always go to

00:25:00,669 --> 00:25:09,220
your console and get all the IDS for

00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:12,100
your disks and all the IDS for the VMS

00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:14,529
so now you can create or modify dummy

00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:17,350
deployment you have your manifest

00:25:14,529 --> 00:25:20,799
pretend that you can deploy that one

00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:24,460
again and instead of deploying it gets

00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:27,249
the disk and VM ID from a list that you

00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:28,480
have created of what exists and when

00:25:27,249 --> 00:25:31,179
you're done with your deployment which

00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:34,600
is a fake deployment you reconstructed

00:25:31,179 --> 00:25:39,519
your database so we did that that was

00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:42,629
over my two weeks vacation the good

00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:44,739
thing at IBM and I'll say this is

00:25:42,629 --> 00:25:46,899
typically we have very very good

00:25:44,739 --> 00:25:50,139
managers and happen to have one Alex and

00:25:46,899 --> 00:25:53,049
he's super cool so those two weeks I got

00:25:50,139 --> 00:25:55,479
back generally so I'm trying to get a

00:25:53,049 --> 00:25:59,869
couple more weeks but anyways

00:25:55,479 --> 00:26:02,089
so you know it happens so with that I

00:25:59,869 --> 00:26:11,529
want to thank you and take some question

00:26:02,089 --> 00:26:11,529
so questions

00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:19,399
os wee Lord okay so the guy that owns

00:26:17,989 --> 00:26:23,929
the OS video is sitting next to you

00:26:19,399 --> 00:26:26,539
that's fab you alright so the problem

00:26:23,929 --> 00:26:28,489
with this is that in software this is

00:26:26,539 --> 00:26:31,190
kind of a unique software problem but

00:26:28,489 --> 00:26:32,779
it's actually an interesting solution we

00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:36,409
came up with that actually probably

00:26:32,779 --> 00:26:38,299
works other places is that there are

00:26:36,409 --> 00:26:40,549
some data centers that have limited VM

00:26:38,299 --> 00:26:44,659
capacity and software doesn't have a

00:26:40,549 --> 00:26:47,179
first-class reservation system so if you

00:26:44,659 --> 00:26:50,629
have a large deployment with VMs in it

00:26:47,179 --> 00:26:53,989
and you try to say for instance update

00:26:50,629 --> 00:26:55,999
or redeploy or add to your deployment

00:26:53,989 --> 00:26:57,859
you might lose the VM so if you release

00:26:55,999 --> 00:26:59,869
some VM you might lose it and since the

00:26:57,859 --> 00:27:02,779
system is out of capacity so instead of

00:26:59,869 --> 00:27:05,210
releasing VMs and getting new ones we

00:27:02,779 --> 00:27:07,070
essentially keep the VM and we reload

00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:08,950
the operating system which is in some

00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:12,019
ways what you need to do because the VM

00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:14,659
hypervisor is fine it's just the OS that

00:27:12,019 --> 00:27:16,549
you have to reload right so to do this

00:27:14,659 --> 00:27:18,830
you actually have to modify the CPI to

00:27:16,549 --> 00:27:20,659
do this I've talked to Dmitriy a long

00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:22,549
time because I pivotal they actually

00:27:20,659 --> 00:27:24,529
have a similar problem for their data

00:27:22,549 --> 00:27:26,809
environments where instead of having

00:27:24,529 --> 00:27:29,179
create a new VM and then reload large

00:27:26,809 --> 00:27:30,830
amount of data they'd rather update the

00:27:29,179 --> 00:27:33,320
stem cell by reloading the operating

00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:34,789
system so there is some discussion about

00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:39,289
maybe potentially making this a

00:27:34,789 --> 00:27:43,279
first-class citizen any other questions

00:27:39,289 --> 00:27:45,549
before you go I've got number 11 Oh Kirk

00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,549
Chris

00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:07,520
so he's the hiring manager thanks for

00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:09,350
taking my talk and doing a little

00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:12,110
advertising okay so number 11 let's do

00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:12,770
this always seek knowledge why is that

00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:15,020
important

00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:18,440
because you know it's large and it's

00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:20,270
hard so if you're a new boss developer

00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:23,060
you might not understand how to use

00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:25,340
Bosch that is very true not everybody

00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:27,140
that are great developers at Bosch know

00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:29,630
how to use Busch I was at Bibble again I

00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:30,410
mentioned this I'll of course I'm

00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:33,680
engineer

00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:37,340
I love the German course but guess what

00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:39,230
I am a terrible driver I think most of

00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:41,180
you probably fit in that category or one

00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:42,590
of those right so it's not because

00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:45,920
you're developer you know how to use it

00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:48,260
Bosh is complex so large learning cycle

00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:50,360
so the good thing is there are lots of

00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:53,540
talk dr. NIC has tons of information

00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:55,340
maria is adding stuff Dimitri anything

00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:57,620
you need to know just pinging him on

00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:59,330
stack pretty much you'll get an answer

00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:00,860
if you can't get insert from him he'll

00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:03,440
point you to somebody that can give you

00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:06,950
an answer so Bosh IO is your source

00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:10,130
right and dr. NIC as I mentioned so seek

00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:12,320
knowledge okay so that was in case

00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:18,340
nobody had questioned anything else okay

00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:22,349
we have 15 seconds no thank you

00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:22,349
