Description: 
	Five Years Delivering World-Class Business Critical Apps on Cloud Foundry – Tim Savage & Ben Fry, Armakuni

Armakuni has worked with Comic Relief to transform the legacy donations platform into a secure, highly scalable and resilient, micro-service platform that caters for over 100,000 concurrent web sessions and up to 500 payments/second.  At the same time, Armakuni was able to reduce the team size by 90% and save iro £5m run costs.  This presentation will walk-through the journey, analyse the key decisions along the way, and discuss the benefits gained by a move to Cloud Native and why Cloud Foundry was key to the initial success and remains critical to the on-going success of the platform, and is now being adopted across the wider technology function.

Comic Relief is the UK-based charity responsible for ‘Red Nose Day’; seven hours of primetime live TV with circa 26 million viewers raising over a billion pounds in five years. 

About Ben Fry
I am truly excited by the possibilities of cloud native and Cloud Foundry and the potential it has to enable organisations to design, build, deploy and run software solutions the way they should be, breaking free from all the complexities and constraints associated with traditional methods and technologies.

About Tim Savage
Tim has been delivering technology across many industry sectors for the past 20 years, most recently working on high volume/transaction web platforms. He formed Armakuni in 2012 with colleagues to provide a platform through which to deliver business critical systems but applying new methodology. Armakuni use new technologies such as PaaS to enable truly agile delivery.

hi everybody right so I think we'll

00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:10,559
we'll start so good afternoon

00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:12,509
it's been a great day so far and thank

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:17,340
you very much for taking the time out to

00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:20,279
come and join us for our presentation as

00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:22,800
the title implies we've been delivering

00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:27,240
Cloud Foundry now for just about five

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,619
years to deliver what we believe to be

00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,679
world-class but certainly business

00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:34,620
critical applications I will explain a

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,030
little bit more as we go through but we

00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,920
thought we'd use this opportunity to

00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:42,030
share some of what we've learned along

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:50,879
the way so I hope you enjoy it

00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:54,690
we hope you enjoyed my name's Tim Savage

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:58,829
I am the CEO and founder one of the

00:00:54,690 --> 00:01:00,780
founders anyway or Alma Cooney I've got

00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:02,760
a background in sort of various areas of

00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:06,960
technology spanning over the last 20

00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:08,640
years embarrassingly and accommodated in

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,970
forming our mikuni which is a

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:16,680
consultancy we put formed in 2012 so

00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:20,220
yeah thanks so I'm a recent addition to

00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:22,530
the team I thought I'm extremely excited

00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:25,530
to be here in extremely excited to be a

00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:28,500
part of the amakuni world I come from a

00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:30,810
world of tradition and problems and

00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,299
legacy IT so when I met him a little

00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:35,280
while back and he introduced me to cloud

00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:36,960
foundry and actually showed me an agile

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,820
pipeline I was like wow bowled over

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,560
absolutely brought him from that day

00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,509
forward and then conversation has

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,000
evolved and I finally I find myself

00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:47,240
talking to you guys now I've been

00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,740
immersed in this I suppose for the past

00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:53,490
four or five months but but not much

00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:56,060
more so I'm here ready to introduce you

00:01:53,490 --> 00:02:00,479
I guess to my thoughts turning around

00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:03,060
trying trying to employ what is amazing

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,790
technology in in a world where people

00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,829
may have not quite as excited and may

00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:11,400
see it more as a threat of an issue so

00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:13,770
more of a business perspective I used to

00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,140
be a technologist so I do have a back

00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:20,310
in technology but that was some time ago

00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:21,990
and hmm yeah now I focus around helping

00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:25,590
larger organizations improve the way

00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:31,410
they work so a little bit about what or

00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:32,400
who are mikuni is software development

00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:34,380
the way it should be done

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,100
that's a very nice quote from one of our

00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:40,470
customers and something that yet we we

00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,760
think is uh what we try to achieve so we

00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:43,920
specialize in cloud native software

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:47,130
development and our mission now really

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:51,530
is to support organizations doing things

00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:54,270
better right so on the journey to this

00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:56,850
amazing place that is cloud native and

00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:59,970
and supported by Cloud Foundry

00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:02,250
so removing all the bottlenecks how do

00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:04,710
we do it we either do it for them our

00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:06,540
customers or we help them do it for

00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:08,570
themselves so it's either we give them

00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:11,610
the fish what we teach them how to fish

00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:14,010
and we we've worked with a number of

00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:15,090
organizations and this presentation is

00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:16,590
our learnings from a number of

00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:19,440
organizations that we've worked with

00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:22,530
both big and small greenfield and some

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,840
not so green I think as a we have to

00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:29,130
appreciate that about 80% of the world

00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:33,450
is steeped in legacy one part of one

00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:35,340
part of another so we've got some some

00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:41,340
experience there with with migrating and

00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:42,690
more brownfield projects but we are we'd

00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:44,840
like to think of ourselves and I think

00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:47,490
we are one of the UK's leading

00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,870
independent Cloud Foundry experts not

00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:51,030
any of we've been using to have family

00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:55,080
for five years which is more than most

00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:58,080
people even know existed I think but

00:03:55,080 --> 00:04:00,000
also we use the open source version and

00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,310
we've worked at pivotal and we've worked

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,150
with IBM so we've got quite a broad

00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:07,560
range of experience this is ultimately I

00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:08,640
think what we try to give our customers

00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,200
right and this is what it's all about

00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,630
it's freedom to innovate it's about

00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,580
putting the business value at the center

00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:17,340
and to take out all the bottlenecks and

00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:20,070
remove all of the issues that people see

00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:22,410
about getting production ready code into

00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:24,900
a production without all the pain that

00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:27,240
people seem to expect of today's

00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:28,650
technology world

00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,389
it's about putting the customer and

00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:36,330
business value at the center of

00:04:30,389 --> 00:04:38,729
everything so we are here to give back

00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:41,340
and just talk through some of what we've

00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:42,870
learnt along the way but first I think

00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:44,789
it's important to give you a little bit

00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:47,340
of context we'll Tim we'll take you

00:04:44,789 --> 00:04:48,870
through a case study and briefly it's

00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:50,039
been 5-10 minutes just taking you

00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:53,069
through a case study of how we've

00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:55,380
delivered one business critical app you

00:04:53,069 --> 00:04:56,580
can before for comic relief and then

00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:59,720
we'll go on to some of the learnings

00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:59,720
that have come as a result of that

00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:05,400
thanks Ben

00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:06,479
so something we've talked about before

00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,039
you know some people might be familiar

00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:11,759
with some aspects of it but a lot of

00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:14,099
people probably won't be one of our

00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:17,310
clients is comic relief a UK charity

00:05:14,099 --> 00:05:19,020
they were set up in 1985 and they have a

00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:23,669
mission statement which is a just world

00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:26,130
free from poverty they're famous for the

00:05:23,669 --> 00:05:27,900
Red Nose Day campaign which I'm imagine

00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:29,639
a lot of people be familiar with it's a

00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:34,139
big campaign which culminates in a

00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:36,150
telethon they've raised in excess of a

00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:39,180
billion pounds sterling over their

00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:40,500
lifetime and each individual campaign

00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:42,840
these days were raised sort of somewhere

00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:46,830
in the region of 100 odd million pounds

00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:48,740
so it's big numbers the telephones when

00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:50,969
they happen they take over the BBC so

00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:53,280
BBC one will be nothing about the

00:05:50,969 --> 00:05:55,110
telethon from 7:00 till 2:00 in the

00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,360
morning they occasionally have a break

00:05:55,110 --> 00:06:00,389
for the news happens some years not

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,370
another years but very much the UK

00:06:00,389 --> 00:06:04,310
public is immersed in these events in

00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:07,550
the aquatic hard to avoid them generally

00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:09,479
unless people make a concerted effort

00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:10,800
so yeah the audiences will be in the

00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:12,210
region of 20 million birds out of the

00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,569
evening but we are you know sort of

00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:17,039
primetime TV at that point in time and

00:06:15,569 --> 00:06:18,750
I'll mcleaney have built and run the

00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:21,449
platform that takes all of the card

00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:24,659
payments for these events so we cover

00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:28,590
web mobile and anything through the call

00:06:24,659 --> 00:06:32,909
centers so to give you some rough

00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:34,740
numbers it's seven hours long we take or

00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:36,479
have to cope with in the region of 400

00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:38,610
payments per second that's the metric

00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,260
which we build for to be able to handle

00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:44,550
those alive

00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:47,750
customer payments give you some context

00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:50,580
on the the 400 the UK as a whole

00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:52,320
averages at 360 transactions a second

00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,880
for car payments fit absolutely

00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:56,540
everything so as to give you a sort of

00:06:53,880 --> 00:07:00,300
scale of what 400 is in terms of

00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:02,010
national levels we expect somewhere in

00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:05,430
the region 100,000 concurrent public web

00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:06,750
users we also have 14,000 call center

00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:08,790
operators that will be logged in and

00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:10,620
using an application and working sort of

00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:13,080
constantly taking donations as the calls

00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:16,170
come in and we expect somewhere in the

00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:18,120
region of 800,000 transactions during

00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:24,180
the evening so that's our sort of scale

00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:27,840
so to summarize the challenge we have no

00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:30,960
second chance we run for one night once

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:33,390
a year seven hours we take tens of

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,890
millions of pounds and we can't fail you

00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:36,300
know there is no option people don't

00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:37,890
come back the next day and sort of want

00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:40,170
to donate their emotional at the time

00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:41,400
they're not buying a TV and they'll get

00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:43,440
it from the next store or whatever you

00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:49,290
know that it doesn't happen so we have

00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:51,360
that one chance okay so they've been

00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:53,190
running it for yeah the organisation has

00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,790
been running for 25 years and before us

00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:58,290
they had a putting our platform they've

00:07:56,790 --> 00:08:01,350
been doing it for you know they say 25

00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:03,360
years before we came along it was a jar

00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:04,410
of monolith that was you know the

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,020
platform that was running this whole

00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:08,850
thing it had evolved over nine years I

00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:12,180
think and was largely a you know black

00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:15,530
box in terms of what it did testing was

00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:18,030
entirely manual up you know all levels

00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:20,130
so it's very limited there were you know

00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:24,140
masses of a potential for human error

00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:26,970
big gaps deployment was manual I

00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:28,760
remember sort of regular shouts along

00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:30,990
the lines of you know that the new

00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:32,700
JavaScript files are on half the servers

00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:34,290
and not the rest you know all sorts of

00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:39,540
things and issues that we had to solve

00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:41,990
at the time they had single points of

00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:45,240
failure so infrastructure providers

00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:46,590
platforms bandwidth payment providers

00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,000
all of these things were single points

00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:52,889
of failure that at any point in time

00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,749
could indeed go wrong another

00:08:52,889 --> 00:08:56,879
also to pull the event together there

00:08:54,749 --> 00:08:59,939
was a very complex matrix of providers

00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:01,529
so lots of organizations but involved we

00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:04,319
had somewhere in the region of between

00:09:01,529 --> 00:09:05,459
40 and 50 people coming together to make

00:09:04,319 --> 00:09:08,009
this event happen but they're all

00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:09,929
partners and big organizations sort of

00:09:08,009 --> 00:09:11,249
pulling their resources together and

00:09:09,929 --> 00:09:12,629
then after a while that started to fall

00:09:11,249 --> 00:09:13,980
apart as these sort of will not fall

00:09:12,629 --> 00:09:15,509
apart but the partners were starting to

00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:17,249
compete and they wanted different sort

00:09:15,509 --> 00:09:18,419
of involvement levels originally they

00:09:17,249 --> 00:09:19,949
all had their own little areas and then

00:09:18,419 --> 00:09:22,079
they started crossing over and going up

00:09:19,949 --> 00:09:23,879
and down the stack in terms of what they

00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:28,290
would or what they delivered as an

00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:30,179
organization and also you know in terms

00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:32,100
of the testing it was largely a one-year

00:09:30,179 --> 00:09:34,109
feedback cycle so we take the learnings

00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:35,910
from one event work on them during the

00:09:34,109 --> 00:09:37,859
year and then you apply them the next

00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:45,779
year and yeah that was literally the

00:09:37,859 --> 00:09:47,970
cycle so this is our solution we took a

00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:50,279
job in monolith and turned it into a

00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:52,139
sort of micro services architecture I'm

00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:55,529
using this slide that was used by

00:09:52,139 --> 00:09:58,199
Gartner in the catalyst conference two

00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:59,489
weeks ago I think it was and this was

00:09:58,199 --> 00:10:03,149
used to illustrate best practice

00:09:59,489 --> 00:10:04,949
multi-cloud we took the sort of black

00:10:03,149 --> 00:10:06,419
bottom one little black box monolith and

00:10:04,949 --> 00:10:09,809
turned it into a sort of microservices

00:10:06,419 --> 00:10:10,799
architecture there within this you know

00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:12,809
what you can see here is sort of the

00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:14,220
multi cloud deployment but there are 28

00:10:12,809 --> 00:10:18,360
micro services in there that are running

00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:19,799
the whole thing it's distributed across

00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,529
multiple infrastructure service

00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:24,419
providers and multiple continents so

00:10:22,529 --> 00:10:28,799
it's quite yeah it's it's truly moat

00:10:24,419 --> 00:10:30,989
multi-cloud we took the enterprise

00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:33,360
relational database and turn it into

00:10:30,989 --> 00:10:35,730
distributed data stores using eventual

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:39,569
consistency an event sourced

00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:42,600
architecture which at the lack of

00:10:39,569 --> 00:10:45,539
confidence and turn now used tested and

00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:48,919
development BDD and a full suite of

00:10:45,539 --> 00:10:51,239
automated tests to get to a point where

00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:53,819
you know we could then put in place for

00:10:51,239 --> 00:10:58,019
continuous deployment everything now is

00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:59,669
code all automated things you can see

00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:02,399
every change gets pushed and will go all

00:10:59,669 --> 00:11:04,589
the way through into production so what

00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,149
was once a one-year feedback cycle is

00:11:04,589 --> 00:11:06,630
now you know fifty times a day when

00:11:06,149 --> 00:11:10,320
we're working

00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:17,400
actively so now developers can make

00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:18,840
changes with confidence we took high

00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,940
spec hardware moved to

00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:24,150
infrastructure-as-a-service

00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:25,830
underneath the pads layer which were

00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:28,070
limited scalability and turned it into

00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:31,340
sort of unlimited horizontal scalability

00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:33,990
and we took the partner list depth from

00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:36,840
down to one team so it's now four people

00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:39,300
that built swears five built it for run

00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,950
it and that's how it's run for the last

00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:43,230
few years

00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:48,030
everything's as code apps infrastructure

00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:49,710
pipeline and I guess yeah the sort of

00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:51,600
end result of all that everything is

00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:53,280
code so that's where the knowledge is

00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,440
all of its contained within the code

00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,940
there's no sideline knowledge you know

00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,690
sort of command dependency or anything

00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:03,600
along those lines so the result for the

00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:09,120
business so far it's been a total

00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:10,890
success 90% reduction in team size we've

00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,240
run for events over the last five years

00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:16,350
and process millions of transactions

00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:19,530
although surprisingly it's only actually

00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:22,710
been yeah doing its job for 28 hours

00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:24,770
over that period of time which is weird

00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:27,900
when you put it in those terms

00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:29,670
yeah it's an equivalent of 5 million

00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:32,420
pounds worth the savings in terms of the

00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:34,560
cost that the organization has to bear

00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:36,090
and we're now in a situation where we

00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,680
can push the entire thing and you know

00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:39,090
we push changes to production in 15

00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,100
minutes so we've been able to push

00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:43,350
changes during an event whilst taking

00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,730
you know up to a hundred transactions a

00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:57,330
second we can push changes into

00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:58,590
production so idea is to put it into

00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:59,940
context it give you a little bit of

00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:01,230
background in terms of one of the

00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:05,160
projects that we've worked on that was

00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:07,980
more greenfield moving from from a Java

00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:09,570
monolith over to if you like having carp

00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:11,220
launch over the architecture and the key

00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:15,120
decisions that we made to run with cloud

00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:18,180
foundry five years ago as often has

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,750
proven to be a the right decision I

00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:21,550
think there are

00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:24,250
a lot of options at the time but we

00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:28,900
decided that that that was right for us

00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:31,510
and and we've stood - we've stood to

00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:32,710
turn to tell the tale so what have we

00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:35,590
learned so there's lots of things that

00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:40,300
we have learned no no I need my glasses

00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:45,460
wherever they may be actually read

00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:47,380
anymore so we I suppose it the most

00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:50,410
important thing that we we've learnt is

00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:53,920
that everyone can benefit from Cloud

00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:57,490
Foundry there is not an application or

00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:59,410
an instance where we believe that the

00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:01,390
co-founder II cannot be deployed there

00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:02,950
is one we took we've spoken with and we

00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:04,540
continue to talk with a client that is

00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:06,580
actually running high frequency

00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:07,900
applications high frequency trading and

00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:10,360
we're looking at ways that we can

00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:15,100
utilize Cloud Foundry to benefit them in

00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:17,050
a way that will still service a lot of

00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:22,000
their needs and introduce some sort of

00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:24,280
improvements in the way they work um but

00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,870
what what's important is that whether

00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,250
you're big or small whether you'll start

00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:28,990
up with your traditional whether you've

00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:30,550
got legacy whether you've got greenfield

00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:33,040
site there is always a way that you can

00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:37,290
employ Cloud Foundry but Cloud Foundry

00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:41,980
and cloud native is a big shift for some

00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:47,050
culture industry does not necessarily

00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:50,260
allow the widespread adoption so a lot

00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:51,490
of people in the next over the next

00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,810
couple of days you would have heard some

00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:56,440
already and you'll hear some more no

00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:58,720
doubt will be evangelizing Cloud Foundry

00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:01,000
and so they should write it's an amazing

00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,890
piece of technology is absolutely

00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,520
fundamental in terms of and has the

00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:07,900
ability to change the world and we all

00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,220
believe in that right we're all sat in

00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,810
this room and we're all around this

00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:14,200
conference because we believe that Cloud

00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:18,089
Foundry has the ability to fundamentally

00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:22,660
change the way IT is delivered I'm

00:15:18,089 --> 00:15:27,100
trying to getting on my soapbox but the

00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:29,260
problem that we have as a community and

00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:30,970
as a platform is the success that Cloud

00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:32,499
Foundry has and one of the key learnings

00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:35,639
that we have

00:15:32,499 --> 00:15:37,989
is its ability to be consumed within an

00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:42,549
organization without giving the

00:15:37,989 --> 00:15:44,979
organization indigestion so the adoption

00:15:42,549 --> 00:15:47,979
has to be specific to your organization

00:15:44,979 --> 00:15:51,789
there are different people that play a

00:15:47,979 --> 00:15:56,169
very significant part in cloud foundries

00:15:51,789 --> 00:15:58,359
adoption and move to cloud native now we

00:15:56,169 --> 00:16:00,669
had a very interesting conversation at

00:15:58,359 --> 00:16:02,169
the unconference last night where we

00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:03,399
were talking about different points of

00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:05,639
resistance and it's really interesting

00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:08,019
to hear different views whether it's the

00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:10,809
developers whether which seem to be very

00:16:08,019 --> 00:16:12,939
much split halfway down the middle some

00:16:10,809 --> 00:16:14,469
see it as this exciting opportunity to

00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:16,509
improve the way they work and and

00:16:14,469 --> 00:16:18,759
genuinely take more control others

00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:19,989
abroad prone to inertia and actually see

00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:21,639
it more as a threat because they're

00:16:19,989 --> 00:16:23,379
having to relearn a lot of the stuff

00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:24,699
that they've taken for granted they're

00:16:23,379 --> 00:16:27,879
in a position of power and they don't

00:16:24,699 --> 00:16:29,229
really see it as a benefit they see it

00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:31,239
more of a threat

00:16:29,229 --> 00:16:33,459
you've got the DevOps and the

00:16:31,239 --> 00:16:35,589
infrastructure teams that some people

00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:37,720
think that they are used to picking up

00:16:35,589 --> 00:16:39,369
new systems as you go so therefore it's

00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,749
just a new platform it's new products

00:16:39,369 --> 00:16:43,239
which they have to pick up and and

00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:44,979
they're expected to deploy great and

00:16:43,239 --> 00:16:47,409
they they don't have a problem others

00:16:44,979 --> 00:16:48,970
feel that it's a massive threat and that

00:16:47,409 --> 00:16:52,979
they're about to it's a bit like selling

00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:56,439
Christmas to turkeys it doesn't work so

00:16:52,979 --> 00:16:58,539
the adoption has to be specific to your

00:16:56,439 --> 00:17:01,059
organization and it has to be balanced

00:16:58,539 --> 00:17:02,949
there is this purist view where cloud

00:17:01,059 --> 00:17:05,289
foundry comes as a bigger package where

00:17:02,949 --> 00:17:07,389
it is Cloud Foundry cloud native 12

00:17:05,289 --> 00:17:09,129
racks are apps microservice architecture

00:17:07,389 --> 00:17:11,289
can't be used for legacy can't be used

00:17:09,129 --> 00:17:13,480
for every everything has to be moved

00:17:11,289 --> 00:17:14,619
over to this way of working and then

00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,839
there's the more pragmatic approach

00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:19,779
which is an actual fact so I had a very

00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:22,269
interesting conversation last night

00:17:19,779 --> 00:17:23,529
about how cloud foundry can be deployed

00:17:22,269 --> 00:17:26,110
and you can you you can build

00:17:23,529 --> 00:17:28,929
infrastructure services and almost not

00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:31,629
quite as easy as being completely

00:17:28,929 --> 00:17:34,509
transparent or completely hidden I mean

00:17:31,629 --> 00:17:36,369
I'm from from the developers and from

00:17:34,509 --> 00:17:38,559
parts of the organization of may

00:17:36,369 --> 00:17:41,679
actually pushback on it but you can

00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,610
actually deploy it in a way that more

00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:45,279
softly-softly

00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:46,390
so you're actually building this wave

00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:49,110
without even people

00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:51,220
realizing it by employing Cloud Foundry

00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:52,900
and then when people when you're

00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:55,630
presenting this new way of working

00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:57,220
people are like well I don't like that

00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:58,450
it's never going to work and except but

00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,620
you've been using it for six months and

00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:01,390
you don't even really know it

00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:04,240
so we'll be subtle changes that we've

00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:06,400
made to the way that your work so the

00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,720
most important thing or one of the most

00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,120
important things that we've learned and

00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:12,850
we continue to learn is the adoption of

00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:16,030
cloud foundry and its ultimate success

00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:18,340
is dependent on the individual drivers

00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:20,530
within the organization to be able to

00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:24,970
appreciate that sometimes the cultural

00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:26,950
shift is too much when you've got five

00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:29,530
seven and a half thousand developers

00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:31,570
across multiple geographies and they've

00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:33,660
been stuck in the world of delivering

00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:37,000
waterfall and they've been reliant on

00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:38,740
massive test cycles to be able to take

00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,140
away this need for them to actually

00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:43,030
write good code then you're going to

00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:44,800
struggle to get actually employed Cloud

00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:47,620
Foundry in a way that you perhaps

00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:48,910
wanting and I think as you know we're

00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:51,820
all here right because we all want to

00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:55,900
see Cloud Foundry adopted and we all see

00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:57,430
it as beneficial to us so it's important

00:18:55,900 --> 00:19:01,840
that we look at the ways that we can

00:18:57,430 --> 00:19:04,200
influence management devil' other

00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:07,090
developers appears to be able to improve

00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:09,520
its adoption in a way that best befits

00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:11,680
our organization so this purest view

00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,380
sometimes should just be banging a head

00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:17,370
against a brick wall and it hurts so

00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:17,370
sometimes it's more pragmatic approach

00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:28,889
so moving on from that perhaps certainly

00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:30,840
one of the one of if not the singular

00:19:28,889 --> 00:19:34,889
most important benefit of Cloud Foundry

00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:38,639
in our 5 years experience is that it

00:19:34,889 --> 00:19:40,440
creates a single contract so if you

00:19:38,639 --> 00:19:43,409
imagine so we were talking about this

00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:46,409
the other day and we've been using Cloud

00:19:43,409 --> 00:19:48,989
Foundry for five years and within that

00:19:46,409 --> 00:19:51,539
five years we have used Cloud Foundry as

00:19:48,989 --> 00:19:53,639
a platform as a service now if we hadn't

00:19:51,539 --> 00:19:55,289
chosen cloud foundry and we chosen to

00:19:53,639 --> 00:19:57,479
use a different technology whether it

00:19:55,289 --> 00:20:00,599
was building our own custom passes a lot

00:19:57,479 --> 00:20:04,499
of organizations have done or we've

00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:05,820
chosen another route we we reckon that

00:20:04,499 --> 00:20:08,639
we would have done things three times

00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:10,529
over there's the technology churn so we

00:20:08,639 --> 00:20:12,989
would have had to continually update our

00:20:10,529 --> 00:20:16,019
custom pads or the technologies that we

00:20:12,989 --> 00:20:18,989
were using as these technologies either

00:20:16,019 --> 00:20:21,119
became redundant or they evolved and

00:20:18,989 --> 00:20:22,440
still there are organizations that are

00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:23,940
pushing back on the adoption of

00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:28,940
something like Cloud Foundry as an

00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:32,129
industry standard open-source de-facto

00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:34,200
has to use and because they have

00:20:32,129 --> 00:20:35,519
invested a lot of time and effort in

00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:38,249
their own custom pads and they have

00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:40,109
these massive teams that have built it

00:20:38,249 --> 00:20:44,070
and there's blood sweat and tears have

00:20:40,109 --> 00:20:45,869
gone into these things but every time

00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:47,659
that there is a new technology every

00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:52,399
time there is a change they have to

00:20:47,659 --> 00:20:55,320
invest time and effort to improve that

00:20:52,399 --> 00:20:56,759
that family does it right they've got a

00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,470
bunch of developers and a bunch of

00:20:56,759 --> 00:21:00,690
technologists that are doing it for you

00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:02,279
so every time that you're and and it's

00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:04,950
transparent to you you just roll out the

00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:07,679
next version we heard we had Sam two

00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:09,869
earlier saying about the the all the new

00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:13,950
features that they're bringing out it's

00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:17,489
got everybody firmly onside and in

00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:19,049
developing its functionality so but it's

00:21:17,489 --> 00:21:20,729
the single contract so for us as

00:21:19,049 --> 00:21:22,769
developers it doesn't matter right we're

00:21:20,729 --> 00:21:25,340
just using Cloud Foundry that's that's

00:21:22,769 --> 00:21:28,080
incredible the other thing is course is

00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:32,129
it removes the need to retrain your team

00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:34,740
so if you if you're using Cloud Foundry

00:21:32,129 --> 00:21:37,169
then it's a consistent contract there is

00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:39,000
cf push right and everything that goes

00:21:37,169 --> 00:21:40,500
around town foundry

00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,690
you're not having to train them on

00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:45,000
different so you train them on one

00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:46,559
platform and then you you decide for

00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,909
whatever reason that you're going to

00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:49,169
upgrade or you're gonna throw that out

00:21:47,909 --> 00:21:51,179
and get in something else you have to

00:21:49,169 --> 00:21:52,470
retrain but also promote from a

00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:53,789
developer's point of view if you're

00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:55,890
learning cloud foundry and you're

00:21:53,789 --> 00:21:57,720
actually competent and expert in cloud

00:21:55,890 --> 00:22:00,270
foundry then you're opening up a whole

00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:03,480
huge opportunity in terms of the that

00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:06,000
the roles that you can perform and the

00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:07,559
other thing is of course for our C's we

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,200
reckon we would have had to rebuild

00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:13,140
several of our apps several of our

00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:16,049
software platforms once if not twice in

00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:16,950
the past five years as our customers

00:22:16,049 --> 00:22:19,799
have fallen out with their

00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:21,510
infrastructure providers and Men and

00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:23,279
said actually we need to move okay so we

00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:24,720
can't use them anymore because we don't

00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:25,950
like what they're charging us or we're

00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,100
just unhappy with the level of service

00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:32,669
when we want to move over there no we

00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:36,149
haven't had to do a great deal of work

00:22:32,669 --> 00:22:39,840
about redesigning or recoding to utilize

00:22:36,149 --> 00:22:43,950
the specific services that that I asked

00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:45,690
provider offering so we've not gone okay

00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:49,380
so but that doesn't mean that you know

00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:52,860
you're unable to leverage the platform

00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:56,940
specifically sorry the I asked specific

00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:58,559
services so that is perhaps one of the

00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:00,870
biggest benefits and the one of the most

00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:04,890
important learnings that we've had very

00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:07,340
fortunate in in our use of in our

00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:10,320
decision to to run with Clara foundry

00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:13,080
but one of the magnificent benefits that

00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,700
we've received um I'm gonna hand out to

00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,740
Tim now just to talk about what else

00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:20,970
we've learnt because there's been some

00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:22,289
more learnings about how you know you're

00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:29,520
on the right track in terms you can

00:23:22,289 --> 00:23:32,360
manage any right some quarters of time

00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:34,470
as well so I'll make this fairly quick

00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:38,309
this is all about the cloud native

00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:40,230
journey and how you know organizations

00:23:38,309 --> 00:23:42,990
are you know adopting or getting

00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:44,340
involved you might be sort of thinking

00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:46,110
about cloud foundry a whole bunch of

00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:48,580
things but what we're trying to do here

00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:50,679
is is this is a list of pointers as to

00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:53,860
in this case you might be losing the way

00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:58,500
the cloud NAT native way when there's a

00:23:53,860 --> 00:24:01,529
lot of them the pairs of the eye as

00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:05,110
you're directly dependent on I as

00:24:01,529 --> 00:24:06,190
offerings the collaboration contracts or

00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:09,370
that single contract we were just

00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:12,700
talking about that contract is broken so

00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:14,740
when you've got your developers that

00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:16,990
people adding value if they aren't

00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:18,429
pushing directly or meow using a CI or

00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:19,539
something then you've suddenly you know

00:24:18,429 --> 00:24:23,919
you're in that position where you've got

00:24:19,539 --> 00:24:26,380
a silo component cost is more important

00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:27,909
than developer cost so we hear people

00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:29,529
that are talking about the efficiencies

00:24:27,909 --> 00:24:31,960
they can get from moving down from X to

00:24:29,529 --> 00:24:34,029
Y in terms of the NIA machine size or

00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:35,139
the performance or whatever what's

00:24:34,029 --> 00:24:36,730
actually the bigger course is the amount

00:24:35,139 --> 00:24:38,289
of time these guys are spending doing it

00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:40,269
or the amount of time that's involved in

00:24:38,289 --> 00:24:41,620
you know the developer cost the true

00:24:40,269 --> 00:24:44,460
cost of ownership and that's never

00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:47,409
really appreciated or looked at

00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:49,090
complexity isn't adding value so the

00:24:47,409 --> 00:24:50,470
complexity that you're adding in and it

00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:52,210
is a complexity put in you know sort of

00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:54,370
go into a pass and microservice

00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:55,809
architecture that is some complexity

00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:57,700
you're adding you should then be able to

00:24:55,809 --> 00:25:01,470
iterate and add value on top of that if

00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:04,779
you're not you're losing your way

00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:08,500
developers aren't empowered it sort of

00:25:04,779 --> 00:25:09,700
relates back to point two but the

00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:12,010
further you move away from a

00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:15,820
self-service model the more velocity and

00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:17,409
empathy is reduced apps aren't twelve

00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:18,850
factor I think everyone knows about

00:25:17,409 --> 00:25:20,980
twelve factor and so on so I think that

00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:23,260
speaks for itself

00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:24,970
tooling is deeply abstracted or version

00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:26,980
specific so we've seen scenarios where

00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:29,320
the tooling has got so complex to allow

00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:31,299
push or to allow environments to you

00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:32,799
know sort of bills to happen or a whole

00:25:31,299 --> 00:25:34,029
complex chain of events that have to

00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:36,370
happen for something to get into

00:25:34,029 --> 00:25:37,779
production that you've sort of stepped

00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:39,370
away from the path of you know the

00:25:37,779 --> 00:25:42,309
simplicity that you should have in terms

00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:45,700
of how you get me applications into

00:25:42,309 --> 00:25:49,870
production forking Cloud Foundry I think

00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:52,510
that speaks for itself we've seen it you

00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:55,720
expect pairs to behave like ours that is

00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:57,940
a you know where you sort of you expect

00:25:55,720 --> 00:26:00,720
the instant access to the sweetie shop

00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:03,280
that is is

00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,750
there's no process to get existing start

00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:06,730
to transition so I think this has been a

00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:09,940
top pick for quite a lot of talks today

00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:14,679
around you know that not being part of

00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:18,390
the process and when Cloud Foundry is a

00:26:14,679 --> 00:26:21,540
solution not an enabler so I think

00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:24,370
somebody mentioned earlier Cloud Foundry

00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:26,590
delivers zero user value it delivers

00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:28,900
nothing it enables you it isn't the

00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:30,580
solution so if it is the solution is

00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:31,770
being talked about as a solution as its

00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:36,010
solving the problem

00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:37,299
you're losing your way and you solve

00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:41,110
problems with version numbers not

00:26:37,299 --> 00:26:42,760
patterns so this is where you know

00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:44,380
people are talking about waiting for X

00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:46,210
or Y version because that will solve all

00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:50,350
your problems you know that's the world

00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:54,250
you're in then things are going wrong so

00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:56,220
you should floor it when and this is

00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:59,799
when you're on the right path

00:26:56,220 --> 00:27:02,080
your architectures cloud native you can

00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:03,460
do small quick iterative developments

00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,679
you've got multiple teams working on

00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:07,270
multiple components they're all working

00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:10,540
two contracts between each other you can

00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:15,250
progress and you can add value quickly

00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:17,140
the apps are easy to deploy so they're

00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:18,429
12 factor apps they get their config

00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:20,230
from the environment a whole bunch of

00:27:18,429 --> 00:27:24,520
things that I imagine people here either

00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:27,130
know about or will learn about your apps

00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:28,660
can be automatically tested so you can't

00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:29,679
get to this world of continuous

00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:32,110
deployment continuous integration

00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:33,970
without you know thoroughly tested

00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:35,950
environments and as much as you know we

00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:37,450
we practice it and we you know we see it

00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:41,799
but we're constantly improving it and

00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:45,179
progressing it in site and logging a

00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:47,140
design by the application developers so

00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:49,360
migrating from a self build

00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:51,850
infrastructure as a service environment

00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,260
to pass often means that sort of a lot

00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:55,840
of the insight you had before will be

00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:57,280
lost and needs to be you'll get some

00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,820
from the pair some peer Cloud Foundry

00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:03,070
gives you some insight but you need to

00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:04,660
build in business level metrics you know

00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:06,280
how long it are your application is

00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:10,210
taking yeah all the stuff you need to

00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:11,919
understand what's going on either at the

00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:14,309
application level or sometimes sort of

00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:14,309
build packy

00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:20,440
your business differentiator is not

00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:22,480
platform dependent so this is true for a

00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:24,760
lot of use cases even though businesses

00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:29,320
maintain their special snowflakes but

00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:30,910
sometimes it's not so example the super

00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:34,330
low latency trading platform that Ben

00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:37,270
was talking about earlier and your

00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:40,060
business pro saw the business process is

00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:43,630
agile to so often go live and releases

00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:46,210
are entirely blocked by internal

00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:48,640
regulation compliance a whole bunch of

00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:51,340
processes that are entirely non agile

00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:53,290
and that's you know that's something you

00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:54,700
need to be agile and if that is yeah if

00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:56,050
you've brought them with you and taking

00:28:54,700 --> 00:29:01,780
them on your journey

00:28:56,050 --> 00:29:05,770
you are on the cloud native journey so

00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:07,570
thank you very much our information is

00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:10,980
up there we are hiring so if anyone's

00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:12,420
yeah looking for new work go sous chef

00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:19,990
thank you very much

00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:19,990
[Applause]

00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:37,759
[Music]

00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:49,770
separate in size or in other words when

00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:49,770
is it appropriate to run your own yes

00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:57,130
but the the point that I was making was

00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:59,770
more that your whatever you're calling

00:29:57,130 --> 00:30:02,010
your pass is utterly dependent on

00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:04,659
something that's very infrastructure I a

00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:07,900
specific so for example you know you're

00:30:04,659 --> 00:30:09,429
using an AWS component that is specific

00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:10,510
to AWS you know you're not in a position

00:30:09,429 --> 00:30:12,730
where you can be portable

00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:13,990
you can't go multiplayer out you haven't

00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:16,390
got any of that flexibility so that's

00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:17,799
that was the point I was making does

00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:20,490
that answer your sort of does not see a

00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:20,490
question but yeah

00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:39,210
at the time openshift existed and there

00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,770
was quite a lot of work going on there

00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:42,900
so we did evaluate it at the time we

00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:45,240
spent quite a bit of time working with

00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:49,610
both and we eventually decided on Cloud

00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:53,820
Foundry a choice I'm glad we made now

00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:55,110
hmm I I couldn't actually because I

00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:58,410
wasn't involved in that decision I was

00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:59,880
on the other team but yeah I could find

00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:01,020
actually if you want to yeah we can give

00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:06,950
you the reasons although it is probably

00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:12,240
now very out of date but yeah look at

00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:13,830
any others nope okay I think the next

00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:18,270
talk is quite soon I think it's a big

00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:19,670
gap so I'll drop out all right thank you

00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:24,380
very much

00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:24,380
