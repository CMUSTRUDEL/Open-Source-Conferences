Description: 
	Keynote: The Shift to a New Digital Allianz Germany - Dr. Daniel Poelchau, Allianz

The fast progress of digitalization is a challenge for Allianz Germany. Customers compare the value of products and services of their insurance companies to the intuitive offerings they are used to from other industries. Additionally, there is a growing number of Startups and InsurTechs shaping the market with innovative ideas and their aim to take possession of the customer interface. This means: in order to be still market leader in ten years, Allianz Germany needs to get digital by default and to be fully geared to customersâ€™ needs and expectations of the digital age.

We recognized the necessity for a wide-ranging digital transformation at Allianz Germany and translated the key factors into our corporate strategy. Of course, two decisive factors are the shift towards a co-located and agile software development together with the implementation of an elastic Cloud Foundry infrastructure which offers easy scalability of successful products.

	00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,570
time because I really saw this

00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:06,060
entertaining presentation and now a

00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:07,830
German guy's German guy from a boring

00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:09,540
insurance company tries to explain you

00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,460
what we are doing here and with such

00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:14,549
entertaining presentations always tough

00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,410
to follow what I like to do and first of

00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:18,090
all I have to apologize a bit because I

00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:20,850
think you listen to him gasp naltar this

00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:22,650
morning so I might repeat some of the

00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:25,680
elements that he was saying so sorry

00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:27,180
again for that I want to take a little

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,490
bit on a journey I want to take you on a

00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:32,969
journey that we as a very traditional

00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:35,430
company made to really think about our

00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:37,920
transformation and what you see we see

00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:41,760
with the slides and what we'll tell you

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:44,610
is is read German I mean we do

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,309
everything there is structured so when

00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:49,710
we go into such a transformation we look

00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:51,780
around ourselves what is happening we

00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:54,870
reflect on our service who are standing

00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,579
and then we do kind of a program so and

00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:59,100
what you're gonna see is exactly this

00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:02,789
journey so when we looked outside the

00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:06,540
world we saw actually this is actually

00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:09,000
if you look at it the transformation is

00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:12,450
happening and if we compare ourselves

00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,100
with financial peers is actually a

00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:17,490
little bit a difference to the banks and

00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:20,159
the insurance companies while the banks

00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:23,549
you already have seen a large degree of

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:26,939
disruption this is not yet the end of

00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:29,850
insurance companies I think one of the

00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:34,680
key drivers is probably that banks have

00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:36,689
naturally more interaction with their

00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:40,320
customers and therefore it was probably

00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:42,509
easier for startups to disrupt and go

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,390
into the value chain so that was the

00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:47,759
outside world so there is disruption out

00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:48,899
there other financial peers are more

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:53,670
affected than we are

00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:56,700
but the storm is rising so that was the

00:01:53,670 --> 00:02:02,399
outside look but then we looked at

00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:04,740
ourselves internally i what kind of bet

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,099
that if I talk to some of my colleagues

00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:11,340
from similar companies like ours

00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:13,470
this might sound familiar with you so we

00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:15,930
used to a waterfall approach

00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:19,650
thinking in boxes and then you have a

00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:20,400
hierarchy to it while if we see where we

00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:23,340
should go

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,620
is actually be far more agile and really

00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:29,850
be faster I mean agile for us is

00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:31,740
actually two things being faster but

00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:33,480
also what kind of some eccentric and

00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:37,680
develop code that really matter for the

00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:39,900
customer so again you know we understood

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,150
the way we try to understand what is

00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:45,360
actually happening in the outside world

00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:47,310
again so you know we have two tech

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,950
companies out there we have also an

00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:53,280
insurance field some of the startup

00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:55,680
disrupting it and our core question was

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,410
what do we learn from that and actually

00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,330
I will now show you the summary of what

00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:03,150
we learn and I want to highlight a

00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:05,010
couple of aspects I mean first of all

00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:07,110
that was just our takeaway there are

00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:09,270
probably academics out there people much

00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:12,540
smarter than us who can give you another

00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:15,840
you know kind of categorization but that

00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:18,570
was our key takeaway and it works quite

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,800
well for us so first of all what you

00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:22,110
have to think about this whole

00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:24,570
transformation is it's actually not

00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:25,980
about IT there are a lot of things that

00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:27,810
are actually business developments that

00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:30,270
are triggered by some IT innovation but

00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:32,040
it's not about a tee you know if you

00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:34,290
look at some of the companies like Apple

00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:37,380
how they are really passionate about

00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:39,510
customer experience this is not PCIT it

00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:41,160
just you know it coincides if you look

00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:44,400
at the Lean principles that were out

00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:47,790
there already before if you think about

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:51,630
you know slicing bigger investments into

00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:53,100
you know short amount of times this was

00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:56,070
coming from venture capitalist already

00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:59,310
for quite a while and colocation is

00:03:56,070 --> 00:04:02,640
actually something you can do all the

00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:05,190
time then of course you have very

00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,680
specific technological developments you

00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:09,480
have agile programming and you have

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,360
elastic infrastructure that you can

00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:14,430
build on actually I don't know again you

00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,290
know you know you know colleagues from

00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:19,560
other incumbents it's always funny to

00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:22,350
talk about agile and will later say work

00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:24,180
work also on it and when I now trough

00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:26,620
within the company I become a huge buzz

00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:28,540
word and actually very often I run

00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:30,400
- you know you run into a situation

00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:32,470
there's a little bit of heartache in

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,090
somebody said it tells me oh don't worry

00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:35,320
we're doing an etch away and then we

00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:36,400
always have to explain them you know

00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,750
look at Joe there's actually a very

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,800
structured approach you know it's not

00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:43,900
about you know chaotic behavior but you

00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:47,440
know this was the reflection that we had

00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:49,240
and then we were actually quite happy to

00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,370
say there are elements which we can

00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,520
build on

00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:58,510
especially the Lean Startup approach

00:04:53,520 --> 00:05:00,639
that was made popular by Eric Ries and

00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:03,280
we are we are also in partnering up with

00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:08,789
pivotal to see how we can introduce it

00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:12,070
in our company so how does it look like

00:05:08,789 --> 00:05:15,160
what we are currently doing is we have

00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:18,430
these six levers that are important to

00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:21,070
us and we have put that in a something

00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:23,440
called digital factory so the digital

00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:26,919
Factory actually has a certain element

00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:30,160
of steering because like each and every

00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:32,169
if you if you compare yourself with a VC

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,330
you need kind of a final management what

00:05:32,169 --> 00:05:36,280
kind of projects do you do you know what

00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:38,289
does the static value behind it how do

00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:40,270
you achieve this value and then we have

00:05:38,289 --> 00:05:42,660
the so called training center or garage

00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:46,389
where the people are actually working

00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:48,370
collocated in natural Manor we have next

00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:50,860
to that also a company called Kaiser

00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:53,530
excellence which is focusing on UX

00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:56,560
design it was an internal company which

00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:59,860
became part of aliens Germany just

00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,599
recently and then we obviously

00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:03,370
collaborate with the global digital

00:06:01,599 --> 00:06:04,660
factory because we also have a digital

00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:07,690
Factory on a global level we're a global

00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:09,520
company or we are part we as Allianz

00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:11,500
Germany a part of the global company and

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:14,830
there are a lot of things working we can

00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:18,699
share developments across countries so

00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:20,650
that is how it looks like what I think

00:06:18,699 --> 00:06:22,570
was already alluded to we are also

00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:25,090
thinking about Minimum Viable products

00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:27,310
because it's all about quickly learning

00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:30,180
on what is working and what is not

00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:33,400
working and we actually want to

00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:36,159
introduce our discipline to say what do

00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:38,380
we actually want to achieve

00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:38,900
so like the MVP proposal so what is it

00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,850
what

00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:42,830
you know what is the question we address

00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:44,979
you know what do we want to achieve what

00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:49,699
is the customer problem we want to solve

00:06:44,979 --> 00:06:51,800
then people get our teams get money to

00:06:49,699 --> 00:06:54,919
work for roughly a hundred days and then

00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:56,389
we look again you know whatever realized

00:06:54,919 --> 00:06:58,970
was it successful or not

00:06:56,389 --> 00:07:01,039
and then our we have created something

00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:03,380
called the review board which then look

00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:05,449
says you know chemical life with this do

00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:10,009
they have to improve or do we have to

00:07:05,449 --> 00:07:12,289
pivot so now how does it really look

00:07:10,009 --> 00:07:13,669
like and there's one colleague later he

00:07:12,289 --> 00:07:16,340
can you know I don't know what the beer

00:07:13,669 --> 00:07:19,010
share you some real-life experience that

00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:21,350
looks like and now it has to work we

00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:26,210
actually introduced collocations open

00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:29,919
spaces we have them instruct cut this is

00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:32,240
one of our major locations roughly 90 I

00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:35,210
think they were opened end of June and

00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:38,139
we have them in Munich where people

00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:42,560
really work

00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:45,560
Kolak ated on the ground focused on the

00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:48,229
concrete delivery there are no

00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:51,669
telephones at the working place so that

00:07:48,229 --> 00:07:54,260
they can really focus on development

00:07:51,669 --> 00:07:58,729
which these kind of settings we put a

00:07:54,260 --> 00:08:02,780
little bit a site off of our regular

00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:04,699
headquarters to really give the team a

00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:06,919
little bit the environment to work on

00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:08,870
the concrete problems because what we

00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:10,849
see is that you know the all these

00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:12,909
different hierarchies functions if you

00:08:10,849 --> 00:08:16,010
are very functionally differentiated

00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:17,659
teams get often disturbed and don't have

00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:20,680
the chance to really work on the end

00:08:17,659 --> 00:08:23,330
product and very often these you know

00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:28,599
departments they don't work out of bad

00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:31,959
intentions it's just how we used to work

00:08:28,599 --> 00:08:35,599
as I said one of the key elements is

00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:41,810
agile development which we do together

00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:46,730
with pivotal this is actually a slide

00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:49,100
that we use also internally to explain

00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:50,630
it and again the very first point I

00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,970
think I mention it earlier is always to

00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:54,460
say look this is

00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:56,470
you know a proven approach it's not

00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:58,270
about managing chaos because sometimes

00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:00,880
people just say oh let's be agile and

00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:05,920
then you know it's actually just another

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:08,620
word for chaos I think if you look at

00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,930
this we started on this journey but we

00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:13,180
still have to get better this is the

00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:17,920
principle and we now have to still stick

00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:20,680
with it part of it we also know

00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,830
investing into what is called elastic

00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:25,060
infrastructure we labeled it that way

00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:26,530
because of course in this kind of

00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:29,710
environments especially if you have

00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:31,990
things in the in the customer-facing

00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:34,570
layout you want to actually implement

00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:40,360
bring time to market and in a very rapid

00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:43,690
manner this is how it looks like you

00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:45,790
know on a simplified way on our side we

00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:49,630
still have of course our core insurance

00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:51,730
and back-end players you have to imagine

00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:54,730
what this insurance is about huh there's

00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:57,430
this longtime business I mean somebody

00:09:54,730 --> 00:10:00,310
buying a life insurance policy at the

00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:03,610
age of let's say 28 you know might turn

00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:05,830
it into annuity and then you know this

00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:07,780
person has an intense death so it's 70

00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:10,510
years 70 years you have this kind of

00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:12,640
policy in those on our systems yeah so

00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:15,010
this is why we still need quite a very

00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:18,250
stable system who keep the basic data on

00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:22,120
this area but then we're investing in a

00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:23,410
customer facing part where you exactly

00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:27,190
have this interaction layer for

00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:30,850
customers but also to introduce very

00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:33,040
quickly new developments and to manage

00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:34,330
that we introduced in an integration

00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,950
layer that actually creates the

00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:37,950
connection between these two speeds

00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:44,320
there was not a quick part now listening

00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:46,270
tool to my pre speaker I was quite

00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,970
impressed especially with the the

00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:51,010
reference to the matrix so I thought gee

00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:52,600
I cannot end on this slide because you

00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:54,700
know it's high level it's probably kind

00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:57,510
of boring for you so what I would like

00:10:54,700 --> 00:11:00,130
to do is to share with you some

00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:01,210
philosophical thinking why we think

00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:05,440
we're on the right way

00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:07,090
and when I was in charge in a previous

00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,100
job very often the transformation

00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:10,990
projects and then usually it--if

00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:14,320
transformation was one element out of it

00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:17,650
among many others and always the interns

00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,870
at each transformation part was the one

00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:21,880
with the hazel and I said back you know

00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:24,400
why is this the case I really wanted to

00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:26,380
understand it why is this the case and

00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:28,120
then I started to reflect and as I also

00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:30,910
did some studies in philosophy I

00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:33,280
sometimes it's it worth opening books

00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:36,070
that are 2,000 years old and that's

00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:37,990
actually it's Plato and that Eris

00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:40,510
totally gave me some you know help to

00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:42,970
understand it and sometimes it's quite

00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:44,410
you know easy if you think about it or

00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:47,830
something that simple if you think about

00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:50,920
coat coat is actually very easy it's

00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:52,510
logic logical it's always logical you

00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:55,060
know it's always an if-then combination

00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:56,680
whatever and it's always explicit it's

00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:58,150
always explicit there's no hidden

00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:00,190
message if you want so you know you

00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:02,050
write something that's even but if you

00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:04,510
look into human systems human

00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:10,660
organization they are neither logical

00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:12,790
nor explicit they are implicit whenever

00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:16,210
I go to you know where the clerk's it

00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:19,380
it's always interesting to see the kind

00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:21,790
of posters that put on their Street

00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:24,610
because this is how the real process is

00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:27,220
run but if you think about an waterfall

00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:29,110
approach and you ask people to do write

00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:31,870
down these requirements they would

00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:33,700
usually never have the idea to write

00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:35,050
down these kind of requirements that

00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:36,250
they for example need a screen where

00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:38,290
they can put their posters on or

00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:42,760
something like that so there's a lot of

00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:46,480
implicit knowledge out there and this is

00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:49,000
why H I really helps you all this helps

00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,070
you to really very quickly it's actually

00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,220
more human you really very quickly make

00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:56,260
the things transparent what are you

00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:58,720
working on and you you acknowledge that

00:12:56,260 --> 00:13:02,380
things are not always logical and are

00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:04,630
not always explicit and this and this is

00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:06,520
why I end with was actually the

00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:09,100
discussion of Plato and Aristotle while

00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:11,590
Plato had the idea to say there's an

00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:13,210
ideal world you know with you know we

00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:14,000
just have to get it right we just have

00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:19,100
to understand

00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,939
you know this ideal world and write it

00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:23,089
down actually

00:13:19,939 --> 00:13:26,300
iris totally said that was probably not

00:13:23,089 --> 00:13:28,069
the case if you think about it in the in

00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:31,850
the in the world there are things that

00:13:28,069 --> 00:13:34,279
are always as they are but some some

00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:38,000
things especially in the human world are

00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:41,000
actually most of the time so but

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,850
something different so coming back and

00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,319
this you know I wanted to write with you

00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:48,079
this may be a little bit of a

00:13:45,319 --> 00:13:50,420
philosophical underpinning why I think

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:54,230
this approach is really helpful because

00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:56,750
it acknowledges that the things that we

00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:59,600
do and if we look at the transformation

00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:04,790
there are ahead of us and neither fully

00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:07,850
logical nor are there always explicit so

00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:10,459
you have to put a lot of thinking to

00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:13,279
take the people who along the few on the

00:14:10,459 --> 00:14:15,610
journey so that they understand what it

00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:19,040
is about that they feel part of it and

00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:22,040
we hope and this is coming back to what

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,959
I've presented to you with our digital

00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:26,149
factor we we've actually built an

00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:29,089
environment where we can really push

00:14:26,149 --> 00:14:31,910
this transformation from a business

00:14:29,089 --> 00:14:35,059
development side so maybe that's the

00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:36,970
logical part and a technological side

00:14:35,059 --> 00:14:40,940
thank you

00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:40,940
