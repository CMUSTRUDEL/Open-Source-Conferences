	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,629
so I assume that a lot of you wanted to

00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:09,000
become a sales rep as a kid I certainly

00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:10,710
didn't because it's really really hard

00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,240
no one likes being rejected yet

00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:14,580
salespeople are being rejected all the

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:18,449
time especially at the top of a sales

00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:21,060
funnel so hey I'm Christina Trager and

00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:22,850
I'm going to show you how to use AI to

00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:25,260
exactly help those people and

00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:31,230
revolutionize the way your business is

00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:34,950
doing sales why do we even care because

00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:38,160
80% of all sales reps are performing at

00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:40,469
average or below we've seen that a sales

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,989
career is hardly anyone's first choice

00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:45,480
they kind of fall into their career

00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:48,059
after college and and rather survive

00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:51,180
than thrive I actually met Jessica Smith

00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:52,980
she is the former director of business

00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:55,770
operations at Evernote and she in our

00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:58,980
101 she had confirmed that the biggest

00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:01,579
churn rate they're experiencing is from

00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:03,989
the position of a junior sales rep so

00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:04,769
what are businesses like Evernote doing

00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:07,260
about it

00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:10,740
businesses in the u.s. spend up to 20

00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:13,200
billion every year in total to train

00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,659
salespeople and that number is even 5

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,820
times higher when it comes to hiring new

00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:19,590
salespeople and that new hire then takes

00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:23,100
up to a full year to be fully productive

00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:25,140
so we can see recruiting and maintaining

00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:27,840
a sales team of a players because you

00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:31,200
don't want B players is incredibly hard

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,450
and very expensive the good news is

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,610
though that at the same time we can see

00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:38,970
another trend gartner predicts that by

00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:41,100
2020 85% of all interactions between

00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:45,299
businesses and customers will be without

00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:47,579
any humans involved machines can now

00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:52,200
actually understand natural human

00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:54,570
dialogue so finally after decades of AI

00:01:52,200 --> 00:02:00,000
promises it's finally happening

00:01:54,570 --> 00:02:02,520
happening so I really encourage you to

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,350
be part of that revolution and take

00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,909
advantage of all of its business

00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:08,640
opportunities and we've actually found

00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:10,289
that especially Millennials absolutely

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,630
embrace the fact that they can just talk

00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:15,270
to it through an AI be themselves and

00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:17,940
you know use their own lingo and can

00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:19,800
interact with businesses on their own

00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:25,350
time and without having to talk to a

00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:27,000
human and as I said there's a real

00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:29,160
business opportunity here because you

00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,140
can now actually reach your customer

00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:34,650
where they act what they already are on

00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:38,220
your website on their phones etc and

00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:39,930
because of that you can easily improve

00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,910
the engagement with that user because

00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:43,290
you absolutely decrease the cognitive

00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:45,120
load on their site they don't have to

00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:46,920
like read text and look at your website

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,410
and look for the answers they can just

00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:52,080
talk to you and ask for what they want

00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:54,120
to know and because you're now in

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,370
control of all interactions between the

00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:59,730
businesses and between your business and

00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:04,050
the end-user you can deliver a very

00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:06,690
consistent brand experience and once the

00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:09,330
AI is trained it works 24/7 no people

00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:11,580
problems no churn no turnover you can

00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:13,800
experience actually tremendous cost

00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:16,260
savings and all of that while being

00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:19,080
highly scalable because if you have one

00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:23,790
bot you can have many conversations at

00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:26,190
the same time and let me tell you about

00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:27,750
Matt Madison and gentleman over there

00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:32,220
I know his emoji look slightly more

00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:35,430
handsome so Matt and his two brothers

00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:37,950
founded a coding boot camp called codify

00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:40,440
Academy and they are doing great they

00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:43,470
had increasing their revenue bed by a 3x

00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:45,300
every year and the the secret sauce for

00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:46,709
them right at the beginning was that

00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:48,959
they would get back to any new lead

00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:51,050
within five minutes after they had left

00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,700
our contact information on a website

00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:55,260
last September though Matt eNOS two

00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,390
brothers were absolutely exhausted

00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:59,040
because of it and they just couldn't do

00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:01,800
any more calls and this is when he

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,930
contacted me and together we wanted to

00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:06,660
solve their three major pain points one

00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:08,340
is that no matter how hard they were

00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:09,990
working it was possibly it was

00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,610
impossible to get back to everyone in

00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:15,200
time because what happens it's Who I am

00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:17,280
in the morning right second

00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,140
they'd find themselves answering the

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:23,310
same questions over and over and over

00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:24,720
again and three the people the majority

00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:25,639
of the people they talked to didn't even

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,449
end up buying

00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:32,629
so it's an absolutely waste and this is

00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:35,360
when we created Bob Bob is say AI sales

00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:37,759
assistant he talks to all of the

00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,740
potential leads and tells us about

00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:43,099
codify Academy and answering all of

00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:45,139
their most basic questions he lives in a

00:04:43,099 --> 00:04:47,840
codified category website and all of

00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:50,389
their landing pages he lives in a little

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,800
chat box answering the visitors

00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:54,169
questions 24/7

00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:56,030
he also follows up via SMS immediately

00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:59,120
after new lead has left our contact

00:04:56,030 --> 00:05:01,580
information on the website and because

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,289
Bob is working 24/7 to only give to good

00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:06,680
leads to Matt he was able to increase

00:05:03,289 --> 00:05:08,389
the conversion rate by 4x leading to a

00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:11,150
10% increase of their annual revenue

00:05:08,389 --> 00:05:14,169
made by Bob within five months after we

00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:17,509
launched this it's absolutely incredible

00:05:14,169 --> 00:05:19,639
so we're actually currently working on

00:05:17,509 --> 00:05:21,680
integrating Bob a little bit more into

00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:24,080
codifies processes so not only for top

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,330
final sales but also for in-person

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:29,479
meeting follow-ups for referrals for

00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:31,069
even for customer off-boarding right so

00:05:29,479 --> 00:05:32,930
everything that's repetitive can be

00:05:31,069 --> 00:05:39,289
automated and that's what we're using

00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:41,270
pop for but why am I here today um Bob

00:05:39,289 --> 00:05:43,300
is built using no chests otherwise we

00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:48,469
wouldn't be here together in this room

00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:51,110
and we're using IBM bluemix and of

00:05:48,469 --> 00:05:54,139
course Cloud Foundry and the reason why

00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:55,789
we chose two technologies is well no js'

00:05:54,139 --> 00:05:57,560
because of its non-blocking feature we

00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:58,969
all know about that very important for

00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,740
an application like that because it can

00:05:58,969 --> 00:06:04,009
have many conversations at the same time

00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:05,449
and then we chose to go with Watson as

00:06:04,009 --> 00:06:07,400
our cognitive intelligence service

00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:08,930
provider because I mean who didn't fall

00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,580
in love with Watson a couple years ago

00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:13,279
when they deputed on TV

00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:16,219
winning jeopardy hello come on in I

00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:18,080
actually met bill Jose who was the guy

00:06:16,219 --> 00:06:20,210
who lost against Watson on TV and even

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:23,449
he loves Watson and he's very interested

00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:25,580
in what we're doing with that and then

00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:27,710
for all the fun part like managing

00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:30,229
hosting and operating our application we

00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:32,120
chose to stick with bluemix and Cloud

00:06:30,229 --> 00:06:34,789
Foundry because for me it was really

00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:36,720
really easy to deploy our application in

00:06:34,789 --> 00:06:38,400
in setting in

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,990
Ekans I didn't have to worry about any

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,460
infrastructure settings and this I want

00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:44,570
to I think I pitched it to Matt he's a

00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:49,290
business guy as like the iOS of all the

00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:53,700
platform as a service techs and so I was

00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:57,030
able to to build a fully automated

00:06:53,700 --> 00:07:01,590
pipeline without any experience in

00:06:57,030 --> 00:07:05,280
DevOps and also frankly I do not have

00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:07,980
like have to worry about how to operate

00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,390
and set up a web server because when you

00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:10,920
build a startup there's only three

00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:12,990
things to care about is you want to

00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:14,880
iterate fast means you have short

00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:17,250
development cycles with an increase in

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,690
workload for application and because you

00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:20,610
want to be fast and you very simple

00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:22,620
processes and one of these processes and

00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:25,200
is running in deploying application

00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:26,970
right and then also all you do should be

00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:32,160
scalable because that's the point of

00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:35,160
being a start-up I think a fun story

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:37,770
here is also that Facebook used to have

00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,780
this motto that says move fast and break

00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:42,060
things and right after the APO they just

00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:45,150
switched it to move fast with stable

00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:47,160
infrastructure and I told Matt if we

00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:48,360
stick with bluemix and Cloud Foundry we

00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,620
can already have some save

00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,470
infrastructure we don't have to wait for

00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:56,729
our IPO so for us this is just a very

00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:59,340
ideal development ecosystem let's look

00:07:56,729 --> 00:08:02,550
at our design no quick so we are a very

00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:04,200
thin web based client we're fully

00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:08,280
connected to server all the time the

00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:11,630
local processing of course we also are

00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:14,130
connected to a to Google's firebase

00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:15,960
we're using the firebase because it's a

00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:19,260
real-time firebase it's very easy to use

00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:20,820
can be set up in seconds and this is

00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:25,140
where we store all of our conversations

00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:27,690
um we are pretty communication with the

00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:29,220
server we needed a WebSocket because we

00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:30,750
are a chat application right so we need

00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:32,940
some real-time bi-directional

00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:34,860
communication and for that we're using a

00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:37,409
very popular JavaScript library called

00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:38,460
socket IO I'm talking today it comes it

00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:39,659
comes in two parts

00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:42,780
you can have a client-side JavaScript

00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:44,250
library or a more server-side no J's

00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,390
library and of course we went with a lot

00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:47,430
of one

00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:50,820
we're using soccer today alongside

00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:52,920
Express that's a very common combo I'd

00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:56,490
say and it works because soccer today Oh

00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:58,080
doesn't work with HTTP requests its

00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:00,930
event based and so we can still use

00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:03,660
Express to distribute our initial client

00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:06,329
script and what I mean by client script

00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:09,140
is our client setting script is that

00:09:06,329 --> 00:09:11,550
every of our clients like codify Academy

00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:12,660
or customers you want to say they have

00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:14,990
their own settings they have their own

00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:17,459
login credential we need for them to

00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:21,000
authenticate with third-party services

00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:22,320
like our Ben Watson and the firebase we

00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,490
also have different settings like the

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,320
name of the bar they have all different

00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:27,570
pictures they might using different

00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,670
colors etc so as soon as the user

00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:32,430
decides to communicate with one of our

00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:34,769
BOTS through our two user facing

00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:38,910
components which is the web browser or

00:09:34,769 --> 00:09:43,140
VSM as an airphone we authenticated user

00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:47,100
and we create a room for them that's how

00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:49,170
we call them so let's look at how it

00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:52,529
works from question to answer on a very

00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:54,060
high level bird's-eye view that's me on

00:09:52,529 --> 00:09:56,459
the top left corner so I usually wear a

00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:59,970
beanie that's my version of business

00:09:56,459 --> 00:10:01,890
formal and I'm asking the number one

00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:03,750
question that every user is asking in

00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:06,480
every conversation no matter what the

00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:08,040
product is how much is it and as soon as

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,930
that's happening our app communicates

00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,490
with Watson and we tell what's it hey

00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:14,940
this is the question and then Watson

00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:16,529
starts its magic and Watson is using

00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:19,860
Katrina training data that we've been

00:10:16,529 --> 00:10:21,779
feeding it before to kind of determine

00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:24,270
what the what kind of question user is

00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:30,089
asking and it sends us back an array

00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:32,550
with different causes and they're up to

00:10:30,089 --> 00:10:35,790
ten I think we're working with five of

00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:37,020
them and they all come back with the

00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:38,610
cost and then what's called the

00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:41,730
confidence level in the confidence level

00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:44,820
is from 0 to 1 or 0 to 100% whatever you

00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:46,980
want and the better your bot is trained

00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:48,660
the more likely you have that your top

00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,070
number one cause also comes back with a

00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:53,070
hundred percent confidence settled so

00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:54,690
for example for how much is it Bob

00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:56,190
currently knows three hundred more than

00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:59,000
three hundred different ways to ask for

00:10:56,190 --> 00:11:01,880
the price so I'm pretty sure we would

00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,250
get back that like the top number one

00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:06,110
cause with a hundred percent confidence

00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:09,110
level and this label is internally

00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:13,000
called total cost and then I take this

00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:15,710
label and connect with our Google

00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,420
database because from there I retrieve

00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:18,980
the actual human readable answer because

00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:20,960
your user doesn't want to get an answer

00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:23,600
back total cost right they want to like

00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:25,970
actually have information and so we use

00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,190
this label as a key and retrieve the

00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:31,520
actual human readable answer and then

00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:34,100
send it back to user so it's not a

00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:38,330
rocket science it really isn't and the

00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:39,710
key takeaway from here is the

00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:41,150
integration with IBM Watson as a

00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:44,270
cognitive and tanjit service provider

00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:48,470
and I will quickly show you how this

00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:51,980
call to Watson works and that's actually

00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:53,600
snippets of our code we ran OJ's project

00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:56,120
so in your app chase all you have to do

00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:59,180
is requiring Watson alongside all of

00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:01,970
your other NPM packages and then also of

00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:04,130
course giving what's and all of the

00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:06,140
credentials for that specific specific

00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:09,710
client so we have a we have a file

00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:12,730
called room that j/s then you can see

00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:14,810
that UPS and what's an object down there

00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:16,910
you tell what some what kind of service

00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:20,120
you want to use in our case it's the

00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:22,010
natural language classifier you get a

00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:23,510
username and a password so all of our

00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:25,580
clients get their own service wrapper

00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:28,760
and you get their your own username

00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:31,220
password and then you need something

00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:34,850
that's called a classifier ID and your

00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:38,210
classifier get something it's kind of

00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:40,670
like a references to a specific snapshot

00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:42,320
or a brain part of Watson right so if I

00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:44,240
talk to Watson I have to tell okay used

00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,970
to sati and this is like the bucket that

00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,830
I want to retrieve the answer from and

00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:51,320
this classifier ID also updates every

00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:52,730
time after you've trained it so this is

00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,230
also something it's important when you

00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:56,600
start out and you build out your

00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:58,580
application in everything's manual make

00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,750
sure you update that new class authority

00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:01,220
every time after you're trained it

00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:06,080
otherwise you will refer to old

00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:08,320
knowledge and then

00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:11,240
easy peasy we created new Watson

00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:15,920
instance using all of our client

00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:18,529
settings we write it to a instance and

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:21,410
then on there we call an ell class of

00:13:18,529 --> 00:13:23,990
hard to classify parts in the pair

00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:25,730
parameters the parameters here again is

00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:27,260
the class of parody so I tell what's in

00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:29,839
okay please use the city in this bucket

00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:33,410
of your brain the text in this case is

00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:35,029
the question and then define what you

00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:38,149
want to do as soon as you get back all

00:13:35,029 --> 00:13:40,250
of these replies in our case we do a

00:13:38,149 --> 00:13:42,260
little bit of logic around has this

00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:46,120
question already asked before do I want

00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:48,560
to give a slightly different answer how

00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:50,329
how is the distribution of the

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:53,570
confidence level so as I said you get

00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:56,180
back up to ten different labels with

00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:57,740
different confidence levels and if all

00:13:56,180 --> 00:14:01,339
of the confidence levels are kind of

00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:02,839
like you know below let's say 70% and

00:14:01,339 --> 00:14:06,019
all of the confidence levels are like

00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:08,420
70% others like 30% 20% you already know

00:14:06,019 --> 00:14:10,130
that the bot is not really sure what to

00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:12,649
answer so you either can ask a more

00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:14,860
clarifying question or you decide to for

00:14:12,649 --> 00:14:17,779
example go with the within I don't know

00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:21,560
right so that would all happen in your

00:14:17,779 --> 00:14:23,600
callback function it's been rather

00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:25,010
technical or not technical I'm still not

00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,770
sure what that hacking a level of the

00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:30,110
audience is so I invite you all to go to

00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:32,180
codify academy.com and actually talked

00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:34,760
about so this is your opportunity to

00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:38,779
grab your phone without me feeling like

00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:40,779
you don't pay attention so if you want

00:14:38,779 --> 00:14:42,890
to do that like we can also actually

00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:55,940
maybe we can drop then we can do this

00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:57,709
here a little quick let's see the types

00:14:55,940 --> 00:15:01,250
are codified website and if you decide

00:14:57,709 --> 00:15:03,079
you want to talk to pop you can find the

00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:04,670
chatroom here so obviously or you have

00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:08,209
talked to him before so that's what we

00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:13,690
store in our room - yes I can see okay

00:15:08,209 --> 00:15:13,690
tell me about code the thigh

00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:23,990
- so a lot of information and I was like

00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:34,850
okay cool that's interesting so how much

00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:39,200
is it alright awesome

00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:41,270
so after and this is actually a

00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:44,990
conversation that Matt used to have all

00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:47,500
the time and from our analytics we can

00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:47,500
see that

00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,310
you

00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:10,650
until a call with one of the codify

00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:13,980
Academy salespeople and also if you see

00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:16,230
some of the answers you could say that I

00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:19,160
mean kill all humans it has quite a bit

00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:22,530
of sassiness and personality to it and

00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:24,840
we did that on purpose because we find

00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:26,430
that any emotional reaction be it

00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:29,130
positive or negative is something that

00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:31,560
we want to have because it's just

00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:34,830
absolutely incredible that people talked

00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:36,480
about like a human and they know it's

00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:38,310
about and it's just a few lines of code

00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,580
and if there's one piece of advice I

00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:43,830
want to share is make sure your body has

00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:47,100
some kind of human life personality I

00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:49,590
can I live in a house that's actually

00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:51,120
good XM I live in a house in with 50

00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:53,190
other people and haight-ashbury and in

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,780
San Francisco we're all quite you know

00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:56,220
techy and cornered so we're good cool or

00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,750
anything so we have all the devices

00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,820
right so we have an OK Google and we

00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:01,560
have an Alexa at home

00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:03,420
so I kick okay Google is in our kitchen

00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,160
Alexa's in the upstairs living room and

00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:06,390
you can just tell just because okay

00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:09,210
Google doesn't really have a name but

00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:10,860
Alexa has how differently you interact

00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:12,870
with the both devices so with OK Google

00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:14,580
for us it's just an extension of their

00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:16,200
search bars but they want that so we

00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:19,950
kind of like yell at it it's like okay

00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:22,080
Google Play brunch music and or get even

00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:24,240
we get very angry if it doesn't get our

00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:26,490
request right where's with Alexa you can

00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:30,180
tell like we're like hey Alexa would you

00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:34,260
mind buying the new Apple home pod but

00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:35,970
um so just make sure to use a name that

00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:37,410
people all can remember and give it a

00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:37,920
personality and people will interact

00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:40,160
with it

00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,160
way more

00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:56,460
go back into the presentation and giving

00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:58,230
it the personality is what I called the

00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:59,580
first of four building blocks so this is

00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:00,690
basically your to-do list if you want to

00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,550
walk out here today and know how to

00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:06,600
build a sales rap this is exactly what

00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:08,400
you have to do step no one is creating

00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:11,100
the scope so being very clear about not

00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,440
only personality but also watch it my

00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:17,700
bots know like what are the questions

00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:20,430
that I that I want him or her to answer

00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:23,270
so if you already have an internal FAQ

00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:25,650
or if you have a you know customers

00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:27,750
support chat or you have some emails

00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:30,510
that you can reference great the more

00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:31,860
questions you can feed your Watson or

00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:34,740
whatever service whether you want to use

00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:36,990
the batter and not only talking about

00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:40,980
unique question but also different

00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:43,800
variants of the same question after

00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:47,820
you've done this you creates what's

00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:50,940
called a training CSV and that file

00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:53,340
contains the question the labels laid

00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:56,210
out how for example Watson wants meets

00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:58,590
it in order for for it to be trained

00:18:56,210 --> 00:19:01,080
then in the second step you create a

00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:03,480
reply database because something you

00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:05,280
have to somehow make all these room in

00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:07,110
visual applies accessible for your bot

00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,660
when we first started out we didn't even

00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:12,540
have a database we just had a JSON file

00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:15,570
in our application and fold it into

00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:17,100
there cannot recommend it so I would

00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:18,630
started with what an actual there was

00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:20,280
right from the get-go so after you've

00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:21,420
done that all you have to do is train

00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:24,540
the brain

00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:26,610
you either can use Watson's interface

00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:28,260
they have a web interface for that or

00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:32,820
you can just use their node SDK and do

00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:35,610
it right from your application it says

00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:37,440
that after you train the bot you get

00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:39,510
back to a classifier ID and then use

00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,010
that classified e to actually build the

00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:44,790
rest of the application because you need

00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:46,470
the ID again to use their algorithms and

00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:47,850
with the rest of vacation I mean hey

00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:50,160
what's the user interface right do I

00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:51,720
want a web browser do I want the to

00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,510
communicate we have Facebook they wanted

00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:56,000
to communicate we as mess

00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:58,159
and also make sure you build a second

00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,799
database to store all of your

00:19:58,159 --> 00:20:03,110
conversations because you want to read

00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:04,580
what your Bob or your Bob your bot is

00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:08,090
talking about right especially at the

00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:10,730
beginning and that brings us to point

00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:13,730
number four which is tracking the

00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:16,370
performance in building a dashboard and

00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:19,549
I cannot stress out enough how important

00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:21,380
it is to have an easy UI for your

00:20:19,549 --> 00:20:24,080
non-technical people to follow along

00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:26,929
what your thought is doing because you

00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:29,600
want to get your butt up to speed as

00:20:26,929 --> 00:20:31,429
soon as possible and so what we did we

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,080
you know asked our friends or we

00:20:31,429 --> 00:20:36,139
outsourced to other people to like

00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:37,789
really read through all of them all of

00:20:36,139 --> 00:20:40,250
the conversations and figuring out okay

00:20:37,789 --> 00:20:42,490
what our areas we need to to train in on

00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,490
more

00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:59,120
and that's us this is how our dashboard

00:20:56,450 --> 00:21:02,590
looks like for an example I don't know

00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,590
oh okay one second

00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:11,180
[Music]

00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:13,100
so you can see that we have a

00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:15,410
conversation we just use angler for that

00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:17,870
an angler material that took us like

00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:20,290
dare to do it sets us up so you can just

00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:22,790
follow along all of the conversations

00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:25,010
you can see what classifier has been

00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:27,380
used in what confidence it it came back

00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:29,030
and then on the left side down there you

00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:30,380
can see there is a part that's called

00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:33,050
training and this is where you can

00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:42,250
actually feed it the human readable

00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:44,780
replies back oh and this is for example

00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:47,120
this is the training father was talking

00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:48,860
about earlier very simple theory

00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,290
everyone can create it this is right

00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:55,700
this is how Watson for example gets us

00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:58,610
to to train to give the new answers to

00:21:55,700 --> 00:22:01,040
them so the in the quotas you see the

00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:02,870
question and then comma and then just

00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:05,090
the name off the label that you want

00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:11,300
Watson to know and give you abacus

00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:14,690
response also something that's not

00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:17,030
talked about a lot of times when it

00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:20,260
comes to chat BOTS and AI is how

00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:22,610
important the training is so four major

00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:24,530
best practices that I want to share with

00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:26,300
you that I want you to know is review

00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:28,850
the don't knows and a daily basis

00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:30,680
especially when you start out you also

00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:32,480
want to update the confidence threshold

00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:36,110
right so when you build out your first

00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:37,700
spot I call them baby box you want to

00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:39,440
have a very very high threshold so you

00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:42,170
don't want to go with an answer that the

00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:45,470
bot is suggesting that's like below 70%

00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:46,970
or even 80 or 90% whereas now for

00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:48,920
example with Bob that's a very mature

00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:51,920
bot we have a confidence level of

00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:53,240
confidence threshold of 0.01 or

00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:55,250
something like that because even the

00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:56,600
answer that comes back with 25% still

00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:59,540
kind of fits because the base is just

00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:03,290
way higher right so you want to update a

00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:04,940
confidence level over time and of course

00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:08,570
you want to automate

00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:10,730
a lot of your training and do it in

00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:13,970
consistent training cycle we do it

00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:16,640
once a week now for all of our BOTS and

00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:20,660
so the major takeaway also from the

00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:22,520
session for you is have an easy training

00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:24,800
guide to put in new data to track the

00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:26,750
performance so we are trekking kpi's

00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:29,870
like how many conversations did we have

00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:32,480
how many questions have been asked what

00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:34,100
our customers are actually ready to drop

00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,320
out right why what is the last question

00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:38,450
before they decide to drop out or what

00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,890
are things that customers are asking for

00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:41,780
did we are not offering yet right so

00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:44,210
having so running this data and having

00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:46,700
this and analysis ready it's incredibly

00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:49,130
valuable and that's why again it's very

00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:55,450
important to have this dashboard ready

00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:58,340
right from the get-go yeah and with Bob

00:23:55,450 --> 00:24:00,290
with Bob we've been extremely successful

00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:02,510
and we wanted to share that success with

00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:05,150
other businesses so if you have any more

00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:08,270
questions or if you want your own Bob

00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:10,450
working for you reach out to me we found

00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:16,040
a new company called cyber industries

00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:19,410
and if you have any more questions this

00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:26,849
is very can reach me at thank you

00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:26,849
[Applause]

00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:36,570
I was just wondering for the training

00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:38,220
yeah how often is it like you know you

00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:39,780
review one of the conversations and just

00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:41,460
wish that like one or two of the

00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:46,170
questions was a little bit different

00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:48,900
how often so yeah yeah well at the

00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:50,240
beginning was a lot more so I think it

00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:52,800
takes up

00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:55,470
it took Bob I think to be fully

00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:56,910
productive about eight weeks it really

00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:58,170
depends on how many conversations do you

00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:59,940
have so you shouldn't launch about

00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:02,340
without having at least like a hundred

00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:04,500
to 200 conversations and how you can do

00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:06,360
that is when you first launch a bot you

00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,980
want us in the sandbox and you send a

00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,570
thing to your friends or to you know

00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:10,980
people in oDesk and it just have a very

00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:15,560
basic conversation and then you can

00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:15,560
train it on that and the questions yeah

00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:33,600
yeah we have about we have about a

00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:36,030
hundred for codify Academy yeah yes yes

00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,680
because we only we do we do both things

00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:40,200
we have the inbound side we have the web

00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:42,480
chat on our of our landing pages and on

00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:44,310
our website but we also do the outbound

00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,140
as soon as we get their contact

00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:52,200
information on any you know at their

00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:54,180
side and whatever itself yeah yeah so I

00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:57,750
have three questions I would ask one by

00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:59,910
one yes the first question is that how

00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:01,920
do you really define a success of a

00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:04,880
conversation that's a good question um

00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:07,410
it's up to you so for us it's we have a

00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,120
we have Aflac in our training dashboard

00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:11,370
and I wish I could have shown you done

00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:13,170
um training dashboard that it's called

00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:15,150
excellent and so we actually give only

00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:16,950
this excellent story when he gets all of

00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:18,710
the kind of the answers right and it

00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:21,270
happens more than 90 percent right now

00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:23,400
and what's the average time spent in

00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:26,160
conversations like 15 you measure the

00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:27,600
metrics you mean how many questions been

00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:30,860
asking you know how much is the

00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:33,840
engagement time per user to the bot so

00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:35,670
hmm we don't measure the time but we

00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,470
measure how many questions to use are

00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:39,750
asking using you're asking four to six

00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:41,309
questions so the outcome of four to six

00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:43,830
questions that get an output

00:26:41,309 --> 00:26:45,210
looking for yeah because that's and

00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:48,090
that's exactly pointed I'm making is

00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:50,490
that especially for top final sales like

00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:52,320
you can almost predict what your users

00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:53,850
are going to ask about like that's why

00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:56,249
you have your FAQ right it's like

00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:57,809
frequently asked question that come over

00:26:56,249 --> 00:26:59,490
and over and over again which also made

00:26:57,809 --> 00:27:00,179
you know Matt's job so painful in the

00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:03,149
first place

00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:05,460
last question who designs the questions

00:27:03,149 --> 00:27:08,309
so there is a new concept called

00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:11,039
conversational you are so in your team

00:27:08,309 --> 00:27:13,049
who's a designated person who keeps

00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:15,899
design it's a question we retake them

00:27:13,049 --> 00:27:17,460
from users so every time we create asked

00:27:15,899 --> 00:27:19,860
a question it's not in our database it

00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:22,139
we add it there is that what your domain

00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:24,480
designed active replies no design the

00:27:22,139 --> 00:27:27,389
questions initially right which path

00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,980
this will go yeah so you have some

00:27:27,389 --> 00:27:34,649
assumptions people allow this question

00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:38,009
yeah we don't do we don't do path right

00:27:34,649 --> 00:27:39,960
now so because this is so that the path

00:27:38,009 --> 00:27:41,820
we're doing for the deep a little bit

00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:44,460
deeper integrations now that we have but

00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:46,259
for the first like top final sales when

00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:48,480
you user lands in a website I can assure

00:27:46,259 --> 00:27:58,019
you nine out of ten times there would be

00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:59,700
what do you do and how much is it if you

00:27:58,019 --> 00:28:02,940
can come back to the slide with

00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:04,619
architecture and operate a bit I believe

00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:06,990
it is not as a kind of initial

00:28:04,619 --> 00:28:10,259
architecture but the final for the

00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:13,230
moment if you can this one yeah yeah

00:28:10,259 --> 00:28:18,720
what was initial and why you choose this

00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:20,129
current that's the first one yes look

00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,740
that was said that was the first thing

00:28:20,129 --> 00:28:24,720
we did so that's I'm when you're a

00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:27,330
startup like you only work with you know

00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:29,129
what's new and inaccessible and all of

00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:31,740
these technologies are so for example

00:28:29,129 --> 00:28:34,049
Watson was very easy to use with bluemix

00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:36,809
because they're already integrated again

00:28:34,049 --> 00:28:40,230
google firebase database is something

00:28:36,809 --> 00:28:42,360
bad because my skills and in back-end

00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:43,769
are very limited is something that I'm

00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:46,230
very thankful for because I'm able to

00:28:43,769 --> 00:28:48,090
host and manage database without a lot

00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:51,389
of knowledge of its lure just like

00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:52,649
another API that you can use and socket

00:28:51,389 --> 00:28:53,700
area or Express again it's a very

00:28:52,649 --> 00:28:59,160
popular come

00:28:53,700 --> 00:29:01,340
that works very well so one last

00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,340
question

00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:11,010
all these BOTS right yeah if you ask

00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:13,230
some question and the answer is not

00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:14,640
satisfactory we tend to ask it in a

00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:16,590
different way we try to avoid any

00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,750
different but I've seen sometimes it'll

00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:21,210
still give back the same answer so in

00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:23,310
such kind of patterns do you does the

00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:24,990
robot think oh there's a bot thing go

00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:26,580
I'm giving the same answer again and

00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:29,040
again maybe this guy wants something

00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:32,340
else yeah so that's why we actually

00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:34,110
prevent giving the same answer so it's

00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:35,730
like what part of the the logic that

00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:37,320
goes behind when we get back to replies

00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:39,120
we like compare of the user has been

00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:41,760
asking or if we have been giving that

00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:43,980
same the same again and then we often

00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,450
depends on what the distribution of the

00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:48,300
confidence level is we tend to give the

00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:50,910
second cause for example so yeah good

00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:51,910
question okay thank you very much

00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:56,450
