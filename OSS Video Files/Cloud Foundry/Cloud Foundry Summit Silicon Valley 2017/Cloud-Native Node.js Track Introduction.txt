good morning everyone thank you for

00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:07,980
coming to the club Native nodejs track

00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:10,710
I'm Dave income from the IBM program

00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,509
manager for node and I'll be your emcee

00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:15,240
for the next couple of days which means

00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:17,270
I get to basically let all the hard work

00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:21,449
be done by others through your speakers

00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:23,279
so it's a pretty good gig actually and

00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:24,900
so without further ado I'd like to

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,430
basically turn things over to Michael

00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,529
Dawson who's one of our lead development

00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:30,330
managers in IBM for node who's going to

00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:32,250
basically give an overview of the

00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,790
two-day session and speakers thank you

00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,670
David

00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:38,489
so thank you all for coming to the

00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:39,930
node.js track and I have the pleasure to

00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:42,680
be able to sort of give you a bit of a

00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:42,680
welcome and one

00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:50,410
you

00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:02,010
and figured out how to pull it down to

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,720
the 13 submissions that of 13 talks are

00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:05,250
you're gonna see today I think you're

00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:07,500
gonna really appreciate the content

00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:09,150
that's it follows a nice theme and they

00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,030
did a good job pulling out all that

00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:14,040
together in addition to that we have the

00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:16,290
pleasure of having Mark Hinkel who's the

00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,780
new executive director for the node.js

00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:21,540
Foundation we heard from the Cloud

00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,920
Foundry summit Cloud Foundry executive

00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,920
director yesterday and you know we'll

00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,990
get to hear today right after I finished

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,240
talking from our new director and his

00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:32,670
views of nodejs and the foundation going

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,080
forward which is great and we also have

00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:37,649
a good panel tomorrow where we have

00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:39,350
Tracy Hines and Michael Rogers from the

00:01:37,649 --> 00:01:41,670
foundation as well as Trevor Livingston

00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:43,350
to talk to us about their view of the

00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:46,350
state of no js' I think we'll all find

00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:47,729
that pretty interesting as well it's

00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:50,190
really a good time to be talking about

00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:51,720
nodejs it's still you know if you're

00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:54,210
involved in node at all you know it's

00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,320
really a growing ecosystem and actually

00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:57,060
at this point I'm curious you know how

00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,460
many of you guys are already developers

00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,590
who are using nodejs a show of hands

00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:03,180
great and how many of you are you know

00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:04,530
people you say using Java but our

00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:07,530
interest to find out a little bit more

00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:09,209
about what's going on in this area okay

00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:10,860
that's good I think you'll find that you

00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:13,079
know the the talks that have something

00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,820
for everybody so if you're new there's

00:02:13,079 --> 00:02:16,650
some good good information about how to

00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:18,570
get into using node with Cloud Foundry

00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:20,160
and if you already know know there's

00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:21,870
some you know some nice deep technical

00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,150
talks to let you learn some new things

00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:26,489
as I said it's a great time you know the

00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:28,410
nodejs ecosystem is still really going

00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:30,750
and in a great way if you look at things

00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:33,090
like the module ecosystem there's over

00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:35,940
400,000 modules out there is by far the

00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:38,220
largest module ecosystem by something

00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:39,780
like two or three times and if you look

00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,790
at the red line that's the growth rate

00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,380
so it's also growing at a much larger

00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:45,870
rate than a lot of the other runtimes

00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:47,670
and languages it's also going in terms

00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:49,260
of contributions I think we've had like

00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:50,640
about a hundred percent growth rate year

00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,230
after year in terms of people are

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,440
getting involved in contributing to no

00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:57,780
js' so it's a really nice and vibrant

00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,799
ecosystem and I have the privilege to

00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,840
talk to you a little bit more about

00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:02,890
things that we're doing in the community

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,660
on that front later on in the

00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:09,040
the other thing that's happened recently

00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:11,440
is no version eight came out if you're

00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,690
familiar with nodes release schedule we

00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,130
have an LTS release schedule and so

00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:17,080
every six months we have a new current

00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:19,180
the interesting thing about node version

00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,250
eight is that it is going to become the

00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:24,580
next LTS which happens every alternate

00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:26,350
current in October so although it's not

00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:28,390
necessarily recommended for production

00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:29,800
yet it's something you should be trying

00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:31,810
out and testing because when it does go

00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,830
to LTS in October is something that

00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:36,070
you're gonna want to consider how you

00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:37,660
move up to it has a number of you know

00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:39,310
new interesting technology and features

00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:41,800
of course like any other release it has

00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:43,390
a new version of the eight it brings NPM

00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,670
five which is supposed to have a lot of

00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:48,100
new improvements it has one of my

00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:50,860
favorites the N API which is a new API

00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:52,810
for writing native native modules as

00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:57,040
well as things like a new debugger

00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:58,360
protocol standardized URL parsing if

00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,980
you're interested in two promises

00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,870
there's util promise Phi which is the

00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:04,600
first step towards making it easier to

00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:07,090
use the node API is with promises as

00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:09,250
well as tracing and async hooks to sort

00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:11,080
of round out things in terms of like new

00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:13,810
ways and new features and technology to

00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:16,239
help supporting and operate your your

00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:17,650
instances and really you know it the

00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:19,930
reason we're talking about it here is

00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:22,390
because no js' is really one of the key

00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:24,430
cloud native runtimes from the data that

00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:27,220
we have in our cloud and bluemix you

00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:30,340
know nodejs is you know the largest use

00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:32,440
run tons of the key ones why are we here

00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:34,120
is IBM sponsoring this track we're

00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,510
really iBM is involved in all sorts of

00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,919
different things in the node community

00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:40,900
we really think that open source is the

00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:42,460
way to go you know our development model

00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:45,430
is if we need something for our internal

00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:46,690
products customers we want to do that

00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:48,430
development out in the community and

00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:50,530
then bring those things back inside so

00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:52,360
we're involved all you know through all

00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:54,940
the different things where platinum

00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:57,430
sponsor in the foundation we have a

00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:58,990
large number of contributors we have

00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:00,520
nine contributors right now as well as

00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:02,169
other people who have actually you know

00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,229
added commits and stuff like that and

00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:07,030
you'll see that we work through the

00:05:04,229 --> 00:05:08,979
things like you know core core

00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:11,169
functionality we work in the groups that

00:05:08,979 --> 00:05:12,640
do the releases all the different

00:05:11,169 --> 00:05:12,879
working groups working on things that

00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,499
are

00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:18,879
you know of interest to enterprise

00:05:14,499 --> 00:05:20,169
customers and and supporting your

00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:21,219
application so that's something you know

00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:23,529
I'll talk to you a little bit later in

00:05:21,219 --> 00:05:25,270
the talk that I have later on today we

00:05:23,529 --> 00:05:28,839
also have products that bundle in nodejs

00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:31,479
and we actually provide an internal SSD

00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:33,339
k distribution of nodes so just to say

00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:35,529
that you know we're no js' is very

00:05:33,339 --> 00:05:38,069
important to us and you know that's why

00:05:35,529 --> 00:05:38,069
we're here today

00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:46,000
you

00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:56,870
Nutan ojs or new to Cloud Foundry it's

00:05:55,669 --> 00:05:58,729
something that's going to help you get

00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:01,729
an on-ramp to using those two those two

00:05:58,729 --> 00:06:03,560
together we then start to talk about

00:06:01,729 --> 00:06:05,240
there's a couple talks that are related

00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:07,039
to using micro services micro services

00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,380
are one of the the key use cases for no

00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:11,479
DTS and these talks are about either

00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:14,030
sort of deconstructing your monolith

00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:17,360
into micro services or building up micro

00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:18,229
services from scratch we then have my

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,060
talk where I'm going to talk a little

00:06:18,229 --> 00:06:22,370
bit more about what's going on in the

00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:24,830
the community and the things that we're

00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:27,139
working on to remove obstacles for

00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:29,509
getting on to the the path to you know

00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:31,220
making a digital transformation I'm

00:06:29,509 --> 00:06:36,590
following that we have some interesting

00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:39,460
talks on integrating IOT and cognitive

00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:41,270
services artificial intelligence with

00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:43,280
nodejs and Cloud Foundry

00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:46,759
another really good place where no joins

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:49,070
and finally we end up today with a talk

00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:54,500
on being able to rapidly prototype some

00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:56,000
API is using loopback tomorrow we start

00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:58,789
to move into things where we're talking

00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,169
about you know using nodejs and Cloud

00:06:58,789 --> 00:07:03,110
Foundry together how would you monitor

00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:05,240
that particular thing we then have a

00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:06,889
panel that we'll talk about or we'll

00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,690
have you know the people's views on the

00:07:06,889 --> 00:07:10,070
state of no GS and an opportunity for

00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:13,759
some of you guys to ask questions as

00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:16,190
well we then move into a couple talks

00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,650
that focus on deployment so deploying

00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:20,630
node with kubernetes or being able to

00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:22,880
set up a pipeline that helps you do your

00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:24,620
deployments and then we finish off the

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,539
overall day with a couple talks about

00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:28,580
tools that might be useful in terms of

00:07:26,539 --> 00:07:31,250
you know maintaining or building your

00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:32,509
applications so I think you know

00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,520
everybody will find something in the

00:07:32,509 --> 00:07:38,349
talks that we have and without further

00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:38,349
