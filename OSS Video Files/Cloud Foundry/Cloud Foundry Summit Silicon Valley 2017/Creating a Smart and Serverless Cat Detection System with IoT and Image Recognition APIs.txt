Title: Creating a Smart and Serverless Cat Detection System with IoT and Image Recognition APIs
Publication date: 2017-06-22
Playlist: Cloud Foundry Summit Silicon Valley 2017
Description: 
	Creating a Smart and Serverless Cat Detection System with IoT and Image Recognition APIs - Linda Nichols, Emerging Technology Advisors    

Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be the difference between applications that just perform tasks and applications that seem truly intelligent and intuitive to humans. With cloud platforms like IBM Bluemix and Amazon Web Services, AI is as accessible as ever to developers through provided and hosted APIs. These cloud platforms also allow simplify the process of using AI with other powerful cloud services such as IoT, big data, messaging, and serverless functions. 

Hardware systems are unique in that they are able to collect real-time data from their environments with various sensors. These systems can become even more powerful and perceptive when this data can be rapidly analyzed with machine learning models. A basic detection system will send an alert when it detects any kind of motion near the sensor, but an intelligent system “knows” what the detected object is. Using image recognition, it can classify the moving object as human and even make a trained guess at what emotion that human was feeling at the moment it was detected.

In this talk, Linda Nichols will describe how a real-life use-case (pets jumping on the kitchen counters) evolved from a simple motion detector to an intelligent and inexpensive cat detection system. Using IBM Watson IoT Platform and Node.js, she was able to connect a Raspberry Pi with IBM Bluemix OpenWhisk functions and IBM Watson image recognition APIs. She will demonstrate how her system can quickly and reliably notify owners when it detects a cat, but ignore other categories of moving objects. She will also discuss how she was able to reduce the complexity of the system architecture and the amount of static code stored on the Raspberry Pi by using “serverless” IBM Bluemix OpenWhisk functions.

all right awesome all right well I'm

00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:09,719
here to talk about my smart serverless

00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:11,340
cat detection system now's your time to

00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:16,100
leave if you don't want to hear about

00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:20,910
cat detection systems your last chance

00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:23,369
alright so this is me Linda Nichols I am

00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:25,619
at Lynn Alou all over the internet

00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:26,840
github Twitter or Twitter's the best way

00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:33,300
to reach me

00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:36,090
Gmail so I work at merging technology

00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:38,969
advisors or consulting firm outside of

00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:40,800
DC and it's the greatest place to work I

00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:42,210
love my co-workers I'm not just saying

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,550
this because it's being recorded but I

00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:48,469
do actually like them a whole lot just

00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:51,270
like JavaScript and of course cats I

00:00:48,469 --> 00:00:53,399
also love the community and I do a lot

00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:56,640
in my community in Norfolk Virginia so I

00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:59,879
run the Norfolk Jas JavaScript user

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,770
group node bot stay Norfolk that will be

00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:03,960
at the end of July node bot stay as an

00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:07,920
international event so there may be one

00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:09,360
in your city we also love revolution

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,580
Kampf which just happened at the

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,320
beginning of June I was one of the

00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:16,500
primary organizers of that that was a

00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:18,060
really great time and I have a lot of

00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,759
empathy for the organizers of this

00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,939
conference now and I try to really be a

00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:25,979
low maintenance speaker for that reason

00:01:22,939 --> 00:01:28,110
also you know penguins

00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:31,650
yay Stanley Cup I would throw that in

00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:36,600
there all right so let's get back to cat

00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:40,320
detection systems so why did I make a

00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,820
cat detection system and if you have

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,549
cats you'll know it's because they're

00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:46,500
jerks and when you're sleeping at night

00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:49,920
they're doing all kinds of things and

00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:52,140
you may need to know if that thing that

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,759
was broken was your cat or significant

00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:57,869
other or your child it was probably your

00:01:53,759 --> 00:02:01,290
cat so I made a system that when a cat

00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:03,780
is detected it will text me but not just

00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:07,549
anything has to be cat because it's

00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:11,330
smart and serverless like I said before

00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:12,440
so this is the cat detection system

00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:14,420
which you can't really see that well

00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,860
from here and I don't really want to pop

00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:18,489
it open because that's really tempting

00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:21,830
fate on the demo that I wanted to later

00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:24,920
but there is a Raspberry Pi inside of

00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:27,349
here and a camera I've got a picture of

00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:29,360
this coming up to this little globe here

00:02:27,349 --> 00:02:30,980
is a PIR sensor if you're not familiar

00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,140
but basically this is the motion

00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:35,660
detector and then the camera there's a

00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:37,220
little hole right here that for the

00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:41,239
camera so basically it detects motion

00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:42,950
immediately takes a picture and inside

00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:43,459
there's some lead wires for a power

00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:45,170
source

00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:46,400
I mean I've been using like these little

00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:49,099
cool things I get free at tech

00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,140
conferences this is great so I don't

00:02:49,099 --> 00:02:53,480
plug anything into the wall I just use

00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:56,299
these things and these batteries are

00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:58,940
getting bigger and a lot cheaper so yeah

00:02:56,299 --> 00:03:02,090
this is what the inside looks like so

00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:05,000
you can trust me that it's in here and

00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:06,980
I'm using a PI but I've also done

00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,780
something similar with the tehsil since

00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:10,910
I'm using note J s but really any

00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:14,389
internet-connected device you can do

00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:16,970
something similar and so since the PI in

00:03:14,389 --> 00:03:20,239
here is just like a little computer I'm

00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:22,190
running nodejs on the PI I'm running and

00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:25,190
then I have johnny-five and the Watson

00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:28,430
IOT SDK running on node I'm going to get

00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:31,010
to johnny-five in a second but the IOT

00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:35,989
SDK is what allows the PI to send

00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:38,510
messages to the IOT platform so yeah

00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:38,989
there's johnny-five but also this is

00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:44,510
johnny-five

00:03:38,989 --> 00:03:47,720
so so johnny-five actually running on

00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:50,870
node allows my pi to be able to access

00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:53,750
my PIR sensor and my camera so with that

00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:56,030
i'm using the raspberry pi io to be able

00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:58,730
to to access those two it really doesn't

00:03:56,030 --> 00:04:00,709
have anything to do with reaching the

00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:04,040
IOT platform it's just to access the

00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:05,680
other hardware that's in here does

00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:10,099
anyone in here use johnny-five

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:12,530
familiar with 25 yeah it's very cool if

00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:15,440
you're looking to do anything in node

00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:16,790
robotics look at their their

00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:19,250
documentation they also have some of the

00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:20,389
best documentation of maybe any node

00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:24,469
module

00:04:20,389 --> 00:04:27,409
in a great community okay so what's I o

00:04:24,469 --> 00:04:29,419
T platform so this is it so you have to

00:04:27,409 --> 00:04:34,639
read that whole message to understand

00:04:29,419 --> 00:04:37,879
what it is or not so yeah it's a pub sub

00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:40,669
system for devices this device publishes

00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:43,219
data other devices subscribe to that

00:04:40,669 --> 00:04:49,159
data and the devices never have to talk

00:04:43,219 --> 00:04:51,500
directly to one another so and when I

00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:54,199
say devices I have a little asterisk

00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:56,930
there because a device doesn't have to

00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:58,879
be this PI a device can also be my

00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:02,270
computer it's anything that can really

00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:03,979
push data up to this IOT platform and

00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:06,379
like I said here too I mean it can

00:05:03,979 --> 00:05:08,870
support billions of devices so I could

00:05:06,379 --> 00:05:10,659
have cat detectors all over the world

00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:13,610
they're all connected to IOT platform

00:05:10,659 --> 00:05:16,370
it's totally cool with that it does not

00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:17,990
affect performance at all it's extremely

00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:21,800
powerful and each one of those devices

00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:24,680
are sending trillions of messages so

00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:26,750
yeah that's a lot it's a lot of cat

00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:31,610
detection and it's a lot of cats doing

00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:33,830
bad things so the device when the the PI

00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:36,589
connects to IOT platform it's sending

00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:39,580
those devices in this mqtt format it's a

00:05:36,589 --> 00:05:42,620
super lightweight message queue format

00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:47,779
and it's very very fast and it's very

00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:50,620
very secure also once it gets up once

00:05:47,779 --> 00:05:54,469
the data gets up to the the IOT platform

00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:56,539
there's a rules engine that can then

00:05:54,469 --> 00:06:00,289
decide where it wants to route those

00:05:56,539 --> 00:06:02,360
messages that you sent so really my

00:06:00,289 --> 00:06:04,219
Raspberry Pi itself is not it does not

00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,990
have very much code on it at all the

00:06:04,219 --> 00:06:09,080
code that's on there just says hey

00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:12,379
something was detected upload that photo

00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:13,759
and send this data at IOT it doesn't do

00:06:12,379 --> 00:06:18,949
anything smart it doesn't do anything

00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:20,629
serverless it's just being a robot so

00:06:18,949 --> 00:06:23,810
this is a terrible terrible diagram so

00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:25,580
don't try to read this but this was sort

00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:28,699
of the best diagram I could find us to

00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:32,110
kinda show what it does with my device

00:06:28,699 --> 00:06:33,550
being on top in QT t being on the Rea

00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:35,530
the platform is in the middle and I'm

00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:38,830
kind of showing that once it gets into

00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:40,720
this device gateway and I have my rules

00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:43,830
firing that basically these detections

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:46,300
can go anywhere I can go to open wisk

00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:50,160
anywhere inside of bluemix once once I'm

00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:53,169
there or I can even do web hook and just

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,780
put in a URL to some sort of API have

00:06:53,169 --> 00:07:00,090
somewhere else so it's really powerful

00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:03,130
for using you know if you're already on

00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:05,620
IBM bluemix then this is a great way to

00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:10,840
tie an IOT device to an existing

00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:13,330
application so yeah I thought this was

00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:16,120
server lists and I just talked about a

00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:18,100
bunch of servers but that's because

00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:21,930
server list is like a made-up marketing

00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:26,460
term so I'm going to use it again here

00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:32,860
so so the server list part of my project

00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:35,020
is open whisk and it's the server list

00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:37,870
cloud platform but basically it allows

00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:39,430
you to write functions you store them in

00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:43,030
the cloud and then you're able to access

00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:46,660
them with events and so maybe that event

00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:50,620
is an API gateway maybe you hit an API

00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:52,720
maybe that event is you've as a database

00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:55,210
record maybe it's a file upload but it's

00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:59,050
many many events happening within

00:07:55,210 --> 00:08:01,900
bluemix can trigger these open Wis

00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:05,020
functions and they're very very tiny and

00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:07,840
and really I don't have to worry about

00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:10,960
any of the DevOps to create them I just

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:13,030
put my function in Open whisk and then I

00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,289
roll out and I'm okay I don't have to

00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:16,389
know anything about containers I don't

00:08:14,289 --> 00:08:17,979
have to know anything about like what it

00:08:16,389 --> 00:08:19,690
takes to host an application because

00:08:17,979 --> 00:08:20,740
it's just this tiny piece of code and I

00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:25,270
don't really want to bother with all

00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:27,160
that um and so it's very cheap too and

00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:30,099
so if you're making something like a cat

00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:32,890
detector I'm not this this cat detector

00:08:30,099 --> 00:08:33,940
is not being marketed okay so I kind of

00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:35,320
just looking for something super

00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:38,440
inexpensive for making these fun

00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:40,180
projects so I haven't paid anything for

00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:43,150
this yet and I've been testing this a

00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:44,980
whole lot because I'm demoing it in

00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:46,960
front of all of you people

00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:49,780
and I've paid nothing so it's great also

00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:51,220
like I mentioned before IOT platform is

00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:52,930
supporting these billions of cat

00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:54,370
detectors all over the world because of

00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:55,810
course everyone is seeing this project

00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:59,530
and it's like right now and they're all

00:08:55,810 --> 00:09:01,030
making one and hitting IOT platform but

00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:02,290
and they can hit the same open wisk

00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:03,910
function and it doesn't matter because

00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:06,760
super scalable I'm not worrying about

00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:09,130
the DevOps someone else who works at IBM

00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:10,870
who is awesome is like worrying about

00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:16,720
making sure that this function continues

00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:18,700
to work also I use nodejs I'm using

00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,190
node.js in this project but I don't have

00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:22,660
to I could use basically anything for

00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:26,200
this code that I'm storing an open whisk

00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:27,280
so open whisk is calling a few api's for

00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:30,520
me and it's doing like a little bit of

00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:32,410
work but if I want to use node or Swift

00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:35,230
I could just use it right out of the box

00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:38,350
just as it exists and in bluemix if I

00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:40,630
want to use something like COBOL I just

00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:42,610
I write my COBOL code that does the

00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:44,590
things I want to do and then I wrap it

00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:47,260
in a docker container and then I upload

00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:49,480
it and for right now - that's really

00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:52,300
powerful because you know there's other

00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:55,360
of course serverless offerings out there

00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:57,160
like lambda named is great - but I can't

00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,950
make my own container and upload it I

00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:02,080
have to depend on what already exists

00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:04,270
and if you work for a company that's not

00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,980
okay with black magic then you're going

00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:07,570
to need something that's open source and

00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:10,900
that you have a little bit of control

00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:12,580
over and yeah you can't actually run

00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:19,870
COBOL and open wisk it exists someone

00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:22,060
has done it yeah right okay so this is

00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:25,120
kind of what this is not my code for the

00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:27,220
cat detector my code is out there but

00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,930
I'm just I'm showing though this is a

00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:32,110
real module called cat names if you want

00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:34,450
a random name for your cat but this is

00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:37,750
how small and open whisk handler can be

00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:40,330
and I can create an API gateway within

00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:42,880
Open whisk and I don't have to like I

00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:44,620
don't have to make an Express server I

00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,810
don't to make a happy server I don't

00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:49,120
have to install node I have no like I

00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:50,830
know this is node 6 because I told open

00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,710
whisk I want to run out node 6 and

00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:55,990
that's that's kind of it

00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:57,170
so yeah feel free to copy this and run

00:10:55,990 --> 00:11:00,569
it

00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:04,110
all right so um all right so there's no

00:11:00,569 --> 00:11:05,279
server well there is a server but we're

00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:09,029
saying there's not a server because

00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:11,040
marketing it's okay that's cool so this

00:11:09,029 --> 00:11:13,019
is what makes it smart

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,360
my cat detector is smarter than Ken

00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:20,879
Jennings we know that because we we saw

00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:24,720
it on have it on Jeopardy so I'm using

00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:26,610
Watson vision recognition api's um it's

00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,259
they're very easy to use you can use

00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:29,910
them straight out of the box which is

00:11:28,259 --> 00:11:32,459
what I'm doing because I'm saying cat or

00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:35,100
no cat but I can't actually train my own

00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:37,290
module my own models if I want to I

00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,910
could train it to know only my cats and

00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:40,230
then I know which one of my cats is

00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:42,629
being the biggest jerk in the middle the

00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:45,389
night but for now we're okay with cat or

00:11:42,629 --> 00:11:47,370
no cat as we're saying cat or

00:11:45,389 --> 00:11:49,800
significant other who like who spilled

00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:53,639
the water on the on the counter it was

00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:57,110
probably a cat all right so this is what

00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:59,899
it looks like I take the motion detector

00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:03,360
fires off it takes a photo of the cat

00:11:59,899 --> 00:12:06,509
it's uploaded Watson then analyzes this

00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,850
image and this is what you get back

00:12:06,509 --> 00:12:10,259
which is which is Jason and we and it

00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:12,509
goes through like this one says it's a

00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:15,660
83% chance this is a domestic cat and

00:12:12,509 --> 00:12:17,790
and it's correct it's it's the cat and a

00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:20,670
feline the mammal and says what color it

00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:23,670
is out of the box you can get some

00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:25,559
really weird things back depending on

00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:27,959
the picture you upload because Watson is

00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:30,720
really good at determining the context

00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:32,249
of things so I may take a picture of my

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,689
cat and there's a little tiny tree in

00:12:32,249 --> 00:12:37,170
the background and I'll see you forests

00:12:33,689 --> 00:12:39,720
on here so that's pretty cool too but

00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:45,509
the way it's working now by an airy cat

00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:47,879
or no cat so so basically this summary I

00:12:45,509 --> 00:12:50,610
have a device the device sends messages

00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:52,529
to the IOT platform the IOT platform

00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:57,660
says I have received a device I've

00:12:52,529 --> 00:12:59,970
received a message I know that that has

00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:01,589
detected something but it does nothing

00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:03,600
to determine what that thing is

00:13:01,589 --> 00:13:04,949
it sends it you know and then it sends

00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,079
it over to open whisk and then open

00:13:04,949 --> 00:13:09,420
whisk then calls Watson and then it also

00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:14,130
calls Twilio to send me a

00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:17,280
next but only if it's kept okay so this

00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:20,190
is all of my code like every little

00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:22,020
project like this that I do I publish on

00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:24,480
the internet which i think is a good

00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:27,290
idea so far no one has really proven me

00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:30,540
wrong this is a bad idea

00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:33,750
so the yeah the top one is the actual

00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:36,330
code that I put on the Raspberry Pi and

00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:38,490
then the bottom is is my open with scat

00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:41,280
affections for calling Twilio and

00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:43,320
calling the the Watson api's I have to

00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:46,290
give a shout out to James Thomas from

00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:48,540
IBM who has helped me out with like a

00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:50,280
lot of questions and in weird errors and

00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:54,810
things that I've had in the process of

00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:59,820
porting this over so thanks to him all

00:13:54,810 --> 00:14:01,050
right and now it's the demo time so I'm

00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:03,870
gonna go ahead and plug this cat

00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:06,750
detector in I'm going to need help from

00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:11,100
someone in the audience so who would

00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:15,980
like to be a cat or no cat yeah okay I

00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:20,090
see a cat or no cat over there awesome

00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:20,090
all right know what that boot up

00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:32,120
I'm going to connect my phone to here

00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:34,850
and and I'm gonna really hope that my

00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:41,440
mom doesn't text me for the next few

00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:41,440
minutes this is dangerous

00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:58,350
that is extremely small

00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:21,980
all right so this is what the IOT

00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:25,730
platform looks like if you haven't seen

00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:27,500
it before it's it has these cards that

00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:29,320
you can set up that will give you some

00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:31,940
little a little bit of information about

00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:34,040
your devices so I can see the last

00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:37,160
message that I sent in I can see some

00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:42,080
information here about my actual device

00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:43,820
like what I called it the ID but we're

00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:45,290
going to worry about open wisk right now

00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:47,090
because this is going to have my logs

00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:54,500
you can see sort of my logs where I was

00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:59,120
kind of testing this before right you

00:15:54,500 --> 00:16:01,990
have this one over here yep increase the

00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,990
font on this one

00:16:08,439 --> 00:16:13,970
right now I'm gonna be a brave soul and

00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:23,540
connect my phone to the internet to be

00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:26,179
recorded all right there's my phone

00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:28,420
that's my cat he's the cutest cat in

00:16:26,179 --> 00:16:28,420
whole world

00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:44,430
I almost forgot my password

00:16:51,920 --> 00:17:00,350
so I've just got like a NPM shortcut

00:16:54,679 --> 00:17:02,389
here for the cat detector the fact I

00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:05,419
could SSH into it as a good is a good

00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:07,250
sign for the the demo gods all right I

00:17:05,419 --> 00:17:10,369
need my cat or no cat

00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:10,369
[Music]

00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,280
you

00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:26,920
like you have to okay there goes all

00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:30,460
right so it's detected like no cat

00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:31,900
so it's detected motion and it is has

00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:33,460
taken a photo and it's publishing an

00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:37,360
event but I'm not getting any text yet

00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:39,730
so there's no cat but now you're gonna

00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:43,600
get to be a cat actually to excuse to be

00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:45,010
two cats so for demo reasons maybe like

00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,330
try to put it about like a foot away

00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:51,180
from the camera and just kind of be

00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:51,180
still but yet move it occasionally oh

00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:56,730
yeah wait hold on

00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,510
you

00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:14,700
and then I have to reboot and then it's

00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:16,920
gonna take a minute does anyone have any

00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:19,160
questions while this is rebooting sorry

00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,160
cat

00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:31,070
I have five yeah

00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:42,810
just cats have I tried what's that no I

00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:45,930
have not detected a lion you know I mean

00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:50,250
you laugh but I do have a zoo near my

00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:52,890
house so yeah I mean I don't have to be

00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:55,890
like super close to detect it really

00:18:52,890 --> 00:19:00,080
maybe so I think that would kind of

00:18:55,890 --> 00:19:00,080
freak out the line keepers a little bit

00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:04,410
yeah I mean well so yeah I mean you say

00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:06,570
that

00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:10,550
I mean Watson duck can detect emotions

00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:10,550
but I think for just people right now I

00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:19,370
mean I love cats and I tend to agree

00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:19,370
with you

00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:40,850
right this time it's gonna be good

00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:43,310
all right

00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:45,080
normally this is pretty pretty instant

00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:46,580
it's still big enough but because it's

00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:51,980
running on a hot spot it takes a second

00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:55,550
to connect to the IOT platform alright

00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:58,580
so it is now connected to Watson and

00:19:55,550 --> 00:20:00,440
okay now you can now you can be be a cat

00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:05,480
yeah I just sort of like maybe move it

00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:07,040
slowly back and forth mmm maybe yeah

00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:18,050
no hoping this time maybe we triggered

00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:19,580
it so when I first was testing this out

00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,930
I tried I had this stuffed cat that

00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:23,060
looked a lot like a cat and I would like

00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:25,610
kind of dance it in front but Watson is

00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:28,340
actually too smart it was like toy and

00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:34,010
so but the these kittens will usually

00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:39,880
kind of will kind of trigger it maybe

00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:39,880
try try to go a little closer

00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:53,330
all right demo gods come on that would

00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:54,680
have been really cool if I was like oh

00:20:53,330 --> 00:21:05,120
you have - Meowth - that's it just

00:20:54,680 --> 00:21:07,550
kidding alright well my camera oh yes

00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:09,770
yes awesome just discovered the bill

00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:14,420
alright thank you and thank you to our

00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:18,170
cat alright so oh it actually detected

00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:20,450
it twice okay so let's go over here yeah

00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:25,130
my my camera overheated justice has

00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:29,470
worked so yay alright so let's see what

00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:29,470
our cat looked like

00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,640
all right so that was a picture it took

00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:51,039
of like blurry cats so we'll come over

00:21:47,049 --> 00:21:55,179
here to where we're monitoring our open

00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:57,760
whist function and just kept this one at

00:21:55,179 --> 00:22:01,149
4:05 should be our cat yes cat true

00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:09,880
alright so here let me bump this up so

00:22:01,149 --> 00:22:12,250
we can actually see it alright so we can

00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:15,399
kind of see here from these cats that it

00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:18,639
classified them as a kitty cat 71% so we

00:22:15,399 --> 00:22:20,080
know this was definitely a cat but

00:22:18,639 --> 00:22:22,210
unfortunately you can see the flaw in

00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:24,070
the system is that my significant other

00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:26,019
could be holding a photo of a cat in

00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:28,529
front of his face knock something off

00:22:26,019 --> 00:22:28,529
the counter

00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,620
you

00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:44,020
oh maybe it was a rabbit but but overall

00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:49,330
it did what it was supposed to do it's

00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:54,130
smart and that's really all I have but

00:22:49,330 --> 00:23:00,480
I've got some time for questions I think

00:22:54,130 --> 00:23:03,600
like appeared first yeah go ahead oh

00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:06,310
yeah whoever you get a to versafine

00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:08,050
mention your five kids what's accuracy

00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:10,960
of a correct cat yeah

00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:17,110
in the detection system and the correct

00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:19,090
name I just I'm not doing any percentage

00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:21,400
right now basically if cat exists in

00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:23,110
this list of of ten items then I say

00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:25,210
that's good like it doesn't have to be a

00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:27,010
certain percentage and I mean but I've

00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:29,970
been really finally choosing 10 items it

00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:29,970
really doesn't get below 50%

00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:40,070
Thanks what part of the system is doing

00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:42,380
the upload to s3 it's on the PI yeah

00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:45,980
yeah and actually I have a version of

00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:48,020
this that's going to object storage but

00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:50,150
it was like I was having some issue with

00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:56,350
it so for demo reasons I just kept us

00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:59,320
three any other questions

00:23:56,350 --> 00:24:04,660
okay thank you so much

00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:04,660
