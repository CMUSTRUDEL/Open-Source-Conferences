	Experiments and Extensions Track Introduction - Matt Cowger, Dell & Dr. Max, IBM    

Michael (aka dr.max)
IBM
Scientist, Architect, and Engineer
My name is Michael Maximilien, better known as max or dr.max, and I am a computer scientist with IBM. At IBM Research Triangle Park, I was a principal engineer for the worldwide industry point-of-sale standard: JavaPOS. At IBM Research, some highlights include pioneering research on semantic Web services, mashups, and cloud computing, and platform-as-a-service. I joined the IBM Cloud Labs in 2014 and work closely with Pivotal Inc., to help make the Cloud Found the best PaaS.

	00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,950
so we were late because we thought we

00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:07,309
were in the giant ballroom like the

00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:09,540
really huge one where the keynotes are

00:00:07,309 --> 00:00:13,889
that's not the case apparently these are

00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:18,199
not quite that popular obsessions my

00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:21,779
name is matt cowgirl max and I ran the

00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:24,300
selections for for this for this session

00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:25,830
and series of sessions I don't know if

00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:29,160
any of you know him he kind of just

00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:31,430
wandered up and says he's a doctor or

00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:36,090
something yeah

00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:38,520
all right so max as matt said sometimes

00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:43,770
I go by a doctor max but what's more

00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:45,840
important is that we Ren so the the set

00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,430
of presentations you're gonna see in

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,250
this session so what we want to do for

00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:53,070
five to ten minutes is to kind of give

00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:55,559
you an idea of how we did this because I

00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:58,559
think what's fair is to make sure that

00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:00,500
not only you understand the process but

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,969
of course you give us some feedback and

00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,979
I think a lot of you probably also

00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:07,170
submitted maybe some of you so

00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:10,080
understand maybe why yours wasn't

00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:15,060
selected or maybe why yours respected so

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:17,189
briefly so I was introduced to Matt some

00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,860
times last year

00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:22,710
I guess by the foundation and asking hey

00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:25,560
would you want to do this thing and I

00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:27,240
mean part of why you know sometimes I

00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,100
use dr. max as a surname is because I

00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:31,020
was in research right so being in

00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:34,610
research I spent a fair amount of time

00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:37,799
running conferences especially like

00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:40,890
academic conferences so I knew what I

00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:43,520
was getting involved in to kind of lead

00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:47,159
a track because I ran entire conferences

00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:50,159
one thing I wasn't ready for is the

00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:52,079
number of submissions so for this track

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,820
even though the woman's kind of sparse

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:59,040
and hopefully people will be walking in

00:01:53,820 --> 00:02:02,189
we had close to 300 submissions to 90

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,840
somewhere in there yeah and of course

00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:05,969
you know usually in an academic

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,429
conference I would have an entire

00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:10,590
program committee which you put together

00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:13,620
that would be like post 30 people to

00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:17,670
review wasn't the case here it

00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:20,909
was just the two of us pretty much so

00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:22,319
what we did is to kind of look at the of

00:02:20,909 --> 00:02:23,970
course you don't submit the entire paper

00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:27,510
or an entire presentation you should be

00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:29,360
done abstract so briefly what we did is

00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:33,829
we use Google spreadsheet and

00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:38,640
essentially reviewed every single

00:02:33,829 --> 00:02:41,010
submissions every single submission so

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:44,579
if you submitted something you must have

00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:46,590
gotten some score of our review but also

00:02:44,579 --> 00:02:49,109
some comment because one of us did

00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:51,209
comment on every single one so you think

00:02:49,109 --> 00:02:52,829
of 300 of course a lot of late nights

00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:55,829
especially towards the end because you

00:02:52,829 --> 00:02:57,420
know we have day jobs as well so that's

00:02:55,829 --> 00:02:59,879
kind of the process I don't know if you

00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:02,280
want to add anything to this to me I

00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:05,190
think that the the hardest part of the

00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:08,430
process are the most clear part of the

00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:10,620
process was that you know dr. max works

00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:11,760
for IBM I work for Dell and the most

00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,260
important thing that we can do is

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,959
remember that this is a community event

00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:18,750
and so the first thing that both of us

00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:22,470
did without even discussing it was to

00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:25,079
remove the submitter column because

00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:26,579
that's the the value is in the in what's

00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:28,109
being submitted and of course you know

00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:31,260
with enough time and in this part of the

00:03:28,109 --> 00:03:33,120
the industry you can probably figure out

00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:35,370
what some of these we're up some of

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,230
these people come from but the most

00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:38,430
important thing is that is is that we

00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:41,609
really focused on making sure that we

00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:43,919
were evaluating things based on what the

00:03:41,609 --> 00:03:46,940
abstract said and we really had no other

00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:52,650
in other information than the abstract

00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:53,879
so as a hint for the future if you were

00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:57,540
submitted and you didn't get selected

00:03:53,879 --> 00:04:00,540
I'm very very sorry if you submitted a

00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:02,639
minimal abstract that was a that was a

00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:05,910
tough thing to deal with okay so really

00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:09,560
good abstracts mean better chances yeah

00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:10,980
one more thing I'll mention about this

00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,799
anonymity

00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:15,780
I guess process that we tried to do is

00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:18,000
that sometimes just because I've worked

00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:23,669
with pretty much all parts of Cloud

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:26,849
Foundry I recognized a project in this

00:04:23,669 --> 00:04:27,620
case you can ask Matt I basically stayed

00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:30,740
out of it

00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:32,210
and of course I in collaboration with

00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:34,130
another colleague from IBM had a

00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:36,050
submission to and I stayed out of it so

00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:38,710
you can rest assured that we were not

00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:41,090
voting for ourselves or for how company

00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:43,760
so one more thing we want to do I guess

00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:45,710
yeah I think there's there's a whole ton

00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,750
of I think where do we have 12 or 16

00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:49,340
sessions that ended up making it through

00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:52,430
that's right I think that they are all

00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:53,650
really great sessions there was the

00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:56,060
number of sessions that were sort of

00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:58,160
above the bubble we eventually ended up

00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:01,580
stack ranking things and thinking what

00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,410
we could fit in that being said we all

00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:06,650
have our own interests and preferences

00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:09,050
and areas so to me that two sessions

00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:11,419
that I think are fascinating that I will

00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:14,690
definitely not be missing the first one

00:05:11,419 --> 00:05:16,220
is a discussion of service kinds of

00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:19,610
architectures functions and service kind

00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:21,910
of architectures within Cloud Foundry to

00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:23,930
me that is probably the single most

00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:26,510
interesting thing that is missing from

00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:27,940
the platform to me today so I'm really

00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:30,520
looking forward to that presentation

00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:35,330
bye-bye max and one of his colleagues

00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:39,919
yeah yeah and the other one is dynamic

00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:42,729
tracing that work being done having run

00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:45,260
a platform in the past a very large one

00:05:42,729 --> 00:05:46,669
dynamic tracing or tracing through an

00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:48,590
entire stack was effectively impossible

00:05:46,669 --> 00:05:53,900
for us so I'm looking forward to that

00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:56,810
one particularly as well cool so for me

00:05:53,900 --> 00:06:00,050
there's a couple sessions that I want to

00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:02,630
highlight that I think are super

00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:04,970
interesting so one is how many people

00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:08,630
here have looked or is looking into

00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:09,680
kubernetes yeah so it's kind of a hot

00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:14,180
topic these days

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:16,669
blasphemy so one of the cool thing

00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:18,950
that's happening this conference as you

00:06:16,669 --> 00:06:24,590
might have heard yesterday is that

00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:28,039
Google is helping out or joined as part

00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:29,930
of the cloud foundry organization and

00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:33,590
part of why they're joining is because

00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:35,900
they realize that you know kubernetes

00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:37,820
doesn't do de to operations and having

00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:40,520
spent a lot of time working with the

00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:41,510
Boche team I know what Bosch does very

00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,390
well so

00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:46,730
the Kubo project is sort of this let's

00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:49,310
take kubernetes let's Basha fie it and

00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:52,130
make it easy to deal with day two

00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:54,260
operations and I know a little bit about

00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:56,690
it partly because not only having

00:06:54,260 --> 00:07:00,200
reviewed it but also because they've

00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:03,470
submitted through the extension PMC

00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:05,150
which I lead and I got to spend quite a

00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:07,760
bit of time with them so I would say if

00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:10,850
you are interested in kubernetes this is

00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:14,960
definitely a very good one to spend some

00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:16,640
time I think probably that's the one I

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,560
would highlight too let's see if you

00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:20,930
guys have any questions otherwise we'll

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,530
start the sessions right I think that's

00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:23,530
