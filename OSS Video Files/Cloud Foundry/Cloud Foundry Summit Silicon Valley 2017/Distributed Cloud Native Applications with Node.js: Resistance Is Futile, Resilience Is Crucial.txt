Description: 
	Distributed Cloud Native Applications with Node.js: Resistance Is Futile, Resilience Is Crucial [I] - Hristo Iliev & Stoyan Rachev, SAP    

Building microservices using Node.js? Hristo and Stoyan stood up to this challenge and had some hard time while working on Abacus, an open source metering service. Join this session to learn from their experience with how to avoid their mistakes. 

The speakers will start by going through the pitfalls of microservices and distributed systems, including how you can troubleshoot and solve typical failures. Next, they will present our Node.js toolset including custom networking modules, Hystrix/Eureka/Turbine integration, and the Mozzle/Riemann/Influx/Grafana monitoring stack that help us build, debug, deploy, and monitor their application at scale on Cloud Foundry. Finally, they will outline how neural networks and the new container networking feature could help with operating such applications.

After attending this talk you will be ready to take a full advantage of these ideas and tools to build scalable and resilient applications.
