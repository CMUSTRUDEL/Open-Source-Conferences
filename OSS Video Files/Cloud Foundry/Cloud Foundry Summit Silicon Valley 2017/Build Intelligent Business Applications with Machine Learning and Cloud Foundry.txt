	00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:05,670
so good afternoon welcome everybody to

00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:07,410
this session my name is Margaret laughs

00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:09,750
and I'm a business development director

00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:11,490
for machine learning with sa P so my

00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:14,070
day-to-day job is talking to our

00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:15,839
customers around our strategy what it is

00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,520
that we're doing in machine learning the

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,230
solutions that we have coming to market

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,689
and of course the value that we're

00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,220
adding here to our customers now because

00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:25,619
I know this is a technical conference

00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:27,779
and the technical audience my I'm gonna

00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:31,800
be joined today by taejun if you want to

00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:34,020
stand up and say hi and taejun and I are

00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,370
gonna tag-team today I'm gonna cover the

00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,020
business side and talk around the

00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,309
business value that we have with machine

00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,320
learning and what we can do with this

00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:41,910
and taejun is going to talk about the

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,460
technical parts so how we're leveraging

00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:45,870
cloud foundry in the applications that

00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,870
we're developing and all that good stuff

00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:50,670
and we'll talk a bit about the API

00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:52,559
business hub and if you missed the

00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:54,750
session two of our colleagues here and

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,940
shout out to them and did a session

00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:59,100
previous to this around the API business

00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,930
hub and how you can leverage that that's

00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,940
going to be useful to know because our

00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:05,070
machine learning functional services are

00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,930
available through that but as I get

00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:09,869
started and as we start to jump into

00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:11,369
this hands up who's familiar with what s

00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:16,170
AP is doing with machine learning

00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:19,979
currently okay they're all the S AP

00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:21,150
hands if you're not part of s AP hands

00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:23,939
up if you're familiar with their

00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:26,130
strategy and with what we're doing okay

00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:28,549
that gives me a wonderful opportunity to

00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:31,650
then get started on this slide so

00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:34,740
yesterday if you were here we had a

00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:36,659
Burin Gergely who's the CTO for sa P he

00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:38,280
was giving the keynote and what he was

00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:41,159
talking about during that of course is

00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,140
digital transformation and how this how

00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:45,899
our customers are looking to us to help

00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:48,720
them enable digital eyes across their

00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:50,579
enterprises so how do they connect all

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,229
the different you know people things and

00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:54,270
processes it says that they're in the

00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:57,270
site and of course what are the

00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:58,439
different components parts of this so

00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:00,659
one of the things we know when we're

00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:03,630
talking to our customers is that this is

00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:05,969
quite complex for them and this is very

00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:07,799
challenging and hard to do the other

00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:10,110
that's on one side on the other side as

00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:12,420
well as if you have you know a resource

00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,340
budget or a strategy budget and you're

00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,690
looking at innovate

00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,530
of course you want to make sure that

00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:17,510
you're doing the right type of

00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:20,000
innovation because innovation can be

00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:21,560
very costly to implement and innovation

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,480
can be costly as well in terms of

00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:26,330
stakeholder engagement and getting folks

00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:28,400
on board so with Si P we can bring this

00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:30,920
together across digital transformation

00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,170
we brought out si P Leonardo which we

00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,640
launched back in May during sapphire

00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:37,010
which is our leading sales conference

00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,799
and what this is is a collection of

00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:41,330
technologies as you can see here and

00:02:39,799 --> 00:02:42,950
what we're doing is helping our

00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:45,349
customers across their value chain

00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:46,940
either help on the business process side

00:02:45,349 --> 00:02:49,489
or help them innovate in many different

00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:51,079
areas so the intelligent part here of

00:02:49,489 --> 00:02:55,579
course is the machine learning part so

00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:57,470
I'll jump into that next ok so in terms

00:02:55,579 --> 00:02:59,239
of how we apply it as well to the

00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:01,819
enterprise I mean we're all familiar

00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:04,069
today with machine learning on the

00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:05,420
consumer space so you know I'm looking

00:03:04,069 --> 00:03:06,980
around I know everybody's got their

00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:09,230
iPhones they're looking at your Google

00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:11,690
Maps you're getting up the time for

00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:13,790
traffic we've got you know while home

00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:16,489
pod just announced there is Alexa so

00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:18,350
there's many different types of tools

00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:20,750
that we can use to help us on the

00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:22,850
consumer side but now on the enterprise

00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:25,190
state side we're seeing machine learning

00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:26,840
really enter this space and of course

00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:28,310
there's three things that are enabling

00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,590
all of that and they do this on the

00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:33,230
consumer side too but of course we know

00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:36,260
that our infrastructure is better than

00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:38,630
it's ever been before so leveraging GPUs

00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:41,239
and folks like Nvidia who do great

00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:43,700
things in this area certainly helped us

00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:45,410
take the power in the capacity from what

00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:47,389
we have in terms of the Big Data and

00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:49,010
what's available out there in the masses

00:03:47,389 --> 00:03:51,680
of data that we're getting either to our

00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:53,389
sensors with IOT or we're looking at our

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,190
business networks or across different

00:03:53,389 --> 00:03:58,849
landscapes and how we bring this

00:03:55,190 --> 00:04:00,669
together and of course sorry this is

00:03:58,849 --> 00:04:04,940
where I should learn to take a pause

00:04:00,669 --> 00:04:06,440
before we continue but the third part

00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:08,329
here that we're looking at as well our

00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:10,220
deep learning algorithms so we know that

00:04:08,329 --> 00:04:12,139
these are far more sophisticated than

00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:14,299
they've ever been before and there's

00:04:12,139 --> 00:04:16,430
great companies out there doing super

00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:18,370
things in this space the other part I

00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:20,930
would say and certainly for us when

00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:23,750
AUSA's sa P when we're working with our

00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:25,550
customers they want us to help them

00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:26,630
generate deeper insights into either

00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:28,880
their existing bit

00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:32,060
business models are help them on their

00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:34,550
future roadmaps as well so certainly for

00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:37,160
an enterprise perspective we definitely

00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:39,230
see that machine learning we're in the

00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:41,390
right environment for a machine learning

00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:44,720
to thrive and start to build and develop

00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:46,490
out from here so with that and and when

00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,160
we talk about si P and we think about us

00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:51,980
as a company I mean we're across 25

00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:55,850
different industries we've over 12lbs so

00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:57,860
the breadth and depth of experience I

00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:59,710
would say that we bring to the market

00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:03,080
here and understanding our customers

00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:05,780
business processes really sets us up in

00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:08,600
terms of understanding the value that we

00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:10,880
can add to them so I talked earlier here

00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,560
about this in the sense of when we think

00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,360
about what we're doing in terms of our

00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,120
strategy and our roadmap and approach

00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:19,100
we're looking at two things one we're

00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,720
looking at business processes and where

00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:23,420
we can automate like highly

00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,010
transactional activities and help our

00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:26,960
customers you know manage that

00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:29,530
differently and of course that leads to

00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:32,930
things like increased revenue or less

00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:34,700
total we drive down the TCO and it

00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:36,800
changes up as well what people are doing

00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:39,530
in their work that's on the one side on

00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:42,650
the seconds hand if you think about this

00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:44,120
we can leverage Leonardo so what we were

00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:46,640
talking about earlier in terms of the

00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:48,410
digital transformation view and we can

00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:50,960
leverage Leonardo in order to help our

00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:52,490
customers productize our develop our

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,050
innovate in many different parts of

00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:55,640
their business leveraging the

00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:58,790
information that we're getting across

00:05:55,640 --> 00:06:01,520
that value chain that was presented so

00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:03,920
taking all of these different parts how

00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,630
you can consume machine learning and as

00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:08,390
I said will start to get over into the

00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:10,670
more technical part of this shortly but

00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:12,620
the foundation for it all from si P is

00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:14,300
of course the si P cloud platform and

00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:15,740
there's many of my colleagues who are

00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,750
here in the room that can help answer

00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:19,970
some questions on that as well if we

00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:21,560
want to spend some time in it but from

00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:23,570
the cloud platform there's a few

00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,850
different things you can do you can

00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:28,370
leverage we have business services so we

00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:31,580
are enabling part of our product

00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:33,110
portfolio with intelligent applications

00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:35,180
and we're making them more intelligent

00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:36,740
as such so there are products that we

00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:39,350
are bringing to market that will have

00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:40,490
intelligence intelligent capabilities so

00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:43,070
machine learning within

00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:45,620
so that's one thing there the second

00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:47,710
part is functional services so this is

00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:51,260
where you could leverage like image

00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:53,750
detection text tabular things like this

00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:55,880
in order to develop applications that

00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:58,460
you want so that's where you see the top

00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:00,680
part as well so we have you can build as

00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:02,420
a partner or customer you can build your

00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:05,210
own machine learning applications

00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:07,070
leveraging our functional services via

00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:09,740
the API business hub that you guys

00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:12,080
talked about earlier as well so in

00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:14,570
essence that's some part of how you can

00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:17,060
like consume machine learning with SA P

00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:18,860
we have the lifecycle management hub

00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:21,560
here so what we're bringing to market on

00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:23,300
this side as well is that trained and

00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,980
developed machine learning models and

00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:26,960
algorithms that you can also leverage

00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:29,450
with your business depending on what it

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,400
is that you want to do so for those of

00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:32,840
you who are starting to you know who are

00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,340
familiar with machine learning are

00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,350
you're implementing this in your

00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:38,420
business are this is an area where you

00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:40,880
want to develop of course you know with

00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:43,280
machine learning it starts off the first

00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,410
question you ask is what is it that you

00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,300
want to do and when you've established

00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:48,740
what it is that you want to do you can

00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,960
work backwards then in terms of

00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:57,230
understanding the best way to build that

00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:59,090
out and to to drive your business so so

00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:02,150
here's another picture that gives a

00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:04,400
sense of the breadth and scope that sa

00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:06,050
piece developing in this area and what

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,780
we're bringing to market and of course

00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:11,450
you can see how across your entire value

00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:13,010
chain you can leverage machine learning

00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:15,740
and it can do many different things for

00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:17,960
you as well so that's a sense of some

00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:19,370
part of where we're going and then here

00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,900
in this slide as well we have a number

00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:23,270
of solutions that we've brought to

00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:25,040
market that work in both the back office

00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:27,710
and of course the front office as well

00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:29,150
so we've many different customer stories

00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:31,130
and typically if this was a longer

00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:32,990
session for me I talked a lot about our

00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:34,970
pocs and what we've been learning with

00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:37,340
our customers as we've brought and

00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:40,220
developed and brought this to market but

00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:42,080
I know that my time is a bit short and I

00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:43,490
have to hand it over to taejun but

00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,770
before I do that are there any questions

00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:48,770
right now in the sense from the business

00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:50,270
side or the approach that you may have

00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:53,770
in terms of thinking about machine

00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:53,770
learning for your organization

00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:06,390
yeah it's so think about Leonardo as a

00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:10,080
portfolio of technologies just go back

00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:11,850
one slide okay so Leonardo it's a

00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,740
portfolio of technologies and that's

00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:16,050
that you can leverage them in different

00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:17,670
ways or you know one perfect example I

00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:19,950
had a customer talking just recently

00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:22,260
where they've like 50,000 sensors on the

00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:23,700
field it's an oil and gas company they

00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:26,040
want to know how they can apply machine

00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:27,780
learning in order to enable different

00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:30,750
insights from that information that

00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:32,580
they're gathering how familiar are

00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:36,660
people with machine learning the topic

00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:38,940
itself in the technology okay so a

00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:40,380
variety of hands and I guess it's

00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:42,210
certainly a trend in area so we know

00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:44,790
people are getting far more interested

00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:46,710
in it a few other things I'd say that

00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:49,050
machine learning then as well as there's

00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:51,030
no one-size-fits-all there's many

00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:52,710
different types of machine learning and

00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:54,930
we're leveraging different technologies

00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:56,880
in order to build out the capabilities

00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:58,980
that you want to do so there's a

00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,840
different slice and dice involved with

00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:02,340
all of those as well so I guess you know

00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,960
this is some of what we've been learning

00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:07,580
as well as we've been building out these

00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:07,580
solutions and bringing them to market

00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:15,960
sales and service so one of the use

00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:18,750
cases that we were looking on here was

00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:21,150
all around the sales cycle in terms of

00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:24,270
getting ahead all qualifying your leads

00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:25,920
and the next level of sales potential

00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:27,840
sales opportunities that you would have

00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,610
but it drives it a bit deeper into

00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:31,770
understanding and connecting through the

00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:33,870
omni-channel engagement and digital

00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:35,670
footprint of the customers in terms of

00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:37,140
bringing more intelligence to

00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:39,000
understanding the direction that they're

00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:40,860
going in and potential opportunities

00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,230
that they're looking at so you can build

00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:44,670
out you know specific am pains to target

00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:46,970
that or have your sales team work with

00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,970
them differently

00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:57,950
I'd have to look back at some of what we

00:10:56,330 --> 00:11:00,200
have already because I know we did it a

00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:04,370
short while ago but I can I can get that

00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:06,140
information so I will move it over to

00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:09,140
taejun who I know is going to talk more

00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:12,830
around the technology as well but and

00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:14,660
how they're developing this within our

00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:27,290
Innovation Center Network group so

00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:30,590
taejun hi I'm Kevin and I'm working at

00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:33,140
the city as a data scientist so today

00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:35,840
before going into my presentation I

00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:41,630
would like to ask how many of you have

00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:44,060
heard of deep learning yeah so I I know

00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:46,940
like Tim learning is the hottest hottest

00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:49,040
topic in even in motion learning area

00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:52,520
and a lot of research institutes are

00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:54,980
doing research on Tim learning so let's

00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:58,330
look into how we can use Tim learning in

00:11:54,980 --> 00:12:00,770
an application so there are three major

00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:05,180
areas where we can use machine learning

00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:08,450
a team learning especially so for first

00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:09,830
of all is a speech recognition and the

00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:13,870
second is natural language processing

00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:19,190
and the third is computer vision so for

00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:21,980
example for each area is like I believe

00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:25,130
you guys are familiar with Siri so

00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:27,710
series using atom learning technique for

00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:30,770
speech recognition and echo is also

00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:33,290
using amateurs echoes who use a team

00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:37,190
learning technique and google translator

00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:38,650
or a lot of Chapas on the on online are

00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:42,320
all using natural language processing

00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:44,630
using team learning and also a

00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:47,240
self-driving car or like face

00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:51,280
recognition they are all using dim

00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:51,280
learning for computer vision technology

00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:58,280
so let's look into their data format and

00:12:55,310 --> 00:13:01,550
they're required computational power so

00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:04,880
for speech recognition the input data

00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:05,420
format is our voice and the voice can be

00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:09,500
written

00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:12,080
in 1 dimensional array so compared to

00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:15,020
other data set the data side is pretty

00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:17,660
small like and when you look into their

00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:21,590
benchmark data set is like 60 MB

00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:24,890
megabytes and for natural language

00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:27,980
processing the text data itself is

00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:30,560
pretty small however when you feed those

00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:33,710
data into dim learning model you should

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:37,400
change each word into facto

00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:42,530
representation so for example here like

00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:46,700
wait for the video each word will be

00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:47,150
like 200 or 300 length array like

00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:51,940
floating

00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:54,740
if 32 bit or 32 bit floating array so

00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:58,940
one sentence will be two dimensional

00:13:54,740 --> 00:14:02,420
array and and when you look into like

00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:06,080
those benchmark data set is like 1gb so

00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:10,340
which is like 110 times 100 times bigger

00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:12,590
than for with data and for computer

00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:17,900
vision part the data set is much much

00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:22,460
huge so for complete for computer vision

00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:27,110
the input data is image or video so for

00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:30,740
image usually is three-dimensional array

00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:34,190
and this size or size of array itself is

00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:42,010
much bigger than this sentence or text

00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:45,260
array so one picture is usually like 5th

00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:49,700
500 kilobytes and the benchmark data set

00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:54,530
is like 200 GB so so for when we look

00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:56,900
into the computational requirement there

00:14:54,530 --> 00:15:01,060
are a lot of speech recognition

00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:03,710
companies which using just using CPU for

00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:08,930
speech recognition because the data set

00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:13,820
is small so there's a we don't nationals

00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:17,370
necessarily use GPU for natural language

00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:22,400
processing is highly recommended to use

00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:25,260
GPU because based on my experience a

00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:28,230
current window when comparing the

00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:32,220
performance of current GPU with eight

00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:35,820
core cpu GPU is like ten times faster

00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:38,220
than eight court CPU and for computer

00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:43,290
vision we definitely need to use

00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:47,790
computer GPU because usually current GPU

00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:51,140
is hundred times faster than CPU so if

00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:54,720
you provide like real-time application

00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:57,779
even though we use GPU if we use very

00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:00,060
very like complicated architecture like

00:15:57,779 --> 00:16:02,580
newer architecture model then it takes

00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:06,300
like one seconds or hundreds of

00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:08,400
milliseconds if you use CPU like it

00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:11,400
takes more than one minute to process

00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:14,510
just one request like considering there

00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:17,640
like like tens of like hundreds of

00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:20,400
requests will comes in in one second so

00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:24,290
we definitely need to use multiple GPU

00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:31,500
to him to create a good application so

00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:35,660
inside s ap we developed it a computer

00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:39,089
vision application so as I said before

00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:42,180
we definitely need to use GPU for

00:16:39,089 --> 00:16:45,510
computer vision application I know that

00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:49,560
currently cloud foundry does not provide

00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:53,100
GPU device however we can easily

00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:57,750
integrate external GPU with cloud

00:16:53,100 --> 00:17:00,839
foundry application so inside s ap we

00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:03,720
have s AP motion learning platform where

00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:06,900
as a data scientist I can train my model

00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:10,410
and also deploy my model and make it as

00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:13,429
a service so after making this motion

00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:17,309
learning service we can integrate with

00:17:13,429 --> 00:17:20,010
application in cloud foundry for other

00:17:17,309 --> 00:17:23,520
cloud platform the reason that I mention

00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:26,429
is I also try like some commercial

00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:30,850
application cloud platform which provide

00:17:26,429 --> 00:17:34,000
GPU such as AWS or Google called the

00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:37,720
or if I worked very well with Cloud

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:40,360
Foundry application so and for other

00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:44,230
parts I believe you guys already know we

00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:48,640
can leverage a lot of services which are

00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:51,900
provided at Cloud Foundry so let's look

00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:56,080
into a little more detail on our

00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:59,470
application so for machine learning

00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:03,909
especially dim learning application

00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:09,100
I think scalability is very important so

00:18:03,909 --> 00:18:12,580
we we adopted like queueing system and

00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:16,090
working worker application in cloud

00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:20,020
foundry to handle machine learning jobs

00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:23,169
in parallel so this worker application

00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:27,159
is very easy to scale up like we can

00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:30,250
just scale up to hundred or 200 in very

00:18:27,159 --> 00:18:33,880
short moment so all the input data will

00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:36,940
be accumulated in queue and then workers

00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:43,990
gonna like cap capture one jobs one by

00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:47,559
one and then put those require requested

00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:51,850
to external GPU machine through REST API

00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:55,240
or RPC and and another important part

00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:58,559
here is we should have security module

00:18:55,240 --> 00:19:01,539
because if there is no security mo

00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:04,630
security module then like other

00:19:01,539 --> 00:19:06,429
application can easily access our like

00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:08,490
dim learning model without any

00:19:06,429 --> 00:19:13,809
authentication so there should be

00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:17,919
whenever work % job to external GPU they

00:19:13,809 --> 00:19:20,440
should use security module and and

00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:24,880
currently we are also looking for like

00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:27,520
other architecture as well so we are you

00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,440
guys I like after session have any

00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:33,760
advice then you're welcome to what

00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:39,840
subject yeah this is pretty much for my

00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:39,840
side and I want to I think we can

00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:51,480
so we can move it into to QA now I guess

00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:53,460
one of the things that taejun and i

00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:55,950
wanted to say here as well was that i

00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:58,020
mean this is just like a little like

00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:59,550
baby toe into the water here a

00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:02,340
machine-learning we could do an entire

00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:03,450
track on this today in terms of looking

00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:05,760
at the challenges and opportunities

00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:07,620
across the business in terms of where

00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,570
you can apply machine learning but also

00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:11,430
then looking at how you can innovate and

00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:13,440
how you leverage different types of

00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:15,600
functional services or computer vision

00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,700
in order to help you do different things

00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:21,000
as per like retail use cases or what

00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:23,220
have you so as I said it's just a kind

00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,200
of a baby toe into the water so are

00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:27,660
there any specific questions that folks

00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,370
have for us are our areas that you want

00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:32,940
to explore with just the time that we

00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:41,550
have left here okay I see a hand over

00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:43,500
there yeah so and that actually came up

00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:45,720
in the previous presentation as well in

00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:48,330
terms of how you can do that so we have

00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:51,450
broad open trends re translation

00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:54,300
services to opensap courses so today you

00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:56,490
can access an opensap course and if

00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:57,900
English is not your primary language or

00:20:56,490 --> 00:21:00,360
you want to have it in another one it

00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:02,550
can translate automatically for you so

00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:04,440
we've developed that through some of our

00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:07,170
product itself but it's also available

00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:09,120
as I understand in the API business hub

00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:10,800
so it's available there is a service if

00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:15,240
you want to leverage it yourself for

00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:17,370
your business technical perspective like

00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,150
Google like all the like

00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:20,700
state-of-the-art

00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:26,670
translator or using a team learning

00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:28,980
model there are no more questions oh

00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:30,330
there's another one here normally we

00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:32,160
always have hands up there's so many

00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:35,480
things to talk about for machine

00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,480
learning it's such a great topic

00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:58,130
yes so yeah we have to recall that as a

00:21:54,770 --> 00:22:02,600
like Delta training so whenever like new

00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:05,450
customer or like new like whenever we

00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:09,590
have to update our model we can leverage

00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:12,320
existing model and we can train retrain

00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:15,830
our models in very short time like just

00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:21,830
changing some part of network yeah so

00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:24,590
and I think like like yeah we providers

00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:31,730
are like machine learning platform so

00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:33,169
yeah there any other questions or is

00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:35,360
there anybody working on a machine

00:22:33,169 --> 00:22:36,950
learning problem project now that they

00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:42,919
want to share or kind of say some of

00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:46,309
their experience through that I think

00:22:42,919 --> 00:22:53,240
we've got a shy group are not enough

00:22:46,309 --> 00:22:55,490
coffee right well we're we're pretty

00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:59,090
good here in terms of as I said this was

00:22:55,490 --> 00:23:01,520
a very brief overview I mean if there's

00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:03,140
anything specific we want you want to

00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,120
talk about afterwards were like Paige

00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:06,980
and I are here I'm if you have any

00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,020
further questions or want to explore the

00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:10,909
topic a bit further but as I said this

00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:12,620
is just like a baby tiptoe into the

00:23:10,909 --> 00:23:14,030
water there's so much to the topic

00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:16,100
there's so much in terms of what

00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:18,260
customers are looking for and one of the

00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:20,919
other items that we you know areas to

00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:23,330
think here and why it's important at a

00:23:20,919 --> 00:23:24,860
tech conference to be talking about the

00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:26,150
business value to machine learning is

00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:27,799
that if there isn't a need from the

00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:29,840
customer well then there's no need on

00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:31,580
the development side so that's one of

00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,200
the things that we're very mindful of in

00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:35,720
terms of what our customers are telling

00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,700
us in terms of that need so they

00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:39,400
certainly see machine learning as really

00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:42,289
supporting and helping them automate

00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:44,419
highly transactional activities on the

00:23:42,289 --> 00:23:46,190
business side but then also how do they

00:23:44,419 --> 00:23:48,290
leverage machine learning functional

00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:50,160
services to do many things on the

00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:52,350
innovation and the development side

00:23:50,160 --> 00:24:02,850
with either product or are they're

00:23:52,350 --> 00:24:05,669
extending their innovation strategy yeah

00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:07,799
so I mean that that's the a good

00:24:05,669 --> 00:24:10,590
question sense of and I'll say a bit of

00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:12,210
where we came so from so both taejun and

00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:15,630
i are part of what we call the

00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:17,490
innovation center network at sa p and we

00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:19,590
have a chief innovation officer guy

00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:20,820
called Jurgen Muller so if any of you

00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:22,200
are following the blogs or what-have-you

00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:24,450
you might see some of what they're

00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:26,220
developing and our role are certainly

00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:28,409
what he you know our organization's

00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:30,450
mandate is is to pioneer new

00:24:28,409 --> 00:24:31,799
technologies and to see where we can

00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:34,200
build them into either you know growth

00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:37,020
models our pioneer new business paths

00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:38,520
forward as such so I would certainly

00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:40,590
from the work that we've done with

00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:43,559
machine learning and the way we we've

00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:45,299
brought use cases to Marcus so we

00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:47,610
brought solutions to market we tried and

00:24:45,299 --> 00:24:49,380
tested these with our customers so we've

00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:51,750
done that but we're also implementing

00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:53,460
across our entire product portfolio so

00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:55,320
if you're an sa p customer or you're

00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:57,240
interested in sa P or you want to engage

00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,710
more on the enterprise side what you'll

00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,600
start to see from our product portfolio

00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:03,299
is that there will be a huge number of

00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:06,270
offerings where we be embed intelligence

00:25:03,299 --> 00:25:08,309
into either existing applications or

00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:11,490
it'll be on the roadmap for future

00:25:08,309 --> 00:25:13,020
applications certainly I can I can say

00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:14,730
cuz we're on record to say this but

00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:17,010
we're betting big with machine learning

00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:18,720
there's no doubt about it I mean at

00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:20,669
every part to cost that you can make

00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,830
your enterprise intelligent there's no

00:25:20,669 --> 00:25:24,510
doubt about that at every part and

00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:27,720
that's why we showed the value chain

00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:29,850
slide further along because you can see

00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:31,860
how machine learning can impact every

00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:33,720
part to your business and it can help

00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:36,150
but just do very different things and

00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:37,530
with the Leonardo umbrella as well where

00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:40,140
we have that collection of technologies

00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:42,299
coming together we're also engaging with

00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:44,429
you know what we have on the IOT side

00:25:42,299 --> 00:25:46,080
are big data analytics or what have you

00:25:44,429 --> 00:25:48,330
and so certainly you're going to see a

00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:50,580
lot more from awesome we're working with

00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:52,500
our customers right now on some really

00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:54,270
exciting news cases where they're

00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:56,880
helping to offer better value to their

00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:58,740
customers and so things like the you

00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:01,230
know retail shopping experience and

00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:03,700
never Jean things like trend analytics

00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:05,520
too we had a use case recent

00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:08,200
we out of China where they've

00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:10,360
implemented a whole new shopping

00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:12,580
experience whereby the consumer designs

00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:14,800
the models their own shoe and a week

00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:16,630
later they can come and collect it

00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:19,420
because the supply chain is also being

00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:22,710
impacted to be much faster efficient at

00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:25,090
no additional cost to you know the the

00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:28,030
the vendors there in that case as well

00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:30,340
so that's that's a kind of an easy

00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:31,690
example to run to but there's plenty of

00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:38,470
those that we have that we're working

00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:40,630
with customers on I can talk for a long

00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:42,100
time on this topic ok with that we'll

00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:45,040
wrap up if you have any questions

00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:48,600
definitely let us know and we'd be more

00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:51,850
than happy to talk thank you thank you

00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,850
