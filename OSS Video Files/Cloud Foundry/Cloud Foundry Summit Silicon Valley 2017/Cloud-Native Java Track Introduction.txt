all right I think we'll kick things off

00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:06,450
I'm not Josh long I'm wearing a collared

00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:07,859
shirt so that would be your first hint

00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,780
my name's Richard Sirota I work with

00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:12,059
pivotal and with the help of Steve from

00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,410
ECS team now CGI we put together this

00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:15,870
job a track so we thought we'd kick

00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:17,760
things off with a little context about

00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:19,260
how we set this up hopefully why this

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,590
will be an interesting track for you so

00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:24,840
obviously job a big job is relevant this

00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:27,060
was just about big old tech abiy I guess

00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,439
a cold fusion track which it's not so

00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,880
we're trying to talk about Java Java is

00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:32,430
important bread monk just did their

00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,780
language survey last week and Java was

00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:36,809
the number two language on the planet

00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:39,170
after JavaScript and this basis on Stack

00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:41,370
Overflow questions github activity so

00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:42,660
job is everywhere people are all using

00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,160
it like crazy that's great

00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,230
but we're not just using it to keep the

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,210
lights on I mean people are using Java

00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:49,649
to build the crazy web-scale apps if

00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,750
you're Netflix you're building real-time

00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:53,280
data pipelines reactive front ends

00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,199
they're embedding spring boot into

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,570
medical devices like that's crazy great

00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,859
stuff so this is not technology that's

00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:00,780
just about old stuff it's about new

00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:03,059
stuff as well and what's exciting about

00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:04,860
some of the new stuff is that start dot

00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:07,140
spring dot IO which of course Josh will

00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,460
show off four hundred thousand projects

00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,869
created there last month so we're

00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,430
building prototypes we're building new

00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:12,960
enterprise apps we're building micro

00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:15,299
services you're building it hundreds of

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,009
thousands of times per month if you look

00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:18,570
at downloads of spring boot we're at

00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:20,430
almost 20 million times a month that's

00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:21,750
one of the most downloaded packages on

00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:23,700
the internet right now after I guess

00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:25,560
holy chat some other things that are

00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,610
actually more popular but 20 million

00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,500
times a month that's awesome

00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:29,909
so you're seeing some great technology

00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,380
here that I think proves Java is not

00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:33,270
just good for your company it's good for

00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,520
your career and so we tried to build a

00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:37,170
track that was around four things you're

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,210
gonna hear some case studies you're

00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:40,740
gonna get some product updates you're

00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:42,689
gonna get some how-to information and

00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,950
then some pretty cool panels so over the

00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:45,540
next couple of days were covering a few

00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,970
things we're gonna kick off today with

00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,790
Josh long he's gonna talk about cloud

00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:52,530
native Java if you don't finish his talk

00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:53,970
with five things to do yourself you

00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,040
probably dead inside because he's very

00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:57,719
exciting and it's gonna give you a lot

00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,829
of new things you want to play with but

00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:59,969
then we're gonna cover a lot more things

00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:01,680
today we're gonna hit the build Pak

00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:03,450
update the build pack for Java really

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,100
impressive work if you're pushing Java

00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:07,200
apps the work that team has done on the

00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:09,390
Bill pack is super impressive so that's

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,370
gonna be a great talk another talk on

00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:13,440
finding performance issues because hey I

00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,800
know I don't build applications after

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,810
before

00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,680
it's problems but I'm sure you do so you

00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:19,590
might make sure you can troubleshoot

00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,240
those and figure those out also some

00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,410
work on over-engineering there's a good

00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,510
talk from Verizon about how they

00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:27,570
actually do Cloud Foundry and how they

00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:29,190
do Java at scale at that company good

00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:30,900
talk on doing Cloud Foundry with Java

00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:32,220
specifically what are the things baked

00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,140
into cloud found you that make Java

00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:35,550
micro services cloud native patterns a

00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:37,770
realistic thing for you so that's gonna

00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:39,570
be a fun talk and then wrapping up today

00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:41,760
with some talk on multi cloud again

00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:42,720
that's a something we all care about is

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,770
we think about where do we put our

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,090
workload so that should be a good one

00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:47,700
tomorrow we're gonna cover some good

00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:49,410
things as you're in Google cloud how do

00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:52,530
we use those brokers to talk to our Java

00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:54,840
apps and microcell teak loud first party

00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:56,310
services we're gonna talk a little bit

00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,990
about decomposing mana list because

00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:59,940
there are a lot of big existing Java

00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:01,110
applications out there how do we make

00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,640
sure we actually start to break those

00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:05,460
apart so be some good lessons learned

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,080
about what that is be should be a fun

00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:08,820
talk from jewels on containers because

00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,200
hey if you're not doing containers or I

00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:12,450
guess server lists now you're you're a

00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,310
complete bloody so we want to talk about

00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:16,050
containers and why do those matter and

00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:18,360
where do they not matter so jewels we'll

00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:21,360
talk about that we'll also be talking

00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:23,520
about contracts bring cloud contrac HCSC

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,630
we'll be talking with pivotal about how

00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,920
they actually do real-time data

00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:27,540
streaming with spring cloud dataflow

00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,340
that should be pretty exciting stuff and

00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:31,470
then we also wrap up with a couple

00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,970
panels so the first panel is gonna be

00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:34,470
looking at what does the modern web app

00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:36,450
stack look like we brought in some

00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:37,920
experts to talk through that hopefully

00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:39,900
yell at each other throat chairs and

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,910
then there's gonna be a security panel

00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,530
it also looks at we brought in some

00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:44,670
people at each layer of the stack and

00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:46,230
I'm hoping they all point out each

00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:47,880
other's vulnerabilities to make it more

00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:50,850
exciting but they're gonna be covering

00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:52,320
where the security look in a microsecond

00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:54,150
how can you actually architect well so

00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:56,970
this whole track is trying to make sure

00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:58,560
we point out that Java is doing some

00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,880
interesting stuff you yourself if you've

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,590
been doing it for years great you'll

00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:03,300
pick up some new stuff if you want to

00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:04,500
pick up Java for the first time this

00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:06,540
should hopefully get you excited about

00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,610
the projects out there and spring and JE

00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,870
world all these different ways you can

00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:13,050
use Java to build some really great

00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:14,250
cloud native and micro-services apps so

00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:16,890
with that I thought start things off

00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:18,390
with my friend Josh long to come up here

00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:21,150
and do some cloud native Java for you

00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:22,500
all and you will pay for your whole seat

00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:26,360
you only need the edge of it because

00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,360
