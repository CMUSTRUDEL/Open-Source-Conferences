Christopher Tretina
Comcast
Director, Technical Architecture
Greater Philadelphia Area

Christopher Tretina is Director of Technical Architecture at Comcast and has led the Core Architecture team that’s been driving the migration of the Enterprise Services Platform (ESP) implementation from SOA and WebLogic to the Xfinity Services Platform (XSP) built with microservices and deployed to Pivotal Cloud Foundry across numerous DevOps teams. Chris has 15 years’ experience in the technology industry in various roles marked at AstraZeneca, Pfizer, QVC, and Comcast.

Uma Tumala
Comcast
Principal Engineer
Uma Tumala is a Principal Engineer at Comcast who had been working within the confines of a heavy weight back office mediation platform built on monolithic architecture for several years. Comcast explored various opportunities to divide those monolithic services into fine-grained micro services and deploy those on a cloud platform. Ultimately, Comcast opted for the power and simplicity of Pivotal Cloud Foundry and Uma served a focal role in leading significant portions of that transformation initiative, especially as it related to indoctrination of automated testing within the build pipelines, as per her background. Uma has been actively involved in each step of this transformation from day one showcasing her enthusiasm and passion in making the migration successful including seamless migration of 200+ consuming applications to the new platform. She and her team worked through many challenges in this journey and gained a great deal of knowledge in the areas of CI/CD, common frameworks, Spring Boot upgrades, monitoring and alerting set up, GSLB configurations, micro service standards, and more. In so doing, she and her team have been able to successfully migrate 90+ services over to Pivotal Cloud Foundry in a little over two years, serving 250+ million transactions with reduced operational overhead, improved ease of scalability, and heightened resiliency and availability.

so my name is Anton Ron I'm an industry

00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:09,030
analyst red monk where a developer focus

00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:10,559
industry analyst firm and I'm delighted

00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:12,030
to be here today to be able to moderate

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:19,109
this panel and I would like two guys

00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:21,029
from Comcast when judges I'm looking at

00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:23,460
the developer working on a

00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:24,390
transformation of our legacy SOA

00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:28,070
platform

00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:31,560
- cloud native micro services at Comcast

00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:33,570
and I'm Christina I lead the technical

00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,480
architecture team for the department

00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:38,160
that I'm a part of that Comcast good

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,559
afternoon I'm Greg Otto and I lead the

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,590
cloud product engineering team for

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,329
Comcast cool so obviously we've heard

00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:47,300
Comcast mentioned earlier on today I'll

00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:50,430
be with citing a couple of figures

00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:51,989
earlier for people that are here for the

00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,850
first time I may not be familiar with

00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:55,170
Comcast's journey with cloud foundry

00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:56,280
could you tell us a little bit about the

00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,360
background and kind of a scale that

00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,480
you're out at this point

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,579
yeah and in the spirit of rapid change

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,799
I'm gonna have to apologize to Abby

00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:09,420
because her slides from just a few

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:12,299
moments ago or already out of date so so

00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:14,880
we're we have over 1,500 developers on

00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:18,000
our platform we have over 12,000

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,759
application instances and then we also

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,439
have about 210 million transactions that

00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:24,780
we process every single day on the

00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:27,420
platform so we gained about 30 million

00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:30,060
since since our keynote a few minutes

00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:32,549
ago and then last year when I was up

00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,200
here we were in the tens of millions of

00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:36,479
transactions a day so now we're in the

00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,689
hundreds of millions so things change

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:41,460
pretty quickly yeah we were joking

00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:42,840
backstage that IB should put the slides

00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,430
up and github and we can just do pull

00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:48,600
requests or update the starts this is

00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:50,159
very true the the kind of cultural

00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,720
shifts and cultural changes that happen

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,689
in organizations find our technology

00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,320
like cloud foundry or that are quite

00:01:53,689 --> 00:01:56,670
quite profound

00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,560
could you tell us a little bit about

00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:00,240
kind of the organization the way it was

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,799
and decides that exists and how you've

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,649
kind of moved beyond not over the last

00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:08,970
couple of years you mean when we were

00:02:03,649 --> 00:02:12,390
transforming our cultural shift sure so

00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:13,360
when we got started back in 2014 we were

00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,980
facing a couple of

00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,220
he challenges that probably many

00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:21,070
companies are facing the first was we

00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:23,770
did not have a way to express with our

00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:26,160
business partners the impact of the

00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:29,530
incidents that were occurring

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,930
additionally we had very stark divisions

00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:35,110
we were very siloed in our methodology

00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:38,320
between developers operations folks and

00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:40,630
testers on top of that we knew that we

00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:42,580
wanted to train up those engineers but

00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:45,880
we didn't have a solid plan for doing so

00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:48,100
and lastly and perhaps most importantly

00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:50,890
we just weren't able to move at the pace

00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:52,690
that the business wanted to in terms of

00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:56,110
taking some great little idea and

00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:58,420
deploying it up through to production so

00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:01,870
when we when we began our transformation

00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:03,820
we put in a couple of key changes the

00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:06,100
first was we agreed with our business

00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:08,680
partners on some common language we call

00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:10,750
it an impact duration for how we wanted

00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:13,060
to communicate the customer felt impact

00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:15,489
whenever one of our applications had an

00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:17,739
incident as Greg knows this was key for

00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:19,930
us in terms of putting together a

00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:21,610
business case that we could put in front

00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:23,530
of our executives to get the initial

00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:27,190
funding that we needed to really

00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:29,440
kickstart our journey the second piece

00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:32,260
is that we did some organizational

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:34,750
realignments to put developers and

00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:37,600
operations folks together to form devops

00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:38,950
teams and then added testers like uma

00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,709
herself here that's her back around

00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:44,560
testing and development together to form

00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:46,989
value teams teams that can deliver

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,720
complete and end business value all

00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:53,500
within the context of 1/2 pizza box size

00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:56,440
team and then we brought in pivotal and

00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:58,540
Accenture to really jumpstart us we

00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:00,519
thought we were doing agile and DevOps

00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:02,890
the best that we could

00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:04,360
but once we brought those guys in you

00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:06,610
haven't seen anything until you've seen

00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,830
them do pure agile and that's what

00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:11,140
really then led us to be able to do the

00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:16,120
DevOps culture shift that started to

00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:17,799
enable the increase to cycle time just

00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:20,049
some that that kind of training aspect

00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:21,310
and they they're kind of retraining and

00:04:20,049 --> 00:04:23,600
rescaling people because you talked a

00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:26,120
little bit about kind of

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,670
how that has changed over time like an

00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,140
tamam day there's a literally a tsunami

00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:31,610
of technologies coming up people and we

00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:32,870
can't just take people out for training

00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:34,640
courses for two days and put them back

00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:36,770
and as much as sometimes the training

00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:38,630
course is a nice thing to get away to so

00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:39,980
kind of like they get on-the-job type

00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:41,810
training he talked a little bit to us

00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:44,870
about that sure

00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:46,940
funny enough in a in a past life we went

00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:49,100
through a similar transformation at a

00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:51,680
different company and it was very

00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:54,380
classroom based which certainly has its

00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,910
place but we weren't able to come up

00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:58,850
with a kind of iterative value that we

00:04:55,910 --> 00:05:01,610
wanted so knowing that when we brought

00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:04,010
in pivotal and Accenture to help us we

00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:06,320
were very keen on we want it to be

00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:08,780
on-the-job training we want our folks

00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,660
are our teams on the ground to pair with

00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:14,360
those guys on delivering real business

00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:15,950
value for actual applications that we

00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:19,160
were looking to build a new or to

00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:21,110
migrate and it was hugely successful we

00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:23,570
were able to get some of those folks

00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:26,450
many folks now I think we have I don't

00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:28,940
know 50 some odd teams probably on the

00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:32,930
platform using the existing knowledge

00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:36,080
that they had before um when you started

00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:38,060
out on this this whole journey like kind

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,530
of day to Stafford met it a lot of

00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:41,030
people use as they play it safe and to

00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:42,680
choose something small it's not

00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:43,580
something you guys date it tell us a

00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,080
little bit about the kind of

00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:48,620
applications that you chose to start

00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:50,800
with yeah yeah this was this was one we

00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:53,630
we really hit out of the park I think

00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,910
when we first started looking at what we

00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:59,150
wanted to tackle the first temptation

00:05:55,910 --> 00:06:02,960
was to choose something very small very

00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:04,610
easy to try and get a big quick win but

00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,730
then we did a lot of analysis between

00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:09,980
Greg and uma and then certainly shot out

00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:12,200
to Todd and Rob over there and their

00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:14,720
teams for looking at what were the

00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:17,780
highest value applications that we could

00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:20,080
move and value in terms of traffic and

00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:23,180
number of incidents that we could avoid

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:25,220
so we we chose three pretty good-sized

00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:28,130
services you know three out of a hundred

00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:30,320
some but by migrating those we were able

00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:33,169
to move 40% of the traffic off of the

00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:35,120
platform by the end of year one and free

00:06:33,169 --> 00:06:36,409
up enough capacity where the following

00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,939
year we could do the remain

00:06:36,409 --> 00:06:42,979
60 some-odd services so all of this then

00:06:40,939 --> 00:06:46,519
ultimately ties back to developers and

00:06:42,979 --> 00:06:47,509
developer productivity so could you tell

00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:49,819
us a little bit about kind of the

00:06:47,509 --> 00:06:51,889
developer journey and where you guys

00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:56,629
have got to at this point and how you I

00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:58,759
feel it although it's moved sure so this

00:06:56,629 --> 00:07:02,089
was definitely a big challenge until

00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:04,639
2015 because we had a solid line in

00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:08,419
between the developer a tester and the

00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:11,059
operations but we adopted at Comcast a

00:07:08,419 --> 00:07:14,329
couple of the things to really shift to

00:07:11,059 --> 00:07:16,389
a DevOps mindset one of the things we

00:07:14,329 --> 00:07:18,499
did is we introduced it the new tools

00:07:16,389 --> 00:07:21,139
technologies such as continuous

00:07:18,499 --> 00:07:23,300
integration continuous development and

00:07:21,139 --> 00:07:27,349
also we did the test-driven development

00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:30,439
we shipped that testing too far left and

00:07:27,349 --> 00:07:35,029
then start writing many many tests early

00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:37,610
in the cycle because we were on this big

00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:39,829
monolithic platform heavyweight which

00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:43,399
use it to take 215 million plus

00:07:39,829 --> 00:07:46,969
transactions on any given day to scale

00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:49,309
that kind of application on a monolithic

00:07:46,969 --> 00:07:52,459
platform it used to take months for us

00:07:49,309 --> 00:07:55,519
because when developer write the code

00:07:52,459 --> 00:07:58,189
for us to deploy that go to different

00:07:55,519 --> 00:08:00,229
environment just us use it to open the

00:07:58,189 --> 00:08:02,869
ticket put it in the queue operations

00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:05,329
use it to take the ticket takes couple

00:08:02,869 --> 00:08:08,269
of hours to deploy let us find the

00:08:05,329 --> 00:08:10,339
defect the process goes and goes so

00:08:08,269 --> 00:08:13,189
there were a lot of manual steps in

00:08:10,339 --> 00:08:15,739
there but with the continuous

00:08:13,189 --> 00:08:18,559
integration and continuous development

00:08:15,739 --> 00:08:20,989
and also we tested driven development we

00:08:18,559 --> 00:08:25,579
were able to achieve I can give you one

00:08:20,989 --> 00:08:27,079
real-time example it Comcast delivering

00:08:25,579 --> 00:08:30,729
the new products and services to

00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:34,719
customer houses is our job we we try to

00:08:30,729 --> 00:08:37,879
deploy new devices to customer accounts

00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:40,159
on on that whole platform like

00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:42,680
Enterprise Services platform which is a

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:45,199
legacy it used to take three to four

00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:47,720
months for us to apply any new feature

00:08:45,199 --> 00:08:48,680
to production but with the continuous

00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,720
integration

00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,999
with with the collaboration from the

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,920
teams we use it to Dupuis started

00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:57,709
deploying any new feature to the

00:08:54,920 --> 00:09:01,610
production in 15 days even less than 15

00:08:57,709 --> 00:09:04,879
days so that is a major culture shift

00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:06,980
that Chris was talking about and also we

00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:10,279
remove a lot of manual steps in our

00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:13,129
processes so that was a major shift in

00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:15,279
the DevOps methodology so would you

00:09:13,129 --> 00:09:18,649
touch just a little bit more on the

00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:20,149
dirty parts and how you feel that has

00:09:18,649 --> 00:09:22,220
changed the way people are approaching

00:09:20,149 --> 00:09:26,480
development yeah sure

00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:29,079
so we had to have a common reschedule

00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,339
we have like 20-plus development teams

00:09:29,079 --> 00:09:34,069
we use it to share common release

00:09:31,339 --> 00:09:37,399
schedule so everybody put in the code on

00:09:34,069 --> 00:09:39,139
the same day by operations but we were

00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:41,300
not talking to each other we were not

00:09:39,139 --> 00:09:44,300
collaborating every team is in their own

00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:48,379
silos their own issues but once we

00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:50,449
started going into the DevOps we were

00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:52,999
deploying all the applications into

00:09:50,449 --> 00:09:54,470
production at our own pace but still we

00:09:52,999 --> 00:09:57,350
were collaborating we started

00:09:54,470 --> 00:10:00,079
collaborating we had a private slack

00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:02,480
channels with like 400 plus developers

00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:05,269
talking every day talking about the

00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:08,569
issues solutions different innovations

00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:13,939
so that really changed the culture shift

00:10:08,569 --> 00:10:15,860
in Comcast just in terms of like this is

00:10:13,939 --> 00:10:17,629
the emergence of slot channels that this

00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:19,160
is something it's talking about the guys

00:10:17,629 --> 00:10:21,350
backstage about it something that's

00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:23,420
coming up as an emerging team in lots of

00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:24,829
organizations we talked that where there

00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:26,240
are a whole diverse communities of

00:10:24,829 --> 00:10:28,519
people who haven't spoken to each other

00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,439
before now now talking could you talk a

00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:32,569
bit about kind of the cross-pollination

00:10:30,439 --> 00:10:36,679
of ideas and like what you're seeing in

00:10:32,569 --> 00:10:38,839
terms of us yeah I can take that so when

00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:40,970
we started the rollout cloud foundry we

00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:42,649
created a slack channel we use slack for

00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:45,290
real-time communications and

00:10:42,649 --> 00:10:47,059
collaboration and it was a really easy

00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:49,639
way for us to be able to share what was

00:10:47,059 --> 00:10:52,309
going on and this this kind of community

00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:54,740
phenomenon was was happening naturally

00:10:52,309 --> 00:10:58,429
which was really interesting so we have

00:10:54,740 --> 00:11:02,620
over 750 people actually I think it's

00:10:58,429 --> 00:11:02,620
closer to 800 people so even I'm a today

00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:05,899
and and what was really interesting is

00:11:04,459 --> 00:11:07,130
that development team that normally

00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:09,470
would never even talk to each other

00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:11,510
totally different products are all

00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:13,550
collaborating on a real-time basis

00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:16,279
sharing best practices helping each

00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:18,980
other out and it really started to see a

00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:20,839
shift in the way in which you know all

00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:23,870
the developers were collaborating across

00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:25,790
these diverse teams and then I think

00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:28,010
Chris and uma can talk a little bit more

00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:29,990
about you know how that inspired them to

00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:32,540
create product channels for their own

00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:34,190
development organizations like the XSP

00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:37,310
channel radio ma yes

00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:40,250
so we rebranded our enterprise services

00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:42,949
platform ESP - Xfinity service platform

00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:45,199
that is our Comcast brand so we

00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:49,010
introduced it our own slack private

00:11:45,199 --> 00:11:51,470
channel with the name same XSP about

00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:53,120
like 400 developers even though they

00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:55,810
were all looking for solutions from the

00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:58,730
architecture code architecture team the

00:11:55,810 --> 00:12:01,310
same other team already had that issue

00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:03,110
and they resolved it they use it to

00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:05,209
pitching they started pitching in they

00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:07,550
started providing the solution and pair

00:12:05,209 --> 00:12:10,010
programming if already a team

00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:11,930
experiences the issue and provide found

00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:13,880
that the solution we use it to pay them

00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:15,800
with the right folks that's where we

00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,269
started collaborating and one of the

00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,490
other thing that we were doing is

00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:22,459
anytime we are introducing the new

00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:24,980
frameworks new libraries or any upgrades

00:12:22,459 --> 00:12:28,370
we started communicating using our

00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:30,350
development forum so we use it to take

00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:32,660
the constructive feedback we keep on

00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:34,579
making the changes so there was a lot of

00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:37,820
improvement from the initiation of the

00:12:34,579 --> 00:12:39,920
framework to where we are right now so

00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:41,810
kind of the feedback loops have got

00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,510
shorter in terms of all the conversation

00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:46,399
feedback we is always welcoming which

00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:48,829
really helped us to improve more and

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,569
more on making the things very easy for

00:12:48,829 --> 00:12:52,550
all the development teams across the

00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:55,430
board I think you referred to it earlier

00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:58,940
Uma as community driven problem solving

00:12:55,430 --> 00:13:02,120
innovation yes just it's a really really

00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:05,269
nice kind of evolution from from working

00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:07,190
for one of the other aspects stuff that

00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:09,440
has struck me I've heard Greg talk

00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:11,110
before during I'm not on the session

00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,750
here last year

00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:16,240
the growth in terms of developer

00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:18,550
adoption within Comcast and kind of like

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,410
from a relatively low base to the point

00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:21,940
you're at now could you just tell people

00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:25,540
us a little bit about what the what that

00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:27,850
kind of growth rate is being sure and it

00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:31,089
will definitely ask person human to jump

00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:33,220
in but the the growth in the developers

00:13:31,089 --> 00:13:37,240
we started with you know very small

00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:39,670
teams and my team is not marketing this

00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:42,130
to the rest of the developer community

00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:44,200
but you know once we had some of the

00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:46,810
wins that Chris described and his first

00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:48,820
services that we moved over and some of

00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:50,649
the developers were feeling that lift of

00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:53,560
anywhere from 50 to 75 percent

00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:56,110
improvement in productivity so spending

00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:58,720
more time on code and and delivering new

00:13:56,110 --> 00:14:01,630
product experiences for our customers it

00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,880
really started to expand because of all

00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:05,829
the all the developers talking to each

00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:08,110
other and you know encouraging them to

00:14:05,829 --> 00:14:11,950
you know to try it out so it really just

00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:14,110
it's kind of exploded from there I think

00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:17,500
our development community really craved

00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:20,500
the independence any initial hesitation

00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:23,140
I think was washed away once the first

00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:25,060
couple of teams migrated and started

00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:28,240
seeing the advantages that that Ummah

00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:31,450
described earlier around no ticketing to

00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:34,690
do deployments the ability to deploy on

00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:38,079
hours without a cm things like that a

00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:41,079
change management ticket those things

00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:42,850
really encouraged the teams that moving

00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:44,740
to this platform was a reward and

00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:47,230
something that they wanted to do in

00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:50,410
order to provide more business value

00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:52,270
quicker which is a nice bridge to my

00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:54,399
next question which is about Dave the

00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:56,410
business value so like essentially like

00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:59,920
technology is ultimately about customer

00:14:56,410 --> 00:15:00,880
experience and you're not in a large

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,070
enterprise you're not gonna get

00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,420
investment in in technology unless

00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:06,250
you're changing the customer experience

00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:08,170
so if you talk to us a little bit about

00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:09,519
the business value aspects of part of

00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:12,970
what you've seen over the last number of

00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:17,199
years yeah so I think I can take that

00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:19,120
and hand it over to Chris so again when

00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:20,649
we had some of the resiliency challenges

00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,449
with her applications that were in

00:15:20,649 --> 00:15:24,129
hacking the business and our customers

00:15:22,449 --> 00:15:26,529
that was really kind of the first

00:15:24,129 --> 00:15:29,139
challenge so we think about the business

00:15:26,529 --> 00:15:30,910
value across three dimensions one was

00:15:29,139 --> 00:15:33,910
the resiliency of the applications that

00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:36,309
moved onto the platform the other one is

00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:39,189
around time in the market and proved

00:15:36,309 --> 00:15:41,829
productivity and then the third being

00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:45,339
scale so scale is is hugely important

00:15:41,829 --> 00:15:49,059
for us and just some of the numbers in

00:15:45,339 --> 00:15:52,319
the impact minutes that we've had we

00:15:49,059 --> 00:15:55,749
actually decreased those 81 percent and

00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:57,819
then at the same time the amount of time

00:15:55,749 --> 00:16:00,990
that it took for the teams to resolve

00:15:57,819 --> 00:16:03,819
issues when they did come up was

00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:06,100
increased by twice so they were able to

00:16:03,819 --> 00:16:07,779
solve problems twice as fast and then in

00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:09,850
terms of the frequency it was happening

00:16:07,779 --> 00:16:12,129
half as much so all of those things

00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:14,410
conspired to create a really awesome

00:16:12,129 --> 00:16:16,540
story around the resiliency of our

00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:18,670
applications and then the you know the

00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:20,470
improved customer experience and you

00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:22,629
know for the business that resulted and

00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:25,889
then from a time to market across the

00:16:22,629 --> 00:16:29,829
entire platform we're seeing at least

00:16:25,889 --> 00:16:32,350
50% improvement in time to market and

00:16:29,829 --> 00:16:35,470
you know some of the teams it's even

00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:36,639
it's even higher than that and then I

00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:38,620
don't know of Chris if you want to talk

00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:41,439
about some of the specific examples from

00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:43,929
your group yeah I mean first of all it's

00:16:41,439 --> 00:16:46,179
it's funny thinking back to the end of

00:16:43,929 --> 00:16:48,759
2014 when when we were sitting together

00:16:46,179 --> 00:16:50,319
Greg talking about that that number

00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:52,749
because at the time we got the funding

00:16:50,319 --> 00:16:55,990
having promised that by the end of 2016

00:16:52,749 --> 00:16:58,269
we'd reduced by 40 percent impact

00:16:55,990 --> 00:17:00,610
duration not knowing at the time how we

00:16:58,269 --> 00:17:02,589
were going to do that and here we are

00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:05,409
today sitting before you having reduced

00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:08,140
by over 80 percent and just about the

00:17:05,409 --> 00:17:10,659
same time period much of which has to do

00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:12,899
with our migration to Cloud Foundry and

00:17:10,659 --> 00:17:16,029
the additional resiliency that provided

00:17:12,899 --> 00:17:19,679
one of the great examples that I love

00:17:16,029 --> 00:17:22,029
telling this story near the end of 2015

00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:24,399
Greg and I and a couple of other folks

00:17:22,029 --> 00:17:27,669
sitting over yonder we're getting ready

00:17:24,399 --> 00:17:30,669
to present to our CEO the next day on

00:17:27,669 --> 00:17:32,410
hey here's what we built isn't it great

00:17:30,669 --> 00:17:34,540
the night before

00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:38,200
we found a bug in one of the services

00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:40,720
that we had migrated and we ended up

00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:42,610
fixing that bug and deploying all the

00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,680
way through to production with complete

00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:47,410
automated testing in a few hours that

00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:49,090
night so it was pretty fortuitous going

00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:52,090
into the next morning to be able to have

00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:53,740
that story and say this is exactly the

00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:56,110
kind of value now that we're able to

00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:57,910
deliver a fix that probably would have

00:17:56,110 --> 00:18:00,460
taken us at least a week with our own

00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:01,870
with our old cycle now take us just a

00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:02,770
couple of hours and that was so

00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:05,020
impactful

00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:07,120
yeah it really demonstrated the power of

00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:09,960
the platform and you know allowed us to

00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:12,940
kind of put it through its paces and

00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:15,220
definitely a fortunate moment that you

00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:18,130
know demos can go bad especially in

00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:21,340
front of your executives there was also

00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:23,350
another you know pretty cool moment that

00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:25,450
happened and it was last year when Chris

00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:28,390
and I were heading out to the spring one

00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:30,340
platform conference and he had talked

00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:33,400
about it on stage when I didn't even

00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:35,950
know but literally the night before we

00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:38,020
were all flying out a couple of the

00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:40,150
folks from the team were a little groggy

00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:43,240
and that's because it was an issue the

00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:45,880
night before and again they were able to

00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:48,640
create a patch and then run it through

00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:50,650
you know the all the cycles fully

00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,540
automated and in there the production

00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:55,390
environment which is you know pretty

00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:57,490
sizable and it was you know like two to

00:18:55,390 --> 00:19:00,010
three hours which was pretty incredible

00:18:57,490 --> 00:19:01,930
yeah it was really nice last year to be

00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:04,420
able to share that on stage I mean it

00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:06,970
literally had just happened as I was as

00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:08,950
I was walking up to present it was just

00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:11,410
a great better together story as you

00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:14,200
like to say greg between the two teams

00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:16,600
the the team running Cloud Foundry under

00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:19,630
under Greg and then all the application

00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:22,510
teams like myself like umas throughout

00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:24,280
the organization partnering together to

00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:26,050
solve a problem literally in less than

00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:28,840
24 hours after we found it

00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:30,190
and live on hours yeah I was a little

00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:33,790
nervous when we started to tell the

00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:36,430
story because I was like oh you know me

00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:38,590
to steal it well I wasn't sure if it

00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:39,770
turned out well because it was news to

00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:43,160
me at the time

00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:45,260
it was pretty cool so I guess one other

00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:47,030
one other business value or business

00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:48,230
metric that starts of interesting to

00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:51,650
most people in this audience is

00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:54,170
developer productivity and just getting

00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:56,980
things done faster I don't have quite a

00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:59,440
skill to freiza swap or nod from sa P

00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:02,030
cuz you talk to us a little bit about

00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:05,750
like today the speak ends that you've

00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:09,500
seen in terms of like bringing kind of

00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:11,840
products out and down the iterations one

00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:15,560
of the thing we had the challenge is

00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:17,720
scaling the applications because we 250

00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:20,180
plus million transactions on any given

00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:22,700
day any issue that comes up in

00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:25,190
production and deploying the patch to

00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:27,200
the production for all all different

00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:29,750
forms in the production it was a quite

00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:32,990
challenge for operations team monitoring

00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:35,060
perspective but now we were able to draw

00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:37,850
it in production across all the

00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:40,610
application instances and our strong

00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:43,400
monitoring was helping us to see how

00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:46,040
healthy is looking like so that was the

00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:48,890
biggest shift as well where we were able

00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:51,170
to see the issues before even our

00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:54,560
consumers our cost our customers are

00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:57,080
actually identifying so that was that

00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:59,750
was another interesting thing that that

00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:02,000
really helped us as well

00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:03,170
so for for those of you that are never

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,880
kind of start up on a stage like this

00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:06,080
we've got a timer that's timing down in

00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,930
front us and if you've looked at the

00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:10,400
schedule we apparently 40 minutes but

00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:12,620
I'd never like it to be said that a red

00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:15,440
mark analyst stop people getting to beer

00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:16,760
so we kind of have to have captain

00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,230
little things on a little bit so you at

00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:20,480
least know this is actually my last

00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:21,950
question but before I ask my last

00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,260
question if you're interested in hearing

00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:28,370
a little bit more about this Greg is

00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:32,690
giving a talk tomorrow at 3:45 we pop

00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:36,500
along - that - that I'm Hulk so the last

00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:38,930
question - words what's next I mean

00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:41,510
we've come a long way in a short period

00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:44,090
of time we're pretty happy with where

00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:47,030
we're at but we're striving for more the

00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:50,900
next big two items are using Cloud

00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:52,970
Foundry as an enabler for multi cloud we

00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:53,570
have a desire to run both in private

00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:56,180
cloud

00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:58,670
as well as multiple different public

00:21:56,180 --> 00:22:00,860
cloud providers and we think the

00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:03,440
abstraction that Cloud Foundry provides

00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:05,210
us gives us the ability to do that and

00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:08,180
then the second big item is around

00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:09,860
digital first that's where we really

00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:12,110
want to be able to give our customers

00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:15,200
the ability to interact with us on their

00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:18,320
smartphones on Xfinity calm as the first

00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:20,540
line of defense Greg and I were talking

00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:23,780
just before and I believe the last time

00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:26,390
I saw we take 300 million phone calls

00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:28,820
per year that's a lot of customer

00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:30,470
interactions from folks who I'm sure

00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:33,380
would prefer to interact with us through

00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:35,150
digital means versus waiting on the

00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:36,860
phone for a little while so you've

00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:39,710
probably seen some of the press releases

00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:41,270
we're making great progress already but

00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:45,040
we're looking to get there and really

00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:46,970
transform the customer experience so

00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,840
thank you very much folks

00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:52,849
all right thanks

00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:52,849
