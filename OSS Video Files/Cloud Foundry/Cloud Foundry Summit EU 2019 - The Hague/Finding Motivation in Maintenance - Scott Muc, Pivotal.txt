Title: Finding Motivation in Maintenance - Scott Muc, Pivotal
Publication date: 2019-09-13
Playlist: Cloud Foundry Summit EU 2019 - The Hague
Description: 
	Finding Motivation in Maintenance - Scott Muc, Pivotal 

Scott tells his story about how he fell back in love with operations and maintenance. By bridging the concepts around Motivation, Habits, and a touch of Gamification he will discuss his journey in finding the joy in maintaining a long-running Cloud Foundry deployment.  Cloud Foundry has already developed in so many ways. It's true value isn't realized unless it's serving business relevant load. Here's a few tips on how to keep that load running and enjoy doing so.

	00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,680
so my apologies for my voice I'm

00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,240
recovering from a sore throat today is

00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,940
the first day that is actually better so

00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,940
I'm actually very excited to be talking

00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:17,310
finally and I'm actually okay with this

00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:19,289
being the post lunch session because

00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,730
you're not gonna have to look at Y Amal

00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:23,279
you're not gonna have to look at Jason

00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:26,160
or any code this is really just going to

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:29,310
be a talk about a story and experience

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:32,969
of mine of just getting inspired

00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:34,860
inspired for the work that I do and so

00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:36,239
we don't really have a ton of time so

00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:40,079
I'm just gonna get right into it and

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:43,379
let's let's get started so but my

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:47,039
inspiration started my head move over

00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:53,250
here yeah who here is familiar with Kent

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:54,750
Beck's 3x talk no perfect okay so I'm

00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:58,920
gonna spend a lot of time setting some

00:00:54,750 --> 00:01:00,840
context here so Kent Beck the originator

00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,439
of like test-driven development and an

00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:06,330
author of like a unit spent the last

00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:10,439
like seven or eight years at Facebook

00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:13,880
and he found that the way of working at

00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:16,799
Facebook was very different than how

00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:20,070
agile and XP practices started in the

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:23,939
beginning and what he found was Facebook

00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:26,970
had this attitude around lots of

00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:29,250
experiments lots of try new things in

00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:31,170
order to see if there's some kernel of

00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:34,710
something that's valuable and then

00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:36,659
taking that things scaling it and so he

00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:39,750
talks about it in this graph that is he

00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:41,939
says explore expand and extract and I'll

00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:44,850
just sort of walk over this this graph

00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:48,240
for a few minutes here so on the y-axis

00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:50,220
we have pay off and so that's sort of

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,810
like the actual value that you're

00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:54,500
getting out of that investment in work

00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:56,579
so if you think of this explore phase

00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,409
this is actually what we're trying to

00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:00,509
provide with Cloud Foundry we want to

00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:03,299
give people that place that playground

00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:06,329
to explore and try new things and see

00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:07,950
what resonates these things really ought

00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:10,890
to be cheap you don't want to spend too

00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:12,750
much money on an exploration you really

00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:13,720
want to do like your user centered

00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,930
design research

00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:19,000
here you're not going to be writing

00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:22,900
great code this is gonna be prototyping

00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:28,090
lots of stuff to throw away going on the

00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:29,950
x-axis is sort of success so what the

00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:33,880
what the heck does that mean for me

00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:35,200
that's more about time and so you want

00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:37,180
these to also be as short as possible

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,460
it's not really a good exploration if it

00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:41,680
takes you six months you want these to

00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:44,410
be really quick and dirty and to answer

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,450
certain kinds of questions that you have

00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:49,360
probing the market figure out like what

00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:51,640
resonates with with customers the expand

00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,830
phase is once you hit something there is

00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,209
a kernel there that people latch on to

00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:58,810
and go this actually looks really cool

00:02:55,209 --> 00:03:00,190
how do we grow it here our constraint

00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:02,200
now goes into more of a technical

00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:04,450
constraint and sort of a race against

00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,950
competition so you want to grow your

00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:10,209
customer base you want to grow your

00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:12,070
features you want to grow from this

00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:14,140
thing that was like sort of throwaway to

00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:16,480
something that's actually useful and

00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:18,010
marketable you don't really have

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,050
marketing involved here you have

00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:22,989
marketing involved here to either both

00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:24,519
grow awareness and also grow the

00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:27,820
technical stack this is where you

00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:30,760
encounter more technical limitations

00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:34,570
like servers regions availability zones

00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:36,850
and then at the end is the extract phase

00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:38,830
and this is a different phase compared

00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:40,630
to beginning and this this is it this is

00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:43,330
the type of work where you're going to

00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:45,370
be a little bit more risk aware you

00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:48,420
don't want to lose this investment that

00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:51,610
you've spent doing numerous explorations

00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:53,560
investing heavily in growing and then

00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:56,049
having an asset that only lives for a

00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:59,320
year due to some kind of circumstances

00:03:56,049 --> 00:04:01,630
like market changes or just outright

00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:07,750
failure you which we'll get into in a

00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:09,910
bit and so he talks about how like a

00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:12,549
little bit of waterfall sometimes fits

00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:14,260
on this side because you want to prepare

00:04:12,549 --> 00:04:16,150
for certain

00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:17,919
unforeseen consequences and you want to

00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:19,989
mitigate them you want to sort of plan

00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:21,789
against them and create some some

00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:24,550
barriers to that whereas here failure is

00:04:21,789 --> 00:04:27,580
fine failure is actually when you spend

00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:29,440
too long on a bad idea

00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:33,699
and we'll revisit this graph a little

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:36,160
bit just to expand on it this graph has

00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:39,099
sort of its fractal in nature it's not

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,630
just a one year time horizon or a five

00:04:39,099 --> 00:04:43,630
year time horizon you can see this in

00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:44,949
your in your day you can see this as you

00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:47,620
spike out to technical implementation

00:04:44,949 --> 00:04:49,660
and say hey this is actually something I

00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:51,610
want to now have five teams in our

00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:53,650
organization use so that's sort of the

00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:56,620
growth and then maintain it so you're

00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:58,509
not churning on technological decisions

00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:00,490
so you can sort of see this fractal

00:04:58,509 --> 00:05:01,979
nature in all the different places where

00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:07,330
you do a little bit of exploration

00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:13,060
expanding and extracting when I first

00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:14,680
saw this talk the thing that jumped out

00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:17,710
at me was that he always drew the graph

00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:19,389
in the same way and it made me sort of

00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:23,349
think about like well what does it look

00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:26,080
like if this graph composed itself in

00:05:23,349 --> 00:05:28,060
different ways so at the top left here

00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,759
actually all the top ones you can sort

00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:33,400
of see those is that the cost of

00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:36,520
exploration is a lot higher than perhaps

00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:39,699
the ones that are in the middle row you

00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:42,789
can also have a slow growth versus like

00:05:39,699 --> 00:05:46,479
an immediate growth in the top right you

00:05:42,789 --> 00:05:49,479
can also have something maybe a marginal

00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:51,340
gain if you look at the middle row left

00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:53,349
column where it's like yeah it was a

00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:54,969
chief experiment but you didn't get the

00:05:53,349 --> 00:05:57,599
growth that you're hoping to get and so

00:05:54,969 --> 00:06:00,310
how valuable is that asset over time and

00:05:57,599 --> 00:06:04,690
and then at the bottom which my head is

00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:07,180
probably blocking is like not a great

00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:09,280
scenario here where yeah you found

00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:11,380
something that resonated but for some

00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,690
reason it tailed off and is no longer

00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:14,800
that valuable you might have to make

00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:17,409
decisions on what you want to do with

00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:21,550
that thing get rid of it or do some kind

00:06:17,409 --> 00:06:24,550
of ROI analysis on it but what I like to

00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:28,120
think I I'm doing and I'll get into what

00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:30,430
what I do in a moment is this is I love

00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:33,069
seeing I want to see how long this can

00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:35,020
go how long can you take an asset that's

00:06:33,069 --> 00:06:37,000
valuable and useful to your customers

00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:39,400
and extend it and get the most value out

00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,680
of it extra some people use the word

00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,110
exploited I'm not a big fan

00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,610
of that word I do like thinking of

00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:46,590
extract it's trying to say like there's

00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:48,600
people that see value let's continue

00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:53,000
giving that value instead of having to

00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:58,560
force them to adopt all the time so that

00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:03,000
resonates with me quite a bit but how do

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:04,740
you get that long line often there's

00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,020
there's sort of maintenance requirements

00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:09,210
you can't really just have something and

00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:13,440
just assume entropy isn't going to take

00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:17,210
over and do its darndest to take it down

00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:19,860
that'd be physical things virtual things

00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:23,160
you know that if you don't do anything

00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:26,160
with your infrastructure for some reason

00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:30,889
like we even use words like rot bit rot

00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:33,599
or some kinds of like decay drift and

00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:36,870
these are fully engineered systems that

00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:38,669
we've created but they're complex and we

00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:39,870
can't control all the variables and so

00:07:38,669 --> 00:07:42,060
things are eventually going to pick it

00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:43,590
apart so maintenance is the process of

00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:46,080
preserving a condition so if you have a

00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:48,180
valuable asset and a valuable system how

00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,940
do you preserve it the way that it is so

00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:53,639
it continues providing value and for me

00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:56,240
like this is see a summit after all so

00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:58,169
like you you as a company may have

00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,970
experimented with different platforms

00:07:58,169 --> 00:08:02,280
and Cloud Foundry was the one that you

00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:04,229
explored then you want to grow it you

00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:06,300
talked to your internal stakeholders and

00:08:04,229 --> 00:08:08,010
your dev teams and said wow this

00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:09,690
actually resonates more than just one

00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:11,099
dev team this way you can see this going

00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:14,340
to a hundred dev teams and that's how

00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:15,539
you scale and grow your platform at your

00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,919
organization but then at some point

00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:19,110
someone's gonna have to maintain it and

00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:22,650
keep it running and keep those people

00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:27,870
happy because the the shininess wears

00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:30,060
off for a little while and so

00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:33,529
maintenance to me is the thing that sort

00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:36,839
of props up that that top-line and

00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:39,959
without it that top line starts falling

00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:41,550
down you could argue that there's

00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:44,430
sometimes some downside risk tolerance

00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:46,649
that's totally acceptable you can sort

00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:48,480
of picture these blocks shrinking over

00:08:46,649 --> 00:08:50,040
time because perhaps you do want to

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,230
retire your platform there's a there's

00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:54,030
an end-of-life at some point I just hope

00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:57,690
it's five years down the road not

00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:59,550
six months and so maintenance is one of

00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:03,540
the activities that you can do to keep

00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:08,970
that going cool so yeah dude where the

00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:11,730
heck is going get there in a second

00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:15,360
so I work on a team that is doing

00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:16,920
platform engineering this sort of covers

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:21,110
a lot of the internal stuff within

00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:23,460
pivotal that we we a operate a platform

00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:25,260
we operate a platform for pivotal

00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:26,940
tracker if you're familiar with pivotal

00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:29,430
tracker it's a if you're not familiar

00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:31,620
with tracker it's a project management

00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:38,220
system for similar to like JIRA or

00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:40,380
mingle or like those and we're it's it's

00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:41,640
a single tenant platform so like we are

00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,350
so I know a lot of you are probably

00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:45,990
running platforms for much larger

00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:48,000
organizations this is a very small one

00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:49,760
but that's that's okay it's maintenance

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,310
is still required if you're big or small

00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:55,590
it's still valuable but we are running a

00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:58,860
production system we carry the pager for

00:09:55,590 --> 00:10:01,520
it and it's a I don't know how long

00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:05,820
pivotal tracker is existed for but it's

00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:07,830
10 15 years maybe so it's it's it's

00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:12,750
articulated as value and it's still

00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:16,320
valuable and we want to keep extracting

00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:17,960
that value but there are some things

00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:22,830
that sort of work against maintenance

00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:25,230
prevention is a bit hard to see you

00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:28,740
don't patch a system and then get

00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:30,510
notified by a hacker saying I saw the e

00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:32,550
patch to open SSL I was about to hacky

00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:33,900
over the weekend but I can't now you

00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:36,930
don't get that kind of feedback with

00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:39,900
preventative type of work the feedbacks

00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:42,360
are slow you don't really you don't

00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:45,900
really know how all that maintenance

00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:48,780
actually impacts you I like I like

00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:51,000
thinking of flossing as an interesting

00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:52,920
metaphor of maintenance is that you

00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,420
didn't like you you don't really get

00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,800
that immediate feedback when you floss

00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,180
but you get that feedback when you go to

00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,790
the dentist and they say you haven't

00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:01,560
been flossing so I make sure I floss

00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:05,460
because I don't want that feedback later

00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:06,620
on and also sometimes the feedback is

00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:10,430
too late

00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:13,130
if if I'll use a dentist analogy again

00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:15,380
is that if the dentist tells you that

00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:16,970
you have a cavity well flossing isn't

00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:18,260
going to fix that unfortunately you're

00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:20,950
at a different state of maintenance

00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:23,240
where you actually need to repair and

00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:27,790
get a filling and then maintain that

00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:27,790
feeling now for for a while

00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:32,480
and also its maintenance is never done

00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:35,960
maintenance is a type of work that is

00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:39,230
repetitive as much as we love automation

00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:41,870
and removing the toil from our jobs is

00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:43,850
that we're building new machines to

00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:45,410
perform that maintenance and so who

00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:47,810
maintains the maintenance machines and

00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:49,070
so it's it's never-ending but it's just

00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:53,450
hopefully we're changing the problem to

00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:56,060
be something better so now to talk a

00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:57,500
little bit around motivation and so

00:11:56,060 --> 00:12:00,560
there's a book by Daniel thing called

00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:02,180
drive one slide does it really do it

00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,340
justice but I do want to break down the

00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:06,410
three key factors that he articulates

00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:08,510
through the research that he's done is

00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:10,070
that in order for someone to be really

00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:13,790
satisfied with the work that they do

00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:15,500
they need autonomy so not being told

00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:18,320
what to do having some agency and what

00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:20,600
they do some level of mastery the

00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:25,280
feeling of getting better at what you do

00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:26,660
and purpose for me like this is this is

00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:29,000
sort of the thing that resonated with me

00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:32,150
is that when when I was seeing that Kent

00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,430
Beck graph it made me this is this is my

00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:38,300
happy place it made me realize that I

00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:40,220
actually love maintaining stuff I I get

00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:42,830
satisfaction of having an old pair of

00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:44,840
jeans lost me forever I don't get as

00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:46,850
much satisfaction and this is not to

00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:48,590
dismiss this type of work but for folks

00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:51,740
who love building things and building

00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:54,320
new things the people that love this

00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:57,040
Explorer loop that's great I'm glad

00:12:54,320 --> 00:13:00,020
there are people that love doing that

00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:03,110
but this is this is my jam this is this

00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:04,550
I'm happy to see how how cheaply I can

00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:05,270
keep that thing running for as long as

00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:07,310
possible

00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:11,140
as long as it's still delivering value

00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:11,140
of course not just for the heck of it

00:13:13,089 --> 00:13:18,939
so that's a bit of a blurry slide but

00:13:16,869 --> 00:13:20,799
like what does what does maintenance

00:13:18,939 --> 00:13:23,169
work look like in the day in the life of

00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:26,679
someone who's running a platform a lot

00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:28,989
of it looks like number incrementing it

00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:33,519
looks like take this thing and bump up

00:13:28,989 --> 00:13:36,149
this patch version not not super

00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:38,919
motivating there's there's like a

00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:41,259
negative term for graphic designers as

00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:42,969
back in the day was like pixel pushers I

00:13:41,259 --> 00:13:45,609
don't want to think of myself as a

00:13:42,969 --> 00:13:50,619
number incrementer I'm more than that

00:13:45,609 --> 00:13:51,939
and and I'll talk at how to turn some of

00:13:50,619 --> 00:13:53,709
these types of stories into something a

00:13:51,939 --> 00:13:55,899
little bit more motivating so that your

00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:57,189
platform teams can actually enjoy the

00:13:55,899 --> 00:14:00,459
work that you do and be proud of the

00:13:57,189 --> 00:14:09,429
work that they do and not just be seen

00:14:00,459 --> 00:14:11,709
as a ticket a ticket processor so some

00:14:09,429 --> 00:14:13,359
of the things that work well with a lot

00:14:11,709 --> 00:14:15,759
of the things that we sort of struggle

00:14:13,359 --> 00:14:18,969
to do in the short term for long term

00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:21,399
games sometimes requires a little bit

00:14:18,969 --> 00:14:25,419
psychological manipulation or some

00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:27,369
people call it gamification gamification

00:14:25,419 --> 00:14:28,989
of course can be used for a lot of

00:14:27,369 --> 00:14:31,509
negative things it's it's used to

00:14:28,989 --> 00:14:36,089
capture people in platforms so that they

00:14:31,509 --> 00:14:38,169
don't leave make addictive types of

00:14:36,089 --> 00:14:39,369
workflows and streaks that you don't

00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:41,259
want to maintain but of course they can

00:14:39,369 --> 00:14:42,759
also be used for good one of the ones

00:14:41,259 --> 00:14:45,579
that I really like is don't break the

00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:47,079
chain that Jerry Seinfeld make mentions

00:14:45,579 --> 00:14:49,119
which is about developing a habit and

00:14:47,079 --> 00:14:52,199
doing something frequently and

00:14:49,119 --> 00:14:54,969
reoccurring so for him it was just about

00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:56,709
30 minutes I think a day of writing some

00:14:54,969 --> 00:15:01,599
stand-up material he just made sure he

00:14:56,709 --> 00:15:03,939
didn't break that chain of course one of

00:15:01,599 --> 00:15:09,009
the negative ones here is this github

00:15:03,939 --> 00:15:11,289
one github I think they removed

00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:12,939
I think this feature the the largest

00:15:11,289 --> 00:15:14,999
Street kind of thing because it actually

00:15:12,939 --> 00:15:17,619
incentivize people to work on weekends

00:15:14,999 --> 00:15:19,419
which is sort of like sort of shows the

00:15:17,619 --> 00:15:23,099
power of sometimes of these very

00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:25,509
simplified gamification mechanics where

00:15:23,099 --> 00:15:26,890
you have to be conscientious when using

00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:28,420
them because you don't want to

00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:33,670
nudge people to do things that are

00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:34,930
unhealthy for them but in in software

00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:38,160
development we sort of naturally already

00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:41,160
had don't break the chain type of

00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:43,840
behavior which is don't break the build

00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:46,480
if you ever go into an organization

00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:48,910
where the build is read frequently it

00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:51,370
can be very frustrating and there's some

00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:53,050
I personally at least get a sense of

00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:56,020
pride of like keeping it green keeping

00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:58,330
keeping things healthy I feel like a

00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:58,930
green build is like having a clean

00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:01,150
kitchen

00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:02,980
it means that I'm everything's in good

00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:04,990
order so I can actually cook a meal

00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:06,880
whereas a red build is like you know my

00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:08,740
roommate just you know created a little

00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:12,190
bunch of mess and I can't cook anything

00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:18,340
now because the kitchens red build is

00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:22,800
red it doesn't mix too well and yeah so

00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:25,210
like habits are one part around making

00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:28,750
short-term decisions that are not

00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:30,670
obvious is healthy in the long term so

00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:32,020
like whatever habits that you can

00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:33,430
develop to like get yourself to floss

00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:35,050
your teeth or I have a habit of making

00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:37,300
sure I go for a walk every single

00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:40,990
morning before I start work I work from

00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:42,940
home that makes makes me healthier in

00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:45,450
the long run a little bit more sane so

00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:51,400
that I don't get a little bit stir-crazy

00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:54,580
and I the motivation there is is simply

00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:56,560
gamification I have stickies in my wall

00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:57,880
in my apartment that just has a little

00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:02,110
green dot and I feel a little bit proud

00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:03,780
of myself now okay okay so talked a

00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:05,710
little bit about the psychology of

00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:06,790
motivation and a little bit about the

00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:08,860
maintenance needs that our

00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:11,800
infrastructure needs how the heck does

00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:18,550
this all get put together and I'll do a

00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:21,910
quick time check Oh looking good okay so

00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:25,600
we've gamified some of our actually and

00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:28,810
let me sort of go back to here like what

00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:31,090
we do in cloud ops we have an okay are

00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:33,520
so objectives and key results one of our

00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:40,270
objectives is a maintenance objective

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:43,690
and it reads out like as we will main

00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:45,550
a stable and secure platform for pivotal

00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:49,330
tracker right that's our objective and

00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:51,190
so a key part of okay ours is having key

00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:57,610
results so how do you measure so I just

00:17:51,190 --> 00:18:00,280
said some fuzzy words stable and secure

00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:01,660
all right cool what do those words mean

00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:03,160
is it completely locked down is it

00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:07,840
disconnected from the internet is it

00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:11,080
100% stable well let's talk about our

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:13,630
metrics that we use to to gauge that so

00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:16,720
from a security stance I'll this is I

00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:19,300
know this is a bit of a graph explosion

00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:22,780
of this one but one of our security

00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:25,930
stances is we will update our software

00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:27,790
frequently because we believe that the

00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:30,610
age of the software that's running in

00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:32,920
our system is correlated to the risk

00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:35,470
security risk of our system so if we

00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:37,330
have like a VM that has been up for 350

00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:40,030
days we see that as a risk not as a

00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:44,620
seller this thing to celebrate and so

00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:47,820
this is a graph of how patched our stem

00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:51,760
cells are for all these services this is

00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:53,380
running on on PCF but even with Bosh

00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:57,100
deployed CFS of course you're going to

00:18:53,380 --> 00:19:01,810
still have a stem cell and here you can

00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:03,430
sort of see oh just use a random one you

00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:05,500
can sort of see when they got patched as

00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:05,860
these one sort of go down there's a few

00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,930
gaps

00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:12,400
that's just our metrics ingestion is not

00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:14,530
always quite on on par but if this

00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,570
continued like this this graph tells us

00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:19,420
what happens if we do absolutely nothing

00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:20,800
if we do nothing every day these graphs

00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:23,320
are gonna increment higher and higher

00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:26,170
until we reach a threshold which for our

00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:27,850
team leaves said 30 days so we don't

00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:30,550
want to have a stem cell that was

00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:34,390
released more than 30 days ago so that's

00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:37,060
part of our security stance and it's

00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:39,040
really fulfilling when our pipelines go

00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:41,770
through a stem cell upgrade and we see

00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:45,970
this thing rejigged self and all the

00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:48,010
graphs didn't go down is it is it fair

00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:50,730
does are we really secure well that's

00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:52,570
that's up to our model to keep on

00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:54,160
assessing and figuring out like how

00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:56,350
secure does this actually make

00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:59,260
of course we can start working on other

00:19:56,350 --> 00:20:01,480
metrics as well but this provides a

00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:04,830
little bit of visual feedback on when we

00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:07,090
upgrade a system based on our model and

00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:08,950
declaration of our security stance to

00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:10,780
our stakeholders we can say we're

00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:13,540
keeping this thing as fresh as possible

00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:17,370
and part of that conversation is like

00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:21,880
I'll go into the next metric in a bit

00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:25,650
this is another so this is using pivotal

00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:27,820
Cloud Foundry so one of the package

00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:29,830
Naumann klaich err there is a tile and

00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:32,560
so this is just a version of the tiles

00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:34,780
that are on the platform but same

00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:37,240
concept is is there is like how old is

00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:39,450
that tile and you can see that we're

00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:41,620
sort of we're chomping on the bit for

00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:45,760
Google to release a new version of their

00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:49,690
stock driver nozzle tile so this graph

00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:52,120
at first glance is telling me our stack

00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:54,280
driver nozzle software is old and hasn't

00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:57,370
been patched and we're waiting for an

00:20:54,280 --> 00:21:00,250
upstream provider to to release a new

00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:01,840
version and we can also see that some

00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:03,970
pivotal products haven't released a

00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,650
patch in a while and so we say hey by

00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:07,750
the way it's been a long time since

00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:09,580
you've released something we would like

00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:11,830
to be able to exercise our ability to

00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:14,740
upgrade because the longer that thing

00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:19,090
goes without upgrading the more anxious

00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:22,120
that we feel about upgrading and so it

00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:25,240
sort of goes into the the mastery

00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:27,820
component of of what's motivating is

00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:29,710
that as a platform team you get to do

00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:32,260
things over and over and over again and

00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:34,630
to me that's exciting because that's

00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:37,210
your opportunity to get better at it if

00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:39,520
you'd only do something once it's it's I

00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:43,470
keep on bugging people that keep on

00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:45,520
creating a Cloud Foundry installers like

00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:48,040
we've only needed to install Cloud

00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:52,690
Foundry four times on our team but we've

00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:54,280
done over a thousand upgrades so that

00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:56,350
that is a little bit more impactful for

00:21:54,280 --> 00:22:02,440
us and it motivates me is a maintainer

00:21:56,350 --> 00:22:05,590
of something as well and so the the next

00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:07,840
graph here is where we're following some

00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:11,290
of the SRU practices especially

00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,760
era budgets and this is our metric that

00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:16,300
we use to determine whether or not we

00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:18,310
can change the system who here is

00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:20,890
familiar with sre practices and era

00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:26,230
budgets a little bit okay most of the

00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:31,180
room cool so this this line is telling

00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:33,850
us how much downtime or customer pain

00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:36,340
heavily introduced by updating the

00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:37,660
system so frequently so this is this is

00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:41,290
an agreement that we've had with our

00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:43,180
stakeholders is that we are based on the

00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:45,640
security stance that we've discussed

00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:47,320
well that means for us to do frequent

00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:50,350
upgrades as well you can't have one

00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:53,290
without the other and so here's our way

00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:55,270
of deciding on how frequently we can

00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:58,480
upgrade as long as we're below these

00:22:55,270 --> 00:23:00,400
budgets were free so again from the

00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,500
motivation standpoint this gives us

00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,690
autonomy we're not really being told

00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:06,610
when to deploy or not we say is like

00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:09,820
we've we've already had an agreement

00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:11,440
about this budget and as long as you're

00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:13,330
within that we understand what that

00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:19,360
means and so we can can we can continue

00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:22,110
our upgrade machine what else do I have

00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,110
on this one

00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:33,250
no nothing so I will I love it when I

00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:36,730
can keep something up and running and

00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:39,430
and keeping it up at that high pay off

00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:42,460
line it makes me really sad to see

00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:46,870
something sort of evolved and become

00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:49,330
unused or unmaintained think of a lot of

00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:53,110
your favorite libraries or open source

00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:55,870
projects or tools or services that you

00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:57,280
use and think about the times where you

00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:58,090
say like I don't really want to use that

00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:00,420
it doesn't look like it's

00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:02,500
well-maintained what does that mean

00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:04,600
explore that a little bit and what are

00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:06,190
the activities that you observe the

00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:10,420
people in those communities doing that

00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:12,370
you support and do you see yourself

00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:14,440
doing those activities do you take any

00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:19,050
pleasure or value from doing those

00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:21,640
activities because if so then maybe

00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:24,820
operations is your jam as well

00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:27,700
and you'll be quite happy playing that

00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:30,370
fractal explore expand extract on

00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:32,620
different things so for our team like

00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:34,720
you know we started with manual upgrades

00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:37,299
and we move to automated upgrades that

00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:40,510
was also in our team a small little

00:24:37,299 --> 00:24:44,200
explore expand and extract and knowing

00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:46,660
where you sort of lie on those on those

00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:48,520
dimensions really helps you with

00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:51,010
decision-making and determine like what

00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:52,929
risks are so if you're at the extract

00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:58,720
phase you're gonna you definitely want

00:24:52,929 --> 00:25:01,360
more tests you want more better clean

00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:04,000
code at Explorer you don't care about

00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:06,760
that stuff so much at growth you're

00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,240
gonna want people that are focusing on

00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:11,740
the technical problems and understanding

00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:13,510
computer science constraints at that

00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:19,570
point because those problems are that

00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:20,830
big well yeah in summary so like we

00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:23,140
talked a little bit about maintenance

00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:26,020
and what that looks like but why do I

00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:28,570
have fun doing it well I I don't feel

00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:30,340
like I'm a ticket processing agent I I

00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:33,940
get to figure out how I solve the

00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:35,650
problems like I said earlier our team

00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:37,840
has an okay R which is around

00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:40,179
maintenance which is we keep the

00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,559
platform stable and secure for our

00:25:40,179 --> 00:25:44,919
number one tenant which is pivotal

00:25:41,559 --> 00:25:47,260
tracker that's it we we have agency to

00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:50,890
figure out what that looks like

00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:54,850
mastery we are changing things all the

00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:57,520
time and with every iteration and every

00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:58,929
sample you get a learning experience I

00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,480
don't think I'd feel like I'd be

00:25:58,929 --> 00:26:03,520
mastering our maintenance if we only

00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:05,200
upgraded once every six months I would

00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,270
feel like I'm just studying myself for

00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:11,799
the next nightmare and so by doing it

00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:14,679
weekly automated I get I get better at

00:26:11,799 --> 00:26:16,210
it and I get better at seeing the

00:26:14,679 --> 00:26:17,620
different types of failure scenarios

00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:18,760
because yeah things break all the time

00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:20,320
when you do it more often

00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,850
but the failures are a little bit more

00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:25,169
manageable you can actually reason about

00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:28,990
them and and they're not quite as scary

00:26:25,169 --> 00:26:32,350
and purpose I love the fact that we're

00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:34,950
keeping tracker alive and healthy we

00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:37,619
have as the previous slide around the

00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:40,830
cloud ops domain like we're providing

00:26:37,619 --> 00:26:43,049
feedback to the rest of of pivotal we

00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:45,830
are exploring different practices and

00:26:43,049 --> 00:26:47,580
trying them out and documenting them and

00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:49,350
proselytizing them to the world and

00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:52,859
being very excited about it even if you

00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:54,480
have a sore throat and that makes it

00:26:52,859 --> 00:26:58,950
easy to show up at work on a Monday

00:26:54,480 --> 00:27:01,049
morning and as an outro yeah so this is

00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:02,639
me you can email me at oh yeah so

00:27:01,049 --> 00:27:04,559
there's a Amon had a question about how

00:27:02,639 --> 00:27:06,269
to pronounce my name my last name is

00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:08,639
actually pronounced boots but I can also

00:27:06,269 --> 00:27:11,009
go by MOOC or mock it's totally fine

00:27:08,639 --> 00:27:15,859
it's lost in translation kind of issue

00:27:11,009 --> 00:27:19,940
but it's totally fine cool and I think

00:27:15,859 --> 00:27:19,940
we have a few minutes for questions

00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:30,960
[Music]

00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:35,340
there we go what are you wearing in this

00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:37,619
photo I washed out I fancy its I was

00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:39,840
touring an industrial museum in Prague

00:27:37,619 --> 00:27:44,580
and it's something that people would

00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:45,880
wear in the metallurgy place yeah and I

00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:48,559
thought it looked like a wizard

00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:52,309
[Laughter]

00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:52,309
any other questions

00:27:53,119 --> 00:28:02,309
besides what I'm wearing if you like

00:27:59,369 --> 00:28:03,389
repeating things do a line automating

00:28:02,309 --> 00:28:07,470
the things you repeat

00:28:03,389 --> 00:28:11,100
oh that's very meta what's the

00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:13,559
motivation when is the step you say now

00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:17,519
I've done this often enough it has to be

00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:21,659
yeah that's cool you can save just in

00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:25,909
case follow up so I like the the

00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:29,340
repetition so that I can learn so that I

00:28:25,909 --> 00:28:31,200
can I can observe all the different

00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:35,100
things that happen through that repeated

00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:36,720
process and yeah I guess yeah to be fair

00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:38,159
it's not about just repeating for the

00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,350
sake of repeating because sometimes that

00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:42,359
is therapeutic work I wouldn't want to

00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:46,279
do that all the time but I do like the

00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:49,279
repetition because patterns emerge

00:28:46,279 --> 00:28:49,279
either

00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:55,780
failure modes emerge you're like oh wow

00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:57,280
it seems like one in ten or one in a

00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:59,410
hundred of these sort of result in this

00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:02,200
kind of thing and so you look at the

00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:04,840
that the repetitive process whether it's

00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:07,570
manual or automated through some kind of

00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:09,610
probabilistic means you're like okay now

00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:11,320
that I've seen enough samples I can

00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:13,000
reason about it

00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:17,950
now does that mean I actually enjoy

00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:19,600
doing it manually not really I think it

00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:21,310
does it just means that I feel a little

00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:24,130
bit more confident any solutions that we

00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:25,750
build that's sort of where I really

00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:27,880
enjoy the repetition

00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:30,940
it helps from it helps fight some

00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:34,290
sometimes the premature solutioning to

00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:34,290
see the problems more and more and more

00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:48,210
anyone else you have to speak into the

00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,490
microphone

00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:53,250
and another question I just have a

00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:56,580
comment one of the things that you said

00:29:53,250 --> 00:30:00,300
at the beginning really I think was

00:29:56,580 --> 00:30:03,740
impactful for me was like we talked

00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:05,970
about building so much like in every

00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:08,490
room that I've been to we talked about

00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:11,940
like innovating and changing and moving

00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:14,400
fast and freaking fast like when you

00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:16,500
pick up a study and you're done like you

00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:20,300
enjoy it when you finish it but then

00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:23,970
that's it you know you don't I feel like

00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:27,540
like me personally I don't wait enough

00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:29,040
to see the you know to see the benefits

00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:29,850
of it it's like you're moving on to the

00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:32,760
next thing yeah

00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:34,860
and if I am doing that like there is a

00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:36,900
lot of something to be said about

00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:39,240
empathy you do about like what we are

00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:41,780
putting out there and the clients and

00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:43,980
our customers are using it right so

00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:47,490
you're just like constantly putting

00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:49,140
something new on them yeah and they have

00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:52,710
to adapt to that change whether they

00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:55,290
want it or not because I feel that's how

00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:57,720
we perceive it like if you're not moving

00:30:55,290 --> 00:31:01,140
fast if you're not like changing

00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:03,030
constantly you're not really moving yeah

00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:04,860
forward no that's that's definitely

00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:07,140
resonates with me is that I felt like I

00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:08,490
was on this change treadmill and I

00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:10,800
realized it doesn't have to be like that

00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:13,440
you can adjust your timelines and so

00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:14,700
like that fractal nature of the graph is

00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,350
like well figure out what your timeline

00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:19,710
is something that fits for you as well

00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:21,720
because yeah you can you can fit in

00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:25,620
different different timelines with that

00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:29,610
fractal work so there is something about

00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:31,950
reaping the mistakes of your previous

00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:33,690
implementations as well like living not

00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:36,540
levied long enough that's morbid but

00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:38,790
like being the consumer of your own

00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:42,360
product for enough time to realize like

00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:44,310
oh that decision that we made I don't

00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:46,740
know a year ago this is the impact now

00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:48,590
and you sort of see that a lot more with

00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:51,000
maintenance and it gets the the

00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:53,370
repetitive part is almost like an

00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:56,160
amplifier and so repetition is really

00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:58,770
interesting to just sort of see those

00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:01,270
tiny those tiny sort of annoyances

00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:04,600
magnify over time

00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:05,710
that repetition yeah I like your

00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,910
question now because I realize that

00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:08,500
repetition is I don't like the

00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:12,010
repetition I like the learnings from

00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:19,390
repetition is I think know the more way

00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:24,100
my models thinking though all right if

00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:26,300
there's no more questions okay we're

00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:31,290
done thank you

00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:31,290
