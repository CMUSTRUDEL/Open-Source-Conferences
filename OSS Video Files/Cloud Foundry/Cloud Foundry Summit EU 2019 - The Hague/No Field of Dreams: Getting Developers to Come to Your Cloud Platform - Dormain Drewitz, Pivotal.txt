Description: 
	No Field of Dreams: Getting Developers to Come to Your Cloud Platform - Dormain Drewitz, Pivotal Software 

You’re (continuously) building a cloud platform for your developers. It’s going to make their lives easier—and keep your pager from going off all weekend. If only you could get all your developer teams to use it!  Many Platform Engineering teams using Cloud Foundry have discovered this interesting reality: they are spending more time “marketing” their platform than they expected. And that’s not a bad thing! But whether you’re new to Cloud Foundry or have been using it for a while, you may wonder if you’re doing the right things to gain adoption within your developer ranks.  In this session you’ll learn:  Why you need to account for ongoing marketing of your platform  What tactics you can use to drive adoption  How to measure the effectiveness of your “marketing” activities

thank you everyone I really means a lot

00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:08,099
to me that at the last session of the

00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:12,049
last day we've got so many faces in the

00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:15,389
room we are gonna be talking about

00:00:12,049 --> 00:00:16,859
marketing your platforms as the might

00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:19,410
have wondered why we are gonna have a

00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:23,640
marketing conversation in the Cloud

00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:25,920
Foundry for operators but this will be a

00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,930
nice way to kind of wind up the events

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,929
shifting to the other side of the brain

00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:33,270
and and benefit from some of the

00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:35,309
patterns that we've seen a pivotal with

00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:38,670
their customers who are more successful

00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:41,129
at driving adoption amongst their

00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,200
developer populations and therefore

00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:45,690
getting all the benefits of running a

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,739
cloud foundry based platform so my name

00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:49,140
is door main drewett's

00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:53,460
I work for pivotal on the product

00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:56,309
marketing team and happy to talk to you

00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,230
about why it's no Field of Dreams which

00:00:56,309 --> 00:01:00,809
I realize is a baseball-reference in

00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,190
Europe we'll get to that so we're gonna

00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:05,820
go through today we're gonna talk a

00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:07,860
little bit about why and and it's always

00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:09,270
important if I'm here to kind of

00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,130
convince you that maybe there's some

00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:12,990
things you want to do differently you

00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:14,640
probably need to understand why you

00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:17,100
would want to do them differently first

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,619
then we'll get into a bit of the what

00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,939
and there's a couple of things that

00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:23,430
we've noticed that our recipe for

00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:25,979
success first from a mindset perspective

00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:29,280
and then we'll actually get into some of

00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:31,409
the skill sets and tool sets around the

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,320
the practice of product marketing and

00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:38,850
then we'll conclude with some very

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:40,590
prescriptive next steps because I work

00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:42,240
for pivotal they have a lot of opinions

00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:48,090
so we like to be very prescriptive about

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:50,100
things so to understand why why does

00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:51,720
marketing your platform matter

00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:55,140
particularly for the team that is

00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:58,280
operating the platform and engineering

00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:02,909
all the automation around the platform

00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:05,899
so there's this movie it's like 30 years

00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:11,099
old now folks remember Field of Dreams

00:02:05,899 --> 00:02:12,660
Kevin Costner okay so it's a classic

00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:13,410
baseball movie and I realize like this

00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:16,110
is not

00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:17,790
the territory for baseball but this guy

00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:20,130
basically builds a baseball field

00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:22,860
because he has voices telling him that

00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:24,480
if he builds it these players will show

00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:26,070
up including like his father or

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,470
grandfather or something like that who

00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:32,430
he wants to have a relationship with

00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:35,100
it's really weird plot line frankly like

00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:38,550
you probably shouldn't go spend your

00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:43,290
life savings building sports facilities

00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:44,190
for ghosts but this idea of if you build

00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:47,220
it they will come

00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:48,360
or sure you know somehow magically we're

00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,020
gonna build something and people are

00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,430
gonna show up

00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:53,100
well it's Hollywood stuff it doesn't

00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:55,560
really work that way you may invest a

00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:57,540
bunch of time building a platform that

00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,970
either you think is what your developers

00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:01,890
need or you even have feedback is what

00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:03,740
your developers need but that doesn't

00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:06,390
mean that they're just gonna all show up

00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:08,850
so let's talk a little bit about what

00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:12,210
good looks like versus sometimes some of

00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:13,890
the things we hear now I will do a

00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:15,720
little bit of naming on the good side

00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:20,070
but we won't do the shaming on the

00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:23,160
not-so-good side the one that laser

00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:26,790
pointer works so over here this is some

00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:29,810
examples from t-mobile and they're now

00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:32,760
actually closer to 40 thousand

00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:34,470
applications instances running on their

00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,660
Cloud Foundry platform so this is a

00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:38,310
couple years old but the things that

00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:40,440
they identified when they were speaking

00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:42,209
even a couple years ago you'll notice

00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:45,810
was they made a lot of deliberate and

00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:47,670
conscious effort into how they attracted

00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:48,330
an onboard developers onto their

00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:50,790
platform

00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:52,680
they didn't leave it up to chance and so

00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:54,780
I think that and you can see from the

00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:58,080
adoption curve that they were able to

00:03:54,780 --> 00:04:00,750
enjoy in those early years you can see

00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,780
that those kinds of efforts paid off so

00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:05,280
there's a number of other customers I

00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:06,540
can think of that have sort of done

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,000
similar things where they've made

00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:10,950
conscious efforts to enable their

00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,890
developers to communicate regularly with

00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:16,890
their developers and to really bring the

00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:18,830
the developers in to what the platform

00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:22,289
was going to offer them on their terms

00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:25,740
now in contrast sometimes you know I

00:04:22,289 --> 00:04:26,160
hear things that are sort of indications

00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,390
that

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,420
you know some of the lines are not

00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:33,990
connecting between what the platform

00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:37,290
team is is trying to do and the people

00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:39,210
they're trying to do it for so you know

00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:41,280
sometimes you get this sort of top-down

00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:42,570
mandate where it's like okay we're

00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,920
supposed to we're supposed to have apps

00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:45,300
on the platform but you know we don't

00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,250
know which ones right so there's a

00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:50,850
there's indicative that there's a

00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:53,490
disconnect from who those customers are

00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:57,210
gonna be they haven't found their first

00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:58,890
customers I kind of live a little bit in

00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:00,720
the Silicon Valley bubble born and

00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:02,250
raised in the Bay Area so I'm surrounded

00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,260
by all these people who want to have

00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:07,440
startups and the fame and glory of that

00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:09,180
so I hear those kinds of patterns all

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,550
the time in the entrepreneurial world

00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:13,410
where folks you know they've got a fine

00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:14,880
and land those very first customers and

00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:17,580
they're almost building a bespoke

00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,770
service for them the man behind the

00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:21,030
curtain kind of approach where you know

00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:22,770
they're they're just trying to make sure

00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:24,690
that they're solving the problem they'll

00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:27,300
figure out how to automate it from there

00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:29,310
that type of thing means that they

00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:32,700
really know who those first customers

00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:34,740
are so another thing I've heard is okay

00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:38,250
you know so we we set up the platform

00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:40,530
and you know we've we've exposed it to

00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:42,600
all the developers we've got like 15% of

00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:43,919
them that are you know doing fine they

00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,300
seem to understand what these cloud

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:48,150
native patterns are they're off to the

00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:51,960
races 85% of them are pushing junk to

00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:54,419
the platform it's you know it the

00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,710
platform can keep it up Bosh is

00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:58,919
constantly resuscitating their

00:05:55,710 --> 00:06:00,930
application but behind the scenes it's

00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:02,700
chewing up a bunch of resources cuz it's

00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:04,380
constantly having to restart this stuff

00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:06,330
we wish that like they kind of

00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:08,640
understood the basic principles better

00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:10,650
it's like well they're not good they're

00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:12,450
not born understanding twelve factor

00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:14,160
they're not born understanding what a

00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:16,320
continuous integration pipeline should

00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,200
look like maybe you should teach that to

00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:21,810
them maybe you should enable them or

00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:24,120
things that you know sometimes I hear

00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:26,990
folks are listening to other users and

00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:30,780
moderate a user group for pivotal

00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:32,250
platform users and it's sometimes some

00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:33,419
of them are sharing all these things

00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,669
that they're doing with the developers

00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:36,720
and someone asks the questions like

00:06:34,669 --> 00:06:38,729
what's the one thing that's the most

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,230
scalable and effective thing that you're

00:06:38,729 --> 00:06:41,990
doing

00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:43,010
right there you're basically trying to

00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:45,800
find the Silver Bullet

00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:48,740
which is totally understandable but it

00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:51,530
means that they're missing kind of the

00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:55,340
realities of what it takes to attract

00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:57,860
developers to your offering did how many

00:06:55,340 --> 00:07:03,170
folks here saw coach A's talk yesterday

00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:05,540
about platformers product okay so this

00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:08,750
really dovetails what I'm going to talk

00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:10,580
about really dovetails with that notion

00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:13,610
you know the platform is product kind of

00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:15,770
concept encompasses a lot about how

00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:19,070
you're building for your developers but

00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:20,690
there's if you if you have a product you

00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:23,810
got to start the email product marketing

00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:26,780
so that tends to fall on the the product

00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:29,870
owner or the product manager of the

00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:32,450
platform products so let's talk a little

00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:35,240
bit about some of the the recipe for

00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:37,340
success patterns that we've noticed and

00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:40,460
some of this I'm just also deriving from

00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:43,460
what I do on a day to day basis and as a

00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:45,740
product marketer for pivotal and I've

00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:49,520
been product marketer at other companies

00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:51,650
before so you're getting you know eight

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,440
or so years of experience baked in here

00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:56,840
I am gonna make another

00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:59,540
baseball-reference because I don't think

00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,080
I really landed the I'm an American in

00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:04,400
Europe

00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:07,850
quite strongly enough so we're just

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:11,330
gonna keep going with it until you know

00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:15,260
everyone fully understands so there's

00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:18,170
this notion in baseball of your at-bats

00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:20,630
right every time you step up to the

00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:22,460
plate the pitcher you know throws throws

00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:27,440
the ball at you and you have your chance

00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:29,450
to have a hit if you like read or saw

00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,660
Moneyball you might have noticed that

00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:35,540
baseball is actually a very metrics

00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:38,410
oriented sport and the at-bats refers to

00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:42,830
okay you know your batting average is

00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:45,550
how many times you've hit divided by the

00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:48,950
number of times you've been at bat so

00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:50,720
one thing that sometimes you see people

00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:52,490
trying to do is they're trying to hit a

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,860
homerun the first time they've step

00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:56,600
to the plate so there they're trying to

00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:59,450
absolutely just kill it

00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:01,940
without being prepared to fail right and

00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:03,620
in baseball you fail all the time right

00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:05,150
there's a lot of reasons why you don't

00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:07,670
get a hit it doesn't mean that you're a

00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:11,720
bad player so really good batting

00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:14,060
averages might be you know a 0.3 zero

00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:15,680
something means that like seven out of

00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:17,900
ten times they're actually not getting a

00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:20,210
hit that's actually really good so this

00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:23,900
notion of what you want is you want more

00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:25,880
at-bats with your customers so that you

00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:28,100
have more opportunities to learn and

00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:30,080
iterate it's very similar to how you

00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,790
might approach building the products in

00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,550
terms of you want those feedback cycles

00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:36,230
the same thing applies to your

00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:39,170
communication strategy with your

00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:42,380
developers and the way that you might

00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:45,170
run programs and events to educate those

00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:47,150
developers you're not going to nail it

00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:50,720
on the first try and that's okay so

00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:55,100
embracing that mindset is more powerful

00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:59,480
than trying to pre optimize for a

00:09:55,100 --> 00:10:01,700
homerun the first time so you know

00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:03,380
gathering you know feedback and requests

00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:06,070
and just be prepared to constantly do

00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:08,810
that that goes hand in hand with this

00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:13,820
other concept that I've run to into

00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:15,710
where if you're not a marketer the turn

00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:17,360
there's a few terms that you maybe have

00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:19,730
picked up you've probably heard of a

00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,190
press release and you've probably heard

00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:24,650
the word a launch right and everyone

00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:27,230
kind of when you think of launch a lot

00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:30,710
of people's mind go to you know Steve

00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:34,100
Jobs in his black turtleneck in a you

00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:36,260
know dark scream background and he's got

00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,280
his beautiful I phone device or

00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,870
something that he's launching and he

00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:43,730
literally changes the world at any

00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:46,250
moment and so this is you're kind of the

00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:49,190
outsiders perception of a launch so

00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:52,010
reality is I mean even at a textbook

00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:53,480
level folks in the practice of written

00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:56,240
it well there's maybe six different

00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:58,160
kinds of launches it depends on what

00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,020
you're releasing and what you're

00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,060
changing and what the opportunity is and

00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:04,730
the other thing is that it's not a

00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:05,720
one-and-done experience it's constantly

00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:09,440
going back

00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:12,860
in front of those users and launching

00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,900
again launching differently and sort of

00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:16,610
opening up those channels of steady

00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:19,430
communication because as you're changing

00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:21,950
your platform you need to have those

00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:24,590
channels available to you to communicate

00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:26,450
that to your developers so that they're

00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:28,570
aware of these are the latest features

00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:30,620
that you should be taking advantage of

00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:33,890
here's how we've helped you succeed

00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:36,470
here's how we've listened to you we've

00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:40,070
heard you and we've solved your problems

00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:43,820
so embracing this notion of you're gonna

00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:47,330
be doing this really a European customer

00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:48,860
actually earlier this year I was you

00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:51,890
know moderating one of these user calls

00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:54,130
and he was the the the product manager

00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:56,630
and he said I spend 50% of my time

00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:58,100
marketing and it was a bit of a

00:11:56,630 --> 00:12:01,130
revelation for him but he didn't braced

00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:04,340
it now not everyone else in the call was

00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:06,880
really prepared for it but it reflected

00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:12,230
that yeah this is a big part of my job

00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:13,610
so I've got to do it come on in its we

00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:15,200
haven't really gotten into anything

00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:18,940
interesting yet you have missed all the

00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:22,130
baseball references though okay so

00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:25,160
another thing and anyone who's worked

00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:27,950
closely with me at doing any kind of

00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:32,870
marketing activities or launches knows

00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:34,880
that I love me some numbers so I'm a I'm

00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:37,870
a metrics girl and really a lot of

00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:41,360
marketing is a is a numbers game and so

00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:45,880
you you want to be prepared to use

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:48,530
numbers as part of your feedback because

00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:50,210
while getting feedback and taking a

00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:52,970
survey and you know tell me what your

00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:54,650
how you found out about this you know

00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:56,720
tell me what you want tell me how you

00:12:54,650 --> 00:13:00,680
like to be communicated to that's all

00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:04,610
fair and good but a lot of people their

00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:07,430
behavior speaks more clearly than what

00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:09,740
they're willing to articulate to you so

00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:12,250
if you have an internal wiki site this

00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:14,900
actually just came up earlier this week

00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:16,820
instrument that wiki site so that you're

00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:18,880
gathering metrics and you know what

00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:21,220
pages are people looking at

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,769
most frequently that's where your

00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:26,769
eyeballs are right and your you want to

00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:28,600
use that information so there's a number

00:13:26,769 --> 00:13:30,519
of things you want to measure which

00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,709
might be also part of just your your

00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:35,050
product practice of how many developers

00:13:32,709 --> 00:13:38,019
do we have how many applications do we

00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:40,389
have and how how are things doing in

00:13:38,019 --> 00:13:42,069
terms of you know are the applications

00:13:40,389 --> 00:13:43,720
being updated regularly like if that's

00:13:42,069 --> 00:13:45,870
one of our goals is to have a platform

00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:49,870
that allows our developers to change

00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:51,310
frequently are we measuring that now you

00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,690
might be saying well like we're doing

00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:55,420
all that anyways what does that have to

00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:57,430
do with marketing mmm those are powerful

00:13:55,420 --> 00:14:00,430
numbers when you're trying to recruit

00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:01,959
your next application team your next

00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:04,149
hundred developers that you're bringing

00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:05,800
on the platform so make sure you're

00:14:04,149 --> 00:14:07,509
measuring them so that you have proof

00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,940
you have evidence that it's like we've

00:14:07,509 --> 00:14:12,430
helped these hundred teams now we want

00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:14,259
to get the next thousand applications on

00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:16,149
the platform it's going to be a lot

00:14:14,259 --> 00:14:18,430
easier if we have proof and we have

00:14:16,149 --> 00:14:20,440
evidence so that's so the value that

00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:23,560
some of those those metrics can provide

00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:26,589
you another one that I came across

00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:28,899
recently is that a team out in

00:14:26,589 --> 00:14:31,990
California is using is they started

00:14:28,899 --> 00:14:34,000
using a Net Promoter Score and part of

00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:37,089
this was actually about the the platform

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,540
team shifting their mindset to really

00:14:37,089 --> 00:14:42,220
grok that the developers weren't just

00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:44,709
like happy with whatever they were

00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:47,110
putting out there and that this was

00:14:44,709 --> 00:14:48,579
really you know about embracing that

00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:49,930
product mindset and this is their

00:14:48,579 --> 00:14:51,699
product that they're building and these

00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:54,399
are their customers so you probably

00:14:51,699 --> 00:14:57,579
notice Net Promoter Score sort of

00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:59,769
surveys in lots of places they're used

00:14:57,579 --> 00:15:02,560
by marketing departments it's usually a

00:14:59,769 --> 00:15:04,839
marketing intelligence function where we

00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:07,720
want to understand how likely are you to

00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:09,880
recommend this to your friends and

00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:13,089
family right how likely are you to

00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:17,160
recommend this platform to another

00:15:13,089 --> 00:15:21,639
developer in your office so that

00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:23,920
feedback can tell you a lot of things

00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:26,470
both in terms of just how you're going

00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:28,360
to manage the products but you have to

00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:31,029
realize that's a that's a marketing

00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:32,740
function that is just used by product

00:15:31,029 --> 00:15:34,589
teams so that kind of thing I

00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:36,670
I think is really interesting to see

00:15:34,589 --> 00:15:40,000
organically bubbling up amongst

00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:41,860
different platform teams around the

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,260
world and then of course you know can

00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:46,810
you tie it to the dollars now this is

00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:48,810
useful because sometimes you're not just

00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:51,250
marketing your platform to developers

00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:53,010
sure those are your users those are the

00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:55,420
ones you're trying to attract their

00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:58,029
application workload on to the platform

00:15:55,420 --> 00:16:00,220
but you also have to market the platform

00:15:58,029 --> 00:16:02,410
to the business leaders and the decision

00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:03,940
makers whether they're in the lines of

00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:05,800
business that own the application or

00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:07,420
they're an infrastructure team that

00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:10,330
might be just you know your own

00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:12,100
superiors in your chain of command you

00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:15,070
need to be able to market to them that

00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:19,089
this platform is successful so can you

00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:21,670
tie the platform to dollars somewhere or

00:16:19,089 --> 00:16:24,070
euros or pounds sterling or whatever

00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:26,020
currency you want to but the point is

00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:29,080
how are you measuring the business value

00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:30,970
can you can you demonstrate where this

00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:33,820
is reducing cost can you demonstrate

00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:36,279
where this is opening up growth and new

00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:39,820
revenue streams all of that is valuable

00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:42,190
information not just so that you know it

00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:44,380
but so that you can go and attract that

00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:45,970
those developers and you can attract new

00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:47,920
lines of business within a large

00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:49,899
organization sure a lot of folks here

00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,720
and large companies that have multiple

00:16:49,899 --> 00:16:55,450
operating divisions maybe one group is

00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,790
using Cloud Foundry but there's six

00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:59,410
other operating divisions that aren't

00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:01,240
how are you going to win them over

00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:04,480
at a senior executive level you need a

00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:07,630
strong business case okay so the last

00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:11,709
sort of philosophical thing before I get

00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:15,100
into more tactical approaches is the

00:17:11,709 --> 00:17:18,520
idea of doing some things that don't

00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:20,230
scale as well as things that scale when

00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:22,829
you think of marketing you often think

00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:25,870
of a sort of one-to-many

00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:28,929
you know channel or style of

00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:32,080
communicating as opposed to you know a

00:17:28,929 --> 00:17:33,990
sales organization might be hey I'm one

00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,700
customer to one person we have a very

00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:39,400
one-to-one relationship the marketing

00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:41,410
organization doesn't you know own that

00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:44,640
particular relationship they've got a

00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:45,870
broadcast it's all about broadcasting

00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,750
[Music]

00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:51,390
it seems like it's all about scale and

00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:54,960
don't get me wrong that's important but

00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:57,750
when you're learning about what works

00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:00,420
it's sometimes helpful to do some things

00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:02,790
that don't scale you know recognize that

00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:05,250
that's what you're doing and so that you

00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:07,380
don't get yourself caught in you know of

00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:11,490
Wow everything we're doing is in scale

00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:13,470
an example I like to point to is Airbnb

00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:16,200
this was written up actually several

00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:18,000
years ago about in the early days of

00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,650
Airbnb they ran into this interesting

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,020
challenge where they were trying to

00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:24,090
attract they had to attract hosts before

00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:26,610
they could attract guests but ultimately

00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:28,590
they wanted transactions and what they

00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:31,290
were finding is people weren't really

00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:33,140
booking a lot of stays so they went out

00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:36,870
to New York they they got a professional

00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:38,880
you know photographer camera and they

00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:40,980
they went like door-to-door to the

00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,500
people who had listings and they help

00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:45,330
them take nicer pictures as people were

00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:47,460
putting kind of crappy pictures up of

00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:49,890
their New York apartments and lo and

00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:52,590
behold people were not booking them they

00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:56,160
did that and they are they directly

00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:59,370
attribute like by solving it in New York

00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:01,559
they set off a chain reaction in all

00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:03,660
these other markets where people started

00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:05,910
to figure out oh this is this is helping

00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:09,630
to get bookings we need better pictures

00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:12,210
we just need glossy or materials so that

00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:16,050
this looks good to the people were

00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:17,670
trying to market to and so to get it

00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:19,320
started they had to do something that

00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:20,820
ultimately was never gonna scale they

00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:23,670
were never gonna have to go to every

00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:28,080
single host and take their pictures for

00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:31,290
them but starting off testing it seeing

00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:33,900
what the response was not only helped

00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:36,300
solve that issue but it's set off kind

00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:39,750
of a positive change across their

00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:42,240
network and then you balance this with

00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:44,610
the things that do scale right so when

00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,190
when you can you run an event where you

00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:49,710
can get twenty or a hundred people in

00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:50,400
the room to educate them all at the same

00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:52,320
time

00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,090
can you send out a newsletter that can

00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,580
go to you know thousands of internal

00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:58,350
developers and help raise their

00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:59,700
awareness of the platform and new

00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:02,670
features

00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:05,520
Brandin right is a very scalable thing

00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:08,220
you know you create one logo identity

00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,780
for your platform and it gets reinforced

00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:13,140
every time you use it

00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:15,000
so you you want to do both is really the

00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:16,920
answer be conscious about where you're

00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,770
taking something on that's like this

00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:22,410
isn't gonna scale but let's try it and

00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:24,300
see what we can learn and see if we can

00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:26,970
then figure out how to make this scale

00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:29,970
later okay so let's get into some

00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:31,820
tactics and we're gonna actually go

00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:35,820
through these tactics from the least

00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:38,790
scalable to the most scalable we're

00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:41,580
gonna start with office hours office

00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:43,350
hours are definitely something that as a

00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:46,550
product manager you're getting a lot of

00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:50,340
great feedback about the product itself

00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:52,950
but you can also test messaging in these

00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:56,100
grooves you can start to understand when

00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:59,280
we talk about the product like this how

00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:00,960
do they respond can we understand and

00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,090
get better articulation of their pain

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,100
points because that's going to feed into

00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:07,980
the messaging that we will use with the

00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:10,460
masses so you can approach these office

00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:15,270
hours not just as I'm getting feature

00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:17,730
specific feature feedback but how how is

00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:22,770
this whole story communicated on a

00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:24,660
one-on-one basis so then kind of inching

00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:26,910
up a little bit now we get to workshops

00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:28,770
right we go from just working with one

00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:31,140
team at a time now we can bring it

00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:33,420
several teams in education and an

00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:35,250
enablement is you know especially when

00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:37,530
you're dealing with a complex products

00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:40,500
that requires change on the part of the

00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:42,630
user you need to be prepared to include

00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:45,450
a lot of enablement in your marketing

00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:47,040
efforts and so running workshops

00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:49,710
regularly and realizing like this does

00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:51,750
not want and done so this is something

00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:54,240
you're gonna probably be doing regularly

00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:55,890
and it will probably have to evolve but

00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,540
how can you do it in a way that's

00:21:55,890 --> 00:22:02,520
relatively rinse and repeat and

00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:03,990
repeatable okay then newsletters so this

00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:07,290
is something that folks use all the time

00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:10,320
in in the marketing context because it's

00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:11,760
establishing a regular cadence with your

00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:15,120
audience

00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:18,450
that you can funnel information into now

00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:20,880
there's some things that some common

00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:22,920
mistakes people make with newsletters

00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:25,410
I've seen when customers have tried to

00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:27,420
do this on their own what you find is

00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:29,850
it's like there's there's 20 or 30

00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:32,000
things in the newsletter no one's

00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:34,530
reading all those newsletters right oh

00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,860
we do this in marketing all the time or

00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:38,940
we're constantly testing or a/b testing

00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:41,010
different material and seeing like what

00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:43,470
what gets people to click on things more

00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:46,140
again comes back to all those metrics

00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:47,520
and numbers those are your friend but

00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:50,010
what we find are things like when you've

00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,930
got more like 6 to 8 things in the

00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:55,920
newsletter people are going to click on

00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:57,540
more so you really want to hone down if

00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:01,200
you're going to run a newsletter

00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:02,400
internally to update your developers you

00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,250
want to make sure you're you're

00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:07,080
prioritizing right you sorry you can't

00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:09,630
just give them everything you you're

00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:12,690
gonna have that temptation resist that

00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:16,710
urge take some really deep breaths and

00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:19,590
then delete stuff out of that draft and

00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:21,720
just don't be afraid it's gonna work out

00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:23,430
ok so you have to make those decisions

00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:25,980
you also have to remember who your

00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:27,270
audience is and so are you putting the

00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:29,100
things in there that are interesting to

00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:31,740
you are you putting things in there that

00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:35,490
are interesting to your readers those

00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:36,900
are not always the same thing so one

00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:41,250
thing we've actually started to do

00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:45,710
recently at pivotal is I now curate and

00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:50,820
like an 80% done developer newsletter

00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:53,550
that the the teams at our accounts can

00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:54,750
take finalized they can we can do the

00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:56,550
whole redo the whole thing if they

00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:59,160
really want to but at least I've given

00:23:56,550 --> 00:24:01,020
them something that's 80% done because a

00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:02,310
lot of enterprise developers have some

00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:04,110
common things so I'll put them in the

00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:09,150
monthly newsletter and then let them

00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:10,710
finish it from there let's see cover

00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:13,860
everything yeah keep it short keep it

00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:16,560
relevant focus on those upskilling

00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:18,300
things right coming back to that you

00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:21,030
know 15% of our developers are doing

00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:22,890
great but 85% are pushing junk right

00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:24,410
it's like remember this is your

00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:27,020
opportunity to

00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:28,550
fix the junk right what are the common

00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:31,880
mistakes that you're seeing that they're

00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:35,420
making and use this as like hey we found

00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:40,460
this great article about how to not do

00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:41,870
junk and and then include that and then

00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:43,640
you also include all the things that are

00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:45,410
very specific to the product you're

00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:48,560
building you know include those success

00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:50,420
stories include those metrics you know

00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:52,100
get people excited about the platform

00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:54,680
that they're running on and of course

00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:56,330
include like hey new feature right you

00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:59,180
know take advantage of this or hey

00:24:56,330 --> 00:25:01,580
important thing you should do so that

00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:03,230
you don't you know like have your

00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:06,110
applications disrupted because we have

00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:08,180
to make a change and then as I mentioned

00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:11,030
before branding is an extremely scalable

00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:13,520
thing it's also something that can be

00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:16,580
very difficult to change as people know

00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:19,850
like when a tech company changes their

00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:24,110
logo like you know the Twittersphere is

00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:26,990
like all about the opinions and so I I

00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:28,820
don't envy anyone who has to like go

00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:33,050
through that process also product naming

00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:35,270
really sucks but you have to name it and

00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:39,260
yeah you do want to put an identity on

00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:43,520
it and it will feed into like greater

00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:46,100
awareness of this thing as a as a as a

00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:47,960
thing right as opposed to just like the

00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,710
way we you've always done it but now

00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,870
they're asking me to do something

00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:53,080
difference like no this is new this is a

00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:56,150
new way of working and it's got a name

00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:58,610
the other thing I've seen is sometimes

00:25:56,150 --> 00:26:02,780
even the team that's working on it they

00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:04,730
kind of have an Associated identity this

00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:06,770
is not unlike for example a pivotal

00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:08,930
you'll often hear the people working at

00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:12,050
pivotal referred to as pivots right so a

00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:13,730
pivot is a thing pivotal and then the

00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:16,360
pivotal platform these are all different

00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:18,710
things that are related etcetera so

00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:19,790
those are those are important things to

00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:23,330
think about we've kind of moved through

00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:27,920
a bunch of useful tactics quick time

00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:32,180
check all right product marketing just a

00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:35,330
couple couple basics when you are

00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:37,640
marketing a products there's three main

00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:39,620
areas three main quests

00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:42,290
that I like to make sure I answered and

00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:44,240
then if I'm jumping in and helping out

00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:46,370
with a new product I'll often do a

00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:48,800
mapping against these three questions

00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:52,070
for all the assets that collateral the

00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:54,620
the pages the internal assets you know

00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:57,170
web you know public facing things white

00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:59,210
papers presentations webinars whatever

00:26:57,170 --> 00:27:01,070
I'm gonna map it against these three

00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:04,070
questions to make sure like are we

00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:07,220
answering these all the way across the

00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:09,590
first thing is the why to understand the

00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:10,880
why the most important thing you need to

00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:14,450
focus on is the pain

00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:16,670
where are your users that you're trying

00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:18,650
to attract where are they hurting right

00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:21,980
what hurts them the most because

00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:24,500
ultimately fixing that pain is the why

00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:26,210
that is why they're coming to you now

00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:29,450
there may also be something that is

00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:31,340
here's some you know self actualization

00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:33,950
level that you can also achieve right

00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:36,500
using maslov's hierarchy that might also

00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:40,100
be not a pain point but we can help you

00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:43,970
with but largely the the quickest sort

00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:46,580
of path to adoption is identifying what

00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:48,950
is the pain that they're feeling right

00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:51,170
is it taking too long to get access to

00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:55,250
various services is it taking too long

00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:58,010
to push to production is it taking too

00:27:55,250 --> 00:28:00,080
long you get the idea so make sure that

00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:02,810
you identify that pain use those office

00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:05,270
hours to tease out what what are your

00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:07,910
biggest pain points right now and the

00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:09,680
words as much as you as possible listen

00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:11,870
very carefully to the words that those

00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:13,610
users are using those words are your

00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:17,180
friends they would always say it better

00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:19,790
than you probably can so the next thing

00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:23,180
is answering the what what is the thing

00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:26,270
right we've built this platform you want

00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:27,950
to be able to answer succinctly what is

00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:31,220
this thing okay maybe you've even given

00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:34,610
it a name remember as you're answering

00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:37,010
the what it is connect it back to the

00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:40,970
pain right this is a way of solving this

00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:43,310
pain and then finally you get into the

00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:44,210
hell right and especially folks who are

00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:46,040
more technical

00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:48,980
they often love to jump into the house

00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:50,990
first but they haven't always answered

00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:53,720
the why do I want to do

00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:57,890
differently and what is this thing you

00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:59,420
want me to push my application to so the

00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:01,130
house sometimes feels like the easy

00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:03,260
thing when you're talking about a group

00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:05,270
of platform engineers but I'm just gonna

00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:07,730
add a little bit of something maybe that

00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:11,300
you haven't thought of and that is

00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:14,750
basically how dopamine works for

00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:16,550
developers which is if they don't have

00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:18,200
that hello world you're asking them to

00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:20,330
do something new they haven't gone that

00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:22,940
first hello world dopamine hit in about

00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:25,070
two hours they're probably gonna start

00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:27,320
to back away and it's gonna be really

00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:29,960
hard to get them to invest that next

00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:31,790
level of trying something new and

00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:34,820
learning and changing their own behavior

00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:38,720
so as you approach building out your how

00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:41,270
resources think about getting that two

00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:43,429
hour ish give or take hello world

00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:44,960
experience so that's the first taste

00:29:43,429 --> 00:29:46,730
that someone can get it's probably with

00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,230
an app that's just a sample app right

00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:49,940
you're not gonna ask them day one

00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:51,679
take that thing that you're working on

00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:53,059
that's like really important to the

00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:55,970
business and let's just go try and push

00:29:53,059 --> 00:29:58,460
it on the platform right get them that's

00:29:55,970 --> 00:30:01,640
that basic CF push experience in two

00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:02,630
hours use it with a sample app once they

00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:04,190
kind of get that a little bit of that

00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:06,350
wind in the hair and then it's like okay

00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:07,700
this is interesting now you give them a

00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:09,620
little bit more you show them how to do

00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:12,200
a couple more changes the two day

00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:13,730
dopamine hit then you can get to the two

00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,830
week dopamine head which is going to

00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:19,040
require them to do a lot more work so

00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:22,000
thinking about things of two hours two

00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:26,660
days two weeks it's easier to remember

00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:29,080
okay my detailed prescriptive next steps

00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:32,690
I'm not going to go through all these

00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:35,750
but I've tried to think through all of

00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:37,370
this stuff now you might be doing a lot

00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:39,080
of this you probably are kind of

00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:40,850
gathering some metrics here and there

00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:42,470
you've probably got some things in place

00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:44,210
for how you communicate with developers

00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:47,540
you're not starting from zero I

00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:49,550
recognize that but I've published my

00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:53,330
slides to the know you know the Cloud

00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:55,370
Foundry summit site this might be just a

00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:56,540
useful wave for wherever you're starting

00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:58,429
to think about okay in the next ten days

00:30:56,540 --> 00:31:00,950
let's let's get that first office hours

00:30:58,429 --> 00:31:03,260
going right we're not going to you know

00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:05,000
publish our first newsletter

00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:08,090
and solve some of the bigger harder

00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,740
things but let's get the the quick kind

00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:12,200
of feedback session and start to capture

00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:14,510
maybe do a quick inventory of what you

00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:16,820
do have etc and then what can you do in

00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:19,220
30 days what can you do in 90 days and

00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:22,610
with this you know quick program you'll

00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:25,100
you know lose 20 pounds and you know

00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:26,870
grow taller and have more developers on

00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:29,870
your platform you know I guarantee it

00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:32,450
I'm just kidding but I think you'll be

00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:34,070
able to get feedback that you can

00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:36,350
incorporate into how you're

00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:38,960
communicating with your developers that

00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:40,790
should help solve how do we how are we

00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:44,360
regularly attracting new developers to

00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:46,480
the platform ok got a number of

00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:50,900
resources I've started to publish

00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:53,090
publicly about this for years I never

00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:56,480
would have assumed that what I actually

00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:58,010
do for my livelihood directly mattered

00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:01,040
so much to the people that I'm usually

00:31:58,010 --> 00:32:02,060
working with but I've learned that

00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:04,640
that's actually not true

00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:09,260
so now I'm starting to sort of share my

00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:10,610
secrets as a product marketer and you

00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:13,430
know just some other good stuff that's

00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:15,470
out there that sort of speaks to how to

00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:17,480
kind of wrap your head around this the

00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:19,910
big thing I would ask is that you just

00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:22,850
you kind of make room in your mindset

00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:24,320
that this is part of your job it's not a

00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:27,550
one and done you're gonna do it all the

00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:30,140
time it's actually can be really fun and

00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:33,620
it's I think most fun when you measure

00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:35,900
it because then you see progress and

00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:38,420
I'll just leave you with if you in a

00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:40,670
month can make it out to Austin Texas I

00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:42,920
know it's a bit of a haul from here I'd

00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:44,660
love to see you I've got a two hundred

00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:49,610
dollar discount code offspring one

00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:52,150
platform for you to join us that's it

00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:52,150
thank you

00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:57,180
