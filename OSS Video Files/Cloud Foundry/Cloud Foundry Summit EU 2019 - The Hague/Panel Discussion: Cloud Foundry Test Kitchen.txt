Title: Panel Discussion: Cloud Foundry Test Kitchen
Publication date: 2019-09-13
Playlist: Cloud Foundry Summit EU 2019 - The Hague
Description: 
	Panel Discussion: Cloud Foundry Test Kitchen - Bernd Krannich, SAP SE; Cornelia Davis, Pivotal; Simon Moser, IBM; Jeff Hobbs, SUSE and Moderated by Swarna Podila, Cloud Foundry Foundation 

The integration of Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes was a major, recurring topic at each of the last few CF summits. Earlier panel discussions created quite some interest: “Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes - Will it blend?” (http://sched.co/DdZr, https://youtu.be/4ow7IumxkOM), "Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes - Did it blend?" (https://sched.co/FRyD, https://youtu.be/QkQe3354Y6Q) and "Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes - The blending continues" (https://sched.co/KJCZ, https://youtu.be/WWidgdvzjOI)  It turned out that new technology components for Cloud Foundry not only come from the Kubernetes ecosystem. In a sequel to the panel discussions, representatives of major companies in the CF ecosystem will reconvene to assess the status of the evolution of Cloud Foundry, the progress that has been made since the last summit, and provide updates to the visions the companies have for the future of Cloud Foundry.

well actually because this way I can

00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:07,350
actually read it to just face this this

00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,970
preface this is our start off slide to

00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:12,450
give us a bit of context so I'll read

00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:14,519
through some of the gives them a little

00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:19,050
background context it's a Twitter this

00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:21,539
is September 2016 and it starts off with

00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:25,080
gaben ROI from Microsoft actually he

00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:28,289
wasn't at Microsoft yet then yeah he was

00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:30,599
still dais and at the very top it's

00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:33,120
saying I had some signals from the ad

00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:36,230
Cloud Foundry ecosystem might move in

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:39,120
the kubernetes direction guess not

00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:44,430
because he's responding to a TechCrunch

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:47,910
article then yeah so yes at the time I

00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:50,579
was with HPE there was a project called

00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:53,850
CF furnace which we actually did with

00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:56,640
IBM and we had proposed a talk to cube

00:00:53,850 --> 00:01:00,180
con hey let's get Cloud Foundry running

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:03,239
on kubernetes and that was called CF

00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:08,040
furnace for I guess the firestorm had

00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:11,430
started the the highlighted tweed in the

00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:13,619
middle is Sam Ramji the CEO of the

00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:15,600
foundation at the time saying that

00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:19,259
refers to CF furnace which is a research

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,250
project it was yeah it's open source but

00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:22,590
dead on arrival

00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:25,170
as Michael Franco well knows from

00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:26,850
TechCrunch and he he led in later

00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:29,159
comments you know someone says but

00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,780
that's not correct based on my info it's

00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:33,229
like well you're welcome to check as CEO

00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:44,759
of cloud foundry I possess the facts

00:01:33,229 --> 00:01:46,560
2016 will then continue to no that's do

00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:51,899
you believe it there yeah there for

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:53,939
posterity here anyway all right um

00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:57,869
how many of you have been in this panel

00:01:53,939 --> 00:02:00,469
discussion in the past Jules you were

00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:00,469
there liar

00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:07,530
okay it used to be it started with

00:02:03,829 --> 00:02:09,539
barons idea and it used to be called the

00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:11,400
will it blend panel because the

00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:13,920
discussion back then was about will

00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,590
kubernetes and Cloud Foundry blend and

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,840
he kind of took after the willand land

00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:20,310
youtube series I don't know how how many

00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,420
of you here are familiar with the will

00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:24,000
it blend

00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:28,170
is anyone here that does not know the

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,730
bullet blend series okay so for those of

00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:32,819
you there were a few hands for those of

00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:34,830
you that does not know that on YouTube

00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:36,950
there's I don't know who that person's

00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:39,989
now what that person's name is but they

00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:42,239
literally take let's say an iPhone and

00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:43,890
put it in a blender and turn it on

00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,900
because they want to see will it blend

00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:48,180
like will it crash into pieces they just

00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,920
do all sorts of bizarre things and I'm

00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:54,269
pretty sure they do good things as well

00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:55,620
so the initial discussion kind of

00:02:54,269 --> 00:02:57,510
started with will these two technologies

00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:59,549
blend or should it blend kind of thing

00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:01,349
and we kind of made this a tradition to

00:02:59,549 --> 00:03:04,620
have this panel discussion at every

00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:06,390
summit it started in Boston and I was a

00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,769
newbie at the time it with the

00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:09,570
foundation so I had no clue what

00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:11,579
questions I was asking I just kept

00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:13,590
asking because I was told to ask some

00:03:11,579 --> 00:03:15,989
questions but over the past few years at

00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:19,290
least I have gained some experience so

00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:21,630
we've renamed it back in Philly

00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:25,170
yeah back in Philly our early this year

00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:27,359
we decided to rename the panel because

00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:30,090
it kind of moved on from just blending

00:03:27,359 --> 00:03:31,709
these two things to having a little more

00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:33,630
and it was kind of an experimental

00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:35,670
kitchen because project ireenie was

00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:37,620
their project quarks was there and there

00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:39,840
were discussions about the cloud native

00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:41,489
bill packs project is also going on so

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,319
there were there are one to many

00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:46,310
projects that are going on in the

00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:49,260
ecosystem not just the cloud foundry and

00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:52,290
kubernetes projects so that's when kind

00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:54,600
of folks decided that okay let's call it

00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:56,430
a cloud foundry Test Kitchen because in

00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:59,250
this Test Kitchen we were experimenting

00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:01,139
a lot of recipes I kind of imagined one

00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:03,870
of yours dr. Jekyll and Hyde in

00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:06,180
experimenting with a lot of things but

00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:08,549
anyway I will said the reason we also

00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:10,260
have an extended time for this session

00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:12,989
and the reason why I'm not sitting there

00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:13,420
is because we want we want all of you to

00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:16,180
ask

00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:18,100
so I will start off with a kind of basic

00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:20,739
question so that I gives you time to

00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:23,440
think of the questions what you want to

00:04:20,739 --> 00:04:27,130
ask I don't I honestly don't have many

00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:30,610
questions prepared I am relying on you

00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:36,520
to continue the discussion here so I'll

00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:46,360
just start off with my basic one we've

00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:48,220
seen all these okay please do hello

00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,410
everyone my name is Cornelia Davis I

00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:52,600
work for pivotal I've been with pivotal

00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:54,340
since the spinoff I came there from EMC

00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,830
where I worked in the corporate CTO

00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:58,630
office doing architecture and emerging

00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:02,229
tech and to a large extent that's what I

00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:04,990
still do at pivotal I do that in the

00:05:02,229 --> 00:05:07,139
context of I'm about 50% field facing

00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:09,760
spend time with customers and partners

00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:11,770
and then the rest of the time internal

00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:15,070
facing helping to drive our product

00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:18,180
strategy and there's been a lot of

00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:21,130
emerging tech since pivotal was spun off

00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:22,840
six and a half years ago initially that

00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:26,650
emerging tech was why we're all here

00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:28,539
cloud foundry and more recently that

00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:33,130
emerging tech has been kubernetes and

00:05:28,539 --> 00:05:35,380
friends and really my focus is on how do

00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:36,910
we tie that to business value because

00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:38,919
otherwise those are just interesting

00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:40,120
tech projects but it's when we get

00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:45,090
business value that it gets really

00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:47,200
interesting hi I'm Jeff Hobbs with souza

00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:49,630
director in the advanced solutions group

00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:52,090
which includes cloud foundry in

00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:56,289
kubernetes both my responsibilities at

00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:59,380
Souza and you've been in in the space

00:05:56,289 --> 00:06:01,990
for a while working on and innovating

00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:05,320
around Cloud Foundry since it was open

00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:07,479
sourced and just trying to always build

00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:10,510
sort of innovative solutions around that

00:06:07,479 --> 00:06:12,669
and innovating more in it as we try and

00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:15,910
address the developer experience for

00:06:12,669 --> 00:06:18,789
other enterprises hi my name is Pam

00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:21,880
Connie working at sa P as a technical

00:06:18,789 --> 00:06:24,909
lead in the SAV cloud platform been with

00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:27,509
sa P for I guess 21 years which kind of

00:06:24,909 --> 00:06:29,829
makes me a veteran I guess

00:06:27,509 --> 00:06:33,059
working in the cloud foundry ecosystems

00:06:29,829 --> 00:06:35,709
since I guess the foundation was created

00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:39,639
2014 maybe even a bit before the

00:06:35,709 --> 00:06:42,159
foundation creation working with like

00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:45,129
these people but then also like many

00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:48,399
people inside the companies that make up

00:06:45,129 --> 00:06:51,519
the foundation to yeah essentially get

00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:56,169
cloud foundry and kubernetes going and

00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:58,449
this is like not so much of an effort

00:06:56,169 --> 00:07:00,909
that like individuals drive but this is

00:06:58,449 --> 00:07:04,119
really a community effort that's that's

00:07:00,909 --> 00:07:06,489
going on there all right

00:07:04,119 --> 00:07:09,909
and my name is Simon Moser I work for

00:07:06,489 --> 00:07:14,169
IBM since I don't know I think 15 years

00:07:09,909 --> 00:07:17,610
or something like that so that in the

00:07:14,169 --> 00:07:24,159
Cloud Foundry ecosystem since I think

00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:28,629
2015 14 15 something so maybe just after

00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:30,999
burned and joint there - in my day job

00:07:28,629 --> 00:07:34,509
I'm responsible for running the IBM

00:07:30,999 --> 00:07:36,459
cloud foundry service which is a public

00:07:34,509 --> 00:07:37,959
cloud service offering where you can

00:07:36,459 --> 00:07:41,199
just push your applications onto a cloud

00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:43,029
foundry hosted thing but also doing a

00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:47,289
lot of community work and hanging out

00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:49,299
with these people all the time yes the

00:07:47,289 --> 00:07:56,139
foundation is gonna be five years old

00:07:49,299 --> 00:07:58,809
come January so last year introducing

00:07:56,139 --> 00:08:01,119
myself thank you I'm sort of Padilha I

00:07:58,809 --> 00:08:03,309
work as a community manager for the

00:08:01,119 --> 00:08:05,469
Cloud Foundry foundation I worked for

00:08:03,309 --> 00:08:07,059
the foundation I'm not affiliated with

00:08:05,469 --> 00:08:09,339
any of the members but I do work with

00:08:07,059 --> 00:08:13,689
all of you so I'm you know you've seen

00:08:09,339 --> 00:08:17,099
my face last year or earlier this year

00:08:13,689 --> 00:08:19,839
in Philly if someone had told me that

00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:21,909
there would be the demo that Simon did

00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:24,189
today on keynote stage I would have

00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:26,860
probably assumed they're lying but here

00:08:24,189 --> 00:08:32,319
we are so with all those changes the

00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:34,689
whole IBM openshift devil and the VMware

00:08:32,319 --> 00:08:37,149
move of its intent of acquiring pivotal

00:08:34,689 --> 00:08:39,339
I will start with first Simon kind of

00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:40,729
tell me what you see the state of this

00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:42,500
whole blending look

00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:45,769
like because it has now gone beyond just

00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:48,860
kubernetes in Cloud Foundry whoa that's

00:08:45,769 --> 00:08:52,010
a tough one to start with so I'll try I

00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:54,110
mean okay so I I think actually we you

00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:58,250
know looking back when we started out

00:08:54,110 --> 00:09:01,279
with what eventually came up to become

00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:05,420
project irony right and actually it goes

00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:08,810
back to the tweet that we just saw I

00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:10,370
think if there is a good reason why

00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:11,660
we're not talking about blending anymore

00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:14,209
because the planning is actually

00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:18,649
happened and there is commercial

00:09:14,209 --> 00:09:21,290
offerings out there iBM has one Suzy has

00:09:18,649 --> 00:09:23,990
one and a bunch of other companies too

00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:26,149
or at least are on the way to get there

00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:28,240
to basically ship an entire cloud formed

00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:30,440
a foundation as a containerized solution

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,209
and not Foundation if not probably a

00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:34,370
platform as a containerized solution on

00:09:32,209 --> 00:09:37,519
top of communities so I think we are we

00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:40,910
are beyond the blending stage right we

00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:44,870
kind of realized as a community and most

00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:47,060
people here in the room as well that you

00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:48,500
know having kubernetes as the backend

00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:50,959
scheduler for your Cloud Foundry

00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:53,149
developer experience is a great idea and

00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,920
that's probably what we should go doing

00:09:53,149 --> 00:09:57,620
forward so I think we're well past the

00:09:54,920 --> 00:10:00,069
blending stage from that perspective

00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:02,899
going back to the little technology

00:10:00,069 --> 00:10:07,360
experiment that I've been showing this

00:10:02,899 --> 00:10:10,130
morning on stage on the keynote stage it

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,990
this is going to be you know just

00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:14,440
another proof point that the technology

00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:17,870
that we have been building and you know

00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:21,680
quarks is in the picture here ireenie is

00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:23,569
in the picture here actually works quite

00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,510
well because you have an underlying

00:10:23,569 --> 00:10:28,519
standard and to attack from a technical

00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:29,930
perspective and openshift platform is

00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:32,240
actually not that different from a

00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:35,139
native for plain kubernetes platform so

00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:38,000
it was not that much effort to you know

00:10:35,139 --> 00:10:42,230
take that step that I demonstrated this

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,060
morning from that perspective I think

00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:47,600
like I said it we're well beyond the

00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:50,510
blending stage and I think what we as a

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,939
community have to ask ourselves is what

00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:54,200
are the next steps going to be right so

00:10:52,939 --> 00:10:57,980
and when I

00:10:54,200 --> 00:11:00,050
that I had this discussion this morning

00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:01,040
at the new Stax pancake pancake

00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:03,820
breakfast

00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:07,610
what complicated what pancake breakfast

00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:10,370
where we are looking at okay what could

00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:12,890
be the next step for the Cloud Foundry

00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:17,240
community right like where do we have to

00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:19,190
extend our programming models is you

00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:21,110
know for example serverless functions

00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:24,110
something that we need to get into the

00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:27,650
you know into the into our programming

00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:31,730
model into our platform do we need

00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:34,730
further alignments with other open

00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:37,610
source initiatives like let's say East

00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:39,590
EO or pick your other pic you either

00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:42,170
pick a different favorite project

00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:46,640
because I think one of the strengths of

00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:49,600
our community is actually that cloud

00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:52,190
foundry has been proven to be able to

00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:55,670
adopt latest and greatest technology

00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:57,950
multiple times by now and be able to

00:11:55,670 --> 00:12:00,290
integrate that technology still

00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:02,810
preserving the Cloud Foundry developer

00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:05,390
experience ease of use maintainability

00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:07,760
and and all of that and I think if we

00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:09,530
just continue doing so and be open to

00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,770
you know other new technology that comes

00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:16,610
up that's kind of like I think where

00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:18,410
we're going this was your idea right the

00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:20,360
panel discussion so how have you seen

00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:22,250
the whole thing about so I would

00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:24,740
definitely agree to to what Simon said

00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:26,960
kind of borrowing from the analogy I

00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:29,150
would say like now the question in the

00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:31,970
Test Kitchen is what are all the recipes

00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:33,860
that we are about to to create but like

00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:38,210
one thing is definitely as a Simon has

00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:40,460
shown taking kubernetes and then Cloud

00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:43,610
Foundry and spinning up completely new

00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:46,790
systems for like new people and then I

00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:48,830
see also that other scenario of many

00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:50,630
people already have a Cloud Foundry

00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:52,880
system being deployed managed with

00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:55,220
Porsche and up and running with

00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,870
productive scenarios so like the other

00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:59,990
recipe that I think we as a community

00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:02,210
need to develop is to come up with a

00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:05,870
strategy of how such a system will

00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:07,529
evolve over time into potentially that

00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:09,930
very same thing that

00:13:07,529 --> 00:13:12,749
Simon has shown a thing that runs solely

00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:15,120
on on kubernetes and and as I guess many

00:13:12,749 --> 00:13:17,189
detailed questions in that recipe that

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,620
still need to be answered in order to to

00:13:17,189 --> 00:13:22,499
get there so I see that as an important

00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:25,259
discussion that's about to start in

00:13:22,499 --> 00:13:28,019
terms of where that whole thing will go

00:13:25,259 --> 00:13:29,970
and also in which steps and and like

00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:37,829
time frames this evolution will will

00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:40,230
actually happen yeah I you know the as I

00:13:37,829 --> 00:13:43,170
put up as the summer provocative tweet

00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:45,629
is it's just a representation it's

00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:48,629
almost three years ago practically to

00:13:45,629 --> 00:13:50,189
the day and and really that was it was

00:13:48,629 --> 00:13:53,959
that was about politics not the

00:13:50,189 --> 00:13:56,639
technical but it represented at the time

00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:59,240
something that we didn't really quite

00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:01,529
understand there was a strong view that

00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:03,959
kubernetes and Cloud Foundry were

00:14:01,529 --> 00:14:06,420
directly in technical opposition to each

00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:09,180
other rather than things that could

00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:12,629
actually work really well together and a

00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:14,459
big reason that we've been able to get

00:14:12,629 --> 00:14:16,350
to this part is not just showing the

00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:18,569
technical but as you do the technical

00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:21,870
part to say hey we do operate on top

00:14:18,569 --> 00:14:25,589
just fine you're realizing the Cloud

00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:27,209
Foundry developer experience is the is

00:14:25,589 --> 00:14:29,420
the biggest strength that Cloud Foundry

00:14:27,209 --> 00:14:31,860
is bringing and having a different

00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:33,870
infrastructure underneath especially at

00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:38,459
the rate of pace that that kubernetes

00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:41,579
has has evolved and matured it they can

00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:43,170
be very symbiotic but the other point as

00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:45,720
I've learned in three years

00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:49,709
from the start of these projects to now

00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:52,949
is wow that was kubernetes one one or

00:14:49,709 --> 00:14:57,389
one - we were starting on boy was that

00:14:52,949 --> 00:15:00,120
an immature platform that you know that

00:14:57,389 --> 00:15:01,410
when we talk about corks in ireenie it's

00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,329
important to know we've been talking a

00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:05,850
lot about them today neither of those

00:15:03,329 --> 00:15:08,639
are actually at the production quality

00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:10,610
but we do actually have containerized

00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:14,519
cloud foundry running production ready

00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:16,589
on using some of the the previous

00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:19,860
versions of those technologies the

00:15:16,589 --> 00:15:21,150
reason that ireenie and quarks exist is

00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:23,400
moving

00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:26,580
the maturity of the kubernetes platform

00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:29,370
itself and so it is sort of an

00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:31,050
interesting mode where everyone assumed

00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:32,910
oh it came from Google it's going to be

00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:34,980
great well they kind of forgot a lot of

00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:36,300
things along the way or just you know

00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:39,090
you have to remember when Google was

00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:41,520
using board pre kubernetes stuff they

00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:43,710
didn't care about Naughty Neighbors

00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:46,050
right because they were operated in a

00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:49,020
walled garden kubernetes comes out and

00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:50,550
it is nowhere near the the strength of

00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:53,940
the multi tendency the cloud foundry has

00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:55,620
now can we learn more and provide more

00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:59,160
functionality on even just the

00:15:55,620 --> 00:16:00,630
kubernetes experience adapting those

00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:03,000
things from cloud foundry and those are

00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:07,020
the the more interesting discussions

00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:09,390
that that were getting into now yes oh

00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:13,140
oh uh queue off of something that you

00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:15,630
just said Jeff which was this concept of

00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:17,640
whether kubernetes in cloud foundry or

00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:20,910
in technical opposition or an or an

00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:23,400
opposition and that is still I mean that

00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:25,860
question maybe in this room on this

00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:28,650
panel feels like it's answered but out

00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:32,640
in the wild that's still very much a

00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:35,310
very lively discussion and I think that

00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:37,530
the roots of that question go down to

00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:40,380
the way that kubernetes to some extent

00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:44,040
is marketed it is marketed as a

00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:46,230
developer platform people talk about

00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:48,540
that it being something that developers

00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:51,630
want to use now I've reflected on this a

00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:52,890
bit especially recently and the reality

00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:55,350
is that if you're coming from an

00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:58,770
infrastructure background if you as an

00:16:55,350 --> 00:17:02,300
app team as a developer have the state

00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:04,620
of the art for you has been ec2 and s3

00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:07,470
you've been getting compute storage and

00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:09,209
network then kubernetes is starts to

00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:11,250
look like a developer abstraction

00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:14,130
because it allows me to do things like

00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:16,380
model my application deployments and it

00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:18,150
has that declarative model and we all

00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:19,770
know that that declarative model is

00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:22,200
something that's very valuable in cloud

00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:24,390
foundry so it starts to and by the way

00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:26,760
I've been with cloud foundry first you

00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:29,820
know six and more than six years and

00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:32,100
that's what we used to demo six years

00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,990
ago we showed that that notion of the

00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:35,470
the

00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:37,279
declarative deployment and how

00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:41,629
eventually consistent you know

00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:42,950
constantly healing and so that is a big

00:17:41,629 --> 00:17:45,649
part of what people understand

00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:49,460
kubernetes to be but if you come at it

00:17:45,649 --> 00:17:50,899
from this community and you have already

00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:52,970
have the experience with cloud foundry

00:17:50,899 --> 00:17:55,789
then kubernetes starts to look like an

00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:58,070
infrastructure abstraction so it really

00:17:55,789 --> 00:18:01,159
is kind of two different viewpoints and

00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:06,139
so it it's that I think that's the root

00:18:01,159 --> 00:18:09,289
of that conversation and so I don't

00:18:06,139 --> 00:18:11,389
think I agree with everything everybody

00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:14,809
has said it's clear that there is no

00:18:11,389 --> 00:18:17,149
Cloud Foundry without kubernetes and

00:18:14,809 --> 00:18:23,119
that Cloud Foundry brings an awful lot

00:18:17,149 --> 00:18:25,279
more to kubernetes but for the non Cloud

00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:28,999
Foundry community it's still kind of a

00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:34,789
raging debate if you will I will go off

00:18:28,999 --> 00:18:36,610
of that yes how many of you were at the

00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:39,590
unconference

00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:41,769
good so you all probably have heard

00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:43,789
Steve Greenberg stock on the call to

00:18:41,769 --> 00:18:46,279
developers I've called for action to

00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:48,440
developers kind of goes along the same

00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:49,879
lines how do we kind of go into the

00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,619
kubernetes community and help them

00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:55,639
understand the value that Cloud Foundry

00:18:51,619 --> 00:18:58,580
brings to Google's community does anyone

00:18:55,639 --> 00:19:05,320
in the audience have either a response

00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:08,240
or a follow-on question for that yeah so

00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:10,759
cloud on me it's about developer

00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:13,990
experience but I think an important part

00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:17,600
is also the operator experience because

00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:19,639
it there's the deploy a thing right and

00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:23,960
that's nice and then it works but then

00:19:19,639 --> 00:19:26,570
you have also the part where something

00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:30,590
breaks down and you have to go in and

00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:32,570
figure out what's going wrong and in my

00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:36,049
experience I'm still missing that a bit

00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:38,419
I'm used to borscht right and basically

00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:41,809
the boss deploy story I think we have

00:19:38,419 --> 00:19:43,970
that now with or the CFO operator is

00:19:41,809 --> 00:19:46,760
getting into that kind of territory

00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:50,150
right that's coming but

00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:52,220
wash instances boys SSH like and just

00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:54,770
seeing what's going on seeing all the

00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:57,380
processes being able to I'm still I

00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:59,960
don't know that feels like there we

00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:02,270
might need something there right to to

00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:05,720
have that create operator experience

00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:10,460
that allows you to run on scale have

00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:14,510
something there you're familiar with the

00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:16,669
Bosch experience I can you know throw a

00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:18,559
dart into a tech crowd and and hit

00:20:16,669 --> 00:20:22,010
someone with the kubernetes experience

00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:25,970
it ten times more likely and that's

00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:28,100
exactly though the the you know for

00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:30,950
better or worse they won an

00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:34,910
infrastructure market share mine share

00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:38,270
with kubernetes and if they've done a

00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:42,020
good job in in that it's matured well

00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:43,730
enough I'm like maybe some other things

00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,809
that get a lot of popularity you really

00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:47,419
have to look at them carefully

00:20:44,809 --> 00:20:49,580
but kubernetes is there and that is true

00:20:47,419 --> 00:20:51,799
you know there is one of the things in

00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:54,740
kind of one of the actually well done

00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:56,630
things about cloud foundry was distinct

00:20:54,740 --> 00:21:00,770
separation of the operator and the

00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:05,690
developer experience it's a real it was

00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:07,910
always a true value add now the then the

00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:09,650
question though really is the if you can

00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:12,950
get more value out of a new

00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:16,010
infrastructure model let's take

00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:20,330
advantage of it and it's true the Bosh

00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:22,700
experience three years ago was way more

00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:25,370
stable and mature than anything you

00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:29,030
could get out of kubernetes but that's

00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:31,250
not true with like the latest kubernetes

00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:33,049
all of the extra features now you need

00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:37,130
to add some extra stuff on top of that

00:21:33,049 --> 00:21:39,320
we work on it but it is just a different

00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:41,030
operational model and yes we have to

00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:42,590
work with people understanding that

00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:44,510
model yeah I

00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:47,090
I'd love to chime in very quickly I

00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:49,160
think that one of the places that we can

00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:52,720
put together a recipe is around those

00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:55,309
personas that you just talked about um I

00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,049
down once and actually wrote wrote down

00:21:55,309 --> 00:21:58,790
some of these things and went through

00:21:57,049 --> 00:22:00,320
the model of what are the things that

00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:02,690
the

00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,190
platform team do and what are the things

00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:05,929
that the app team do so the people

00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:07,159
providing Cloud Foundry is a platform

00:22:05,929 --> 00:22:09,590
where the people consuming it as a

00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:11,539
platform and I kind of started to map

00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:13,429
those over into the into the kubernetes

00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:16,070
space and the interesting thing is that

00:22:13,429 --> 00:22:18,769
coop cuttle of course which is the

00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:20,690
equivalent of CF right to some extent

00:22:18,769 --> 00:22:24,110
it's actually kind of it and here's the

00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:26,450
point it's kind of a coop cuddle is one

00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:28,159
thing where we have CF CLI when we have

00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:31,250
the boss CLI right

00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:35,570
so with coop cuddle you can deploy a

00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:37,490
workload you can expose it as a service

00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:39,679
so it's maybe a little a little

00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:41,929
equivalent to routing but not quite the

00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:43,700
same there's some subtle differences

00:22:41,929 --> 00:22:45,980
there but you know what else you can do

00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:51,139
with coop cuddle you can delete a note

00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:53,960
from your cluster and yes true you can

00:22:51,139 --> 00:22:57,309
set up role based access control to keep

00:22:53,960 --> 00:23:00,649
an individual from deleting a node and

00:22:57,309 --> 00:23:03,769
allow them to deploy a workload but you

00:23:00,649 --> 00:23:07,399
have to set that up yourself so here is

00:23:03,769 --> 00:23:09,500
an abstraction that we have nailed in

00:23:07,399 --> 00:23:11,299
the Cloud Foundry community that I don't

00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:13,279
see anyone even in the kubernetes

00:23:11,299 --> 00:23:17,240
community thinking about those personas

00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:19,700
so we think of Cloud Foundry as the open

00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:22,009
source repositories but I think of cloud

00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:23,539
foundry is all of the organizational

00:23:22,009 --> 00:23:26,090
structures that we built around it that

00:23:23,539 --> 00:23:28,340
we've proven to work and that's a place

00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:31,389
where cloud foundry has an awful lot to

00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:34,730
offer to the kubernetes community and

00:23:31,389 --> 00:23:36,559
just to add to that so there is might

00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:38,840
not be known to everybody who's not

00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:43,519
following the the community too closely

00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:45,220
but there is a debate about or a work

00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:48,740
group that has just been recently

00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:52,789
formalized I forgot this name I think

00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:55,129
it's called the Bosh lifecycle thank you

00:23:52,789 --> 00:23:58,639
the lifecycle special interest group or

00:23:55,129 --> 00:24:01,820
something like that which really the the

00:23:58,639 --> 00:24:05,029
the initial spark that created this

00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:07,100
workgroup was to say okay if the Cloud

00:24:05,029 --> 00:24:09,260
Foundry community is embarking on this

00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:11,629
journey to say everything has to become

00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:13,430
containerized eventually and you know

00:24:11,629 --> 00:24:17,770
we're all in on that

00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:21,980
on that journey what are the actual gaps

00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:25,040
that Cuba need is today has that we are

00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:27,560
known or that we want because we have

00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:30,500
them in a in a Bosch you know from a

00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:32,630
Bosch world so think about and it ties

00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:34,790
nicely into some of the stuff that not

00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:36,950
sure of what whom of you has listened to

00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:38,930
the some of the quirks talks and that

00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:40,940
have been happened but one thing you

00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:42,890
that you probably realized in the Cork's

00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:45,710
or in some of the Cork's talk when they

00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:48,040
talk about the CF operator is that we

00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:49,910
needed to invent it concepts like

00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:52,430
ordered sets

00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:54,410
alright well basically say if we roll a

00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:56,600
Cloud Foundry deployment we just cannot

00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:58,130
roll every kubernetes pot at the same

00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,810
time because it'll just gonna create a

00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:01,490
freakin outage and you know every

00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:03,590
operator will out there will just love

00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:05,930
us because it degrades their existing

00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:10,010
Bosch experience so we needed to invent

00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:12,110
additional concepts like ordered ordered

00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:16,090
sets and you know extended I think it's

00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:18,440
called extended sets of extended sets so

00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:20,360
ordered extended like basically

00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:22,160
possibilities where you can mimic some

00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:23,870
of the Bosch behavior say okay if I'm if

00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:25,760
I have ten instances of this part and

00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:27,620
I'm gonna roll them I'm gonna do the

00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:30,800
apply a certain order to them in order

00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:33,400
to you manage dependencies and and that

00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:36,320
sort of thing so I think there is value

00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:38,210
from a Bosch coming from a Bosch mindset

00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:40,490
it's even applicable to the company does

00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:44,660
community today and that we could use in

00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:48,020
order to infuse into this you know into

00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:50,210
the kubernetes community at large and

00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:52,190
everybody in the room so if you have an

00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:53,990
opinion about Bosch and an opinion about

00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:56,300
how that actually should look like I

00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:57,410
know that not many people do but those

00:25:56,300 --> 00:26:01,850
who do

00:25:57,410 --> 00:26:04,190
please join this workgroup and share

00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:06,020
your thoughts so if you are one of the

00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:07,610
lucky persons like me that's actually

00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:09,530
responsible for running a cloud foundry

00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:11,690
system with Bosch you might have some

00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:14,020
scars about that and where did it might

00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:16,850
be valuable where do people find the

00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:19,250
location for this is this a kubernetes

00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:21,020
working group a CLC f working for a

00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:22,850
cloud foundry cloud foundry working

00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:25,010
group so if you are on the Cloud Foundry

00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:27,450
slack which you can also join by just

00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:30,030
looking up for Cloud Foundry slack group

00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:31,710
look for a cig - lifecycle Channel and

00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:33,179
you can pretty much get everything there

00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:35,160
there's a proposal document and

00:26:33,179 --> 00:26:36,929
conversations going on I think there's

00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:39,240
also a regular call that you all have

00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:41,370
yes there's like a weekly weekly call or

00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:42,870
bi-weekly or bi-weekly call and then a

00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:43,890
bunch of working documents I mean this

00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:47,100
just got started

00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:52,049
like fairly recently it's it's not not

00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:54,840
been far along yet did you want to say

00:26:52,049 --> 00:26:57,150
anything or should I parent okay

00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:58,830
question from the audience I need I need

00:26:57,150 --> 00:27:06,840
some of you to raise your hand so I can

00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:09,660
bring the mic any questions okay so I'll

00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:12,960
chime chime on on its production ready

00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:14,520
to some extent but not released I know

00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,770
that some of you guys are working more

00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:19,620
like in a provider space

00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:22,200
I would like refer to is it Enterprise

00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:24,330
ready or is it just production ready

00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:26,730
like at provider scale that can just

00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:31,230
mitigate all the risks that are inside

00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:33,299
it was just people and stuff its

00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:36,679
Enterprise ready and that it can run in

00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:36,679
production it can scale your

00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:49,110
containerized cloud foundry the the

00:27:46,169 --> 00:27:51,540
probably the thing that's that's missing

00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:53,429
and and it's missing for Rubin

00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:56,010
specifically and and other people that

00:27:53,429 --> 00:27:58,380
represent him trying to build that is

00:27:56,010 --> 00:28:00,809
not all of the patterns are as

00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:02,700
well-established as they might be in in

00:28:00,809 --> 00:28:05,490
the Bosch camp oh yeah no we know how to

00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:07,710
fix that and you do this but it's not a

00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:11,040
it's not may be abstracted behind a

00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:15,360
command line and this is actually an

00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:19,650
area where you know the the separating

00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:21,630
so one of the aspects in the cloud

00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:22,830
foundry sort of soup to nuts from from

00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:24,660
Bosch all the way to developer

00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:28,049
experience is then it allowed you to

00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:30,059
build very clear paths now it's like

00:28:28,049 --> 00:28:32,940
okay who's kubernetes are you running

00:28:30,059 --> 00:28:35,760
how did it get installed who's doing you

00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:39,480
know the storage interfaces it's that

00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:41,250
extra mix of elements that that mean

00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:43,290
that okay you may need to handle your

00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:46,590
operator stuff slightly differently and

00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:48,450
it so it in our experience it's come

00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:50,820
from how well do you know how to manage

00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:54,960
your kubernetes the Cloud Foundry stuff

00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:57,000
is pretty simple on top but I would I

00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,880
would argue that most people manage

00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,610
their kubernetes more poorly than people

00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:04,470
have managed their boss but again I

00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:07,110
would say it the inflection point for

00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:10,440
that is is you know it's going like this

00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:12,450
for the the kubernetes side and and I

00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:14,100
can just second that like in terms of

00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:15,810
like you were asking about production

00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:18,210
readiness and Enterprise readiness for

00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:21,930
containerized cloud foundry

00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:25,260
so from an you know speaking as putting

00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:26,940
my IBM head on here I'm I think we have

00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:29,520
a bunch of customers now who actually

00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:31,440
started to be in production on

00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:34,110
containerized cloud foundry it's not a

00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:36,480
big amount of a big member yet but it's

00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:38,670
a it's a couple and it's also smaller

00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,740
deployments and but we also have it for

00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:43,020
the next couple of months a bunch of the

00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:47,550
you know really large enterprise heavy

00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:49,950
regulated like think of all all the

00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:54,840
craziness you can think of who are about

00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:58,580
to go on production so I am thinking

00:29:54,840 --> 00:30:01,980
that that you know the time's right

00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:04,050
maybe two to two what Simon said I think

00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:06,210
another question regarding enterprise

00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:08,790
readiness might be is it a drop-in

00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:11,370
replacement for any bosch managed cloud

00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:14,250
foundry and I would say no there's still

00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:15,870
some way to go there like on the irony

00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:17,550
side there's definitely certain

00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:19,740
functionalities that the team still

00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:23,550
needs to complete in order to achieve

00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:26,190
feature parity between and Jules's is

00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:28,680
already laughing so so maybe that

00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:33,440
statement is invalid as we speak but

00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:33,440
that's at least I guess current state of

00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:43,680
I see so but depending on like do you

00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:45,810
have them already offer to you and users

00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:47,940
reality is at least one of them will be

00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:50,280
using those features so it might be hard

00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:52,650
to move over there and then in terms of

00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:54,840
scale I think like the the other

00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:55,230
interesting question that lies ahead of

00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:57,660
us

00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:59,850
is is actually one kubernetes cluster

00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:02,429
enough to run your Cloud Foundry

00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:05,460
workloads and it might be up until a

00:31:02,429 --> 00:31:07,710
certain level of scale number of

00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:10,679
applications number of requests etc etc

00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:13,440
but then for bigger deployments which we

00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:14,820
had si P in particular run that the

00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,799
question is like do you need to have

00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:18,660
multiple kubernetes clusters underneath

00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:20,690
and then what does that mean for your

00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:23,220
control plane what does that mean for

00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:25,290
distribution of requests across those

00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:28,850
kubernetes clusters etc etc and I think

00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:31,200
this is another like interesting

00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:31,559
discussion area that there lies ahead of

00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:37,950
us

00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:39,799
I suppose I should have added the caveat

00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:45,570
the for the production ready that still

00:31:39,799 --> 00:31:56,429
diego-based ok who else has the next

00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:58,500
question afraid yet now we're talking a

00:31:56,429 --> 00:32:00,870
lot about the operator side of a foundry

00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:03,600
here and you surely mentioned I think it

00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:05,520
was you burn about what is next in the

00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,200
kitchen where it comes to the developer

00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:09,900
experience that the end-user actually

00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:13,020
can expect from cloud foundry besides

00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:19,260
I'm able to push my code where do you

00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:21,510
see that going so yeah I would say

00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:24,480
definitely the fact that that sto is

00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:26,970
coming into the stack will will like

00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:30,929
provide the opportunity to then expose

00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:33,000
more of the easier functionality to the

00:32:30,929 --> 00:32:35,610
dev Cloud Foundry developer and I think

00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,890
we've we've seen some some examples in

00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:40,770
in in the keynotes during during the

00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:45,169
conference there so that is going to be

00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:48,419
an interesting thing then I guess also

00:32:45,169 --> 00:32:50,990
the question is like an abling cloud

00:32:48,419 --> 00:32:55,260
foundry on top of kubernetes is there

00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:57,480
like additional tech and and that might

00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:59,669
be either infrastructure components that

00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:02,280
are pulled in Cloud Foundry or just kind

00:32:59,669 --> 00:33:04,470
of regular kubernetes tooling that now

00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:08,130
is unlocked by by putting Cloud Foundry

00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:11,789
on top of the stack another area

00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:13,799
quite frankly for me that is and I think

00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:16,470
we had that discussion in earlier in

00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:19,799
earlier panels but for me that is the

00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:21,539
second step after kind of enabling the

00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:24,870
fact that people can actually move over

00:33:21,539 --> 00:33:26,760
quote-unquote in masses so I think that

00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:30,000
there's definitely opportunities ahead

00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:32,190
but for me like in my mind I I still it

00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,380
I'm still in the process of sorting out

00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:36,780
that that first step and that means kind

00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:38,820
of no change neither positive nor

00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:41,760
negative for the people that are using

00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:44,070
the platform or the developers if we

00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:46,289
kind of say operators are obviously also

00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:51,120
users of the platform then this is quite

00:33:46,289 --> 00:33:52,740
quite a bit of a change obviously I can

00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,830
I can just add to that so I think from

00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:57,900
from that you know going forward to

00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:59,820
discussion and multiple you know

00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:01,260
discussions are amongst multiple sets of

00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:03,360
people throughout the conference now

00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:06,570
about okay what's the strategic outlook

00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:09,389
off like can we get can we work together

00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:10,770
to get you some kind of a I'm gonna call

00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:12,750
it a milestone plan for the lack of a

00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:14,100
better word I say okay the next thing

00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:16,320
that we're gonna ship as part of the

00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:17,790
carpentry platform would be and is to

00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,190
your integration then the next thing

00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:21,929
would be I don't know what Zack

00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:25,530
Robertson really nicely demonstrated

00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:28,590
this morning with you know rolling

00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:30,810
rolling updates and v3 API s and

00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:33,960
revisions on the cloud controller API

00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:35,909
and and those sort of things I think

00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:38,100
from you know all those all those

00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:40,379
functionalities and features to me are

00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:43,200
stuff that's already in the works and

00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:44,609
like Byrne said you know blending with

00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:46,500
kubernetes or basing on top of

00:34:44,609 --> 00:34:48,869
kubernetes might even unlock a bunch of

00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:51,060
things that would make this even nicer

00:34:48,869 --> 00:34:53,850
but I don't think that we as a community

00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:57,390
right and and you know the people are up

00:34:53,850 --> 00:35:00,300
here as vendors should shouldn't stop

00:34:57,390 --> 00:35:02,340
thinking about is also you know what

00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:04,109
other what is the next step of where

00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:06,540
we're going to take this because those

00:35:04,109 --> 00:35:10,650
are you know so to say tiny little

00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:12,540
increments off of you know functionality

00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:14,760
and added features as we go forward but

00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:16,740
I don't think like we as a community we

00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:18,270
now have to start bigger like we have to

00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:21,030
start thinking bigger that's what I met

00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:21,480
and you know initially I said I actually

00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:24,240
in

00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:26,460
in the world in the more distant future

00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:28,950
it's not something that will happen near

00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:33,150
next spring but maybe next Christmas

00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:35,040
whatever where where we you know as a

00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:37,590
community are starting to unify the

00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:40,260
programming models in the sense that why

00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:42,750
do I have to run a separate stack if I

00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:45,300
want to have a server dysfunctions next

00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:48,000
to my 12 factor app next to my container

00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:51,990
all right why is this not going to be

00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:55,800
some kind of a unified thing behind one

00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:59,400
platform and building such a platform

00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:02,040
might mean that technology has to change

00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:03,630
and technology has to adopt and and I

00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:05,250
think this is the discussion this is the

00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:05,609
next level of discussion where we have

00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:08,010
to

00:36:05,609 --> 00:36:09,930
so getting kubernetes in as the

00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:11,640
orchestrator step one doing all these

00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:13,830
incremental changes it's going to be

00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:16,140
stepped two but I think we need to start

00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:18,660
working on step three right now which is

00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:21,600
you know layout the layout the grand

00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:23,580
vision of where we want to go pick the

00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:27,780
right technology for that grand vision

00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:30,720
and go and build it yeah I just add on

00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:32,700
to that is because you finally got to

00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:34,859
the point that if Stefan you're asking

00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:37,410
about well where is the cloud found next

00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:39,960
layer for Cloud Foundry innovation I

00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:43,200
think it the the function is a service

00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:46,430
space as it were people are looking at

00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:50,400
faz or and there's some you know major

00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:52,380
popular frameworks out there and in the

00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:55,619
same way they looked at maybe kubernetes

00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:58,619
in Cloud Foundry before and maybe

00:36:55,619 --> 00:37:01,410
actually you can mix those two better as

00:36:58,619 --> 00:37:03,180
well and you know if I look at the K

00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:06,270
data and I have looked deeply at K

00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:08,970
native its it reminds me of kubernetes

00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:12,180
1.0 if I want a fast framework but then

00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:14,180
I think oh I actually have you know

00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:21,180
Cloud Foundry version I didn't know

00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:24,480
3,500 and whatever it is now 16 and it

00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:27,570
actually gives me 95% there is it there

00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:29,520
is five percent that it doesn't so why

00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:32,340
do I need an entirely new thing then we

00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:34,500
build all the stuff and again so I want

00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:35,340
us to make sure as a community we're

00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:37,380
looking at that and

00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:40,590
thinking about adopting cloud foundry

00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:42,090
for these these other extra 5% that

00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:45,570
people are finding interesting use cases

00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:47,130
for I would actually be sorry I would

00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:48,690
actually be interested in the room like

00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:50,580
I mean there must be a couple of people

00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:52,440
here in the room that are you know

00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:55,290
day-to-day out there in consulting jobs

00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:57,930
or working with working with customers

00:37:55,290 --> 00:38:00,240
do you see similar requirements this is

00:37:57,930 --> 00:38:02,460
something that that you you comes up in

00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:06,350
your daily life too or is this just

00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:18,030
something that a couple of people in

00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:20,550
cooperations dream together well the

00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:23,990
question is do you see a need for this

00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:28,050
kind of unification from your daily work

00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:30,660
unification well unification in the

00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:32,850
sense of bringing additional concepts

00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:36,480
into the platform like functions as a

00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:47,060
service as we did with containers with

00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:47,060
kubernetes now does anyone say No

00:38:54,400 --> 00:39:00,010
so I think this this whole foundation is

00:38:57,310 --> 00:39:02,130
very vendor driven so there's a lot of

00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:04,300
talk about unifying stuff but

00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:06,790
communities came from the outside and

00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:08,380
communities is very accessible community

00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:10,960
and it's very good at picking up like

00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:12,910
small companies in small ideas and I

00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:15,480
think that's why they were moving faster

00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:17,860
than us because they have such a

00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:18,910
footprint like financially and all of

00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:21,790
that if you want to run it on your

00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:24,370
laptop that was so much smaller was so

00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:26,140
much easier to try and I think if

00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:31,120
function as a service happens it doesn't

00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:33,190
have to happen in our area right we

00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:35,170
could just integrate it at some point if

00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:37,300
we are s openness could be notices at

00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:40,150
the moment then we could just pick it up

00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:42,160
and make it work for us yeah I think

00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:43,810
that you you touched upon a theme I

00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:47,920
think that is very interesting which is

00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:49,660
about composability composition we've

00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:53,080
talked about this on this panel before

00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:55,960
that cloud foundry has always been a

00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:58,060
complete system totally opinionated has

00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:00,460
everything baked in and even as an

00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:01,990
open-source community the way that we've

00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:03,670
been running you know the way the Cloud

00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:07,450
Foundry Foundation has been running it's

00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:11,110
been around at this composite this this

00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:13,390
full solution and I I appreciate your

00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:16,840
challenge because you're saying actually

00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:19,030
do we want to as a community as a Cloud

00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:21,450
Foundry community continue to be about

00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:24,250
the composition the highly opinionated

00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:27,610
composition or do we want to for example

00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:30,040
be a an environment where we're an

00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:33,820
integration platform where it's more

00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:36,280
around choose giving tools for the

00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:39,180
composition or tools for integration as

00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:41,560
opposed to being the highly opinionated

00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:47,980
single platform view

00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:52,030
I appreciate that challenge does it have

00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:54,550
to be an either/or no I don't think so

00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:58,750
I think I mean clearly there's value in

00:40:54,550 --> 00:41:01,120
having you know I work for pivotal so we

00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:03,550
provide a shrink-wrapped solution and

00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:05,200
there's huge value in that and when I

00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:06,520
look at what people are doing in a

00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,840
kubernetes environment

00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:09,730
many of those same customers are

00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:12,910
cobbling two things together on the

00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:14,650
kubernetes side and it's extraordinarily

00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:15,460
difficult so I don't think it's an

00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:17,020
either/or

00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:18,760
one of the things I like to think about

00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:22,360
though is a little bit more plug ability

00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:24,460
but then it can't be we're just building

00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:27,010
everything together you know by scratch

00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:28,510
you know from scratch so it almost

00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:31,150
becomes a platform for building

00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:34,780
platforms where ever I heard that before

00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:37,710
so did you have a comment I'm sorry he

00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:40,390
asked the question and I answered it

00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:53,590
agreed she said you got it any other

00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:56,380
questions any functionality that's only

00:41:53,590 --> 00:42:03,700
available on Cloud Foundry rolling on

00:41:56,380 --> 00:42:05,980
kubernetes so actually that's a very

00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:10,620
good question because it's exactly

00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:16,120
reflects a a comment from last year's

00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:19,870
panel which was which I asked when are

00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:24,190
we going to hit the question can I can

00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:31,200
only implement this on kubernetes can I

00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:33,550
do that yeah that's probably coming soon

00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:35,770
but then we do hit you know an

00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:37,450
inflection point of oh well you know

00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:42,100
that this operates in a different way

00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:44,260
but you already have the the the

00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:46,840
converse of that and there are still

00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:49,090
features such as you know windows

00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:52,330
integration because windows integration

00:42:49,090 --> 00:42:54,370
currently is still all vm based there's

00:42:52,330 --> 00:42:56,560
nothing in work done so if you're

00:42:54,370 --> 00:43:00,790
picking the containerized cloud foundry

00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:03,580
or we are exercising the windows

00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:05,590
ecosystem for now they're working on the

00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:07,270
container stuff and that'll that'll come

00:43:05,590 --> 00:43:08,980
but doing that right now there is a

00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:13,420
choice you have a few features that

00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:15,460
can't be brought in when it happens it

00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:17,410
what is it going to be and is it going

00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:20,349
to be major there's a lot of choices you

00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:22,839
can make in a in a cloud foundry eCos

00:43:20,349 --> 00:43:25,479
if you choose the ISTE release of for

00:43:22,839 --> 00:43:27,160
routing you're getting different routing

00:43:25,479 --> 00:43:30,069
functionality than if you get the go

00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:33,339
router so those are those subtle

00:43:30,069 --> 00:43:35,499
differences already exist and I I don't

00:43:33,339 --> 00:43:41,579
think they would you know break us in

00:43:35,499 --> 00:43:44,499
any way but going back so I actually do

00:43:41,579 --> 00:43:48,099
envision a couple of things going

00:43:44,499 --> 00:43:49,869
forward that would probably only be

00:43:48,099 --> 00:43:56,589
possible to implement them communities

00:43:49,869 --> 00:43:59,289
yes well you could think about so when

00:43:56,589 --> 00:44:00,670
we're talking about you catch up on this

00:43:59,289 --> 00:44:03,969
earlier we're talking about heart

00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:06,189
multi-tenancy for kubernetes and I mean

00:44:03,969 --> 00:44:10,929
kudos to Jules they did an awesome job

00:44:06,189 --> 00:44:13,150
securing Runcie to the best possible but

00:44:10,929 --> 00:44:15,369
when you look at that yeah level deeper

00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:17,079
and and you look at things like for

00:44:15,369 --> 00:44:18,549
example firecracker or you look at

00:44:17,079 --> 00:44:22,150
things like you know this some of this

00:44:18,549 --> 00:44:25,179
new micro VM stuff that is now you

00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:29,319
getting used in some cases I could

00:44:25,179 --> 00:44:31,689
actually see a kubernetes distribution

00:44:29,319 --> 00:44:34,709
at one point in time that uses

00:44:31,689 --> 00:44:38,199
firecracker instead of continuity and

00:44:34,709 --> 00:44:40,089
once you are at that point you are at

00:44:38,199 --> 00:44:41,769
that point like Bosch and the

00:44:40,089 --> 00:44:44,079
traditional Cloud Foundry were like we

00:44:41,769 --> 00:44:46,390
could make use of that technology for

00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:50,229
security for any other non-functional

00:44:46,390 --> 00:44:52,269
pieces but that is I do I personally

00:44:50,229 --> 00:45:03,759
don't think it's gonna happen in the

00:44:52,269 --> 00:45:05,799
Bosch world saying I think what cloud

00:45:03,759 --> 00:45:08,019
foundry gives you is the standard the

00:45:05,799 --> 00:45:10,509
developer can expect to exist we solved

00:45:08,019 --> 00:45:11,499
by the language specification right but

00:45:10,509 --> 00:45:13,959
then you could have multiple

00:45:11,499 --> 00:45:16,569
implementations of how that maps to the

00:45:13,959 --> 00:45:19,209
backend and already we have this arena X

00:45:16,569 --> 00:45:22,769
thing right so as an operator you can

00:45:19,209 --> 00:45:25,929
customize how that CF pushed thing

00:45:22,769 --> 00:45:27,549
becomes stuff in kubernetes so as you've

00:45:25,929 --> 00:45:30,009
got that platform underneath that cuban

00:45:27,549 --> 00:45:31,209
ESI's platform you can customize the

00:45:30,009 --> 00:45:33,339
scheduling for it I mean putting their

00:45:31,209 --> 00:45:33,700
custom scheduler to say what nodes it

00:45:33,339 --> 00:45:36,040
lands

00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:38,770
right you can use we had a talk earlier

00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:40,510
about are using persistent volume claims

00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:42,940
so you can look at an environment

00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:46,839
variable that the user put into their CF

00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:48,250
push and amount of volume in it and the

00:45:46,839 --> 00:45:50,170
nice thing about that is none of that

00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:51,880
changes the CF push experience from my

00:45:50,170 --> 00:45:54,460
apps gonna work saying we might as a

00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:56,140
developer I don't care but where it does

00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:58,000
I think give you some features that are

00:45:56,140 --> 00:46:00,400
new is it gives you a lot more

00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:03,549
flexibility from that cuban FC's

00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:05,220
platform as an operator and and the

00:46:03,549 --> 00:46:08,530
analogy I was saying someone earlier

00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:10,750
graph you out of people no graph QL if

00:46:08,530 --> 00:46:13,180
you go to the graph QL website it's

00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:15,400
literally one page it's a specification

00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:17,079
doesn't contain any implementation right

00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:19,869
it says here's how you write to client

00:46:17,079 --> 00:46:22,510
and here's how you write a server and in

00:46:19,869 --> 00:46:24,849
a lot of ways I see CF actually is that

00:46:22,510 --> 00:46:27,760
specification of here's what I give a

00:46:24,849 --> 00:46:29,740
platform as a developer right and then

00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:31,930
as a platform you can say how's that

00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:35,049
going to map to the back end right for

00:46:31,930 --> 00:46:37,750
those roles so maybe it's kind of easier

00:46:35,049 --> 00:46:39,579
to to answer your question if you kind

00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:41,410
of invert it and formulate it slightly

00:46:39,579 --> 00:46:43,359
differently I would kind of ask the

00:46:41,410 --> 00:46:46,660
question of what is the likelihood of

00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:49,180
the Cloud Foundry community maintaining

00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:51,640
two parallel code streams forever

00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:54,280
I would say that's kind of zero and then

00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:56,290
if that is the likelihood then on which

00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:59,020
horse would you bet if like one of those

00:46:56,290 --> 00:47:02,020
streams could benefit from another open

00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:03,609
source ecosystem that is moving at even

00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:05,650
a higher place than then Cloud Foundry

00:47:03,609 --> 00:47:09,490
and I think the the answer to your

00:47:05,650 --> 00:47:12,400
question is somewhat clear yeah I think

00:47:09,490 --> 00:47:14,049
you just sparked something I thought

00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:16,720
there's a very interesting thing there

00:47:14,049 --> 00:47:20,049
in that I up the set of primitives that

00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:23,230
are available as first-class primitives

00:47:20,049 --> 00:47:25,569
in kubernetes is so much richer than

00:47:23,230 --> 00:47:27,280
what was available on I as and that's

00:47:25,569 --> 00:47:30,089
exactly what you were just talking about

00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:33,970
so another example that I would give is

00:47:30,089 --> 00:47:35,980
you know things around paints and

00:47:33,970 --> 00:47:38,170
Toleration x' paints and Toleration x'

00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:40,839
is not a first-class entity and in

00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:43,450
infrastructure as a service so that is

00:47:40,839 --> 00:47:44,710
it's a primitive that you can use for

00:47:43,450 --> 00:47:46,790
those of you who might not what know

00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:49,610
what taints and toleration czar the

00:47:46,790 --> 00:47:52,370
two primitives that you can use to start

00:47:49,610 --> 00:47:54,890
to control where workloads are landings

00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:58,610
so that say you can't put things here

00:47:54,890 --> 00:48:01,490
you can put things there when we start

00:47:58,610 --> 00:48:04,130
to embrace those when you say the

00:48:01,490 --> 00:48:06,470
operator can start to embrace those my

00:48:04,130 --> 00:48:10,070
only concern right now is the split

00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:12,890
brain because right now things like capi

00:48:10,070 --> 00:48:15,350
the cloud controller are assuming a

00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:18,490
certain level of control of things and

00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:21,290
if we now start to use a different

00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:23,030
control plane to start to control some

00:48:21,290 --> 00:48:25,100
of those things we could end up in

00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:28,160
situations where we thrash and those

00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:30,140
types of things so and I don't think

00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:32,480
that stops us from moving forward in

00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:37,100
this direction but it does start to say

00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:40,160
okay well how much do we leave in capi

00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:42,500
how much do we start to rebuild some of

00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:44,060
the Cappy logic to take advantage of

00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:46,130
those primitives instead of just using

00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:48,020
those primitives as an operator from the

00:48:46,130 --> 00:48:50,600
side I think we have to think about

00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:54,730
those things okay that's a problem I

00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:54,730
want to work on that's pretty fun

00:48:57,210 --> 00:49:08,400
any other questions anyone else so I'm

00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:11,700
interested to redirect the call of

00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:15,750
action from the unconference to you so

00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:20,099
what would you think or do you want from

00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:23,849
us as community where to engage how to

00:49:20,099 --> 00:49:25,829
engage do you have any ideas or what do

00:49:23,849 --> 00:49:29,550
you think also relation of course to

00:49:25,829 --> 00:49:32,990
cube what what to do write blog pose or

00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:35,760
get crazy or what do you think yeah so

00:49:32,990 --> 00:49:38,760
it's a great question and it's because

00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:40,890
it requires a community's effort but

00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:43,640
just you know show of hands how many

00:49:40,890 --> 00:49:48,059
people have given a Cloud Foundry talk

00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:51,750
outs not at the Cloud Foundry meetup or

00:49:48,059 --> 00:49:55,050
summat you know I've had the opportunity

00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:58,619
at both the cube con and and open

00:49:55,050 --> 00:50:00,210
infrastructure summits and you get you

00:49:58,619 --> 00:50:02,460
you have to tailor your talk differently

00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:06,839
you have to tailor the title differently

00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:08,460
in the abstract to get it accepted as

00:50:06,839 --> 00:50:11,720
yeah I've been rejected more times than

00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:15,020
I've had accepted let's just say that

00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:18,780
mentor people on how to write the EFI's

00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:20,730
the III couldn't offer to you know you

00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:22,740
review from having some acceptance you

00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:24,390
know you just you have to know to the

00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:26,970
community in which you're addressing and

00:50:24,390 --> 00:50:29,520
what you're trying so the cube con one

00:50:26,970 --> 00:50:31,650
was was about expressing more about the

00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:33,980
developer model I did not actually use

00:50:31,650 --> 00:50:36,150
the word cloud foundry in my abstract

00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:38,640
mysteriously it appeared on my title of

00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:42,450
my talk when I was there but it wasn't

00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:44,010
in the abstract so but that's that's the

00:50:42,450 --> 00:50:46,260
thing is it's great to see a few other

00:50:44,010 --> 00:50:50,160
hands but it would be great to see even

00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:53,010
more and because remember it is not an

00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:55,589
either/or there is there is a tremendous

00:50:53,010 --> 00:50:58,410
amount of value in cloud foundry from

00:50:55,589 --> 00:50:59,670
the from the model that it works on the

00:50:58,410 --> 00:51:02,549
composability several other things

00:50:59,670 --> 00:51:06,210
pinellia mentioned that that we can

00:51:02,549 --> 00:51:08,820
share with other communities and and we

00:51:06,210 --> 00:51:11,610
really do need to and

00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:14,580
- maybe a - what just said so Simon and

00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:17,880
I were actually trying to get a talk in

00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:19,560
at the upcoming cube con us which was

00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:22,410
rejected ultimately but I think we

00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:24,480
followed the same strategy basically not

00:51:22,410 --> 00:51:26,670
mentioning Cloud Foundry or at least

00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:28,380
putting that - the very last sentence in

00:51:26,670 --> 00:51:30,990
the abstract and I think as a community

00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:33,270
we need to think through why that

00:51:30,990 --> 00:51:35,310
actually is like I've been in many

00:51:33,270 --> 00:51:37,770
conversations with people that are

00:51:35,310 --> 00:51:39,720
coming with a kubernetes background and

00:51:37,770 --> 00:51:42,420
like as soon as you start mentioning

00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:45,360
Cloud Foundry or even Bosch you like

00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:48,270
come in some strange situations and

00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:50,850
people like shut down their blinds and

00:51:48,270 --> 00:51:52,530
like then the conversation goes in in

00:51:50,850 --> 00:51:54,570
completely strange directions because

00:51:52,530 --> 00:51:58,020
and then you hear those words around

00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:59,810
legacy etc etc at least I've been in

00:51:58,020 --> 00:52:02,400
those conversations and I'm not sure

00:51:59,810 --> 00:52:04,770
entirely why that is I believe there's

00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:07,070
some not invented here definitely that's

00:52:04,770 --> 00:52:10,440
that's been part of that but but like

00:52:07,070 --> 00:52:12,300
why could I as a single person come up

00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:14,910
with a project that does not have the

00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:16,530
name Cloud Foundry but then potentially

00:52:14,910 --> 00:52:18,240
the very same codebase say I'm a

00:52:16,530 --> 00:52:20,820
start-up and kind of going to the

00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:23,850
kubernetes ecosystem and start marketing

00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:25,890
that stuff why is that and why are terms

00:52:23,850 --> 00:52:28,620
like Cal foundry and Bosch such red

00:52:25,890 --> 00:52:32,010
signals for the kubernetes community is

00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:35,040
at least not entirely clear to me well I

00:52:32,010 --> 00:52:37,280
I think we can try to solve we could try

00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:39,720
to answer that question or we can just

00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:41,700
suffering is the resistance to what is

00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:44,340
I'll tell you one of the things that I

00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:46,650
do is I don't talk about Bosch all that

00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:49,050
much at I don't use the name Bosch I

00:52:46,650 --> 00:52:51,540
talk about the value that Bosch brings I

00:52:49,050 --> 00:52:53,100
talk about cluster lifecycle management

00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:54,810
I talked about the deeply embedded

00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:58,100
versioning I talk about the packaging

00:52:54,810 --> 00:53:00,870
and when I start talking about those

00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:03,900
those capabilities and the business

00:53:00,870 --> 00:53:07,250
value that that brings then I find that

00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:11,490
the the resistance the the the stress

00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:13,350
starts to go away and so I mean Jeff you

00:53:11,490 --> 00:53:15,000
said it yourself is that you avoid some

00:53:13,350 --> 00:53:17,220
of those terms even when you're writing

00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:19,170
the abstract and it really comes back to

00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:20,850
the capabilities and I find that

00:53:19,170 --> 00:53:21,990
kubernetes by and large is still a

00:53:20,850 --> 00:53:25,230
pretty techie

00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:27,450
unity and we and in the Cloud Foundry

00:53:25,230 --> 00:53:29,880
community have been very very good at

00:53:27,450 --> 00:53:31,590
tying our tact to business value from

00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:33,630
the very beginning it was really driven

00:53:31,590 --> 00:53:35,730
by the business values and that's

00:53:33,630 --> 00:53:37,680
something that I don't find exists as

00:53:35,730 --> 00:53:39,720
strongly in the kubernetes community it

00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:42,450
comes I mean they they themselves say we

00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:45,510
come from a you know a Linux mindset a

00:53:42,450 --> 00:53:48,060
you know bunch of components mindset and

00:53:45,510 --> 00:53:49,980
so I think to some extent let's not

00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:51,450
fight that okay I didn't use the term

00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:54,000
Bosch anymore I talk about the

00:53:51,450 --> 00:53:56,040
capabilities I completely agree with

00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,770
that in many of the conversations that

00:53:56,040 --> 00:54:01,440
we've had without mentioning the terms

00:53:58,770 --> 00:54:03,900
if you explain the value of the

00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:06,920
individual components light bulbs go on

00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:08,970
as soon as you mention it it kind of

00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:10,710
offers that kind of resistance so I

00:54:08,970 --> 00:54:13,170
think that is a really good point and

00:54:10,710 --> 00:54:15,690
kind of tying back the call to action

00:54:13,170 --> 00:54:17,369
for all of you I think it's really

00:54:15,690 --> 00:54:19,260
important I think even the last

00:54:17,369 --> 00:54:21,420
discussion Cornelia had mentioned that

00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:24,210
it is more important for us in the Cloud

00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:26,520
Foundry community to go out into other

00:54:24,210 --> 00:54:29,970
open-source events or other technology

00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:32,280
events to go kind of explain the value

00:54:29,970 --> 00:54:35,940
or educate them about the value of Cloud

00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:37,200
Foundry and I think this is it has been

00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:40,140
the right time for the past six months

00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:41,450
at least for sure two years ago maybe it

00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:43,500
would have been a little too early

00:54:41,450 --> 00:54:46,560
little too soon but I think it's

00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:48,359
definitely on to all of you here to take

00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:50,730
that message out to the rest of the

00:54:48,359 --> 00:54:55,380
community yep and I would just add to

00:54:50,730 --> 00:54:57,510
that that I I personally don't try to

00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:59,340
sell Cloud Foundry again I want to

00:54:57,510 --> 00:55:01,230
emphasize that is that I don't go out

00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:04,890
and try to sell Cloud Foundry I go out

00:55:01,230 --> 00:55:08,100
and I sell the the the results that

00:55:04,890 --> 00:55:10,800
people have realized based on certain

00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:12,810
capabilities because I think that's

00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:15,150
really the key thing and there's going

00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:17,070
to be even better ways for us to realize

00:55:15,150 --> 00:55:18,810
some of those values on a kubernetes

00:55:17,070 --> 00:55:20,280
based platform that might not even

00:55:18,810 --> 00:55:24,119
involve some of the Cloud Foundry

00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:25,590
codebase so I don't I personally don't

00:55:24,119 --> 00:55:27,570
think of Cloud Foundry is only the

00:55:25,590 --> 00:55:30,030
codebase I think of Cloud Foundry as a

00:55:27,570 --> 00:55:31,800
set of capabilities and if we start

00:55:30,030 --> 00:55:34,020
thinking of it that way and articulating

00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:35,400
it that way I think we stand a far

00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:37,799
better chance of influence

00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:40,319
in that community and when if we

00:55:37,799 --> 00:55:42,359
influence the kubernetes community with

00:55:40,319 --> 00:55:44,640
some of the the good mojo that we've

00:55:42,359 --> 00:55:47,970
built over the last six years six seven

00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:50,400
years that will be a huge win and if any

00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:52,289
of you have some have an idea and are

00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:54,750
not sure how to proceed talk to each

00:55:52,289 --> 00:55:56,700
other or talk to any of them or if you

00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:58,619
think the foundation can help we are all

00:55:56,700 --> 00:56:00,210
here right that's how our community has

00:55:58,619 --> 00:56:01,490
grown so talk to each other let's figure

00:56:00,210 --> 00:56:04,650
out

00:56:01,490 --> 00:56:08,309
yeah just one of cornelisz comments

00:56:04,650 --> 00:56:10,260
maybe think that one of the detracting

00:56:08,309 --> 00:56:11,579
reasons what do these weird detracting

00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:14,420
reasons people have against Cloud

00:56:11,579 --> 00:56:16,410
Foundry is oh that's enterprise software

00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:19,440
one of the great things the Cloud

00:56:16,410 --> 00:56:21,660
Foundry foundation has done is build up

00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:24,059
an ecosystem that really includes the

00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:26,430
users not just the builders and that

00:56:24,059 --> 00:56:28,650
includes many enterprises and why does

00:56:26,430 --> 00:56:29,869
include many enterprises because they've

00:56:28,650 --> 00:56:34,770
all discovered it works

00:56:29,869 --> 00:56:39,660
this software is transformative shocking

00:56:34,770 --> 00:56:42,900
and that's that's the that gets them to

00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:45,089
the elements of well what is it about

00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:47,549
that value that we're trying to bring

00:56:45,089 --> 00:56:49,650
and you know you can do it you can say

00:56:47,549 --> 00:56:52,020
the big guys using it but you know what

00:56:49,650 --> 00:56:57,390
you can get that same value into any

00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:59,520
size organization and you know so so

00:56:57,390 --> 00:57:01,170
what's some times given as a you know a

00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:05,640
seller oh that's enterprising I mean I

00:57:01,170 --> 00:57:08,369
guess Linux is enterprising now but it

00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:11,010
still seems to be used an awful lot so

00:57:08,369 --> 00:57:12,900
yeah it's it is really about what what

00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:14,970
the values that it's bringing and see

00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:16,950
that that growth in the attraction it

00:57:14,970 --> 00:57:19,829
has in a very lovely quiet and sort of

00:57:16,950 --> 00:57:21,779
different model it is a different set of

00:57:19,829 --> 00:57:23,309
people that you know you're trying to

00:57:21,779 --> 00:57:28,890
interact with but there's a lot of value

00:57:23,309 --> 00:57:31,650
it brings any other questions or do you

00:57:28,890 --> 00:57:33,630
want me to ask one question so I

00:57:31,650 --> 00:57:35,309
actually just want to share since

00:57:33,630 --> 00:57:38,099
there's a pause I'm going to share an

00:57:35,309 --> 00:57:40,740
anecdote so earlier this year I spent a

00:57:38,099 --> 00:57:43,079
bit of time with a couple of my pivotal

00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:45,670
colleagues and a couple of my VMware

00:57:43,079 --> 00:57:49,739
colleagues doing a

00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:53,259
kind of a teaching each other about

00:57:49,739 --> 00:57:57,789
cluster API which for those of you who

00:57:53,259 --> 00:58:01,059
don't know cluster API is thought of as

00:57:57,789 --> 00:58:03,039
a Bosch like thing in the kubernetes

00:58:01,059 --> 00:58:05,549
community it is something that's used to

00:58:03,039 --> 00:58:08,589
take care of kubernetes clusters and

00:58:05,549 --> 00:58:10,599
Bosch and the interesting thing and I'll

00:58:08,589 --> 00:58:11,859
leave with this it's it's just such a

00:58:10,599 --> 00:58:13,390
perfect example of what we're talking

00:58:11,859 --> 00:58:17,380
about in the differences in these

00:58:13,390 --> 00:58:19,150
communities on day one one of my VMware

00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:22,390
colleagues that came from the hefty

00:58:19,150 --> 00:58:26,859
oside Tim st. Clair who actually leads

00:58:22,390 --> 00:58:29,529
the cluster lifecycle sig in the

00:58:26,859 --> 00:58:31,089
kubernetes community when he started one

00:58:29,529 --> 00:58:33,009
of the first things that he said and he

00:58:31,089 --> 00:58:34,569
was teaching us about cluster API was

00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:36,549
one of the first things he said was we

00:58:34,569 --> 00:58:38,349
come from a Linux mindset we come from

00:58:36,549 --> 00:58:40,619
an open-source mindset we are all about

00:58:38,349 --> 00:58:44,410
components we are all about optionality

00:58:40,619 --> 00:58:47,410
etc when it came time the next day for

00:58:44,410 --> 00:58:50,289
us to introduce Bosch we talked about

00:58:47,410 --> 00:58:53,680
what we had pivotal called the 5 SS and

00:58:50,289 --> 00:58:57,279
we started with what are the values that

00:58:53,680 --> 00:59:00,160
you get from Bosch stability scalability

00:58:57,279 --> 00:59:03,789
cost savings the S comes in the second

00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:06,849
word and so on and that I think is I

00:59:03,789 --> 00:59:09,880
think it's a great exemplar of how these

00:59:06,849 --> 00:59:11,319
two communities are different and I

00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:13,720
don't think that that's that's not a

00:59:11,319 --> 00:59:18,029
value judgment in either direction it's

00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:21,999
just an observation and as we try to

00:59:18,029 --> 00:59:23,950
blend or bring together these recipes in

00:59:21,999 --> 00:59:27,509
the Test Kitchen we need to be we need

00:59:23,950 --> 00:59:30,759
to honor actually both of those cultures

00:59:27,509 --> 00:59:32,140
understand your audience right tailor

00:59:30,759 --> 00:59:35,200
your message to the audience that you're

00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:36,730
trying to build and I think that brings

00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:38,650
us back to what you said earlier which I

00:59:36,730 --> 00:59:40,089
thought was it was excellent is I think

00:59:38,650 --> 00:59:42,579
it's going to be very critical for us

00:59:40,089 --> 00:59:45,849
going forward to find that balance

00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:47,739
between having a very clear opinion of a

00:59:45,849 --> 00:59:50,499
bunch of pieces that actually fit

00:59:47,739 --> 00:59:52,690
together and work together versus you

00:59:50,499 --> 00:59:54,730
know the coordinators community a bunch

00:59:52,690 --> 00:59:56,319
of Lego blocks that gets dumped out in

00:59:54,730 --> 00:59:58,509
front of you is you know pick out the

00:59:56,319 --> 00:59:59,320
ones that you that that might work

00:59:58,509 --> 01:00:01,060
together so

00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:04,240
I think striking that balance between

01:00:01,060 --> 01:00:08,230
stuff that is curated opinionated and

01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:09,130
working and proven to work versus if you

01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:10,930
don't look at the caught native

01:00:09,130 --> 01:00:12,910
foundation I mean it

01:00:10,930 --> 01:00:14,200
computer foundation it does seem like

01:00:12,910 --> 01:00:16,510
this you know you've seen the scatter

01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:17,860
diagram of all these technologies out

01:00:16,510 --> 01:00:20,140
there's like which one do you pick and

01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:22,360
and I think that that that's the big

01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:23,230
strength of the cloud foundry foundation

01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:26,400
that we have there we gotta be very

01:00:23,230 --> 01:00:30,570
careful I think not to use lose that I

01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:32,740
might just add one final thing to that

01:00:30,570 --> 01:00:35,770
myself we had a very interesting

01:00:32,740 --> 01:00:37,420
discussion earlier today and there was

01:00:35,770 --> 01:00:39,130
an analogy coming up and this is why I

01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:40,780
was asking to that very same question of

01:00:39,130 --> 01:00:43,540
yours earlier does it be an either/or

01:00:40,780 --> 01:00:45,960
and when you think about there is

01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:48,250
Volkswagen a Volkswagen here in the room

01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:52,570
there are a couple people out there well

01:00:48,250 --> 01:00:59,740
yes maybe you don't count in this my

01:00:52,570 --> 01:01:01,080
example though like when you look at you

01:00:59,740 --> 01:01:04,000
know when you look at Volkswagen

01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:05,680
Volkswagen builds cars everybody

01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,540
understands right and people these

01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:09,940
people in Europe understand that there

01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:12,160
is one platform so you can buy the same

01:01:09,940 --> 01:01:13,960
car technically the same cars but a lot

01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:17,410
of common ingredients right and they're

01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:17,950
marketed under bands of VW brands of

01:01:17,410 --> 01:01:21,280
Skoda

01:01:17,950 --> 01:01:22,930
brands of I don't know say at whatever

01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:25,930
rights it but under the covers it's a

01:01:22,930 --> 01:01:28,120
lot of the same technology right and and

01:01:25,930 --> 01:01:30,070
from from from that perspective and and

01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:31,900
then they still differentiate on the

01:01:30,070 --> 01:01:33,700
brand like you know Skoda might have the

01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:36,250
better navigation system in there or

01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:37,750
someone might have whatever whatever

01:01:36,250 --> 01:01:41,110
their distinguishing factor is but the

01:01:37,750 --> 01:01:44,040
base components is still opinionated in

01:01:41,110 --> 01:01:46,570
the sense that someone in the VW

01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:48,640
ecosystem has decided we're going to use

01:01:46,570 --> 01:01:50,110
this transmission and everybody's going

01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:51,940
to use this one transmission so you do

01:01:50,110 --> 01:01:53,830
not differentiate on transmissions you

01:01:51,940 --> 01:01:57,220
can differentiate on other stuff and go

01:01:53,830 --> 01:01:59,110
off and tell 0 right and I think from a

01:01:57,220 --> 01:02:01,000
you know from that perspective if we're

01:01:59,110 --> 01:02:03,780
starting to look at that that our

01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:07,270
founder foundation needs to become that

01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:09,829
thing that platform that basically says

01:02:07,270 --> 01:02:11,630
we have an opinion nation this is

01:02:09,829 --> 01:02:13,729
set of technologies that you are

01:02:11,630 --> 01:02:18,680
supposed to use to build that platform

01:02:13,729 --> 01:02:20,539
but allow differentiation at that you

01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:22,999
know at the next level so if a vendor

01:02:20,539 --> 01:02:25,329
like pivotal or a vendor like Sousa or a

01:02:22,999 --> 01:02:28,190
vendor like IBM then put together a

01:02:25,329 --> 01:02:30,410
distribution we could still put some

01:02:28,190 --> 01:02:34,400
icing on that cake and make it different

01:02:30,410 --> 01:02:36,890
and make it unique okay we are okay I'm

01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:38,089
getting two points of feedback here once

01:02:36,890 --> 01:02:39,979
it's our time is up

01:02:38,089 --> 01:02:42,799
and the other says I have five minutes

01:02:39,979 --> 01:02:45,680
I'm not sure which one is it but I will

01:02:42,799 --> 01:02:47,719
I don't remember so I will go it okay

01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:49,160
five minutes left thank you in these

01:02:47,719 --> 01:02:53,239
last five minutes I want the four of you

01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:55,729
to kind of summarize either a piece of

01:02:53,239 --> 01:02:58,339
advice or suggestion or your thoughts on

01:02:55,729 --> 01:03:01,339
where should we go from here I would

01:02:58,339 --> 01:03:02,989
like to start with parent I always like

01:03:01,339 --> 01:03:05,180
to call on him because he started

01:03:02,989 --> 01:03:05,509
decided it was your fault okay sure of

01:03:05,180 --> 01:03:08,539
course

01:03:05,509 --> 01:03:10,670
so where do we go from here as I said

01:03:08,539 --> 01:03:13,459
earlier I think the interesting

01:03:10,670 --> 01:03:16,160
conversation will be how do we take

01:03:13,459 --> 01:03:18,739
today's Cloud Foundry towards the world

01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:20,420
of on the one hand you have that like

01:03:18,739 --> 01:03:23,449
potentially smaller Cloud Foundry

01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:25,130
deployment that exists today and some of

01:03:23,449 --> 01:03:26,809
the vendors have already commercial

01:03:25,130 --> 01:03:28,609
offerings out that that provide that

01:03:26,809 --> 01:03:31,430
stuff but but then at the same time

01:03:28,609 --> 01:03:34,640
evolve the existing potentially bigger

01:03:31,430 --> 01:03:36,979
Bosch managed systems and that's for me

01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:39,349
like a very interesting conversation to

01:03:36,979 --> 01:03:42,349
have and I don't think that it's an

01:03:39,349 --> 01:03:45,319
either/or like companies like like IBM

01:03:42,349 --> 01:03:49,369
offer both and and I think that's like

01:03:45,319 --> 01:03:51,890
the interesting twist and and turn how

01:03:49,369 --> 01:03:54,170
to to make sure that like people that

01:03:51,890 --> 01:03:56,749
either decide for one side or the other

01:03:54,170 --> 01:03:59,299
or even like going down both routes are

01:03:56,749 --> 01:04:04,390
well served and continue to be well

01:03:59,299 --> 01:04:07,999
served by by this community Cornelia

01:04:04,390 --> 01:04:09,680
yeah so I think I think there's probably

01:04:07,999 --> 01:04:12,529
nothing that's more important than that

01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:15,589
right now so I I do work for a company

01:04:12,529 --> 01:04:18,769
that has a distribution of both cloud

01:04:15,589 --> 01:04:19,819
foundry and of kubernetes and I can tell

01:04:18,769 --> 01:04:23,160
you that from a very practical

01:04:19,819 --> 01:04:25,140
standpoint when you have this

01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:28,500
area of confusion that we are in right

01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:30,540
now it can stall everything it can stall

01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:32,850
people's progress from a sales

01:04:30,540 --> 01:04:35,730
perspective its stall sales but I I

01:04:32,850 --> 01:04:38,310
don't get paid on sales at all so I am

01:04:35,730 --> 01:04:40,770
always the thing that stalls is the

01:04:38,310 --> 01:04:42,630
value that organizations could get from

01:04:40,770 --> 01:04:44,190
that and so I would a hundred percent

01:04:42,630 --> 01:04:48,390
agree that there is nothing more

01:04:44,190 --> 01:04:51,390
important right now than for us to start

01:04:48,390 --> 01:04:53,460
to think very concretely about what

01:04:51,390 --> 01:04:56,340
would that evolution look like for

01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:58,020
somebody who wants to continue realizing

01:04:56,340 --> 01:05:00,150
the values that they're getting out of a

01:04:58,020 --> 01:05:03,140
an opinionated platform like cloud

01:05:00,150 --> 01:05:05,970
foundry as we make this transition over

01:05:03,140 --> 01:05:12,510
let's let's keep that in mind not just

01:05:05,970 --> 01:05:15,780
the technical components yeah I just you

01:05:12,510 --> 01:05:20,340
know keep an open mind there's a lot of

01:05:15,780 --> 01:05:23,250
technologies out there and look at them

01:05:20,340 --> 01:05:28,170
for for what they offer as benefits not

01:05:23,250 --> 01:05:30,270
