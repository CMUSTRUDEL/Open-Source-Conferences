Description: 
	Stratos Project Update: The Future of the Stratos Management UI - Neil MacDougall & Richard Cox, SUSE 

In this talk we will review the development of the Stratos Web-based Management UI for Cloud Foundry and both summarise and demonstrate the new features and improvements that have been added recently.  We will also look forward to the year ahead and discuss where we we are heading with our work on Extensions and the new features that we are planning.  Come join us at this session to learn more about Stratos, to see a live demo of it in action and to hear about some of the awesome new features coming your way!

oh thank you for coming fantastic right

00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:08,189
last last but one session so what we're

00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:09,780
going to talk about today is progress

00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:12,780
update on what we've been doing recently

00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:14,190
with Stratis we are gonna then look

00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,410
ahead talk about some of the future

00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:18,810
stuff we're working on Richard is going

00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:20,460
to give a demo to kind of showcase some

00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:22,410
of the features we've added fairly

00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,359
recently and then there should be a tiny

00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:26,640
bit of wrap up at the end and we'll try

00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:32,820
and leave five minutes or so for

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:36,120
questions so we think we came out

00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:38,850
incubation so there wasn't much fuss

00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:41,340
around this or any announcements but we

00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:43,980
are now graduating from a incubated

00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:47,039
project to a core clad family project so

00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:48,899
we will be moving a gap organizations I

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,879
should be transparent github will

00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:53,699
redirect over time we'll make some

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,170
updates to our references but we'll keep

00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:56,730
you posted in a slight channel so that's

00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,289
an awesome achievement for the tape so

00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:02,699
we're super super pleased to be doing

00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:05,580
this I found this this morning some some

00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:06,990
company source e 2e posted this

00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:10,680
yesterday they've done an analysis of

00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:14,250
the Cloud Foundry projects and Stratos

00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,860
is the most active repository so um I

00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:20,040
want to make a point we do still

00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:22,920
actively develop and maintain Stratos as

00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,350
a core team of suzer who do that we have

00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,540
others that contribute PRS and features

00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:30,299
as well and they said some quite nice

00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:34,409
things as well go take a look in terms

00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:35,850
of what we've done recently call Stratos

00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:37,500
is kind of the core so independent of

00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:42,030
any particular feature there's a few

00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:43,770
things we've done we we kind of a second

00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:45,689
point where we continually try and

00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,909
refine the user experience and usability

00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:50,340
across the board so if we get features

00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:52,380
in and we get feedback or we ourselves

00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,700
say hey this is not providing the

00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,040
message friends will try and refine and

00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:59,100
tweak those things particular we've done

00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:01,350
around the navigation so we had quite a

00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,939
bit of horizontal nav in some of the

00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:05,869
areas that's now been moved down the

00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:08,280
side I think which is which is nicer

00:02:05,869 --> 00:02:09,720
I'll skip some of that or there's some

00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,430
improvements in terms of being able to

00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,300
focus and tap around the UI using a

00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,850
keyboard we've got this

00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:17,350
new home screen if you're not seeing it

00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:19,270
so you know with Stratus you can

00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:21,580
register and connect multiple cloud

00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:23,080
foundries or foundations you can end up

00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:24,850
with quite a lot of orgs and spaces and

00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,530
apps and so when you go in you know if

00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:27,580
you wanted to look at particular amp you

00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:29,950
kind of have to work your way down and

00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:31,840
find it to find out what's going on so

00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:34,600
with this you can have favorite all of

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:39,220
those entities so you can favorite a CAD

00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:41,800
foundry or an app or org or a space if

00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:43,780
you can do a surface but we're gonna

00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:46,750
read that and then if you write

00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:48,910
extensions on top of Stratus you can and

00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:51,280
also favorite entities in in those as

00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:53,020
well so this means when you come in as

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,520
shown here and ritual demo this you can

00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:57,970
kind of get to the apps that you maybe

00:02:54,520 --> 00:03:00,250
care about and then as you Jam around

00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:01,510
that you get your activity on the on the

00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:05,140
right as well so you can go back easily

00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:06,820
to where you've been in terms of some of

00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,990
the app stuff again I've thrown this one

00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:10,390
up there we've tried to make things a

00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:11,530
bit more visual across the UI so for

00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:13,180
example when you deploying an app you

00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:15,580
just get a more visual tile experience

00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:18,190
maybe user places we do things like

00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:19,360
autocomplete names as you type now just

00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:22,660
things to make it just a little bit

00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:25,030
easier and in terms of sort of user

00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:28,000
management you can now invite users into

00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:29,830
de Stratos so if you're an admin and

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,650
it's configured you can go into an org

00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:34,209
or a space you can say invite user you

00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:36,100
can enter their email address that it

00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:38,709
will send an email to them you can

00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:41,140
change the template but once you've done

00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:42,790
that before they've even kind of click

00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:44,920
through and come in you can continue

00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:46,390
that users created you can continue to

00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,120
set them up give them access to the orcs

00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:50,290
and spaces that you want them to access

00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,270
they'll get the email they click through

00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:54,160
set up a swerd and they're good to go

00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:57,540
straight away so that's now in there or

00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:59,530
something the cloud gov guys requested a

00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:00,880
few things on services again I think

00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:02,350
which will show this so we've now got

00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:05,110
support for the user provided service

00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:08,500
instances so those are shown together on

00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:10,690
the service wall which is quite nice you

00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:15,220
can browse service plans in the details

00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:17,859
page if a service has a JSON schema we

00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:19,900
show much nicer UI now when you unbind

00:04:17,859 --> 00:04:21,340
that service so instead of just getting

00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:23,740
in the ability to enter a JSON blob

00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:25,090
you'll get more of a form field based on

00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:26,350
the JSON schema for that service that's

00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:26,960
something our friends orange did just

00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:31,150
quite

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:33,080
and then a few other bits and bobs I

00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:35,420
guess one of the main features we've

00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:38,120
added is autoscaler so again this was a

00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:40,130
contribution from the IBM team so

00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:42,440
they've obviously recently revamped the

00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:45,710
autoscaler service they previously had a

00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:48,200
UI for scaler what they've done is

00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:49,370
they've kind of written a new UI and

00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,410
they've written that inside of Stratos

00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:53,780
so we have an extensions mechanism

00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:55,520
they've used that to add support for to

00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:57,410
scale it into Stratos and again Richard

00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,810
will show this but it lets you for an

00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:02,480
app view the policy create the policy

00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:04,700
edit the policy and then view events so

00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:06,290
you can see okay what why did autoscaler

00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,960
and increase the number of instances up

00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:10,070
or down so it's quite nice

00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:11,990
and we've also more recently added

00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:14,090
support for quotas so previously in

00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:16,250
Stratos you could see a quota but you

00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:19,370
couldn't actually edit or create so now

00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:20,870
you can go into an org or a space you

00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:22,910
can edit the quota you can create a new

00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:28,900
one you can assign a a quota to a space

00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:31,250
or an org so it's quite nice what's next

00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:33,740
so I talked about extensions I think

00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:35,900
there's I went a long point I kind of

00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:39,140
make his Stratis is kind of already

00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:41,120
extensible we have I won't go into the

00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:43,580
detail but we have various places

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,890
throughout the the code where you can

00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:47,990
add in your own extensions so you can

00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:49,670
create custom themes for example which

00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:52,310
is something we at Sousa do you can

00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:53,870
change the colors you can change all the

00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:55,220
logos there's things that a lot of

00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:56,270
companies actually do right and often

00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:58,130
they don't go any further than that they

00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:59,810
just take the course Stratus tweak the

00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:01,580
colors and that they're local in the

00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:02,870
place so it's something we support you

00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:05,900
can change the login screen if you wish

00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:07,190
if you want it to look more different

00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,290
than the standard one and again that's

00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:11,930
something we're sue to do so it here's

00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:15,740
to our corporate standard you can add in

00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:18,440
and custom UI views so we have certain

00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:21,020
points in the UI where you can add in a

00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:23,180
new view so we use angular for the

00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:24,560
front-end with angular decorators you

00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:27,050
can effectively just take an angular

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,240
component add a decorator say where you

00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:30,980
want this to appear and then that'll get

00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:34,280
inserted into the right place in the UI

00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:35,660
so for example in the application wall

00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,490
maybe we'll show this you can add

00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:39,680
buttons into the action bar at the top

00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:40,430
you can on the application view you can

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,170
add

00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:43,520
- the seitan - generally most of the

00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:46,250
places that you care about you can add

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:49,490
in your own nav items linked in to the

00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:51,380
right place and you can add stuff on the

00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:54,020
back end as well so that uses golang if

00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:55,700
the we have sort of a generic proxying

00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:58,880
mechanism when you're talking to a rest

00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:00,260
server or rest api if that doesn't meet

00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,780
your needs for whatever you're trying to

00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:12,740
do then you can extend the back end with

00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:15,470
your own api's yeah you cannot remove

00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:18,050
buns so that's a good question though so

00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:19,820
there is a feature request where there

00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:21,410
are some features we have in the UI that

00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:24,050
not everybody wants so we do things like

00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:26,420
you can SSH into an application instance

00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:28,340
and you can deploy applications from the

00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:30,950
UI and those two features are ones that

00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:32,840
maybe I don't know certainly in the past

00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:35,360
has said hey I'd want those for my orc

00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:37,160
right my company doesn't really want to

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,380
let people do them of course you can do

00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,700
those further the command line but in

00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:43,730
the UI they were like well I'd you know

00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:45,320
I'd rather not have those so when I come

00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:47,180
up to talk about extensions now those

00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,950
are the kind of things that if we factor

00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:50,840
out into separate extensions that when

00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:52,160
somebody comes to build their Stratos

00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:55,580
they could choose not to include those

00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:57,530
so that'd be a way of disabling those I

00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:59,030
think more generically we will try and

00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:00,320
look at our way over time where you can

00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:02,630
turn some features on off and

00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:07,790
administrator could do that but we don't

00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:09,800
have that right now excuse me so I can't

00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:11,840
approach that we have for extension is

00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:14,630
very much kind of catered for

00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,640
somebody that wants to take Stratos add

00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:18,620
some extra bits in maybe change the

00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:20,510
theme a little bit right so the way you

00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:21,950
do that is you fork the repo you put

00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:24,170
your changes in a particular place and

00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:28,640
then we minimize any conflicts when you

00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:30,680
come to kind of rebase that's okay but

00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:32,240
we want to make it easier for people to

00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,040
share extensions right if they do that

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,960
then it's in their repo yes somebody

00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,580
else could come along take that custom

00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:39,710
code out maybe put it in their version

00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:42,800
make it work what we want to be able to

00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:44,210
do is to support users that they want to

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,710
build a version of Stratos they want to

00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:47,180
take some extensions from other people

00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:48,740
that have made them available and of

00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:50,750
course we want people who want to create

00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:52,580
extensions to better do that on their

00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,840
own to make them available to others to

00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:56,360
use

00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:57,890
and we want people to be able to build

00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:03,170
those extensions kind of independent of

00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:04,730
the core team so kind of want to get to

00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:07,100
this kind of world where there's a bunch

00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:08,990
of course Stratis pieces as separate

00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:11,240
packages there's a bunch of extensions

00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:15,410
some may be developed by the the core

00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:17,690
team some develops maybe by the IBM team

00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:19,160
for example the autoscaler some maybe

00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:21,050
the Sousa but ones that we've talked

00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:22,760
about here that are nothing to do with

00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:26,600
Cloud Foundry and then maybe a bunch of

00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:30,350
custom themes right and we want some of

00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:32,089
those to live in different repos so if

00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:33,920
the core Stratos team will take care of

00:09:32,089 --> 00:09:35,810
things like the strategies and maybe the

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,760
Cloud Foundry but maybe the IBM

00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:39,650
autoscaler lives in a separate repo

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,960
right and maybe the Souza ones live in

00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:44,120
another repo and you know your extension

00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:45,950
of your own repo which means that you as

00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:48,170
a developer of an extension you know

00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:50,029
there's a clear ownership for the code

00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:52,100
you can release it at your own cadence

00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:53,690
you don't have to worry about kind of

00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:57,020
liaising with the Stratos team together

00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:59,930
PR merged into our repository so that's

00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:02,150
where we're trying to get to the front

00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:03,560
end extensions because we use angular

00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:06,050
those will be angular libraries

00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:08,290
published as NPM packages on the back

00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:10,520
end you know those will be go modules

00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:11,900
which won a leverage standard practices

00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,610
as much as possible for those there's a

00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:16,010
little bit of custom stuff we need to do

00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:19,220
a theming and we're going to have a

00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:20,540
little bit of metadata so that you can

00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,890
declare dependencies between the back

00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:23,780
end and the front end components right

00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:25,670
so if you're including a front-end

00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:27,920
component and it needs a back-end piece

00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:31,490
then extension then we'll make sure that

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:33,710
you can describe that metadata and we're

00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:35,810
working currently kind of reject things

00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:36,709
so that we can enable this that's the

00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:39,320
bulk of the work we're doing at the

00:10:36,709 --> 00:10:40,850
moment okay

00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,930
so another thing we're going to be

00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:45,020
working on we haven't started yet

00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:48,800
hopefully where we September November

00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:50,570
this year is really on v3 a rich has

00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:54,200
been in a lot of work to kind of capture

00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:56,690
our requirements for v3 so we're working

00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,550
with that team we have quite different

00:10:56,690 --> 00:11:00,709
sort of use cases to things like the CLI

00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:03,080
right because with Stratos you can have

00:11:00,709 --> 00:11:04,459
multiple foundations registered it's you

00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:07,130
know you can Jam round and browse

00:11:04,459 --> 00:11:07,769
between all spaces apps very quickly so

00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:09,929
the API need

00:11:07,769 --> 00:11:12,300
to let us do that efficiently right with

00:11:09,929 --> 00:11:13,470
the CLI you tend to target an org if it

00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:16,259
takes a couple of seconds to come back

00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:17,670
you don't really perceive much much of a

00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:19,980
problem that in the CLI right you then

00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:21,929
target a space you then push around port

00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:23,550
you ask about your app you can kind of

00:11:21,929 --> 00:11:25,949
live with a little bit of making a

00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:27,600
request per one of those but when we're

00:11:25,949 --> 00:11:29,309
browsing and you want to switch returned

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,079
at wall in and out of an app we need

00:11:29,309 --> 00:11:32,249
really efficient calls that letters get

00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:34,980
as much of the information as possible

00:11:32,249 --> 00:11:36,959
in the most efficient manner so we are

00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:39,269
working with a v3 API team to try make

00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,709
sure that our needs are met we're going

00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:42,389
to start implementing as say November

00:11:40,709 --> 00:11:46,889
and what we're really trying to work out

00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:48,869
is how we continue on can continue to

00:11:46,889 --> 00:11:50,879
support both v2 and v3 so our current

00:11:48,869 --> 00:11:54,439
plan once we've got extensions in place

00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:56,429
is that we'll take the v2 kind of

00:11:54,439 --> 00:11:58,379
version of the Cloud Foundry which will

00:11:56,429 --> 00:12:01,589
become an extension Stratus will then

00:11:58,379 --> 00:12:03,569
clone that to make a v3 version will

00:12:01,589 --> 00:12:05,610
leave the v2 one alone will do fixes if

00:12:03,569 --> 00:12:08,129
there are you know security fixes or

00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:10,439
kind of major bugs to fix and then we'll

00:12:08,129 --> 00:12:13,619
work on the v3 migrating that to the API

00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:16,439
and taking care of the new kind of

00:12:13,619 --> 00:12:21,209
features that are part of the v3 API so

00:12:16,439 --> 00:12:22,649
what kind of look like this but if

00:12:21,209 --> 00:12:23,910
you've got like cards on the we have the

00:12:22,649 --> 00:12:26,129
app wall hopefully familiar with that

00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:27,720
where you see our applications we'll

00:12:26,129 --> 00:12:30,779
make an update so that we'll both show

00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:32,959
v2 and v3 apps so let's say you had a

00:12:30,779 --> 00:12:36,240
cloud foundry that was using the v2 API

00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:37,470
yet a newer Cloud Foundry is v3 you

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,869
would see those applications

00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:42,149
side-by-side if you clicked on a v2 you

00:12:39,869 --> 00:12:43,829
would go to a route like this and inside

00:12:42,149 --> 00:12:46,589
of angular it's very good it will route

00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:48,660
that and use the components for that v2

00:12:46,589 --> 00:12:50,309
so that would be the veto extension if

00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:52,259
you clicked on the other one would take

00:12:50,309 --> 00:12:54,720
you to the v3 extension and you would

00:12:52,259 --> 00:12:56,790
use the angle of v3 code and the nice

00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,470
thing with the way angular works is it

00:12:56,790 --> 00:13:00,389
would only load the code for these if

00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:02,699
you actually invoked it so if you never

00:13:00,389 --> 00:13:04,049
used a v2 app that v3 code would never

00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:09,149
get loaded into the browser so it's

00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:10,769
quite nice araignee support so there's

00:13:09,149 --> 00:13:12,569
not much too much we have to do for this

00:13:10,769 --> 00:13:14,069
but we want to make sure that if you're

00:13:12,569 --> 00:13:16,619
using Cloud Foundry with ireenie

00:13:14,069 --> 00:13:19,529
that we do the right thing we have some

00:13:16,619 --> 00:13:20,870
integration with the metrics so whether

00:13:19,529 --> 00:13:23,060
you're using the Met

00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:25,339
shut that we have or Bosch Prometheus

00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:26,990
metrics there's all currently a when

00:13:25,339 --> 00:13:29,900
Stratos where you can wire in metrics

00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:31,700
and we then show you for example which

00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:33,320
cell an application instance is running

00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:35,450
on we want to make sure we can do the

00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:37,610
same kind of thing for ireenie so you

00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:39,589
can see which kubernetes node your

00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:41,029
application is running on and then if

00:13:39,589 --> 00:13:42,980
there's a problem with that application

00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:47,210
you may be spot that there's a problem

00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:48,890
with a particular node and then sort of

00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:51,020
more generally we continue to update the

00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:53,870
stack that we use for angular sorry for

00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:55,250
Strato so angle on the front end I said

00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:57,100
go on the back end keeping track of

00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:59,839
those particularly on the front end

00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:02,120
angular revs in every sort of six months

00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,550
from age version be the next one version

00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:07,460
9 it's quite a major rewrite in terms of

00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:09,440
finally supporting the IV renderer this

00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:12,290
should kind of bring as much better

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:14,510
performance improvements particular end

00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:16,790
compilations so we do have some issues

00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:18,710
with UCF push Stratos without pre

00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:20,690
building it it just takes a long time to

00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:23,690
compile and this will help with that a

00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:29,120
lot and it also finally provides API so

00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:31,160
that we can do localization then I guess

00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,890
more generally with project improvements

00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:35,420
the way we run things you know we're

00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:38,390
trying to get towards monthly releases

00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:39,709
what kind of does that work at half by

00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:40,880
weight I don't know every two months at

00:14:39,709 --> 00:14:42,550
the moment so we want to get better at

00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,540
doing that and do that more regularly

00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:46,580
also improve the visibility of what

00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:48,250
we're working on so that people can see

00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:50,839
what's coming in the next version

00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:53,690
representing some of the major features

00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:56,000
of epics represent those as projects in

00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:57,470
github so you can see what work is left

00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,170
to do before particular feature makes it

00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:04,910
in and then will reopen doing the

00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:06,709
regular project meetings okay so that

00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:07,940
was a quick ways through and then I'm

00:15:06,709 --> 00:15:09,830
gonna hand over to Richard hold em you

00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:18,820
some of those things hopefully and then

00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:22,520
we'll come back and just wrap up okay

00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:23,870
just start from the start so I'll take

00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,459
you to some of the features yes as I've

00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:27,860
said that we've recently added in last 6

00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:30,470
to 6 or 12 months so the first thing you

00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:32,690
may notice in a lot of talks we've we've

00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:33,829
had this conference and we've been

00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:34,670
showing the downstream version and this

00:15:33,829 --> 00:15:37,160
is the upstream version

00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:40,130
with a generic blue background and and

00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:45,050
the Cloud Foundry Stratus logo I'm now

00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:46,070
going to awkwardly type in password and

00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:47,570
one of the things we were previously

00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,980
write about two months ago when you

00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:50,180
logged in you'll get straight taken

00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,710
straight to the application world where

00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:52,880
you can see all your apps and that might

00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:55,370
be a bit of a slow process because we

00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,600
might be fetching a lot of apps so we've

00:15:55,370 --> 00:16:00,670
kind of optimized it now and have this

00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:10,010
new home screen I'm going to log in and

00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:11,240
retype the password and you're straight

00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:13,070
into the home screen and the home screen

00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,420
is Neil mentioned you can see entities

00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:15,440
that you've you favorite it you've gone

00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,310
through the app and favorite it and the

00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,560
reason where we did this is because

00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:20,030
sometimes the organizations and spaces

00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,370
were quite a few clicks down into the

00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:23,750
interface and you might not be able to

00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:27,140
quickly get somewhere you want to go to

00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:28,640
so now you can favorite these and then

00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:30,770
when you click on them you can get to

00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,850
taken straight down to the parts where

00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:33,860
you're interested in you can see the

00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:35,450
summary for these entities and at the

00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:38,420
moment you can you can favorite

00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:39,740
applications organizations and spaces so

00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:42,110
I'm going to click around on a few of

00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:44,330
these just to show you where you can

00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:46,790
kinda quickly get into you can also

00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:48,680
search in here as well so if you have a

00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:51,260
hundred here then you can you can easily

00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:53,570
kind of find the ones you wanted that

00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:59,870
was a bad example or you can filter the

00:16:53,570 --> 00:17:01,130
types as well I'm so going to continue

00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:03,680
clicking around on these a little bit

00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:04,970
more and then share the second part the

00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,490
home screen which is basically the

00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:09,200
activity side and you can see that the

00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:10,190
we have a list of top which is mostly

00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,560
the frequent

00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:15,470
entities you go to or the the recent

00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:17,060
ones and if we go to one of these you

00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:18,920
can also access the the recent count on

00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:20,330
the top right from wherever you are in

00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:23,120
the interface and I'll be using that a

00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:26,930
little bit later so let's move on to the

00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:28,490
application wall so the up all is where

00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:30,080
you see all the applications of all the

00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:31,910
co-founders you've connected and you can

00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:36,310
do stuff like filtering by those or

00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:38,290
searching and sorting we also support a

00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:40,190
normal table view as well

00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:42,320
anyway notice that some of these have

00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:43,370
colors associated with them so that

00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,660
something we're going to be green saying

00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:46,760
everything's right it's deployed all the

00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:48,290
instances that you'd expect her up and

00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:51,080
for instance this one's red

00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:52,310
as an operator or a space manager or dev

00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,840
you may be interested in going and

00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:56,990
looking at the red ones and so they're

00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,610
immediately visible so I'm gonna now dip

00:17:56,990 --> 00:18:00,320
into deploying an application so

00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:02,270
instructor so you can deploy you can

00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,770
create a shell of an application or you

00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:06,590
can actually provide some source code

00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:10,130
and do a CF push and what we've added in

00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:12,410
the last six to 12 months is support for

00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:15,020
public it lab which I'm going to run

00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:19,760
through now so I'm going to select a

00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:24,080
primary organization and space and then

00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:25,910
I'm going to provide a project and one

00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:28,850
of the things we've done here is to to

00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:32,630
make it easier to find your repo is to

00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:34,550
autocomplete and we did choose a quick

00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:36,560
app but here we've got out and fetched

00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:38,330
information to do with that repo in the

00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:40,640
last the branches so we're just going to

00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:45,290
deploy for a master and we're going to

00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:50,000
select a commit and then we can supply

00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:51,800
some overrides and we're gonna create a

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,450
random route as well and they're gonna

00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:56,720
hit deploy and we're gonna pray to the

00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:59,960
demo gods and thankfully we do get the

00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:02,150
logs so this is the log server as the CF

00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:03,620
push and we're not gonna we're not going

00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:04,670
to wait for that to finish we're just

00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:06,650
going to go straight to the the

00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:08,510
application summary page here you can

00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:11,210
see some general stats about it how many

00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:13,430
instances where nibble work from where

00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:14,780
it's from I'm not going to go into that

00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:16,730
too much detail sake is not too much

00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:18,260
this has changed but I'll show you the

00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:19,940
the github page where you can see in

00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:21,680
more specifics about where it came from

00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:23,540
and the repo and you can see the list of

00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:25,430
commits and see that what commit that

00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:29,990
the application is currently on so that

00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:31,970
as so you can also do other things with

00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:33,020
these commits so say if you it's Friday

00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:34,910
afternoon and what you do on Friday

00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:36,050
afternoon you push the production and

00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:37,310
then you go down to the pub and

00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:39,050
celebrate your new features that you've

00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:40,460
just pushed but there's a Twitter storm

00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:41,570
and there's problems with this new

00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:44,530
version so you need to go back to the

00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:46,610
previous one so it's quite easy to then

00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:48,170
go back to a page so you can log on to

00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:50,030
your phone while you're in the pub and

00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:53,450
hit deploy and restore that to a

00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:54,860
previous version one of the other big

00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:56,990
features that is recently been added is

00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:59,900
the ability to auto scale so this is all

00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:01,580
contributed by IBM our friends at IBM

00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:04,070
I'm gonna quickly

00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:05,600
you through what you do with autoscaler

00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:07,640
so you've said first of all you set a

00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,380
policy and then we can see that policy

00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,220
and see what happens with the autistic

00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,900
owner so we're going to have some

00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:15,440
default instant counts

00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:24,140
you can add scaling rules and add a

00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:27,080
couple of these and also to foreign

00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:28,550
policy you can define schedules to say

00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,750
to change those incidents counts and you

00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:32,150
can have them repeating on certain days

00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:33,680
of the week or you can set specific time

00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:36,800
frames so maybe a Christmas you want to

00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:38,090
you want to have more instances or if

00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:41,000
it's if it was the school holidays you

00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:43,340
won't have less so let's get finished

00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,710
they'll create the policy and we could

00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:46,610
set hanging to the policy view screen

00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:48,080
you can see what basically something

00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:49,700
wrong received is specified and any

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,410
schedules that you've added if this was

00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:53,720
an old app you might see scaling and

00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:54,980
scaling events at the bottom and when

00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,960
the application well then when the

00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:58,760
autoscaler starts fetching the metrics

00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,920
and receives them you will start seeing

00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:03,740
them up here but we're not going to wait

00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:05,420
for those but if we did have left lots

00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:10,100
of metrics we have the chance to show

00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:12,560
those in an interesting way so that's it

00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:14,360
for the for the app side I'm going to

00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:15,410
move on to the marketplace and the

00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,510
marketplace is where you can see

00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:19,250
services for all of the club boundaries

00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:20,990
that you've connected it's a little bit

00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:24,350
slow because it's going out to IBM that

00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:25,370
has a quite a few services ok so one of

00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:27,530
one of the feedback we had from the

00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:28,700
community was that the when you the

00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:30,470
first time you see service plan because

00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:32,600
yes service plans is when you create a

00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:34,010
service so you may want to find a free

00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:36,590
one first to know that you want to go on

00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:38,990
and then then create an instance so now

00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:41,780
you can go into the summary for that

00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:44,360
service and see a list of service plans

00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:46,250
so here we can see there's a lovely free

00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:48,320
one so there's essentials which is free

00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:50,030
so we're going to do that also on this

00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,950
page you can see the list of instances

00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:53,120
and here you can see there's one called

00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:54,910
elite me so what do you see when you see

00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:59,060
something says delete me you delete it

00:21:54,910 --> 00:22:00,230
and previously right about a year ago we

00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,700
didn't we had out I think yeah we had a

00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:03,350
request from someone from the last

00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:06,290
summit that basically was a little bit

00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:07,580
too easy to delete important things and

00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:09,200
you could just click the affirmative on

00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:10,640
the dialog and you've just deleted an

00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,040
org with lots of things in that you know

00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,960
what is late so for some important

00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:18,620
entities we've added the ability to

00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:20,960
basically just so I so make you kind of

00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:23,210
strictly think about what you're doing

00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:25,070
before you delete it so we'll delete

00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:27,260
that one and then we're going to go and

00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:29,480
create we're going to create new delete

00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:30,799
me so we're going to select the

00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:33,559
organizer to the space we want to deploy

00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:36,230
that service to we're going to select

00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:40,460
the the free one that we've previously

00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:42,620
found and then we're going to provide it

00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:45,470
a name I'll get it ready for the next

00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:47,270
next demo so you can also specify the

00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:50,029
service parameters and for the service

00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:51,770
parameters at the moment is Jason one of

00:22:50,029 --> 00:22:53,450
our friends orange going to be did a

00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:54,020
feature that basically if the service

00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:55,580
returned

00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:58,429
Jason schema for the service parameters

00:22:55,580 --> 00:23:00,740
we would use that to populate or

00:22:58,429 --> 00:23:02,840
dynamically create a form that would

00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:05,270
have defaults in or kind of guides and

00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:06,640
place labels and that then we could then

00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:08,720
go on and create the Jason form I

00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:11,870
haven't yet got this configured up yet

00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:14,149
so it is there but I would love to demo

00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:16,330
that but I can't today someone hit

00:23:14,149 --> 00:23:22,700
finish and that hopefully should

00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:25,159
complete possibly and once you create a

00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:26,870
service you go to the service wall and

00:23:25,159 --> 00:23:27,919
this is like the marketplace this is but

00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:29,360
this is where you see all of these

00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:30,529
service instances that associated with

00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:33,020
all the Cloud Foundry to collect food

00:23:30,529 --> 00:23:37,130
you've you've registered and you can do

00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:39,529
the normal kind of filtering one of the

00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:41,450
requests we had last year we didn't have

00:23:39,529 --> 00:23:42,950
the ability to support user provider

00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:45,710
services and we had quite a lot of

00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:48,590
community feedback to to do that so now

00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:50,149
we can now we can create user provider

00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:51,770
services as well and you can do all the

00:23:50,149 --> 00:23:59,539
usual things like bind and bind to it to

00:23:51,770 --> 00:24:01,250
apps I'm gonna so one of the big things

00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:03,169
we had to do was to make this list

00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:04,909
available to showed two types of

00:24:03,169 --> 00:24:06,470
services this normal service instances

00:24:04,909 --> 00:24:11,799
and user provider service instances and

00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:14,000
you can filter filter on those as usual

00:24:11,799 --> 00:24:16,820
and that was it for services now moving

00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,230
on to Cloud Foundry so here we can see

00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:20,330
we've got the three three five families

00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:24,500
connected and we're going to dive into

00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:26,570
an SCF one of the problems you might

00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:28,519
have hid and we fit I know I hid a lot

00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:29,719
is when you deploy an app and it routes

00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:31,609
can you just get the message saying

00:24:29,719 --> 00:24:33,109
sweeties already taken and then you're

00:24:31,609 --> 00:24:34,609
like okay so where where is that root

00:24:33,109 --> 00:24:36,320
what's what's going on what apps it

00:24:34,609 --> 00:24:39,469
connected to so what we've done to help

00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:40,789
with that is a routes page so this is at

00:24:39,469 --> 00:24:43,039
a Cloud Foundry level you can see all

00:24:40,789 --> 00:24:46,849
the routes associated or in that and you

00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:49,309
can easily you can easily search or see

00:24:46,849 --> 00:24:50,330
which applications are attached and you

00:24:49,309 --> 00:24:52,369
can do all the things you might expect

00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:54,139
from that you can map them from all the

00:24:52,369 --> 00:24:57,979
attached applications or delete those

00:24:54,139 --> 00:25:02,950
routes entirely and now let's dive into

00:24:57,979 --> 00:25:06,019
an organization I'm going to summit and

00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:07,339
see the list of spaces so here we can

00:25:06,019 --> 00:25:09,979
see that our eyes are really taken to

00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:10,759
this yellow bar so as an operator you

00:25:09,979 --> 00:25:12,259
might think well hang of it something

00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:14,779
something's going to go on there so I'm

00:25:12,259 --> 00:25:16,700
going to investigate that dive into that

00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:19,159
space and in the space summary now you

00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:20,989
can see we've got a red got a red

00:25:19,159 --> 00:25:23,299
warning on the memory usage for this

00:25:20,989 --> 00:25:25,969
space it's basically telling us that

00:25:23,299 --> 00:25:27,079
we've approaching the quota limit and

00:25:25,969 --> 00:25:28,039
before run about a year ago that was

00:25:27,079 --> 00:25:29,779
going to be the end of the story you'd

00:25:28,039 --> 00:25:31,249
have to switch to the CLI to start

00:25:29,779 --> 00:25:34,190
addressing any quota issues but now we

00:25:31,249 --> 00:25:36,259
have quota support at the organization a

00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:38,839
space level so you can view all of the

00:25:36,259 --> 00:25:41,749
quotas at those levels you can create

00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:42,349
new edit and delete but we're feeling

00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:45,499
generous today

00:25:42,349 --> 00:25:48,339
so we're going to go in and update this

00:25:45,499 --> 00:25:55,129
quota and give the person some more

00:25:48,339 --> 00:25:57,079
memory to update that switch back to the

00:25:55,129 --> 00:25:58,479
summary and now as they've got lots more

00:25:57,079 --> 00:26:02,570
and they're not practical limit

00:25:58,479 --> 00:26:05,389
there's no red warning so switch back to

00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:07,519
the organisation and the user list and

00:26:05,389 --> 00:26:10,549
we had some comments from the team at

00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:11,869
cloud gov and they basically said that

00:26:10,549 --> 00:26:14,209
one of the problems are when you're

00:26:11,869 --> 00:26:16,489
looking at an organization that the you

00:26:14,209 --> 00:26:17,929
see all of the users regardless of if

00:26:16,489 --> 00:26:19,909
they have any roles in that organization

00:26:17,929 --> 00:26:21,139
so sometimes you don't you don't want to

00:26:19,909 --> 00:26:22,789
be provided with hundreds of people

00:26:21,139 --> 00:26:24,349
that's not relevant so now we have a

00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:27,019
filter that basically says should only

00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:28,249
show me people that that have roles in

00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:29,779
that level so if you're at space level

00:26:28,249 --> 00:26:32,779
you went to see random or people from

00:26:29,779 --> 00:26:34,219
other logs and you can also go back and

00:26:32,779 --> 00:26:36,259
see the ones that would have no roles

00:26:34,219 --> 00:26:39,379
also you can always go and add people

00:26:36,259 --> 00:26:41,400
new people too to the ones you want and

00:26:39,379 --> 00:26:42,780
I think

00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,400
another thing I'm going to show today is

00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:45,780
the ability to invite users and this is

00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,270
another thing that came from the cloud

00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:49,740
cover team so you can click on it if you

00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:52,470
have the right privileges you can click

00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:54,420
on invite and you could enter an email

00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:56,400
and this would still this would send

00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:57,900
basically if I configured via SMTP

00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,640
server correctly this would send an

00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,600
email that would have a link in and then

00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,440
a person could click on that link and

00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,780
set their password

00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,460
I haven't configured my some TP server

00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:08,040
correctly so when I press the button is

00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:11,610
going to create that user and they've

00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:12,930
failed because the the invite failed but

00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:28,890
I'm going to do that now we'll get a

00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:30,690
warning hopefully possibly yeah I've had

00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:32,700
problems my VPN all the time and it can

00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:34,470
it drops so I would have but it was over

00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:37,530
that and pretend that it did actually

00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:40,980
invite someone here's some that I have

00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:42,270
created earlier so what would happen and

00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:44,490
as soon as you've hit that button the

00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:46,500
email would be sent normally be sent and

00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:47,700
importantly for the cloud gov guys you

00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,530
could also you could start managing

00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:51,300
roles for that user before the users as

00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:53,010
is accepted or set password so

00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:54,930
everything's ready as soon as they log

00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:58,910
in the first time so we're just going to

00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:58,910
apply some random random brahms

00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:06,090
and then they should appear in that list

00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:10,410
and that was it for the demo I'll go

00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:11,820
home back to Neal thanks Richard if we

00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:13,620
go back real quick yes we've got a

00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:15,960
couple minutes I think then the next

00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:17,070
person up so just to wrap up right so we

00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,380
want to do that will show you what we've

00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:22,710
been working on the last few months

00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:23,970
while we're going next hopefully you got

00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:25,680
from this the focus really is on

00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:28,200
extensibility so getting that new

00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:31,860
extensions framework in place and then

00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:33,560
starting look at the v3 API support you

00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:36,120
know part the reason we come to these

00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:39,600
these summits and do these presentations

00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:42,210
really we we need your help right so if

00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:44,010
you use Stratos please let us know if

00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:45,990
you don't please let us know why not or

00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:48,780
if that's something you might want to do

00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:51,660
if you have suggestions for improvements

00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:53,700
then hit is up in the slack channel or

00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:55,350
submit issues that'd be great

00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:57,030
we're going to be launching

00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:58,320
another Stratis Community Survey we do

00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:59,760
these every year so there be one coming

00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:02,160
out maybe next week or the week after

00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:04,140
please feed that back to us let us know

00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:07,430
how you deploy Stratis how you use it

00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:08,610
that would be very much appreciated

00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:11,370
awesome

00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:12,690
that's the slack let's get up thank you

00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:17,749
very much
