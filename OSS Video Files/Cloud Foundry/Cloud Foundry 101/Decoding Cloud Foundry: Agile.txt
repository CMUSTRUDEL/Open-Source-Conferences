I'm now going to talk about the

00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:04,830
principles with agile some of the

00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07,790
challenges and misconceptions with our

00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:10,500
job and their relevance to Cloud Foundry

00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:12,360
Angela's been around for a good twenty

00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,950
years and it's been popular for at least

00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,500
ten so again it should be another well

00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,270
understood topic the best way to

00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,820
understand agile is to go online and

00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:23,189
read the agile manifesto most companies

00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:26,310
I work with would say that agile or the

00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:28,710
youth some agile methodology a lot of

00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:30,810
companies use inceptions and sprints and

00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:33,210
they run stand-ups and have retros and

00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:35,489
the bold have even moved on to things

00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:39,649
like pairing test-driven design domain

00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:42,230
driven development development however

00:00:39,649 --> 00:00:45,149
often as some Ramsey often talks about

00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:47,640
the most fundamental piece of agile is

00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:50,629
missing and that's frequent delivery of

00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,550
features into the hands of n geezers

00:00:50,629 --> 00:00:55,829
without this vital closed feedback loop

00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:59,250
is very hard to tightly align your

00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:02,399
product to user expectations so how does

00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:03,870
Cloud Foundry help with agile well Cloud

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,729
Foundry it helps you move from agile

00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,650
development we're in development you run

00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:09,390
run run really quickly and then you

00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,880
Gaghan stop when it comes to production

00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:14,189
to agile deployment where you have a

00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:17,390
platform that you can repeatedly deploy

00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:17,390
