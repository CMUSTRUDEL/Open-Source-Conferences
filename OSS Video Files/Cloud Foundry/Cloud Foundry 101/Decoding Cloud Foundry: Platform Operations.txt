I'm going to talk about the principles

00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,920
of platform operations some of the

00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:07,680
challenges and misconceptions and their

00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,809
relevance to Cloud Foundry platform

00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,840
operations is really an extension of the

00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:14,460
DevOps argument since stating the

00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,190
obvious but when it comes to installing

00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:19,199
and running Cloud Foundry itself it

00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,510
doesn't work very well if you lock down

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,820
to these silos of speciality with these

00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:27,060
complex crazy interactions and

00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:29,369
communication flows for example if

00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:32,130
you're establishing a centralized Cloud

00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:34,110
Foundry within your organization you

00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:35,700
need to establish a business capability

00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:38,280
team often known as the platform

00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:41,100
operations team responsible for building

00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:43,829
and running Cloud Foundry you also need

00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,629
a platform champion to passionately

00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:49,190
advocate for the use of a platform

00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:49,190
