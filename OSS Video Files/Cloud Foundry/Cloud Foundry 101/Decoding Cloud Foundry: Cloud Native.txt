I'm going to talk about the principles

00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:04,770
behind cloud native some of the

00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,150
challenges and misconceptions and its

00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:07,919
relevance to Cloud Foundry

00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:10,440
so we've talked about these other IT

00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:11,730
concerns and I would argue you can do

00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,219
all these things and get all this stuff

00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:17,430
right and it doesn't mean you explicitly

00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:19,470
cloud native however I would argue that

00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:21,090
you absolutely have to do each one of

00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:23,340
these things in order to be cloud native

00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:26,430
and that's why understanding the value

00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:29,220
of each term is so important so what

00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:30,929
does it mean to be cloud native I've

00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,120
searched online and tried to look for a

00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:34,710
different decent definition I found this

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,809
definition on Wikipedia which is very

00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,980
app centric and didn't really explain it

00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:40,820
for me so I've come up with my own

00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:43,860
definition cloud native is a term

00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:46,710
describing software designed to run and

00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,329
scale both reliably and predictably on

00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,090
top of potentially unreliable

00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:52,079
cloud-based infrastructure

00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:54,000
this means that cloud native

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,270
applications have been purposefully

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,230
designed to be infrastructure unaware

00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:59,850
meaning they're decoupled from the

00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,239
infrastructure and free to move as

00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,239
