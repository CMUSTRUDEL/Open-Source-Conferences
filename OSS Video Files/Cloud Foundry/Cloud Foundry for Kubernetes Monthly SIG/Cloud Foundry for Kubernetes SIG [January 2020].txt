under demo more for you to do the next

00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:11,840
one appears to be what are we doing next

00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:13,920
now that we should be doing next now

00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,980
don't quite understand another one of

00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,539
your topics what are we not going next

00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,490
now that we should be doing next now

00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:22,830
that actually makes a lot of sense you

00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:24,720
know before going into the actual

00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:27,810
contents I think one of the suggestions

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,779
from last time or maybe like before we

00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:32,219
even start that Chris could you start

00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:34,110
the recording oh you already did

00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:38,070
it's very recording yep and what we can

00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:40,500
edit all the intro chat is is recorded

00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:42,390
too so yeah before going into the actual

00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,420
topic I think one of the suggestions

00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:47,309
from last time was to see if we kind of

00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:50,219
time box discussions a little bit I

00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:52,079
think there was a suggestion to say so

00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:55,079
far we only managed to to cover one

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,780
topic in one of the sessions I I guess

00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:59,699
and III can't really judge because my

00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:03,930
first question would be what is the

00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:06,360
ireenie worse and like based on that but

00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:08,850
maybe we could kind of see how long that

00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:11,760
would actually take timewise - to go

00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:13,470
through the door maybe take any stock

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,729
saying arena first I decide I'm not

00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:24,409
saying it really worth anymore

00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:27,630
it's 2005 universe in the sense of

00:01:24,409 --> 00:01:29,250
initially when we started we nee we kind

00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:32,070
of had to everything in the arena team

00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,299
is no one else was going to do it we had

00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:34,890
to do the failure than we have to do the

00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:37,530
log similar that kind of stuff in the

00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:40,890
networking and that that you know didn't

00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:42,570
seem very scalable long term so we tried

00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:44,430
to stop doing those things you know the

00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:47,310
other teams with more context could

00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:50,340
start doing them and that's that's what

00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:52,890
we've been in the universe but I think

00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:56,960
that the I mean we mean ebert is a thing

00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:59,520
like that that is now a thing i things

00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:02,969
we've got ready what I'm figuring out

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:06,149
how to move and keeps yet we've got the

00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:09,270
networking people etc so I think now

00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:13,350
that we're really talking about is how

00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:17,030
do we get like a cf-19 5 as in

00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:20,520
we get small to bilities native

00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:22,890
containers that are hopefully a puddle

00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:25,470
applied batch F away from adding to

00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:31,980
improve Buster and you have you can see

00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:33,450
it pushing this okay yeah thanks thanks

00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:36,210
for for the explanation

00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:38,250
I was definitely helpful so into in

00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:39,510
terms of this suggestion of like time

00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:42,420
boxing

00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:44,670
maybe I'll just play the timekeeper and

00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:46,470
like remind everybody after half an hour

00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:48,210
that we've spent half of the meeting and

00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:50,430
then we can kind of collectively decide

00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:53,010
if you want to continue on on that topic

00:02:50,430 --> 00:03:00,300
or or just like move over to the next

00:02:53,010 --> 00:03:03,150
one will be my suggestion and unless

00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:05,190
there's other suggestions irena verse or

00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:14,070
Cloud Foundry evolution 5 as we learned

00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:17,130
roadmap jewels back to you so honestly

00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:21,360
this is like several months ago I think

00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:29,040
I added this so they're so the list but

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:30,450
only now it created attention I think I

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,480
think this was someone suggesting this

00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:34,800
I'm not sure who definitely me I mean

00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:38,210
I'm not sure we've actually talked about

00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:40,470
this now to speed out the right people

00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:46,020
we need to decide the topic a bit

00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:48,000
earlier but the thought was that could

00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:50,490
be kind of get like a combined roadmap

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,720
for all the different themes so we would

00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:59,610
have kind of a tiara an overall idea of

00:03:53,720 --> 00:04:01,560
when when when you know we expected the

00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:03,900
warden of all the things integrated when

00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:06,060
we expect such cool thing when we expect

00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:09,360
when each team expects features and

00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:10,680
cetera et cetera I think I mean to be

00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,170
honest a lot of that currently happens

00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,970
inside pivotal the nature of a lot of it

00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:17,609
is that these things or gives you things

00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:20,760
outside it might give you mean garden

00:04:17,609 --> 00:04:24,969
and a couple of others I think it would

00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:27,349
be good to try and open that stuff up

00:04:24,969 --> 00:04:29,810
maybe the other conversation happens

00:04:27,349 --> 00:04:31,969
very tangentially related but here's how

00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:35,120
we can get more of a open source

00:04:31,969 --> 00:04:38,870
ecosystem around some of this selling

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:41,629
stuff how do we open up the roadmap how

00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:44,360
do we open up the pieces that we're

00:04:41,629 --> 00:04:46,879
doing how do we build some kind of

00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:50,050
independent excitement around some of

00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:52,580
these things for being spent and that's

00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:54,770
did their things and people should be

00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:56,689
excited about how do we do that one of

00:04:54,770 --> 00:05:02,229
the things we should be talking about I

00:04:56,689 --> 00:05:02,229
think those would be conversations I

00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:13,610
fully support the idea of having a

00:05:10,849 --> 00:05:16,310
written down roadmap with all of the

00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:18,800
teams declaring their intent and their

00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:20,810
and estimating a timeline on delivery of

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,250
the things they're working on because

00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:24,529
part of the problem we've had at Sousa

00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:27,349
is that we thought we knew what

00:05:24,529 --> 00:05:30,199
everyone's roadmap was we based our own

00:05:27,349 --> 00:05:32,629
product roam ads on those things and now

00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:35,050
it turns out there's like very different

00:05:32,629 --> 00:05:38,060
ideas of how we're gonna do this thing

00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:44,060
as as you might have ascertained from my

00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:45,860
posts and my previous rants our efforts

00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:49,219
on cube CF we thought were going to be

00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:51,830
very central to CF on k's like we

00:05:49,219 --> 00:05:54,699
thought we would get a lot more interest

00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:59,689
from pivots from people in the community

00:05:54,699 --> 00:06:01,879
on that format for basically on quarks

00:05:59,689 --> 00:06:05,089
people have formed opinions on quarks

00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:08,960
which may be valid maybe not totally

00:06:05,089 --> 00:06:13,490
informed that it shouldn't be part of

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:15,800
the CF on K eights efforts we've got to

00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:18,500
come to some agreement on on how much of

00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:21,979
that you're going to use where cube CF

00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:23,509
fits in the efforts that are going on in

00:06:21,979 --> 00:06:25,789
relevant and we have to have that

00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:28,150
discussion here I know there's been some

00:06:25,789 --> 00:06:31,039
informal can discussions with SCI

00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:33,349
between our team has we need to surface

00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:35,060
this issue because it's it's we're gonna

00:06:33,349 --> 00:06:37,610
end up in two different places if we

00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,730
don't figure it out now let me let me

00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:50,400
say some things out

00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:53,340
what it's worth so number one eye is

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:57,390
important have roadmap and the evil and

00:06:53,340 --> 00:07:01,470
an idea of where we're all headed at the

00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:03,540
same time that's you know we know maps

00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:04,770
are gonna change like what we don't want

00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:06,570
to do is write a road map that we don't

00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:10,110
change sometimes and something to give a

00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:12,660
change and that should be okay right

00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:18,210
I don't think that where we mess I do

00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:20,210
simply messed up as a community a lot I

00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:23,400
don't think that the way we messed up

00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:27,690
was changing the road map I think

00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:30,330
sometimes I mean I think I think UCF was

00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:32,220
exactly the right thing to build given

00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:34,470
the assumptions that existed you know

00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:37,380
when we started building it

00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:41,820
those are something's changed and it

00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:43,410
would suck to keep along the line just

00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:45,410
because we had a road map you see what I

00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:49,170
mean

00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:52,830
what we're I think we completely messed

00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:56,340
up is we didn't communicate at the

00:07:52,830 --> 00:08:02,430
community at all about those assumptions

00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:04,800
changing and well if I'm honest I don't

00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:08,820
think UCF is the long-term correct

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:13,470
direction first although I think a lot

00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:16,680
of the pieces will be I think I think

00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:18,690
you'll earn ownership of that stuff even

00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,070
if it's not the correct long-term shape

00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:26,610
if you see what I mean

00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:28,020
I think it is it's a long-running

00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:30,270
problem I think we've had i'm just badly

00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:33,240
now but but just I thought is worth I

00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:37,020
think the main problem we made with

00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:38,729
Diego personally if we used announce who

00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:41,490
said the Diego team is the team that

00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:42,930
creates the noun da de which may be

00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:45,390
slower than you should have been too far

00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:47,570
away as the Diego team should have been

00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:50,880
the scheduling team not to be able to

00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:52,529
when we get attacked to nouns because

00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,620
our team

00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:59,370
with an ounce we make bad decisions and

00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:02,819
I think problem is that the PM CF team

00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:03,899
is seeing the crates qcf and it should

00:09:02,819 --> 00:09:08,550
be the team that figures out how to

00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:12,059
deploy boundary in the native way for

00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:15,899
operators you see what I mean anyway I

00:09:12,059 --> 00:09:18,540
don't disagree and I don't think Vlad or

00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:23,610
any others not I agree I know he doesn't

00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:25,829
anything Jen I can add something like I

00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:28,019
totally agree with choose that yeah it's

00:09:25,829 --> 00:09:30,720
like teams and everything but I think

00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:33,629
that those wand roles it is missing

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:36,300
that was a Diego transition that Samba

00:09:33,629 --> 00:09:39,120
needs to look overall program and talked

00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:41,220
to some teams we can say oh yeah please

00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,920
teams communicate with each other there

00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:46,949
should be I know some program manager

00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,660
product manager someone who will go and

00:09:46,949 --> 00:09:51,269
pincer people from other teams like said

00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:53,459
ok you have dependency on some as a team

00:09:51,269 --> 00:09:55,230
let's do better than just might be

00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:58,019
sometimes mentions I would he trouble

00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:59,790
issues what was a chart I let us get to

00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:03,360
requirements from one product to another

00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:06,240
product earlier then ask p.m. of the

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,100
project to do this because the end of

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,160
the project is always overloaded and

00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:14,730
it's that might be one of the debye idea

00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:16,829
talk because on a rainy site we don't

00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:19,980
have I know I didn't feel the strong

00:10:16,829 --> 00:10:21,930
communication with keep CF course our

00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:25,819
communication about keeps here I'd I

00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:29,339
think it was even less on the copy and

00:10:25,819 --> 00:10:31,139
relevance I'd like it started but it's

00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:34,199
going on p.m. level should be on some

00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:38,009
higher level and that what prevents it

00:10:34,199 --> 00:10:40,800
from doing some product I know that on

00:10:38,009 --> 00:10:42,480
pivotal site or be aware site that

00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,699
definitely sound like people who product

00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,370
Eisen and they know what's happening but

00:10:44,699 --> 00:10:50,339
they working more on

00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:54,779
closest spot and notes is that much an

00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:57,179
open source part with all people right

00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:59,519
now that's right exactly where I I feel

00:10:57,179 --> 00:11:01,290
the cell down there was project

00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,370
management there was or program

00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:04,079
management whatever you want to call the

00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:06,380
overarching management that happened

00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:08,570
within pivotal and we didn't we don't we

00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:10,040
it'll doughnut have a clarity on where

00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:12,590
those efforts are headed

00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:18,610
so I hereby nominate daniel Jones to be

00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:18,610
the PM for CF on communities second in

00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:31,090
attention also Mike you need to snap me

00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:31,090
in - if it's Pedro then yeah sure

00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:38,120
so we're we are far enough down a path

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,550
that we are gonna continue working with

00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:43,370
cube CF again not married to the repo

00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:46,490
name but we've done this work on the

00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:50,690
operator we we got consensus from SAV

00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:54,350
and IBM and Sousa early on that this end

00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:56,210
and validated that against the Cloud

00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:57,740
Foundry community that this is a

00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:59,990
direction that we want to go and we're

00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:03,230
going to develop these technology and so

00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:06,890
we have something that works with the CF

00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:10,700
operator it works it's passing cats with

00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:13,340
cube CF the missing component I think is

00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:17,600
that cube CF is not yet an upstream

00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:23,470
artifact we plan to rectify that very

00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:26,270
soon at that point what I would like is

00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:28,310
at least an effort from this group to

00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:31,370
understand what the work that's been

00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:33,380
done and how it works and I need very

00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:36,170
specific technical objections to

00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:38,390
problems I need to because we've talked

00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:39,680
philosophically about oh well we've

00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,910
changed their idea of how this should be

00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,910
maybe we should be using a different

00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:46,700
template er I need to know what's wrong

00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:48,500
with what we did before we change off it

00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:50,390
and start on a new thing because and

00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:52,520
here's my it's not some emotional

00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:54,080
investment with cube CF because I have a

00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:56,060
little bit of that but I think I can see

00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:58,190
that what I'm worried about is a

00:12:56,060 --> 00:13:01,070
timeline I'm worried about having a

00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:03,400
deliverable and having a path towards a

00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:08,780
deliverable that it doesn't prevent

00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:10,940
working releases now so I think we have

00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:14,270
a path and you know Vlad and Jeff leave

00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:17,300
please please chime in I think we have a

00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:20,060
path right now that allows us to take

00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:24,760
away chunks of not only cube CF

00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:28,100
but especially CF operator as it becomes

00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:31,220
possible to do that to where as we

00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:33,560
replace Bosch components with kubernetes

00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:36,350
native components we can get rid of

00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:38,240
things that are are specifically for

00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:41,030
managing certain aspects of quash

00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:43,970
releases so I think we have a path from

00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:45,170
where we are right now mostly the Susan

00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:48,950
team but those people who are involved

00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:50,840
in cube CF and CF operator to get us to

00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:54,110
where we need to be in six months time

00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:58,070
in a year's time and that was one of the

00:13:54,110 --> 00:14:00,410
reasons we took s CF and started to to

00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:02,000
change it do instead of starting from

00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:05,480
scratch we took what we had done already

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,360
and figured out a path to get to a truly

00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:11,480
more cube idiomatic way of producing

00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:13,370
cloud foundry on kubernetes I don't

00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:15,410
think that it's broadly understood that

00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:17,030
that's our intention or I mean I know

00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:18,650
I've said that but I don't think we've

00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:22,220
gotten into the technical details of how

00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:26,540
we get there from here basically how we

00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:28,070
meet the component teams when they are

00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:31,070
ready to release cube native and cube

00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:33,350
idiomatic components and we have that

00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:34,940
discussion here or should we plan a

00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:42,890
document or like how should that

00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:44,660
discussion go I think all of the above

00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:46,450
of it I think you should have a document

00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:48,830
I don't think that prevents is

00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:54,080
discussing it here and that's another

00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:56,300
things you should be stuff I think as a

00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:57,470
shared artifact for more detailed

00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:59,060
discussion would likely be more

00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:02,750
productive I mean this is a nice

00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:05,210
informal channel but it's it's hard to

00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:09,500
have a lot of this activity translate in

00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:11,900
concrete plans I think I think loves and

00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:14,930
happy I mean I think would be good I

00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:19,250
think I think I'd really like to get a

00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:25,970
document that one said where'd we want

00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:28,340
to end up and to said I'm not sure I

00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:31,520
won't Duncan which is like YPG has done

00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:33,800
I I understand what's really saying but

00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:36,230
I think what we want to say is

00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:38,600
is where we want to end up and here is

00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:41,060
how we plan to get there and then we can

00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:47,839
all discuss yeah positively how we do

00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:50,630
that and except again yes there is a

00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:53,450
case against PDF I think it might well

00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:56,810
be many parts of the answer but how we

00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:58,640
get there I just don't want to start by

00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:59,990
saying here with the pieces why

00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,850
shouldn't we use them I want to start by

00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:03,829
saying what's the goal including the

00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:10,820
goal and then figure out how against the

00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:13,550
goal and I want to read again that we

00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:16,810
need some like responsible your son who

00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:20,060
will go and talk to all other teams and

00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:21,980
I'm not sure that from VMware Site we

00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:24,320
can provide this be us and you too I

00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:26,149
caused a noise we have little bit less

00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,519
people so I don't think we have 3 p.m.

00:16:26,149 --> 00:16:31,640
right now so maybe it's some other

00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:34,519
company should get this person who will

00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:38,029
go by Kazakh teams might be go like say

00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:39,890
ok let's dark all our stories connected

00:16:38,029 --> 00:16:42,760
to this is this dark so I can check is

00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:44,779
to all trackers let's say all I do some

00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:49,070
organizational things to all these

00:16:44,779 --> 00:16:51,620
things yeah no I I joke a semi jokingly

00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:54,260
suggested Daniel but Berendt has

00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:56,990
actually been the quarterback for the

00:16:54,260 --> 00:17:01,250
early phases of these discussions and I

00:16:56,990 --> 00:17:05,270
just wonder if that's too much low

00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:08,750
workload to throw at at you parent or if

00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:10,939
there's interest there in in project

00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:13,579
managing the larger thing or or what

00:17:10,939 --> 00:17:15,919
that would mean well I think it's

00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:18,110
actually the formal part too too much

00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:20,360
workload apart from my day job I think

00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:23,449
at least smart ball that knows how the

00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:26,540
rest of my day looks like so it's the

00:17:23,449 --> 00:17:28,280
same with me I think I think there's

00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:31,100
also something of a different skill set

00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:34,059
there I mean we have I think what Alex

00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:36,050
is referring to is how we had a lot of

00:17:34,059 --> 00:17:41,870
what we call technical program

00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:45,800
management investment on things like CFC

00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:47,570
are and Kubo as well as being

00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:51,710
coordinated on the pivotal side

00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:53,360
VMware side with PKS and so I think

00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:55,940
there's a possibility that we might be

00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:58,340
able to allocate on the VMware side some

00:17:55,940 --> 00:18:00,679
of the folks that work in that technical

00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:02,750
program management practice to help

00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:04,190
coordinate some of this effort but I

00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:07,580
also don't control those allocations so

00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:10,820
I can't make any promises who would we

00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:17,750
need to engage do we need to talk to mom

00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:19,940
I yeah it's just going to say that

00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:24,440
that's something that we can can

00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:28,039
advocate for ultimately this will go up

00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:29,659
to T'Pol Ozone who sits on the board and

00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:33,889
is very supportive of this being

00:18:29,659 --> 00:18:36,350
successful and it's it's still early in

00:18:33,889 --> 00:18:39,440
the year as far as us having been

00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:42,860
acquired by VMware and making these

00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:49,700
sorts of requests but that's something

00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:52,370
that I can talk with Paul about no I

00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:54,370
know but I think we need to talk to Paul

00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:58,519
like we need to have a direct

00:18:54,370 --> 00:19:01,399
conversation with board members and

00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:05,179
stuff maybe involved if he's on the

00:19:01,399 --> 00:19:07,429
board maybe Thomas could could be the

00:19:05,179 --> 00:19:09,139
liaison because you understand our

00:19:07,429 --> 00:19:11,840
concern right we built something based

00:19:09,139 --> 00:19:13,549
on assumptions we had about how this

00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:17,840
project would go these assumptions have

00:19:13,549 --> 00:19:19,309
changed we're looking at a lot of a lot

00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:22,700
of engineering investment that has gone

00:19:19,309 --> 00:19:26,389
in on our side and and it's basically

00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:28,039
going to be ignored unless unless we can

00:19:26,389 --> 00:19:30,379
find a way to integrate it unless we can

00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:32,899
find a way for for this work to be

00:19:30,379 --> 00:19:34,940
useful to the pivots that are working on

00:19:32,899 --> 00:19:38,629
the court on the on the component teams

00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:42,409
this the the work will just be left and

00:19:38,629 --> 00:19:44,710
it'll be a weird side project I can't

00:19:42,409 --> 00:19:48,070
have that

00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:49,629
well I mean I don't let me just say some

00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:52,960
things firstly I don't think that's

00:19:49,629 --> 00:19:55,029
really like I mean I think we're gonna

00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,289
try and reuse like in all cases we're

00:19:55,029 --> 00:19:59,139
gonna try and reuse as many of the

00:19:56,289 --> 00:20:00,549
pieces as we can whatever happens like I

00:19:59,139 --> 00:20:06,039
don't think it's like let's throw all

00:20:00,549 --> 00:20:06,940
the way thing but also should always be

00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:09,940
throwing things away

00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:11,409
we're like this whole project let's just

00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:13,720
like say out loud like this whole

00:20:11,409 --> 00:20:15,549
project it's much more difficult than it

00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:18,460
should be because we held on to Diego

00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:21,700
for n months longer than we should be

00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:24,700
and we can disagree about how what the

00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:30,519
magnitude of n was right it wasn't zero

00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:32,470
right and culturally what we should

00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:33,820
never do is feel we spent a lot of

00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:35,379
engineering F on that therefore we

00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:37,840
should continue spending engineering F

00:20:35,379 --> 00:20:39,159
on that if there was ever a project

00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,830
where we shouldn't do that it's this one

00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:43,869
no no and and I think that's why we're

00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:48,159
like at least pleasant it's why I'm a

00:20:43,869 --> 00:20:49,779
little kind of like them more kind of

00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:53,649
nervous about this kind of thing because

00:20:49,779 --> 00:20:56,470
I think if we hold on to some of the

00:20:53,649 --> 00:20:57,789
kind of things like boxing cetera it

00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:59,999
does stand in the way of building a

00:20:57,789 --> 00:20:59,999
thing

00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:07,929
TL TL DR I'd much rather waste the

00:21:05,379 --> 00:21:14,769
effort of cube C F and maybe FF of the

00:21:07,929 --> 00:21:17,440
whole thing yeah I mean I'm sort of get

00:21:14,769 --> 00:21:20,320
that I don't think it's necessary waste

00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,970
any of that effort right that's why I

00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,409
started with that I don't think y'all

00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:25,240
talking about wasting that effort right

00:21:23,409 --> 00:21:27,159
I actually think you should sound with

00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:28,929
as much as we can which is we use as

00:21:27,159 --> 00:21:31,419
much as we can and the ways to do that

00:21:28,929 --> 00:21:34,450
is the star by saying here's what we

00:21:31,419 --> 00:21:36,850
want to get to right and then knowing

00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:38,230
that we want to get to not from

00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:39,249
releasing to like what we have because

00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:41,559
what should it look like

00:21:39,249 --> 00:21:43,299
what we're building and then figure out

00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:45,220
where the pizzas can come from to build

00:21:43,299 --> 00:21:47,499
that in the most expedient way possible

00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:49,450
that's what we should do and then maybe

00:21:47,499 --> 00:21:51,490
use as much as you can well I don't want

00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:53,320
to start with is let's reuse as much of

00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:54,399
this thing as possible because it exists

00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:56,559
so we don't want to throw that away

00:21:54,399 --> 00:21:58,509
because I just think like we have to

00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:00,579
that can't be the right I

00:21:58,509 --> 00:22:02,079
want I want to take issue I mean cuz I

00:22:00,579 --> 00:22:03,279
you're preaching to the choir in one way

00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:05,199
and I don't think you understand that

00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:07,029
you're preaching to the choir and I want

00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:09,070
to take issue with what Shannon has said

00:22:07,029 --> 00:22:12,609
that I don't we don't understand sunk

00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:16,449
cost fallacy some of our team has thrown

00:22:12,609 --> 00:22:21,399
out an entire Cloud Foundry distribution

00:22:16,449 --> 00:22:23,619
three times I'm on this and it's getting

00:22:21,399 --> 00:22:26,349
to be a little tyrant like we have

00:22:23,619 --> 00:22:30,249
thrown out so much code that has not

00:22:26,349 --> 00:22:32,679
made it upstream but I'm really really

00:22:30,249 --> 00:22:35,349
loath to do that again so that's why I'm

00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:37,389
trying to find a path where we can and I

00:22:35,349 --> 00:22:39,279
don't mind getting rid of the stuff I

00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:41,019
just don't I mind getting rid of the

00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:42,909
stuff before anyone's tried it or anyone

00:22:41,019 --> 00:22:45,190
who used it or anyone's really realized

00:22:42,909 --> 00:22:47,769
that it works that's what I'm getting at

00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:50,949
here so it's like eat your vegetables

00:22:47,769 --> 00:22:54,669
just try it you know just just try it

00:22:50,949 --> 00:22:57,369
and if you don't like the taste of it at

00:22:54,669 --> 00:22:59,529
least tell us what taste is wrong and

00:22:57,369 --> 00:23:01,659
see maybe why we put those spices in

00:22:59,529 --> 00:23:03,339
like there is there are reasons for all

00:23:01,659 --> 00:23:04,719
of the weirdness that you might see and

00:23:03,339 --> 00:23:06,699
see if operator and I'm I'm projecting

00:23:04,719 --> 00:23:10,149
maybe nobody thinks see if operators

00:23:06,699 --> 00:23:13,599
weird but I suspect some people do then

00:23:10,149 --> 00:23:15,099
find it overly complex I want to know

00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:16,869
what the parts are that are particularly

00:23:15,099 --> 00:23:18,519
objection well we never we've gotten

00:23:16,869 --> 00:23:20,769
into a lot of philosophical discussions

00:23:18,519 --> 00:23:23,529
here I need it's us to get a little bit

00:23:20,769 --> 00:23:26,289
more pragmatic about and we're pretty

00:23:23,529 --> 00:23:29,709
open to criticism so I think I would

00:23:26,289 --> 00:23:33,069
like to get a proposal together on what

00:23:29,709 --> 00:23:36,339
exactly what we're arguing should be

00:23:33,069 --> 00:23:37,869
reused or should be used and then start

00:23:36,339 --> 00:23:39,639
talking about the things that we don't

00:23:37,869 --> 00:23:43,169
want and that the component teams don't

00:23:39,639 --> 00:23:46,149
want to consume don't want to be mean I

00:23:43,169 --> 00:23:48,459
think like the see if operator is kind

00:23:46,149 --> 00:23:50,159
of a wash director replacement although

00:23:48,459 --> 00:23:53,649
it can delegate most of the work to

00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:57,609
communities I think it naturally doesn't

00:23:53,649 --> 00:24:02,139
provide that many assets if you decide

00:23:57,609 --> 00:24:05,919
to leave wash behind right even things

00:24:02,139 --> 00:24:08,559
like what was billed around stateful

00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:10,380
sets it's like most of the CF components

00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:15,179
shouldn't be stateful sets

00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:17,820
yeah yeah there are just naturally not

00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:20,400
that many acids that you can like rescue

00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:23,240
over into a world that has abandoned

00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:26,220
right I really want to say this right

00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:27,450
I'll feel bad if you get anything

00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:30,630
without saying this I want to say this

00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:34,230
out loud there is not a criticism in my

00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:36,179
head about boobs yet it is exactly what

00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:38,340
you would build if you start from the

00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:39,840
correct assumptions that were the

00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:41,880
correct assumptions when we started

00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,400
building it that's right I don't have

00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:48,450
quit I just think the assumptions behind

00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:50,280
it specifically but it's that we can't

00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:53,970
move the things directly off watch to

00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:56,850
something natives are now me right like

00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:59,159
most of the things should be deployments

00:24:56,850 --> 00:25:01,980
and say four sets and config maps and

00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:04,620
I'm not even sure we just have ytt to be

00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:06,450
doing templating I actually think we

00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:07,980
should probably have an operator but I

00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:10,890
think the operator should start from

00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:13,620
that simple thing and be a non required

00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:15,330
thing on top of it I don't think yeah

00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:17,580
like I don't think operates with the

00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:20,130
priming way it's not promoting teenagers

00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:22,980
not parents on the sto or anyway we were

00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:24,809
tell me any other piece of there are

00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:28,260
operators for those things and we should

00:25:24,809 --> 00:25:30,780
have an operator and in my opinion the

00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:32,100
coop CF team are by far the most

00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:35,970
qualified team which we like that

00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:40,080
operator there's many of the pieces from

00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:45,390
on cube CF but nobody on any team could

00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:49,230
be right 18 Bosch manifests in 2024

00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:50,700
Venezia and no baby on any team it

00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:52,320
should need the operate that different

00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:56,120
to deploy that component but those are

00:25:52,320 --> 00:26:01,740
my maintenance for what it's just a

00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:05,520
timeline issue because Troy and Simon

00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:09,780
from IBM they need a see if their runs

00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:13,250
on cube now and everyone else doesn't I

00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:15,870
think that's the only that's the only

00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:16,559
difference of opinion in what we're

00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:19,500
talking about

00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:21,200
I don't think and well I mean correct me

00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:23,370
if I'm wrong but like

00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,330
so I don't think anyone has a problem is

00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:26,550
saying like the

00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:27,900
like we should use UTF get that stuff

00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:30,000
out there right now it's a thing that

00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:35,010
exists in some interviews I think what

00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:37,500
we're talking about is we should be

00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:40,230
plan on that as a long-term thing or

00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:42,720
should we try and get somewhere else but

00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:46,700
the thing about cube CF is that it's not

00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,700
tied to Bosh it's just a home track

00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:51,150
right now it has a deployment it's a

00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:55,800
deployment manifest in it but that's

00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:57,510
just a llamo file you were placing the

00:26:55,800 --> 00:27:00,330
database now so it's no longer about

00:26:57,510 --> 00:27:03,990
Felice and Irina they're both in

00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:06,390
progress team is working on ireenie and

00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:11,190
we're working on the database and after

00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:14,570
that we move on to something else so I

00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:19,580
mean for what is less the world what I

00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:21,960
see what if this makes it clearer I

00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:24,720
think need to be absolutely single

00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:28,320
people apply of CF and it's some

00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:30,750
deployments and some concrete Maps right

00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:33,690
I also think there should be an operator

00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:36,330
that gives you a Cloud Foundry CRD that

00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:38,580
you can set some variables on any those

00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:40,980
ins installs and upgrades it for you

00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:42,600
and I think that that operator that

00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:47,790
we're talking about could easily evolve

00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:51,710
out the QCF stuff right but I think the

00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:55,320
operator is an optional thing eventually

00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:57,720
that you can use if you wanted and the

00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:58,440
development things would just be before

00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,940
llamó files

00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,380
and and the thing I'm describing you

00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:08,040
haven't invented but just like okay

00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:09,960
maybe just a thought because we

00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:12,120
identified and I think we all agree that

00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:17,280
that the CF operator is really a Bosch

00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:19,880
operator and it's it's in the quirks the

00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:29,340
quirks project is in in the Bosch

00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:30,840
umbrella why don't we call it that a do

00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:33,380
not mean because I think there's also

00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:35,910
interest in because there's this big

00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:38,050
community of releases of Bosch things

00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:44,830
that are now

00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:46,210
Sara Lee CFTR and right now the what we

00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:49,810
currently call CF operator is required

00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:51,760
to properly run cube CF but we we

00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:52,210
intended not to be the case in the

00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,520
future

00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:58,150
we intend a much smaller operator to be

00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:59,950
in the mix that is just providing the

00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:03,970
intelligence that is required to babysit

00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:05,530
a Cloud Foundry yes yes yes yes there

00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:09,880
should be a bus operator which is what

00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:12,010
beeps yes now and also may be using in a

00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:14,260
CFE cfi right okay

00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:16,360
no I mean I think there should be a bus

00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:18,310
operator as in the thing that just

00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:20,440
deploys generic cost manifests and

00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:22,060
that's what we have right now and I

00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:24,040
think some of the hesitation people have

00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:27,220
about that being the generic CF operator

00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:29,140
if we want the last very CF focused

00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:32,080
operator that is actually an operator

00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:37,000
thoughts yet which made well emerge from

00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:40,900
what we already have whatever but needed

00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,820
and you know from a design point of view

00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,930
would be bad enough to buy I think we

00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:45,520
all seems you don't both of them like

00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:51,880
that's my opinion I can easily create a

00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:54,040
CF operator as well as what we have it

00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:57,820
makes some sense to me I'll think back

00:29:54,040 --> 00:30:00,820
with yeah you could I'm sorry glad or

00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:03,610
mario pipe up please if you have an

00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:07,510
opinion on it I mean we choose Cloud

00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:11,470
Foundry more as the community are not so

00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:13,240
much as the software so it's an operator

00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:16,210
for the Cloud Foundry community and not

00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:19,830
so much for fondly the application one

00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:22,240
time sure we could rename to borscht and

00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:25,620
we do have some pieces which are not

00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:28,480
wash on specific which are not really on

00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:31,480
the for now but most of it deals with

00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:34,540
force because as you said the assumption

00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:38,590
was there's a published API there's a

00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:41,440
publish set of a claret of manifests in

00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:43,930
the community and this is false right so

00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:46,750
the decision to drop everything Bosch

00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:49,210
like the build system Monty the manifest

00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:51,640
and everything this display this

00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:54,040
destroys a huge part of the tour chain I

00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:55,960
for everybody especially so for the

00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:59,020
operator which was built to be

00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:01,120
compatible to that tool chain right most

00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:05,440
of it is just translating it and chiku

00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:08,110
Benitez that are the parts which can go

00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:12,340
away in the future once we reach zero

00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:13,840
Bosch which might be like um never maybe

00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:15,550
there will always be a little bit of

00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:18,160
Porsche on the Cloud Foundry application

00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:20,170
run time I have yet to see any efforts

00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,770
in that direction which come close to

00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:22,750
the real thing

00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:25,570
right what what we are used to Noah's

00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:28,020
got foundry application runtime so this

00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:30,400
is all very much in the future for now I

00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:33,730
know we have it running on cabinet us

00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:35,590
now yeah so one of the ways that I've

00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:38,230
been thinking about this is that I mean

00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:41,970
Troy I think you're right you and Susa

00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:45,130
have done a lot of work getting a fairly

00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:47,920
fully featured CF up and running on

00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:49,090
kubernetes based on the Bosch artifacts

00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:51,670
that the community has been publishing

00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:53,260
and you know I know iBM has also

00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:55,870
especially been building on top of that

00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:57,970
for its community or for its

00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:59,440
distributions and it's been interested

00:31:57,970 --> 00:32:03,990
in contributing to that and the

00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:06,610
community as well I think as we've been

00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:08,500
looking at the systems that are getting

00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:10,210
replaced by parts of the kubernetes

00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:12,790
ecosystem whether that's core kubernetes

00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:14,620
itself or things like SEO I mean we're

00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:16,480
seeing a much less complicated system

00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:18,580
sitting on top of those building blocks

00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:20,980
within the community that's why we've

00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:22,570
been much more enthusiastic about kind

00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:24,820
of starting again from scratch just

00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:26,350
saying like what if what if we have a

00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:27,760
smaller set of systems that we control

00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:30,780
and we're integrating those against

00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:33,550
these other things like SEO on top of

00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:35,380
kubernetes and I think to Jules this

00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:37,240
point a lot of those components maybe

00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:38,980
you're right there's some work to do in

00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:41,680
terms of how they get configured or what

00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:45,040
their life cycle is like but they would

00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:47,080
run just fine as deployments with some

00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:48,910
like out of bands job coordinating

00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:51,100
database migrations or something like

00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:55,120
that and so like there's I think there's

00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:56,740
there's a lot of constraints that Bosch

00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:59,350
has imposed that have gone into those

00:32:56,740 --> 00:33:01,480
component operations that are then

00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:02,620
getting reflected in CF operator Bashaw

00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,270
operator because it's starting from

00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:04,450
those artifacts and getting them to try

00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:07,000
to

00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:08,470
work the same way yeah and so I totally

00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,800
recognize that this was designed for a

00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:14,950
fleet of VM and and those those don't

00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:18,640
map properly yep so what I think might

00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:21,700
be most productive is for us to try to

00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:24,760
support cube CF and the community and to

00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:26,890
change it incrementally as those teams

00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:28,180
get more and more cube idiomatic and

00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:29,920
their deployment strategies and

00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:32,980
configuration strategies and that's

00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:36,070
gonna dissolve a fair amount of cube CF

00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:39,820
and CF operator boss operator whatever

00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:42,220
we want to call it away but I think I

00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:43,750
think we'd all be happy if in the long

00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:45,100
term in the next six months or to the

00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:47,590
year we got to remove as much of that

00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:49,930
complexity as possible both from how the

00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:52,450
components are coordinated and operate

00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:56,020
and then how all the system integrates

00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:59,230
together to a cohesive whole and so I

00:33:56,020 --> 00:34:02,020
know there's been some discussion on the

00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:05,020
relevant proposal for integration about

00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:06,490
should this just use cube CF and I think

00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:10,660
it might be more valuable to have that

00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:13,330
as a separate kind of nurturing arena

00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:15,160
for those component teams to try and

00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:18,490
just build this up from scratch again

00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:22,240
and we can then try and like I think

00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:24,580
it'd be productive to share the

00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:26,530
learnings in the community with both

00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:29,080
approaches because we'll learn more

00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:31,150
about the CF operator components and

00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:33,370
there's lower building blocks that might

00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:35,290
be actual pieces of your reducible

00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:40,390
complexity that we have to deal with in

00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:42,010
the system and those could inform how

00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:45,640
much additional complexity has to go

00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:47,470
into that more direct approach and then

00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:48,460
as we're bootstrapping like one of the

00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:49,810
main problems that a lot of the

00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:52,060
component teams have been having as

00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:54,790
they've been trying to work more

00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:58,510
directly with kubernetes packaging and

00:34:54,790 --> 00:35:00,340
deployments is that it's been hard for

00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:02,800
them even to get a minimally complete

00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:04,930
system up and running for integration

00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,890
just so they can iterate fast this is

00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:10,100
something they've been struggling with

00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:12,890
for months and if

00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:15,860
my gut says that doesn't come from cube

00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:18,110
CF immediately like that we can get

00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:19,790
something smaller off the ground with

00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:24,170
these relevant efforts and the proposal

00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:27,740
that psy has shared and as that that

00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:31,790
keeps iterating we can work with the

00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:34,820
cube CF project to incorporate those

00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:39,790
components as they get matured into that

00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:44,330
yeah this was exactly the ideas that I

00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:50,060
talked with psy about exactly the same

00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:52,660
lines I think I think we're in agreement

00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:55,540
yeah I wanted to call that out too that

00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:59,600
that what you just said is extremely

00:35:55,540 --> 00:36:02,060
good to learn that you're basically on

00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:06,590
the same page as as my line of thinking

00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:09,860
I would say that as the component of

00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:13,100
teams are preparing new artifacts for

00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:15,050
the relevant integration tools we could

00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:18,740
simultaneously try them out and swap

00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:22,910
them out in cubes EF like it's it and it

00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:26,000
would probably work if if what is there

00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:29,510
right now to replace Bosch releases with

00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:33,320
helm charts or what we have sort of

00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:35,510
plans to release it with - to replace

00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:39,260
with just straight-up on template would

00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:43,100
you be mo for what it's worth we we've

00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:46,150
done experiments thrown out ireenie part

00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:49,670
of cube CF and replaced it with home

00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:52,940
we've thrown out even like the

00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:56,860
controller stuff and at least got like a

00:36:52,940 --> 00:37:00,200
working CF login with actually the copy

00:36:56,860 --> 00:37:02,960
communities release replacing parts from

00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:05,900
from cube CF and we I think just today

00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:08,300
somebody finish to actually attach CF

00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:11,300
kubernetes networking to a CF operator

00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:14,240
based thing and you could like you had

00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:16,700
both routes but basically we kept the go

00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:19,070
router in because it also does the

00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:23,120
system component routing so that's one

00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:26,540
reason - and we were able to curl

00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:29,390
like via both father so there are some

00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:30,890
experiments going on yeah and likewise

00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:31,850
where we're gonna be doing some of that

00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:34,340
as well

00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:37,330
that's great to hear that you've done it

00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:39,470
independently okay so maybe it's not as

00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:42,620
screaming and emergency as I thought it

00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:44,930
was and it's not there are places where

00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:48,680
the existing projects can touch each

00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:50,960
other and try things out I felt like I

00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:53,720
just needed to vent there so thank you

00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:55,340
for tolerating that in the meeting I

00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:57,740
don't want to derail the conversation

00:37:55,340 --> 00:38:00,740
anymore because I know there was other

00:37:57,740 --> 00:38:03,110
issues that we wanted to talk about yeah

00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:06,950
one other thing that I wanted to say I I

00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:13,430
could potentially see uh longer-lived

00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:18,710
shim roll 4cf operator in a cfar

00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:20,660
distribution depending on whether any of

00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:22,700
these component or subsystem changes

00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:25,010
would end up introducing significant

00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:27,260
behavioral changes so one example might

00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:29,270
be transitioning from go router to you

00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:31,610
sto so Guerrera certainly has some

00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:33,290
features that aren't like we haven't

00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:35,300
figured out how to re-implement an ST or

00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:41,960
that might not make it about services

00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:43,460
maybe being one example and if if you

00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:45,950
want to keep that ingress routing here

00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:47,870
for application workloads maybe it's

00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:50,030
going to be more valuable longer term to

00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:51,020
keep the go router and I don't think

00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:52,970
that there are current plans to

00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:54,500
repackage that frigates distribution

00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:55,940
maybe that would be relatively simple to

00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:59,390
do routing release is not terribly

00:38:55,940 --> 00:39:02,360
complex but I could see to the extent

00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:05,240
that there's that variability or desire

00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:08,270
to maintain a certain amount of

00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:09,920
continuity with existing behavior from

00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:14,870
the Bosch package components that

00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:18,050
potentially being valuable like I think

00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:20,570
additionally we also have Daniel's

00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:23,360
question in the chat which might tie in

00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:25,520
nicely at this point like how confident

00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:28,250
are we given all the timelines that era

00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:30,580
goals I mentioned that this is really a

00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:30,580
thing

00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:44,150
all right bye Eric okay hey I don't know

00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:46,700
Eric is closest to working with many of

00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:48,530
the teams and fewer so we're doing the

00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:50,809
kids native packaging so I don't want to

00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:53,960
speak too much about that but it will

00:39:50,809 --> 00:39:56,059
say like everyone's working on this this

00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:58,250
is kind of their each each of the

00:39:56,059 --> 00:40:02,000
project teams I think this is their

00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:05,450
highest priority to figure this out so I

00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:11,619
I have high confidence that we'll do

00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:14,690
this have-have have something here like

00:40:11,619 --> 00:40:17,000
in the next month or two to to show and

00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:19,099
then maybe by mid year it'll be more

00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:22,760
robust but like that's that's all very

00:40:19,099 --> 00:40:24,740
variable rate as Eric was describing

00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:29,059
like it's not going to have full

00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:30,940
functionality natively because things

00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:35,930
like route services things like

00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:42,410
container to container networking etc so

00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:44,359
hey I think for that web app 12 factor

00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:47,720
where that we can tell a pretty

00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:52,369
convincing story hopefully in the next

00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:55,940
couple of months and more robustly by

00:40:52,369 --> 00:40:59,119
mid-year I think that's our hope and

00:40:55,940 --> 00:41:00,500
this allows us to take a take a slightly

00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:04,400
different approach where we evaluate

00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:07,609
each component for its ability to pass

00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:10,490
the tests its feature parity with the

00:41:07,609 --> 00:41:13,400
Bosch component and then we decide to

00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:15,619
call something production ready when our

00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:17,119
QA says its production ready it's on a

00:41:15,619 --> 00:41:20,030
component by component basis which is

00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:22,069
why we're going down this path to that

00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:23,150
end I don't know whether we should segue

00:41:22,069 --> 00:41:26,270
to talk about ireenie

00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:29,390
feature parity with diego from a

00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:30,740
performance perspective that was another

00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:33,250
thing i was going to throw out as a

00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:35,960
possible thing for the agenda but i

00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:38,510
don't know that's an hour conversation i

00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:44,510
think just just very quickly before we

00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:49,140
move on i did wonder as a suggestion

00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:52,860
if you say if if there might be someone

00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:57,530
you might be willing to add to the

00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:59,850
release integration team as one way of

00:41:57,530 --> 00:42:01,770
making sure you're always in the loop on

00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:05,250
on what the release integration team is

00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:08,100
doing that's an excellent suggestion

00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:09,620
I'll take that back and and see if we

00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:15,780
can find somebody that's appropriate

00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:20,310
okay I would I would say that that and

00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:23,270
we would also consider putting someone

00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:25,200
forward for for not only release

00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:27,510
integration but also for project

00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:30,690
management or program management if if

00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:32,730
if there was a need for that again I'd

00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:35,750
have to talk about resourcing with you

00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:39,890
know Jeff and people up his team but

00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:43,590
it's it's something we could consider I

00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:46,710
think at least this the program

00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:50,070
management part would add for everybody

00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:53,940
outside of the amber alert politicals

00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:56,400
some amount of confidence on some amount

00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:58,380
of let's say transparency to see what's

00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:03,270
happening because my feeling is right

00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:05,040
now the only people who can really cool

00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:07,110
enough for like well enough understand

00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:10,350
what's going on in the individual teams

00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:12,810
are working with those teams turrent

00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:15,330
right from the outside it's pretty hard

00:43:12,810 --> 00:43:18,510
to get a good understanding even when

00:43:15,330 --> 00:43:21,720
looking into tracker like what's really

00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:23,580
happening which kind of decisions are

00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:25,110
being done in terms of hey this is some

00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:29,070
kind of functionality we are currently

00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:33,780
not targeting or not looking at in order

00:43:29,070 --> 00:43:35,580
to make things easier and so on so yeah

00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:37,710
I'm not sure like what the solution to

00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:41,670
this is but at least that's my feeling

00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:43,740
that we are a bit like on the outside

00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:48,000
and it's terribly hard to to figure out

00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:49,350
what's going and maybe it's this meeting

00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,330
maybe it's a different meeting maybe

00:43:49,350 --> 00:43:55,280
it's a dashboard maybe it's something

00:43:51,330 --> 00:43:55,280
else maybe it's the first I don't know

00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:10,140
or maybe it's just me there would be

00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:18,690
worse candidates I think no no maybe

00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:19,590
it's just me feeling this way it's a

00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:27,330
good point

00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:29,670
I as much as VMware who we as as people

00:44:27,330 --> 00:44:32,270
funded by the VMware and many of the

00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:35,820
project teams contributing to it

00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:37,530
we I can work talk with Paul see if we

00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:44,310
can get funding for a project manager

00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:45,840
but it certainly won't have the that

00:44:44,310 --> 00:44:48,150
person wouldn't have the visibility of

00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:51,210
pain points necessarily as much as

00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:56,420
someone a project manager coming from

00:44:51,210 --> 00:45:00,840
one of the other member companies and so

00:44:56,420 --> 00:45:04,580
if anyone has anyone who might be able

00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:08,130
to do this volunteering Daniel Jones or

00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:12,840
otherwise I think that could be helpful

00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:14,880
nonetheless I will ask for for support

00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:21,780
like at a project management capacity

00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:26,750
but I do think as as we try to generally

00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:26,750
be more transparent with among all of us

00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:33,359
gather I think project management from

00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:38,700
different viewpoints could could be

00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:42,050
really good thank you Detroit do you

00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:44,940
think it's reasonable to have a expected

00:45:42,050 --> 00:45:49,230
timeline for whether or not Sousa can

00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:51,119
help support this you know I could guess

00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:53,190
in a timeline I mean just because the

00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:54,960
longer we everybody's kind of waiting

00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:58,470
saying well that you know clearly this

00:45:54,960 --> 00:46:00,600
is a need we have right the more the

00:45:58,470 --> 00:46:02,250
needs gonna grow yeah now I think I

00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:06,390
think in this meeting we resolved the

00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:09,630
most urgent concerns I had about in the

00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:11,460
place of cube CF and

00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:15,630
how diversion see the work of the

00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:17,850
component teams could get but so we do

00:46:15,630 --> 00:46:21,630
need to find somebody and it doesn't

00:46:17,850 --> 00:46:23,430
have to be from Sousa but I get us point

00:46:21,630 --> 00:46:27,720
that maybe one of the other partner

00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:30,480
companies as well I have to take this

00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:33,630
back I mean this is we do have a couple

00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:36,030
people that might be suitable in terms

00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:40,500
of what their current workload is with

00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:42,450
cloud application platform I'd really

00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:45,860
have to have a chat with Jeff offline

00:46:42,450 --> 00:46:49,290
and then up is chaining up my chain and

00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:51,090
and figure out so I can't tell you right

00:46:49,290 --> 00:46:53,190
now if there would be a time line on an

00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:56,550
answer I will have some kind of answer

00:46:53,190 --> 00:47:00,750
by next week but it might not be a

00:46:56,550 --> 00:47:02,780
definitive answer that sounds fair

00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:02,780
enough

00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:21,470
got nine minutes left what can we do in

00:47:15,869 --> 00:47:24,240
nine minutes and like Marco try to like

00:47:21,470 --> 00:47:26,930
talk about the timeline aspect or bring

00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:30,269
bring up again Daniels questions around

00:47:26,930 --> 00:47:32,339
timelines like and and initially we

00:47:30,269 --> 00:47:35,089
discussed this this document so so is

00:47:32,339 --> 00:47:38,730
that also part of such a document to

00:47:35,089 --> 00:47:40,079
kind of try and document those timeline

00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:42,000
assumptions kind of knowing that

00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:44,250
obviously it's not something that's

00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:47,420
that's carved in stone either but like

00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:54,119
having that timeline do you want things

00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:57,509
I always like to start with some clear

00:47:54,119 --> 00:48:01,440
milestones and then like that that

00:47:57,509 --> 00:48:03,420
people generally understand as what

00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:05,759
those milestones are and then and then

00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:09,269
from there were work through them the

00:48:05,759 --> 00:48:14,279
timelines are general projected hopes

00:48:09,269 --> 00:48:16,710
and dreams and and kind of things so if

00:48:14,279 --> 00:48:18,509
we can somehow collaborate on what are

00:48:16,710 --> 00:48:21,150
some some milestones people are

00:48:18,509 --> 00:48:23,039
interested in or seem reasonable I think

00:48:21,150 --> 00:48:25,980
that would be a good place to start and

00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:39,509
then and then let the lens of timelines

00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:41,789
there on that particular topic so Troy

00:48:39,509 --> 00:48:44,759
is that like starting that document

00:48:41,789 --> 00:48:48,750
something that you would be taking as an

00:48:44,759 --> 00:48:50,730
action item or when I have such a

00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:54,720
document but okay I guess we didn't

00:48:50,730 --> 00:48:56,789
really say how we come to you like not

00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:59,309
actually who's writing it but like

00:48:56,789 --> 00:49:01,109
sometimes it just helps to say here is

00:48:59,309 --> 00:49:05,579
that empty page everybody please

00:49:01,109 --> 00:49:08,609
contribute their thoughts ideas sure

00:49:05,579 --> 00:49:13,519
I'll take that with Jamie you and I

00:49:08,609 --> 00:49:16,970
could start something in Google and

00:49:13,519 --> 00:49:19,950
document is better or some sort of

00:49:16,970 --> 00:49:22,049
spreadsheet what's good I'm not a

00:49:19,950 --> 00:49:25,290
project manager I'm a very poor project

00:49:22,049 --> 00:49:28,350
manager I personally like documents

00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:31,560
just the the commenting is a little more

00:49:28,350 --> 00:49:33,210
understandable spreadsheets I could

00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:36,150
never understand like where was the

00:49:33,210 --> 00:49:39,960
comment what are the open comments it's

00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:42,660
yeah hopefully there's some cool way we

00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:46,200
can make an image that we can update

00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:49,370
based on the dates next to component so

00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:55,410
we want a list of all the components and

00:49:49,370 --> 00:49:57,630
what the what the milestone dates our

00:49:55,410 --> 00:50:00,360
milestones are for for kubernetes native

00:49:57,630 --> 00:50:02,370
implementations of those it imagined so

00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:06,840
I mean some of those will probably be

00:50:02,370 --> 00:50:08,820
none it might be just replace but but

00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:12,360
but yeah some something like that might

00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:14,550
help well you could try it and see if

00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:17,130
that's the right format I know I can

00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:21,060
certainly give the dates for for QC

00:50:17,130 --> 00:50:33,420
essence and see if operator and work

00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:35,640
with glad on that okay that seems like a

00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:38,100
really positive stopping place unless

00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:39,990
there's anything folks when I talk about

00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:48,450
the six minutes we have left

00:50:39,990 --> 00:50:52,040
yep good point it doesn't seem to be the

00:50:48,450 --> 00:50:54,600
case so yes thank you Matt for now and

00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:59,880
we'll talk again in two weeks and

00:50:54,600 --> 00:51:02,010
probably Jules maybe like you you could

00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:04,350
take a look at like the the upcoming

00:51:02,010 --> 00:51:06,480
agenda vote because the likelihood is

00:51:04,350 --> 00:51:10,050
high that somebody wants to see and

00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:14,340
irineu damo at least that was like also

00:51:10,050 --> 00:51:16,170
highly highly voted for yeah I voted for

00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:19,650
that and I would love to see that and

00:51:16,170 --> 00:51:21,750
maybe on annotated ireenie demo just to

00:51:19,650 --> 00:51:25,070
talk about what is happening behind the

00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:29,280
scenes I have a lot of questions about

00:51:25,070 --> 00:51:30,870
the how things happen in ireenie when

00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:36,120
they're happening as compared to how

00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:37,490
they work as a like you know yeah I

00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:39,260
guess the still subject

00:51:37,490 --> 00:51:41,930
to to welding of course but I think

00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:43,760
there will be a time where jewels and of

00:51:41,930 --> 00:51:47,869
praise spontaneously will need to pull

00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:52,100
out and I rhenium also better be

00:51:47,869 --> 00:51:54,860
prepared for that time and I guess with

00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:55,330
that thanks everybody and talk to you in
