you

00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:13,800
alright thanks for now hello and welcome

00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:16,270
everyone to this week's episode of

00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:18,009
special interest group for Cloud Foundry

00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:21,099
for kubernetes thanks everybody for

00:00:18,009 --> 00:00:27,700
making it it's my pleasure - you too

00:00:21,099 --> 00:00:30,480
today - like govern this episode of the

00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:36,489
meeting burnt is I'm not able to join

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:39,280
and we have a winner in terms of topics

00:00:36,489 --> 00:00:44,310
Eric already put it in the notes thank

00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:47,290
you very much for consistency between

00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:50,050
Bosch CF and cuneta CF in terms of

00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:52,090
container to container network there is

00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:59,550
one additional topic that was brought up

00:00:52,090 --> 00:01:02,140
up front I think by Sai and that is we

00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:03,520
initially established the slack channel

00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:07,180
cf4 kate's

00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:11,140
for this specific signaling and by

00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:14,190
coincidence or not there is now a github

00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:20,290
artifact called by the same name and

00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:21,700
that makes people join this lecture hall

00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:25,360
if they want to talk about the artifact

00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:27,729
and I guess we wanted to raise it up for

00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,870
discussion like if that's a good thing

00:01:27,729 --> 00:01:31,180
or a bad thing

00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:33,880
if you want to keep it like this that we

00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:36,940
have maybe zeke related discussions and

00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:38,140
like github artifact created discussions

00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:42,850
in the same channel if that makes sense

00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:45,630
for everyone or if it doesn't yeah how

00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:47,770
does everybody feel about this site

00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:51,070
since you brought it up do you have a

00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:53,950
specific opinion on this actually to

00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:56,350
remind both in one place yeah the

00:01:53,950 --> 00:02:00,970
discussions are all related to sort of

00:01:56,350 --> 00:02:03,270
the same thing so yeah that's this my

00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:03,270
opinion

00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:11,150
and I think my my expected objection is

00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:15,080
that this might lead people to not know

00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:16,850
about cube CF that's sort of what we

00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,350
would generally understand the thing to

00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:20,840
be that we've overloaded the name of

00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:23,870
this channel but it's not a strong

00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:26,270
objection I mean I think we all know who

00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:28,040
each other are and know where the

00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:30,650
projects are so we can direct people who

00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:35,240
might be seeking one or the other I'm

00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:36,770
not not too bothered by it you can kind

00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,400
of you can kind of see it both ways

00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:41,320
Connie

00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:43,640
you can the the danger is that it

00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:48,260
prejudices one over the other

00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:50,090
but the potential upside is actually

00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:52,640
maybe encourages there not to be to

00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:55,700
things and to try and we're all in one

00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:59,090
channel with one exactly rats yeah

00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:02,570
probably good yeah so I'm I don't have a

00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:04,790
problem a serious problem with it I do

00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:08,800
you think I really like the discussions

00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:08,800
in there in the last few days

00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:19,180
I was just going to link a post from

00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:22,270
from Fenton Brian who posted yesterday a

00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:26,500
little bit confused about fissile and

00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:29,620
its status and I tried to clarify but

00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:33,190
his point in the end is yeah it's a

00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:36,940
little difficult to discover from from

00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:41,200
the website like fissile became quirks

00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:43,470
and lives in the CF operator repo and is

00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:49,030
related to cube CF in the certain way

00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:53,440
yeah yeah we yeah yeah I would I would

00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:55,000
like to say that I'm also like like I if

00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:57,310
anyone should know this it should be me

00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:02,650
and I've lost track of what the various

00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:04,450
nouns in that world me now so yeah well

00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:06,700
I had I had a similar conversation in

00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:09,160
the day and I realized that I don't even

00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:12,910
know which is the correct noun noun for

00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:14,560
things now now I think I have an

00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:17,980
understanding of it so I should probably

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:22,920
weigh in on that thread to try and

00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:27,760
define things yeah the quarks project

00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:31,330
has included fissile I mean that it's

00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:33,430
the same team that maintains it but it's

00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:36,430
actually more closely bound to keep CF

00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:38,380
and keep CF won't be living in the Boche

00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:40,750
pmc and that this is the problem right

00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:43,090
because we've as we discussed in the

00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:45,220
last meeting the CF operator is more of

00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:48,610
a Bosch operator which is why it belongs

00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:49,870
in the Bosch at PMC and cube CF belongs

00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:52,480
in run time which is where it's gonna

00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:56,440
hopefully go for incubation soon we've

00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:58,419
done that later maybe if the CF operator

00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:02,140
is in fact the budget operator we might

00:04:58,419 --> 00:05:07,240
want to get ahead of the ball renaming

00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:08,950
some of that I mean I think I'm at the

00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,919
risk of creating even more names which

00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:14,680
is not something I want to do by then

00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:16,600
maybe we need to think this I mean I I

00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,870
nominate Roy but I think maybe we just

00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:21,210
think to think through this

00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:22,530
pick three leaves or you pick the

00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:28,200
minimum amount of names that covers all

00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:30,210
the things and redirect other stuff so

00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:32,910
adducing this inspire I kind of agreed

00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:36,960
this is a problem there's not an obvious

00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:41,250
entry point what one word with this main

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:46,100
word you see what I mean I think also

00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:48,600
late part of sorry story I think part of

00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:50,400
Fenton's post was also that it's very

00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,500
hard to discover it from the Cloud

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,680
Foundry pages yeah like from the

00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:57,120
official website if I'm looking for

00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,120
Cloud Foundry coronaries

00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,880
what is the thing I should look at um

00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:05,280
and I'm not sure who mind can or should

00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:11,040
be taking this but this seems like a

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:14,010
thing we should fix we are working on

00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:15,210
that the web team and I mean the

00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:17,940
marketing team is definitely paying

00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:21,660
attention to how it should be

00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:23,520
I guess made simple - for folks to find

00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:25,080
information especially at that sort I

00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,700
was also going to reach out to you en

00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,440
Baron to see if they would be able to

00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:32,460
summarize all the efforts going on in

00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:34,080
the CF and kubernetes front maybe in a

00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:36,810
block was kind of thing that we can use

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,180
as an anchor to point people to

00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:41,400
different places in the in the website

00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:43,890
because right now there is I mean we

00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:46,260
there are pieces of information in

00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:47,880
different places and for us to have some

00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:50,460
kind of a meaningful story I think you

00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,930
need some kind of anchor I was asking

00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:53,220
chip if he could write it but he

00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:55,470
suggested that someone from the

00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:57,420
community especially someone like Baron

00:06:55,470 --> 00:07:00,530
and URI would be the right post to

00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:05,010
someone I said so I was going to you

00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:08,700
yeah I think you know having someone

00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:11,510
like trails away in his Verity like a

00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:15,330
piece of that wrong I guess I thought eh

00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:18,030
well anyway I have pretty high

00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:20,430
confidence that in this meeting we have

00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:24,540
a we're starting to come to a consensus

00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:26,280
on on how it is and you a and Eric and I

00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:30,030
have had side-channel discussion with

00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:32,669
Jamie Gomez so I think we're on the same

00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:35,610
page but yeah if we could

00:07:32,669 --> 00:07:37,319
start a Google Doc discussion that turns

00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:39,949
into a blog post that will tell people

00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:41,610
where to find things in that from that

00:07:39,949 --> 00:07:44,849
guidance

00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:48,719
Swarna the maybe the quarks content and

00:07:44,849 --> 00:07:51,889
the Irani content could be updated on

00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:55,229
the website to point to the right places

00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:58,469
okay let me do that demo and let me just

00:07:55,229 --> 00:08:03,229
double check that that my understanding

00:07:58,469 --> 00:08:07,110
is the same that we have CF on K it's a

00:08:03,229 --> 00:08:11,279
project maintained by the relevant team

00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:13,830
and it is new and experimental we have a

00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:17,039
cube CF repository that is going to go

00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:19,800
for incubation in the run time pmc which

00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:22,680
is parallel work and hopefully cross

00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:28,110
pollinating we have the quarks work

00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:31,830
which is under the bosch pmc and that is

00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:34,440
the what will be renamed the bosch

00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:38,849
operator figure out the best way to do

00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:41,849
that and then that leaves fissile which

00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:45,360
is an implementation portion of it

00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:48,449
that's how if my that's how cube CF is

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,370
built so that's the part that I need to

00:08:48,449 --> 00:08:51,810
sync with Ladd and see where he feels

00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:54,120
that belongs or what the best way is to

00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:56,820
describe that so that people know that

00:08:54,120 --> 00:09:01,199
it's still part of the part of that

00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:02,399
ecosystem but it's specific job is more

00:09:01,199 --> 00:09:05,160
limited because I quite often hear

00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,959
people talking about fifth aisle as if

00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:10,260
it's Sousa Cloud Foundry like the

00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:11,790
previous version of cube CF and that is

00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:13,890
a misunderstanding of what it is

00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:16,560
actually doing so that part has to be

00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:19,050
clarified as well so one is why don't I

00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:22,949
take that offline with Eric and you a

00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:25,230
and Marco or maybe you and Marco and

00:09:22,949 --> 00:09:27,029
we'll get you what you need

00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:32,399
Swarna will collaborate on a document

00:09:27,029 --> 00:09:36,589
and yeah one of us will post it yeah I

00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:40,500
think sounds Merrick could be and and I

00:09:36,589 --> 00:09:42,600
Marco and burnt it I'll be happy to to

00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:44,120
collaborate and volunteering Marco and

00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,339
burned but yeah

00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:51,350
yeah and that that readout sounds right

00:09:46,339 --> 00:09:55,670
to me try good I wouldn't be slightly

00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:56,600
controversial why not yeah just going

00:09:55,670 --> 00:10:00,709
back to where we started

00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:04,790
siesta Kate's and the channel and the

00:10:00,709 --> 00:10:06,559
overlapping of the channel it feels know

00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:08,870
that the problem isn't so much I mean we

00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:10,639
can explain all these nouns are and the

00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:13,009
document sounds like a good idea but I

00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:14,839
feel like the missing thing is like an

00:10:13,009 --> 00:10:18,649
entry point like what is the entry point

00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:20,769
that gives you CF on Cuba Nettie's and I

00:10:18,649 --> 00:10:23,569
feel like there's a really well named

00:10:20,769 --> 00:10:25,790
entry point which is CF for kubernetes

00:10:23,569 --> 00:10:31,040
and it's kind of a shame that it refers

00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:34,220
to one of them not all of them I feel

00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:36,889
like that repo is kind of the entry

00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:39,889
point and the fact that right now that

00:10:36,889 --> 00:10:41,660
repo is actually I mean what were what

00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:44,870
we have at the moment right is a thing

00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:47,509
called CF for kubernetes which is not in

00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:49,850
fact the entry point to getting CS for

00:10:47,509 --> 00:10:51,980
Cuba nettings it is an experimental

00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:53,899
collection of Bosch releases that

00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:56,660
currently won't even do CF push end to

00:10:53,899 --> 00:10:59,600
end if you see what I mean all right so

00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:01,759
as a user if I go to Cloud Foundry /cs

00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:05,449
for Cuba Nettie's that isn't actually

00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:07,999
the correct entry point right now and I

00:11:05,449 --> 00:11:11,209
kind of feel like it should be a correct

00:11:07,999 --> 00:11:14,600
entry point whether that means that CF

00:11:11,209 --> 00:11:16,850
or kubernetes the current thing should

00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,290
be elsewhere or whether it just means

00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:22,759
that that readme should link to the

00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:25,129
other things as well I don't know but if

00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:28,100
that feels weird to me right now alone

00:11:25,129 --> 00:11:30,050
is like Seattle cubing it like housing

00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:31,879
house how is someone supposed to

00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:36,949
understand that Seattle humanities is

00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:40,759
not actually just the entry point well

00:11:36,949 --> 00:11:43,129
we could in the readme say this is

00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:44,870
experimental work that is currently

00:11:43,129 --> 00:11:46,790
undergoing if you're looking for some CF

00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:52,370
for kubernetes that you can deploy now

00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:54,079
here's cube C F and this is pointing to

00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:56,000
something which will soon be better than

00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:58,060
it is right now in terms of documenting

00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:04,960
how things how to get going

00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:07,660
so we have a CF for cube CF Docs repo

00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:10,920
which is getting closer to completion

00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,920
which would be a

00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:16,579
we have pointers back and forth would

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:20,540
that satisfy that I mean it's still not

00:12:16,579 --> 00:12:23,149
great naming yeah I mean maybe maybe all

00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:25,880
it would honestly take is like if all of

00:12:23,149 --> 00:12:27,259
the various things had a link at the

00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:29,420
front of the readme that link to a

00:12:27,259 --> 00:12:32,329
common doc sites which is like here are

00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:35,420
the dogs for CF on kubernetes and that

00:12:32,329 --> 00:12:37,100
had that document we were discussing it

00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:39,740
maybe that's enough maybe we just like

00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:44,209
maybe maybe all the various places like

00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:46,160
arena repo fits our repo cork sweeper

00:12:44,209 --> 00:12:48,560
all these things should have a link at

00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,089
the start of their readme and that says

00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,750
here are the docs for cloud foundry on

00:12:50,089 --> 00:12:52,970
kubernetes

00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:54,949
right like and and then the rest of

00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:56,720
things for that repo right but for

00:12:54,949 --> 00:12:59,839
people who hit any of these places we

00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:04,190
need to like get them two to one

00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:08,959
consistent said you know cs4 kubernetes

00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:11,149
dot io sort of thing yeah that makes a

00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:16,699
lot of sense like if we can have it a

00:13:11,149 --> 00:13:18,560
consistent blurb that either explains it

00:13:16,699 --> 00:13:22,490
on its own or points to a place that

00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:26,750
explains it that makes a lot of sense so

00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:31,970
like I certainly like Google search like

00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:36,130
ireenie comes up a lot all and and so if

00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:40,430
you stumble across any of these for for

00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:42,519
how to make sense it'll of it all yeah

00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:44,870
Joe I think that's a good point about

00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:50,389
getting more and more of this content

00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:53,870
into the CF Doc's yeah as one other

00:13:50,389 --> 00:13:57,139
entry point to the set of projects that

00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:59,060
we're building that sounds I mean I

00:13:57,139 --> 00:14:02,300
propose that as a plan then like if we

00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:03,470
can get some kind of a dog along the

00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,480
lines of what we talked about and then

00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:08,269
we'll can get all the various reposts

00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:10,040
just linked people to that higher yeah

00:14:08,269 --> 00:14:12,019
that is where it belongs

00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:16,250
actually CF Docs is exactly where it

00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:17,720
belongs yeah but I think for the for the

00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:21,790
very short term cross linking two things

00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:21,790
would also make a lot of sense yeah

00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:40,770
all right cool so I get it for now that

00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:46,170
we have an action item for Troy Huey and

00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:53,400
me and Swarna I guess and Eric yeah and

00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:55,080
ever happen all right that's good it's

00:14:53,400 --> 00:15:01,290
checking sigh did that all make sense to

00:14:55,080 --> 00:15:02,720
you that all good I believe so yeah all

00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:06,540
right cool

00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:11,700
then we have the container to container

00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:13,680
networking um I'm not sure who brought

00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:16,640
this topic up initially because there is

00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:20,850
no handle

00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:22,860
behind the topic on slack if that person

00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:25,170
is here maybe you want to say one two

00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:27,950
sentences about it what made you put

00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:27,950
that up on the agenda

00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:36,580
if not then it wasn't me but I'm curious

00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:37,030
also about what what they're referring

00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:39,460
to

00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:40,600
yeah then I was about to get many people

00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:43,780
who voted for it

00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,980
Eric Guildford oh yeah well I mostly

00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:47,240
wanted to know what aspects of

00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:50,810
consistency they were referring to you

00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:50,810
[Laughter]

00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:57,850
Jules

00:15:55,450 --> 00:16:01,630
I also see your name behind that whole

00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:02,590
thing yes I was just hoping someone had

00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:06,490
solved the problem

00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:07,870
it's I I would enjoy that problem having

00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:14,820
been solved and that would that would

00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:17,560
make many use cases easier so

00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:19,180
unfortunately it's beginning to Sam and

00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:24,070
this is someone to which rather than

00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:25,960
some solution which is sad all right

00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:27,250
before we before we are talking about

00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:32,320
solutions you want to talk about the

00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:38,080
problem first well the problem to me

00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:41,290
ain't right so we are at some point

00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:43,360
going to one to migrate people keep

00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:46,840
people on migration paths from once yes

00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:49,590
to another and obviously there are some

00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:54,790
rather large bosh based CF environments

00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:59,080
and in terms of getting those over to CF

00:16:54,790 --> 00:17:02,670
on coop cs4 Cubitt cetera there's this

00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:07,180
various ways you can try to do it but to

00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:09,100
me they eat the the simplest you just

00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:11,110
run these things side by side right not

00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:14,050
like try sharing databases showing all

00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:16,060
that stuff's just have two of them but

00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:19,990
then you run into the problems of

00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:21,220
networking between the two and that's

00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:23,530
that's why I was going because it

00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:25,360
becomes difficult so if we could easily

00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:28,900
get conscious turnout looking between

00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:31,890
the two it just makes migration and

00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:34,300
staged migration a slow slow migration

00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:36,700
doing something similar to we did what

00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:38,110
we did with das in Diego where you can

00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:39,880
kind of have them bugs running at the

00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:42,370
same time and slowly move apps over

00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:43,160
before you shut things off make sure

00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:45,200
that a lot easier

00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:48,290
then trying to sort of like shut one

00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:50,900
down stall one up it's like way too

00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:52,580
scary to do at scale so Jules you're

00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:56,810
thinking of consistency here meaning

00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:59,960
there's actually effectively a shared

00:17:56,810 --> 00:18:04,160
container network between the Bosch

00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:06,620
based installation with geocells and the

00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:09,530
kids based installation with its workers

00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:10,940
and CNI that's what I was thinking well

00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:15,500
though I mean I guess this stuff becomes

00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:16,520
a bit of a sorry you see whatever you

00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:19,400
want in this topic

00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:22,580
apparently I mean I guess it could also

00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:25,790
mean just like I mean one big missing

00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:28,040
piece from ireenie right now is the

00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:31,070
container networking stuff right that's

00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:32,690
that's one thing that people moving from

00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:34,820
one to another will carry any heavy

00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:37,190
edition experience partly because you

00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:39,020
know kubernetes already has overlays and

00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:40,970
stuff so what is containing that working

00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:43,760
exactly mean in that world it's not

00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:45,530
under simply fear that that is

00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,390
definitely another variable topics I

00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:51,250
would love it if someone had solved and

00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:51,250
would happily what should their more

00:18:55,060 --> 00:19:00,550
yeah I'm not sure

00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:06,460
current vision for the communities

00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:09,100
native networking part is I don't think

00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:11,050
could we have people from the I'm the

00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:13,090
team on the call I don't think I don't I

00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:16,480
don't say anyone from the networking

00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:18,370
team represented but I think Shannon and

00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:23,590
Gabe would be the best equipped to weigh

00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:27,480
in even on issues of feature parity like

00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:29,980
having things like AB security groups or

00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,530
container network policy connectivity

00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:34,390
should be there across the cluster

00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:36,309
except for those those rude ireenie

00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:46,210
network policies that drop in and lock

00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:49,630
everything out and yeah I have a meta

00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:54,730
meta point which is I think maybe we

00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:56,559
should we should have the poll pick the

00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:59,290
topic for the next week rather than the

00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:01,240
current week because otherwise you have

00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:02,620
this situation where you only find out

00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:05,470
what the topic is and whether there's

00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:08,260
any control to it on the week so maybe

00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:11,080
we maybe we say that next week the topic

00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:13,780
will be this and then we find someone

00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:16,450
ideally Gabe or Shannon and you can talk

00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:18,340
to it the next week and then we'll vote

00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:21,130
next week for the next one like whatever

00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:24,490
the votes are next time it's one the

00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:29,730
next week all be I could also try and

00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:29,730
get Nino khodabandeh in as well

00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,390
so potentially have the expectation of

00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:39,920
the pool closing on a staggered schedule

00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:41,300
if we're going to continue to

00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:44,060
coordinator on that just have a close

00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:46,730
week before and or so and then try and

00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:48,590
drum up whoever's going to represent

00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:53,000
that topic or find out that we don't

00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:55,190
have anyone but I think that's that's a

00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,010
good idea for this topic we can also

00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:59,660
figure out you asked that question so

00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:00,410
that we know what they were actually

00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:03,100
referring to

00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:07,510
since consistent has inconsistent

00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:07,510
understanding across all of our minds

00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,600
you

00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:22,980
I honestly can't remember if I raised it

00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:24,870
and then didn't vote for it all right so

00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:27,900
yeah it seems like we already have our

00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:31,800
topic for for the next occurrence in two

00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:35,370
weeks which is networking bit who will

00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:37,260
try to get Gabe and/or Shannon on the

00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:39,630
call

00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:43,980
looking at you some Francisco pivotal

00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:46,909
yeah I can I can trim please at least

00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:46,909
try to get them

00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:57,389
yeah if it's a highly appreciated Eric

00:21:51,240 --> 00:22:01,710
I mean Gabe's in the Portland area so

00:21:57,389 --> 00:22:04,230
it's no physical coercion available to

00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:06,149
apply maybe that's why Shannon's been

00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:08,539
hanging out at home in Oakland for a

00:22:06,149 --> 00:22:08,539
while too

00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:15,059
all right times have changed that

00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:17,490
pivotal VM are already can tell you have

00:22:15,059 --> 00:22:21,600
to apply physical pressure to get people

00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:23,940
into the meetings cool all right

00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:29,779
which other things you want to talk

00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:29,779
about in the next 30 minutes

00:22:31,929 --> 00:22:38,350
can't believe we have a shortage of

00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:41,169
things to talk about Eric we're gonna

00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:45,610
talk about incubation in the run time

00:22:41,169 --> 00:22:50,799
PMC later and our time so just to let

00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:53,169
everyone know that we we thought we were

00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:56,529
gonna skip a step with cube CF and just

00:22:53,169 --> 00:22:58,869
like put it right in the foundation we

00:22:56,529 --> 00:23:02,070
redirected back to the process and the

00:22:58,869 --> 00:23:09,039
process is incubated it's discussed and

00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:11,289
so the document that that glad created

00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:14,619
is been published to CF dev hasn't

00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:17,039
received any feedback so far gonna point

00:23:14,619 --> 00:23:22,299
people to it in the run time pmc call

00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:24,460
get some feedback on that eric has

00:23:22,299 --> 00:23:25,960
graciously said we could move it into

00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:28,149
incubation out-of-band

00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:30,129
as in before the next run time pmc

00:23:28,149 --> 00:23:32,320
meetings so we'll just give people some

00:23:30,129 --> 00:23:34,389
time to take a look at that it will go

00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:37,539
into incubation the reason one of the

00:23:34,389 --> 00:23:39,249
reasons I was pushing so hard for it to

00:23:37,539 --> 00:23:40,240
get in quickly because I'd love to have

00:23:39,249 --> 00:23:42,759
something to talk about

00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,799
suza cons coming up and I'll be there

00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:46,629
and I was wanting to have something

00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:49,049
foundation related to talk about there

00:23:46,629 --> 00:23:51,490
and so we can talk about the incubation

00:23:49,049 --> 00:23:53,799
hopefully if all goes well we could say

00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:55,179
cube CF was accepted for incubation I

00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:58,029
can make a bit of a noise about that

00:23:55,179 --> 00:24:02,100
raise its profile raise the profile of

00:23:58,029 --> 00:24:04,480
CF working on kubernetes a little bit

00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:06,070
helps with my product but it also helps

00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,999
I think with the foundation in the

00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:12,490
community's effort and then hopefully

00:24:08,999 --> 00:24:15,340
we'll see a nod your head if the

00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:16,809
timeline sounds right we if we have it

00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:18,940
in the incubation for a short time we

00:24:16,809 --> 00:24:21,580
may be able to announce if it goes well

00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:26,409
maybe I'm able to announce graduation by

00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:28,480
CFS I'm at Austin question mark not

00:24:26,409 --> 00:24:30,850
vigorous not it but yeah I think that

00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,360
sounds positive plausible yes at least

00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:33,439
plausible

00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:39,719
I'll take plausible

00:24:33,439 --> 00:24:41,219
yeah and I just in terms of just closing

00:24:39,719 --> 00:24:45,629
up the incubation proposal relatively

00:24:41,219 --> 00:24:49,859
quickly I reminded folks in the runtime

00:24:45,629 --> 00:24:53,959
PMC to weigh in on it and let them know

00:24:49,859 --> 00:24:57,119
that I kick off an out-of-band approval

00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:58,919
request later this week so I think on

00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:00,869
the 20th and leave that open for a

00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:02,309
couple of days business days for people

00:25:00,869 --> 00:25:06,469
to comment but that should be resolved

00:25:02,309 --> 00:25:06,469
by really next week that's great

00:25:06,649 --> 00:25:10,469
I've gotten commitment from all the

00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:11,840
people at Sue's I just want to get it

00:25:10,469 --> 00:25:14,419
through before anyone changes their mind

00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:16,889
[Laughter]

00:25:14,419 --> 00:25:23,999
sorry that I piece donated can't do

00:25:16,889 --> 00:25:29,359
anything so yeah that's thank you very

00:25:23,999 --> 00:25:31,799
much Yui and yeah thanks ray

00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:34,589
unfortunately I don't see Jamie Gomes on

00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:37,349
the call I could kick him to haven't

00:25:34,589 --> 00:25:41,549
joined but maybe that could be another

00:25:37,349 --> 00:25:43,049
topic for next meeting and we can have

00:25:41,549 --> 00:25:45,899
maybe a little bit of time to prepare

00:25:43,049 --> 00:25:50,879
for it the idea that was announced was

00:25:45,899 --> 00:25:53,479
at last last meeting for a technical

00:25:50,879 --> 00:25:53,479
program manager

00:25:56,149 --> 00:26:01,529
Jamie's volunteered for that so I'll

00:25:59,429 --> 00:26:06,029
I'll talk to him a little bit more about

00:26:01,529 --> 00:26:08,999
it and and we'll we'll have maybe a

00:26:06,029 --> 00:26:11,219
proposal bye-bye then what's what Sousa

00:26:08,999 --> 00:26:11,899
can offer timelines for coordinating

00:26:11,219 --> 00:26:14,399
these efforts

00:26:11,899 --> 00:26:16,499
Thanks trying this job for this for

00:26:14,399 --> 00:26:18,689
example this job of untangling the

00:26:16,499 --> 00:26:19,649
different nouns and pointing people in

00:26:18,689 --> 00:26:22,199
the right direction and having a

00:26:19,649 --> 00:26:24,089
consistent story great job for it would

00:26:22,199 --> 00:26:26,849
be so great for us all just to be able

00:26:24,089 --> 00:26:29,669
to delegate that to someone and that's

00:26:26,849 --> 00:26:32,729
that's exactly why we need someone in

00:26:29,669 --> 00:26:35,999
that role so we'll make a first step

00:26:32,729 --> 00:26:39,089
ourselves but I'll drag him in and yeah

00:26:35,999 --> 00:26:40,499
make him part of that food one thing I

00:26:39,089 --> 00:26:43,169
was also thinking that could be helpful

00:26:40,499 --> 00:26:45,629
is working with the project leads see

00:26:43,169 --> 00:26:46,470
you broadcast more of their roadmap and

00:26:45,629 --> 00:26:48,930
plan

00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:51,180
at a high level so that if we have

00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:53,880
questions around things like consistency

00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:58,340
of container networking we always have a

00:26:53,880 --> 00:27:01,020
more public resource to point people to

00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:02,810
which brings me to another thing we

00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:06,720
could talk about if there's interest

00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:09,690
alexander has there been much feedback

00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:13,530
on your so you're sort of kubernetes

00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:14,120
style guide kubernetes idiomatic style

00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:18,300
guide

00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:21,840
so there has been some feedback but

00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:25,470
right now I'm just migrated to the to

00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:27,930
the github repo so it's now you know God

00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:32,150
font incubator kind of like owned by a

00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:34,650
drinking but not really because it's

00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:37,800
diverse I don't know if I really will

00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:40,190
own it but yeah I basically copy-paste

00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:43,980
him expanding I did a bit more

00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:45,450
references to the document is it will

00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:47,130
indeed harp which will be open for

00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:51,870
contributions if anyone wants to add

00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:55,380
anything they're welcome I don't think

00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:59,960
I'll add much more on my own I will

00:27:55,380 --> 00:28:04,200
write for Piazza document all right cool

00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:06,150
I think we can also have Sai give us an

00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:08,660
update about the current efforts on

00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:15,570
theirs here for communities artifacts

00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:18,410
thanks Marco so I think primary today as

00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:21,570
of today a primary objective is to

00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:23,370
integrate build packs so we can have a

00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:27,150
full C apush experience so we are

00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:31,050
working actively with Cappy for on Capac

00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:34,380
integration we're also working with the

00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:38,250
logging and metrics team to incorporate

00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:39,720
the logging capability into Steve okay

00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:41,820
so those are those are the two primary

00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:44,760
set of tracks we were working on right

00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:46,110
now we also have our first public

00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:48,360
pipeline don't know what you had a

00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:50,370
chance to take a look at it it runs

00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:56,190
every ten minutes takes about four

00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:58,950
minutes to build deploy and test so so

00:28:56,190 --> 00:29:00,230
that's all let's look up near my future

00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:02,630
milestones

00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:06,530
we would like to fast follow that with

00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:08,480
additionally with building of a full

00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:11,360
integration pipeline with the teams so

00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:15,230
established in the contract between us

00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:19,220
and the contributing teams on how we

00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:20,720
would build the release safe consistent

00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:23,000
components release and how do we ship

00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,960
those so those are those are sort of the

00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:32,330
next set of milestones people intend to

00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:35,660
to work on get a channel Tullio a cease

00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:37,730
who would ask this if you were here what

00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:45,440
are the chances kpac could get donated

00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:51,049
to the foundation believe kpac is in the

00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:56,270
CN CF okay so as part of cloud native

00:29:51,049 --> 00:29:58,429
build packs okay I might be wrong but

00:29:56,270 --> 00:30:02,660
but but generally it's like a pet GT

00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:04,720
licensed and so we're we're just kind of

00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:09,530
pulling that in just like any other

00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:12,200
Apache 2 license project is at least

00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:17,750
github license in pivotal /k PAC

00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:19,460
I see that would that doesn't

00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:22,250
necessarily say it's not on the CN CF I

00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:23,540
guess but I think their roles are

00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:25,880
different like it it wouldn't

00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:27,980
necessarily be in CN CF incubator or

00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:30,320
something like that as long as it's

00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:32,960
under the the cloud native build PACs

00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:35,299
governance as part of CN CF that's fine

00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,860
and we can pull that in it's just if we

00:30:35,299 --> 00:30:40,140
start using that we just need to be sure

00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:43,010
that it's not yeah

00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:49,370
it'd have to follow up I'm not sure okay

00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:51,030
thanks I've one more thing around the

00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:53,460
lock regulator

00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:56,490
artifact integration that as I mentioned

00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:59,370
before I think triggered by one of the

00:30:56,490 --> 00:31:03,420
mergers there I was wondering if we

00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:07,350
could like given that you have a

00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:09,660
pipeline now have in that repository at

00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:11,910
least some indication for which versions

00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:16,980
of kinetise this whole thing is supposed

00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:18,840
to work and for which it is like

00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:22,260
actively tested or something right

00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:26,240
because there was some issues with 116

00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:30,870
because of the removal of deprecated

00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:35,640
kinds and so on so this this would be

00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:37,560
highly appreciated yeah that's it that's

00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:40,710
a great point I think we're gonna the

00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:43,170
documentation will continue to update as

00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:45,270
we learn people have been testing on a

00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:48,030
different industry distros so it seems

00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:50,040
like we should start adding the

00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:54,090
destroyers that we are testing and what

00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:58,080
folks have tested on so another good

00:31:54,090 --> 00:32:00,500
idea might be to activate configuration

00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:04,740
although that will make the test go red

00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:06,450
um but like there's at least one Network

00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:09,510
policy coming from from ireenie

00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:15,300
that that doesn't work and it only shows

00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:17,100
up yeah I noticed that chatter I haven't

00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:22,620
had a chance to take a look at it but I

00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:24,480
will do that today I I guess that my

00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:26,670
team will actually open some PRS to

00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:29,580
things like we I think we have already

00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:32,340
an overlay on CF for kids that removes

00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:36,450
the irony in our policy under the issue

00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:37,170
on irony not sure it removing it's the

00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:46,440
right idea

00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:48,690
I mean I think things should work I'm

00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:51,110
all on board with you should actually be

00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:51,110
out in read

00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:57,250
you probably need to open the right rule

00:32:54,309 --> 00:32:59,620
rather than Tony Jules we just like we

00:32:57,250 --> 00:33:01,899
just made it green for us without all

00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:04,840
the activating network policies probably

00:33:01,899 --> 00:33:06,309
like as I suggested on slack that we

00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:09,850
should probably talk about who is

00:33:06,309 --> 00:33:12,370
actually responsible right for these

00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:15,399
network policies only going to be either

00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:18,700
see if FERC aids as the aggregating

00:33:15,399 --> 00:33:21,370
thing or CF Cades networking as the

00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:27,009
networking thing but I'm not sure let's

00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:29,440
have a discussion on that yeah mine as

00:33:27,009 --> 00:33:33,519
well yeah I think that would make the

00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:47,169
most sense to me aside Gabe also chiming

00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:51,940
in on some of those threads here for

00:33:47,169 --> 00:33:55,529
gates I've been wondering do we have a

00:33:51,940 --> 00:34:00,100
model yet for the kinds of things that

00:33:55,529 --> 00:34:01,539
used to be optional in CF deployment so

00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:03,549
in other words you have to point in how

00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:06,100
to hold bag of ops files that you could

00:34:03,549 --> 00:34:09,550
pick and choose from are we gonna repeat

00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:15,579
that combinatorial explosion or are we

00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:19,089
gonna keep those elsewhere or do we have

00:34:15,579 --> 00:34:23,109
opinions about that my team is starting

00:34:19,089 --> 00:34:25,389
to approach the point where we would be

00:34:23,109 --> 00:34:35,050
contributing some stuff to take an SMD

00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:37,690
volume services working but I really

00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:40,030
support for persistent volumes or am i

00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:42,960
misstating this for something and none

00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:42,960
of my engineers are here

00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:49,569
it isn't currently included in in CF or

00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:54,700
Kate's

00:34:49,569 --> 00:34:56,409
so that needs to be added and then once

00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:57,940
you've added that that's just an

00:34:56,409 --> 00:34:59,470
extension point so you knew the other

00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:02,170
bits that actually turn on a volume

00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:06,260
service so in our case that's like an

00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:09,200
SMB CSI plug-in and service broker

00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:11,060
yeah so all that stuff isn't necessarily

00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:13,760
stuff that everybody wants but some

00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:17,599
people want to and so we used to do that

00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:19,880
without spots and now there's a ytt

00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:22,579
version of an ops file that we could

00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:24,020
just kind of pile on in there but I

00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:27,050
don't know if people wanted to stop and

00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:29,900
think before we start firing that model

00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:32,270
up I mean just look at what we've done

00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:36,380
in in cube CF there because that is

00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:37,310
working as far as I'm aware and you

00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:43,160
might be able to do some of the

00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:45,680
publicity I like to talk about infant do

00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:47,839
a config map if you need config

00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:49,700
don't meet the templates all out at the

00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:54,829
front your config map and then people

00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:56,650
can just change it as I Julien to your

00:35:54,829 --> 00:35:59,630
question we have not yet explored that

00:35:56,650 --> 00:36:03,589
our goal right now the short-term goal

00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:05,359
is to get the K back integration on and

00:36:03,589 --> 00:36:07,640
then nothing fast fall over it sort of

00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:09,500
building opinions on that lessons

00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:11,900
learned from CF deployment what not to

00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:19,700
do well we can carry the good things but

00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:22,970
no not yet you know there yet okay cool

00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:26,210
well we can just we can certainly keep

00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:29,450
our our patches to ourselves for a

00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:34,670
little bit that's that's the same thing

00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:37,220
we did this you have deployment so but

00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:41,260
we'll look forward to however that ends

00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:41,260
up looking Thanks

00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:59,700
worth noting that that Julian did say to

00:36:56,650 --> 00:37:09,570
me that using CFR capes was actually

00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:14,490
pretty easy and fast you're muted

00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:16,890
ah thank you yeah some you know minor

00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:18,570
configuration stumbles around kubernetes

00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:23,250
versions in that but once you get it

00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:26,940
working it's very quick it's very

00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:29,580
refreshing a suicide said it starts up

00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:32,490
in four minutes

00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:36,450
I got it running on kind on my on my

00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:37,550
laptop with some minor tweaks that was

00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:44,280
cool

00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:47,070
including volume services so ya know why

00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:49,980
do you like dogs page like sorry

00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:53,280
currently tree you may not be able to

00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:56,370
installed on kind since maybe the end of

00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:59,370
the last lots of East your stuff came in

00:37:56,370 --> 00:38:04,020
and I don't think we've spent any time

00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:08,310
figuring out how to deal with the size

00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:12,800
of installation in general you know I

00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:15,720
think it it wants five notes on it

00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:18,450
depends on node size in Berea I mean we

00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:20,610
we we only you know a team use decays so

00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:24,600
we just use em twos and five of them as

00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:27,060
a safe sizing but we also haven't leaked

00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:29,520
any kind of you know if we receive

00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:32,580
requests I know if you have a setting

00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:34,050
said like turn off the mesh like which

00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:35,910
avoids all the side cards and stuff

00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:37,620
which is a lot lighter than already

00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:41,329
using it you might look at that it's

00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:44,779
called it's the old lean or something

00:38:41,329 --> 00:38:49,549
one of the you know or longer-term goals

00:38:44,779 --> 00:38:52,039
is to have all of the teams relinquish

00:38:49,549 --> 00:38:54,829
control of TLS themselves and just rely

00:38:52,039 --> 00:38:57,709
on each taeho you know cycling our

00:38:54,829 --> 00:38:59,299
friend that way not no one has to really

00:38:57,709 --> 00:39:01,759
worry about certificates and whatnot and

00:38:59,299 --> 00:39:03,440
know that configuration yeah which

00:39:01,759 --> 00:39:07,130
potentially would work out also delayed

00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:08,719
for local development because you know

00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:10,819
we you don't have to run we still as

00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:12,979
locally let's say right so as long as we

00:39:10,819 --> 00:39:14,630
were able to tease that apart nicely and

00:39:12,979 --> 00:39:19,819
drop all of the certificate management

00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:31,579
out of the components that's a good each

00:39:19,819 --> 00:39:34,160
case yeah I was just gonna say I think

00:39:31,579 --> 00:39:37,069
it would be like I mean if we could get

00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:39,170
like a nice dogs page that shows people

00:39:37,069 --> 00:39:42,979
how to get started on keeping at ease in

00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:46,910
Dhaka on kinds with the CF that would

00:39:42,979 --> 00:39:49,249
just be insanely great big huge like

00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:59,010
stand this up on your laptop just need

00:39:49,249 --> 00:40:01,380
docker that'd be pretty great yeah

00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:04,590
have to make some modifications like for

00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:07,100
example even well before I guess I must

00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:09,600
have got it before things scaled up but

00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:12,030
you know vo has a load balancer on the

00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:14,520
front end and kind doesn't support that

00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:18,030
stuff like that so we would have to

00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:21,260
guess decide that that's a priority to

00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:25,770
make to make that a target but I agree

00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:29,040
just also for developers able to being

00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:31,830
able to just spin stuff up yeah we

00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:34,170
noticed there's a strong desire from

00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:36,420
other component contributing teams as

00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:40,680
well that has been requests to run on

00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:42,780
kind local so that's worth looking into

00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:44,580
in terms of how we can make that work

00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:47,750
so we love to check with these you land

00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:53,460
what car two weeks you made you know

00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:54,870
yeah well I can certainly send those to

00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:59,970
you I think I actually linked him in a

00:40:54,870 --> 00:41:01,470
story but yeah you can see golf lines

00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:07,620
here like you're right here so I can

00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:09,480
just hide your patch files and I think

00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:11,070
the last time around I had to do another

00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:14,910
patch to deal with the kubernetes

00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:17,040
version thing but but yeah definitely

00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:21,780
feel free to come by I would love to see

00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:24,630
that work get folded in Julian which

00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:27,570
Julian are you on flack it so I kind of

00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:29,610
I do yeah I'm sorry I didn't bother

00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:31,710
updating my resume

00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:36,540
I'm the one with unpronounceable last

00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:40,530
name starts with H J I'm Julian HJ on

00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:43,370
slack thanks I feel like I'm getting

00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:47,070
close to being able to pronounce it like

00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:49,800
Julian yard sir that's close enough

00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:53,640
close i don't pronounce it right either

00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:56,930
so it's danish it sounds like you're

00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:56,930
joking if you pronounce it right

00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:04,079
[Music]

00:42:12,229 --> 00:42:17,210
all right anybody having additional

00:42:15,749 --> 00:42:19,289
topics they want to talk about

00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:27,180
vertically more people are dropping off

00:42:19,289 --> 00:42:35,910
by psy I could bug jewels for about a

00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:40,229
weird bug by everyone when you deploy

00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:43,049
docker images jewels it's expecting the

00:42:40,229 --> 00:42:48,299
exposed port to be 8080 yes I have a

00:42:43,049 --> 00:42:50,970
story yeah okay thanks I will just check

00:42:48,299 --> 00:42:54,720
them aligned and then point out I think

00:42:50,970 --> 00:42:56,640
it's pretty high oh oh good good good

00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:58,229
last I think when we first spotted this

00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:00,299
it was in the icebox so we just wanted

00:42:58,229 --> 00:43:03,239
to I'd wanted to know how important that

00:43:00,299 --> 00:43:10,829
was to you I'm glad it is in the air

00:43:03,239 --> 00:43:17,670
good good thanks that was easy I'm glad

00:43:10,829 --> 00:43:20,039
I stayed and so are we all right if

00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:23,579
there are no additional topics for today

00:43:20,039 --> 00:43:27,509
I guess we are done everybody enjoyed

00:43:23,579 --> 00:43:31,700
their ten minutes and talk to young

00:43:27,509 --> 00:43:31,700
