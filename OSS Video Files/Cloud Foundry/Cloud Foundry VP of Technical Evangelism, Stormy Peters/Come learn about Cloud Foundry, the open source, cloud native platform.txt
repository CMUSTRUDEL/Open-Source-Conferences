Description: 
	Talk by Stormy Peters

 Cloud Foundry is an open source platform to deploy, monitor, recover, scale and update your apps. Come learn about Cloud Foundry,  about how it’s developed and see a demo. As an open source software project, it’s developed in the open, by organizations (including SAP, Pivotal, HP, GE, IBM and many others) using methods like pair programming and dojos.

so cut saw start Cloud Foundry is a

00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:07,230
application framework and so you develop

00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:08,790
your application and whatever your

00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,710
favorite application development

00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:13,110
platform is and then you use cloud

00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:15,210
foundry to you do see if push you push

00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:17,430
it out you deploy it you can monitor it

00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:19,800
you can manage it you can scale it I'm

00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:21,720
you can restart it you can kill it so

00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,430
it's the it's the framework that lets

00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,080
you deploy your application then manage

00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:27,840
it so the application developer doesn't

00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:30,060
have to worry about the runtime part and

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,529
so to start out with white cloud foundry

00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,510
actually wanted to start out with my

00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:36,899
personal story about why I'm on cloud

00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:38,489
foundry and so I started out in open

00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:40,290
source software because I think we can

00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:42,809
create much better things in the world

00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:44,219
if we all collaborate together so linger

00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:46,020
than college we'd sit there we'd have a

00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:48,210
hundred people in the classroom and we

00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,010
all go write the same spell checker it

00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,180
helps like this is really silly like why

00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:52,260
am I writing spell checker and the guy

00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,460
next to me is writing a spell check and

00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,739
the guy next to him is writing a spell

00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,719
checker I'm so to me the idea of open

00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:59,699
source where we can all collaborate and

00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:01,579
build on each other's ideas and make

00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:03,960
things even bigger was was super

00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:06,510
appealing and that's why I went into it

00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,189
and many of you may know my real first

00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:09,540
start in open source software was with

00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:13,409
kinome how many people are familiar with

00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:14,670
genome there I'm awesome and in Arbor

00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:16,770
was to have a free and open source

00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:18,360
software desktop and at one point I was

00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:19,560
executive director of genome and I said

00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,930
we have a free and open source software

00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,119
desktop and I started talking about the

00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:26,040
fact that the web wasn't open and like

00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:27,900
we were storing all of our data in these

00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,490
data stores that we didn't have they

00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,049
weren't open formats you couldn't easily

00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:33,390
pull your stuff out you couldn't move

00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:35,610
them from one photo management tool

00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:38,310
together photo management tool and so I

00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:40,020
ended up at Mozilla and that Mozilla we

00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,790
were working on making sure that the web

00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,680
was open for everybody and that there

00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:46,290
are open formats and open standards and

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,939
this is a group in Libya they get the

00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:50,100
country right and they're working on

00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:51,570
Firefox OS phones because a lot of the

00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:54,990
phones that are going into developing

00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:57,270
countries aren't open they're open so

00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:58,920
they're channeling the web like through

00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:00,899
Facebook or through another platform and

00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,310
so we're working on making sure that the

00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:04,320
next generation of the next billion

00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:06,119
people in developing countries I'm had

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,970
access to the entire web and had that

00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:09,740
freedom to create and so then I saw like

00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:11,570
there's this new

00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:13,490
thing coming up and it's really exciting

00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:15,140
and it's a little bit crazy still I

00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:17,570
think and there's a lot of work to be

00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:19,640
done there and that's the cloud I think

00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:21,890
the way things are going now if you're

00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,870
an individual app developer you really

00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:25,400
can't create an app that just runs on

00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:26,600
the laptop I mean there's a few that

00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,610
still work though there's it spew on the

00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:30,770
desktop but most apps that are most

00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:33,230
meaningful in our world today run on the

00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:35,780
cloud are available 24 x seven scale

00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:37,640
they're reliable and so this cloud space

00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:39,620
needs to be open and needs to be

00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,720
standard and we need to make sure that

00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:43,490
application developers everywhere can

00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,020
use it or we're going to miss a whole

00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:48,620
lot of people and a whole lot of great

00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:53,330
ideas so how many people remember the

00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:55,910
year of the desktop slogan 2001 do you

00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:58,880
remember that one and one of the year

00:02:55,910 --> 00:03:01,340
the desktop in 2007 and then it was the

00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:02,720
year the desktop in 2010 and I think I

00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:05,120
saw something written late last year but

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,130
it's now the year of the desktop and we

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,590
make a lot of fun of that but I actually

00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:11,720
think we missed by making so much friend

00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:13,340
of the year the desktop we missed some

00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,770
really key innovations that came out of

00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:18,320
all that effort I'm so for example one

00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:20,780
laptop per child they were built on

00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,920
linux and open source software I'm they

00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:23,600
said they were going to bring a laptop

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,330
to every kid in the world for a hundred

00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:28,310
dollars and they didn't exactly

00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:30,350
accomplish their mission but I think

00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:32,450
along the way they really influenced the

00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:34,190
whole netbook market so all the netbooks

00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:35,960
that were created when way down in price

00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:38,420
they actually came down to a hundred

00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:40,250
dollars so they change that the Linux

00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:42,890
desktop changed the world that's just

00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:44,960
one example another example is the

00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:46,700
raspberry PI's we're also built off the

00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:49,400
Linux desktop models so now you can get

00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:51,080
like a $35 little gadget that you can

00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,210
turn into a desktop or you can turn into

00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:55,310
like a monitoring system for your house

00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:57,680
or you can so there are a lot of

00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:59,570
innovations along the way that we missed

00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,900
by saying it wasn't the year of the

00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:05,000
Linux desktop and so those new things

00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,410
coming this new run it in the cloud is I

00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,390
think it's really huge it's going to be

00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:10,580
the next wave it's going to be something

00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:12,440
like electricity or something you know

00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:14,330
it's going to be an innovation that

00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:17,209
means that much to our society maybe

00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:19,040
like the internet so it's the year of

00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:20,459
the cloud and I like V here the cloud

00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,079
and we've all heard the word cloud

00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:24,360
about five years now and probably will

00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,530
hear it for another five or ten but it's

00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,120
really the time that we're starting to

00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:29,759
see a lot of people work together and

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,770
it's both individuals and companies so

00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,990
the cloud founded foundation and missing

00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:36,660
a few logos but we have 53 companies

00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:38,160
most of who our users not actually

00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:40,440
developers they're not making money off

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,360
Cloud Foundry directly like they're not

00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:44,190
selling it I'm they're actually using it

00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,990
in their businesses and they want to be

00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:47,250
part of this open-source movement so I

00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:49,680
think this is the time we can bring

00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:51,300
individuals and companies together in a

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,039
way that's reminiscent of probably the

00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:57,000
Linux kernel and when Linux actually got

00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:59,220
started and at the same time probably

00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,470
the Linux kernel felt this way too but

00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:03,330
the cloud space and cut founder is kind

00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:05,310
of really big for individual minds to

00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:07,470
conceive and to know all the pieces and

00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:08,580
parts and so it's our job those of us

00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:10,110
that are good at that or those of us

00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,460
that want to use it to make sure that

00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:13,770
all the pieces work really well together

00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,970
and for example it has to be all the

00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:17,099
software has to work well together and

00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:21,000
it has to be scalable so this is a

00:05:17,099 --> 00:05:22,919
picture of Oktoberfest in Munich who

00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:28,770
wants to guess how many beers they serve

00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:30,690
during that weekend how many you're

00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:34,199
close with 1 billion but not quite that

00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:38,669
much beer any other guesses how would

00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:41,460
you that's a really good question that's

00:05:38,669 --> 00:05:44,370
what I might and after that so it's

00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:46,139
eight million beers in that weekend gets

00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:48,210
served there and so they've learned how

00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:50,820
to ski how about a beer pouring and

00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:52,380
their beer serving 28 million I'm also

00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:54,240
has to be really reliable has to be up

00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:56,360
21st by seven so developers should be

00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,590
able to develop an app and deploy it

00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:00,210
without having to have a team of 20

00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:02,250
people to keep their app up and running

00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:04,020
24 by 7 there should be some service or

00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:07,949
some way that we can enable individuals

00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:10,169
to create and it has to ask to be able

00:06:07,949 --> 00:06:12,630
to be monitored and then all those

00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:14,550
pieces have to fit together so when you

00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:16,979
take all those pieces the ones that

00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:19,199
schedule it the ones that that deployed

00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:20,340
across pm's the ones that wanted it the

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,349
ones that can kill it and start it they

00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:23,699
all have to be couch together and I'll

00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:25,500
get into a little bit the companies

00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:27,780
often end up with like teams of twenty

00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,360
people to do that work and we want to

00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:32,430
make sure it's assessable to everybody

00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,230
so how family does is take all those

00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:36,020
things that you

00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:38,330
deploy a nap but the thing to deploy it

00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:40,010
the thing to monitor it the thing to

00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:41,630
schedule it the thing to scale it up you

00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:43,130
know it's Christmas time in your app

00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:44,780
like we're first people to Amazon for

00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:46,520
your affiliate fees should be able to

00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:50,260
immediately scale to the size it needs

00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:52,730
and to eventually kill it if you need to

00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:54,850
and the receiving is with individuals

00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:58,160
and companies are seem like really huge

00:06:54,850 --> 00:07:00,080
exponential changes so this is sa p tech

00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,540
ed I was there and they had these like

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,040
real examples of how much people had

00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:06,110
saved or how much faster they could

00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:07,520
scale their app I mean these are real

00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:10,820
customers that have their names on the

00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:13,070
bottom and I see this like across the

00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:15,760
industry when I go to the vendors that

00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:18,110
sell Cloud Foundry are touting the stuff

00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:20,090
but our vision is that there should be a

00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:21,320
cloud platform that can be either

00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:23,480
private like you should be able to

00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:25,370
deploy your own cloud foundry platform

00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:27,110
and run your own app or there should be

00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:28,730
public instances of quad founder you can

00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:30,650
deploy your app and you should be able

00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:32,030
to move your appt between them so we

00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:33,530
don't want to create a monopoly where

00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:35,000
one person is the only place where you

00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:36,320
can deploy your app we want to make sure

00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,210
that a lot of people can live in this

00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,680
ecosystem and then there's a vibrant

00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:41,630
ecosystem of apps that can move between

00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,100
vendors and various vendors that offer

00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:47,780
different services at different levels

00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:50,600
for different things and just as a

00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:53,240
couple of examples anyone heard of comic

00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:56,270
relief it's a it's a really big

00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:58,430
nonprofit in the UK they do a number of

00:07:56,270 --> 00:08:00,440
good works things the one I always

00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:01,610
remembers I help babies in Africa and

00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:04,100
like they have really hurt when dying

00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:05,660
stories they do all our fundraising in

00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:08,750
one day it's called the Red Nose Day

00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:10,360
don't ask me why and the bad day the

00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:13,310
public television service helps them

00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:15,110
advertise across all the UK and everyone

00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:17,090
makes their donations and they bring in

00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:22,190
a billion dollars that day and they're

00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:23,960
doing about 400 400 thousand four

00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:25,670
hundred four hundred times at 400

00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:28,220
transactions a second but they do all

00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:30,620
this during seven hour periods the rest

00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:32,180
of the 364 days a year they don't raise

00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:33,530
much money at all and then during the

00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:35,419
seven hour window they have to bring in

00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:36,230
a billion dollars and they really can't

00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:37,880
miss any

00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:40,010
part of that window they just missed

00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:42,440
like you know one seventh of their other

00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:43,880
fundraising thing and a small

00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:46,700
development team of about five people

00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:48,860
from a company called our Cooney use cod

00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:50,150
foundry and set up their platform and so

00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,560
they run on Cloud Foundry for this one

00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:53,720
they run all year round but trying this

00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:56,980
one day they manage to scale from a few

00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:59,810
transactions a second to like 400

00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:01,700
another example is GE they're bringing

00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:03,830
all of this technology to the industrial

00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:06,500
Internet so they're building big wind

00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:08,810
farms and airplanes and all these

00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:10,520
airplanes have tons of data so they're

00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:13,070
reporting back like the wind farms

00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:16,580
report back from like different parts of

00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:18,320
each window report back every second or

00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:20,060
a couple of times a second and they take

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,220
all that data and they're able to make

00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,990
decisions about where the airplane flies

00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:26,000
or what the wind speed is or what the

00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:28,490
gas mileage is or what the wind farms

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,590
working on in real time with all of this

00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:33,530
data and it has to scale depending on

00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:35,450
what's happening in the moment and so

00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:39,230
why does how does cloud founder fit in

00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:41,330
here and since the year 2050 two percent

00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:44,000
of the fortune 500 companies have

00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:46,190
dropped off the list and I heard an even

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,020
more startling number it was like since

00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:50,840
1980 like eighty percent of them are

00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:53,690
different so companies haven't learned

00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:56,060
how to ramp up become number one in

00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:57,200
their business and stay there and so one

00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:59,330
of the things that they're missing right

00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,760
now and this is a book by Rita McGann

00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:03,560
thermograph this actually could read she

00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,750
says it used to be up until probably two

00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:08,180
thousand and what companies did was

00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:09,830
discover their niche they developed you

00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:12,380
know the dominated their niche I pick on

00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:14,120
HP because i worked at HP i'm so HP was

00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:15,680
like the printer company and they did

00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,060
printers better than anybody else and

00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,740
they dominated the market and if you

00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:20,570
wanted a printer he bought HP and that

00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:22,340
was just obvious and they could kind of

00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:23,570
ride that wave because if you're going

00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:26,480
to buy a printer you're going to buy HP

00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:28,700
sprinter that's no longer the case now

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,650
you have a customer and that customers

00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:33,140
loyal to you as long as you adapt to

00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:35,570
their needs so take a guess how many

00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:39,590
times a day does amazon adjusts just

00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:42,490
their prices I'm eaten across either

00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:42,490
platform how many

00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:50,470
way more than 10 times the effort price

00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:52,790
is two and a half million times a day

00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:54,110
yeah across other products they're

00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:56,089
constantly adjusting their prices

00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:57,529
fluctuating by what what they're seeing

00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:59,329
in the market where people are asking

00:10:57,529 --> 00:11:01,209
what the providers are doing with their

00:10:59,329 --> 00:11:04,190
adding but also at the same time

00:11:01,209 --> 00:11:06,079
updating if you have never managed to

00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:07,639
see one but like they're updating like

00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:09,139
their carts or their buttons or their

00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:10,370
look and feel you know from one day to

00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:12,170
the next you can kind of see some

00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:15,199
changes in Amazon so they're constantly

00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:17,959
adjusting to their customers so they're

00:11:15,199 --> 00:11:19,880
not staying in one market their vomiting

00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:22,069
all markets but but they're constantly

00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:23,839
adjusting to keep those customers and so

00:11:22,069 --> 00:11:25,759
that continues innovation cycle is what

00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:28,069
most companies and most businesses are

00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:29,779
going to need to adopt that ability to

00:11:28,069 --> 00:11:31,069
constantly know what the customers want

00:11:29,779 --> 00:11:33,709
next and to be able to change with it

00:11:31,069 --> 00:11:35,630
and that's going to require some culture

00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:37,399
changes so you're no longer going to

00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:39,589
have great big teens you know a lab over

00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:41,600
100 people working on like picking on HP

00:11:39,589 --> 00:11:43,730
but hp-ux you're going to have small

00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,769
teams and the guess is you probably need

00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:47,420
a team that I'm getting ahead of myself

00:11:45,769 --> 00:11:49,579
but you need to team that like two

00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:52,190
pizzas can feed and those things need to

00:11:49,579 --> 00:11:54,079
be able to work really quickly and and

00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:55,459
communicate effectively with other teams

00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,050
that having to spend a lot of time in

00:11:55,459 --> 00:11:58,459
meetings discussing like what Maya

00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:01,339
product doesn't what yours doesn't how

00:11:58,459 --> 00:12:02,720
they're going to interface so it's a

00:12:01,339 --> 00:12:04,550
continuous integration how many people

00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,470
will have some kind of integration place

00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:07,760
at your work or your project where all

00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:10,250
of you can check in code in the same

00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,870
place that most feel awesome and how

00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:13,699
many of people have a continuous

00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:16,010
deployment so when you check in code it

00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:18,970
actually goes to market to your website

00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:23,990
or to your product within say a month

00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:28,040
within a week within a day okay the rest

00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:29,149
of you are stuck in water scrum fall so

00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:32,060
you have this very agile development

00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:34,130
cycle but it's not able to be released

00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:36,769
quickly because of whatever QA testing a

00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:38,660
process release process you have and so

00:12:36,769 --> 00:12:40,490
it kind of looks like this you develop

00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:43,540
something really cool and nobody can see

00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:46,610
it or you can't see what you need to see

00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:48,980
and so we want to help people get to

00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:50,839
this continuous integration continuous

00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:52,519
deployment it's kind of the area we're

00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:54,050
focused on and so that they can have

00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:55,910
continuous innovation and keep up with a

00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:59,480
market and keep up with their customers

00:12:55,910 --> 00:13:00,890
another way to think about it is how

00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,360
many people were used to work with an

00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:04,460
organization that kind of like software

00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:06,800
was broken up into front office back

00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:08,180
office and you had very clear roles and

00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:11,720
you actually sat probably in different

00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:13,220
buildings or different teams this is a

00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,780
price waterhouse cooper background by

00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:16,370
the way and when you move to kind of

00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:18,560
like the enterprise service bus where

00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:19,700
there is a little less you know a little

00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,020
more interaction a little more

00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:23,060
definition about what you are and how

00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:25,190
you interact with other people and then

00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:27,290
we move to this this new model of api's

00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:29,390
you shouldn't have to have a meeting

00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:30,680
with the group that who's api's you're

00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:33,110
using they should say here's what I do

00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:34,570
here's my API and then your application

00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:37,190
can call it with a very well-defined

00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:38,990
here's how I call it here's what I can

00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:40,460
expect back and then you can fail

00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:44,450
gracefully or move on to the next thing

00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:47,030
if you if it doesn't work so getting

00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:49,790
back to the two Pizza team idea and this

00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:51,980
is Martin Melvin Connolly and he said

00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:54,740
that any product will look like its

00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:56,480
organization so however you set up your

00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,710
team's your product will end up looking

00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,420
like this this kind of gives me

00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:01,030
nightmares at times in certain places I

00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:02,930
worked because however you set up your

00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:04,220
organization your product is going to

00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:05,540
near that in some way those are the

00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:07,520
people that talk together those are the

00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:09,920
people that work together and so here's

00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:11,570
the two Pizza team and I want to point

00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,160
out if terrible on your team you

00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:15,940
probably have a two-person team because

00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:19,070
he wants this whole pizza themselves I

00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:22,970
think there's amazon somebody amazon

00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:24,680
that coins that idea and so we used to

00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:25,790
have maybe I'm kind of seeing the same

00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,320
thing over and over again but it's a

00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:28,880
really important culture change and I'm

00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,080
really important change to get why we're

00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,310
doing what we're doing at Cloud Foundry

00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,960
I'm going to give you a demo and I'm

00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:35,630
going to talk about that in a minute but

00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:37,790
you used to have an application world

00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:39,470
where you probably had a technical

00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:41,360
architect or chief technical architect

00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:43,130
who knew how everything worked and

00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,600
everybody in the organization was a

00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:45,590
little frayed that might leave and then

00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,870
you wouldn't know how something works

00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:50,210
now you'd move to a world where everyone

00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:52,310
manages their own application of their

00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:54,020
own micro service and they interact with

00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:56,180
other people through api's and so no one

00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:57,500
really knows how all the pieces work but

00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:59,300
they all work well together because

00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:01,850
there's clear definition of what they do

00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:03,470
and how they interact how many people

00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:06,690
feel like they're in the monolithic

00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:08,580
layered world's these days

00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:09,870
cool a lot of us still are and how many

00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:11,400
people feel like the release

00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:14,250
transitioning to micro services are

00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:16,590
trying to make that leap awesome and so

00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:17,880
if anyone wants to chime in feel feel

00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:19,590
free if you have questions or you have

00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,600
stories you want to share I'm down here

00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:25,530
instead of up there so we can try to do

00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:27,420
that so microservices this new world is

00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:29,490
great and actually to be honest with you

00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:31,140
I feel like my car services is like it's

00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:34,170
the great new thing like now we're not

00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:36,030
supposed to eat flour it's it's better

00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:37,470
than what we had but I don't think it's

00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:39,600
the end-all be-all so I think we're

00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:42,270
still evolving just like diets or

00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,680
evolving but they're great but you need

00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:45,450
to make sure that you can rapidly

00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,280
provision them that you can create them

00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:49,110
very quickly that you can deploy them

00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:51,330
quickly that you can update them in

00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:53,130
place without messing with anything else

00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:54,840
around either make sure you can scale

00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:56,070
them quickly and you need to make sure

00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:59,160
you have a culture that works really

00:15:56,070 --> 00:16:01,260
well with them and so if you asking to

00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:03,990
be about this maker services when I

00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:05,970
started in this so yeah I'll put it to a

00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:07,770
factor net they say that's the Holy

00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:09,900
Grail the Bible that will tell you how

00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:12,090
to do maker surfaces I think it's a

00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,960
really awesome primer I don't think it's

00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:15,840
going to teach you how to do

00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:16,950
microservices by itself because there's

00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:19,320
a whole bunch of more things I'm not

00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:22,170
going to read through these but but you

00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:24,210
also need to make sure that there's not

00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:25,500
much if you create micro services you

00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:28,020
need to make sure that what developers

00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:29,460
are deploying is actually developing is

00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:32,310
actually what's getting deployed that

00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:33,300
those environments look very similar you

00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:35,460
need to make sure you can scale up

00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:36,660
really quickly so in addition to just

00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:38,280
creating this thing called a micro

00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:39,990
service you have to make sure that the

00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:41,730
environment around it also works well

00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:43,350
with micro services and that's kind of

00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:45,840
the whole DevOps culture that they talk

00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:47,760
about how many people have a group in

00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:49,890
their company that's called DevOps I'm

00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:51,240
just kind of curious yeah and how many

00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:58,589
people would consider themselves a

00:16:51,240 --> 00:17:01,110
DevOps person cool no too but you know

00:16:58,589 --> 00:17:02,190
that's not enough and you still need you

00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:03,900
know you still need to know how you're

00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:06,089
going to recover from failures you need

00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:07,949
how we need to be able to isolate the

00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:09,060
resources you need to be able to figure

00:17:07,949 --> 00:17:10,800
out how you're going to deal with data

00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:12,449
because these microservices don't carry

00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:15,179
their own data with them so they have to

00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:17,339
have persistent data somewhere there's a

00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:18,430
lot of issues to be figured out and a

00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:20,680
lot of technology

00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:23,170
I'm so the Borg was was google's on

00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:24,910
coaster configuration software and a lot

00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:27,100
of really cool technology spun out of

00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:28,900
that or around that time and around that

00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:30,550
space I mean that's what we're seeing

00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,960
people play with now so we're people

00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:34,300
seeing people play with Cooper Nettie's

00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:35,620
with my sauce with docker and I heard

00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:37,600
the doctor talk here was like you

00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:39,340
couldn't get into it so this is these

00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,320
are the technologies that is people

00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:43,720
moved to micro services under there

00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:44,620
trying for and I won't include this

00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,850
slide because I think it's really cool

00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:49,870
how many people here open source fans

00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:51,640
that scale hopefully everybody so if you

00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:52,960
read the bus we now have open source all

00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,190
the way from the hardware stack all the

00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,740
way up to the software stack so the

00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:58,210
whole stack has open source software but

00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:00,460
there's another change here that I think

00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:02,350
is really cool and the other changes

00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:04,420
these are not company names along the

00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:05,950
producer project names so now instead of

00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:08,650
having technologies focused around

00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:10,840
companies we have technologies focused

00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:12,910
around projects all the way up the stack

00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,050
and I think that's pretty new I mean

00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:17,430
we've been working on it for a long time

00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:19,690
but that ability is pretty name and

00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:22,090
we've also changed the way we measure

00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:23,440
things you can see how the world's

00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:24,820
changed by looking at the unit

00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,100
measurements so we have changed from

00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:29,410
internet as a service to platform as a

00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:30,850
service or to the app platform and so

00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:33,310
we've gone from measuring things and how

00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:35,230
many VMS do you have to having how many

00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:36,910
micro services or apps do you have with

00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:38,620
the whole world in it and you don't have

00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:40,270
to worry about the number of VMs that

00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:42,400
the application platform should spin

00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:46,060
those up automatically and send your app

00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:48,010
where it needs to go and the reason that

00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:49,510
these application platforms can can make

00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:52,150
it is because they can do this is

00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:54,190
because they they have constraints but

00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:56,620
because they have constraints they can

00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:58,420
make promises so because they say you

00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:59,680
have to use one of these 50 languages

00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:01,360
they can say if you're using one of

00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:04,510
these 50 languages we can handle the

00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:06,010
build for you if so they have

00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:09,400
constraints so that they can make

00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:11,200
promises and when they can make promises

00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:13,540
like this is a one of the cloud foundry

00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,760
developers and he said you know he wrote

00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:17,680
a haiku about pretty pressed and he said

00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:20,140
here's my source code run it on the

00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:23,860
cloud for me I do not care how like just

00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:26,190
make the thing work and so what we're

00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:28,090
trying to do is turn turn that

00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:28,770
environment from the left where you had

00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:30,090
to have all your

00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:32,100
i braised your dependencies your zip

00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:33,510
files your jar files and turn it into

00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,250
something where you just have your app

00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:36,900
with a web balancer and the database

00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:41,040
thing and all you have to worry about is

00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:42,990
your app and the platform should

00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:45,600
automatically you know self deploy

00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:50,940
figure out what burb environment you're

00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:52,620
on push it out there scale it scale it

00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:54,600
you know add more instances when it

00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:57,870
needs to kill it when you tell it to and

00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:59,190
so this is CF push is when you ask how

00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:00,600
you do card found reruns let's see if

00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:02,640
push like that's the command you can run

00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:04,470
the most so see effort and the whole

00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,230
bunch of variables you can add to n

00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:08,460
stuff but you do see if target my cloud

00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:09,330
found I'm gonna give you a demo in a sec

00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:11,280
I just wanted to walk you through what

00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:12,930
I'm going to demo it so you can do CF

00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,880
targets you're going to say you know

00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:16,680
here's my Cloud Foundry environment I'm

00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,910
using IBM bluemix or i'm using pivotal

00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:20,280
row i'm using the one I set up on my

00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:21,380
servers that's that's my my target

00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:24,750
environment where I want to run my app

00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:27,510
then we do a CF push your app which is

00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:29,850
literally just for files that are part

00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:31,170
of your application and then you can

00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:32,550
create services like so if your

00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:34,410
application needs a database you need

00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:36,870
persistent data store you create service

00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:38,400
then you bind your app to the service so

00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:40,560
that they know to work with each other

00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,750
talk to each other and then you start

00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:44,520
your app and if you want you can scale

00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:49,080
it or you can set it up to automatically

00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:50,370
scale and and so what's the container so

00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:52,170
a lot of people get confused between

00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:53,400
like Cloud Foundry and docker and Coburn

00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:55,890
and he's like how all those pieces work

00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,480
together and there are containers in

00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:59,490
Cloud Foundry but where we've done is

00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,240
say you know so what teams have done is

00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:02,160
they go and play with all these

00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,230
technologies and they put them together

00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,430
and what they find that they're learning

00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:06,990
in the process they learn about

00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:08,580
containers they learn about schedulers

00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:10,650
and then they end up with the team is

00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:12,840
like 20 people keeping those things

00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:15,180
running well together and so what we've

00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:16,740
done is taking the best of those given

00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:19,170
you as many choices as we can and

00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:20,610
packages them all up and do that for you

00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:22,350
so it's a prescriptive environment

00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:23,730
instead of a self-assembled environment

00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:29,250
I'm so you're not trying to put them

00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:30,930
together like that and ok for you really

00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:33,000
little folks this is not a one-to-one

00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:34,590
mapping so like scheduler is not core

00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,500
services I'm just trying to show a

00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:38,640
little bit what's under the covers here

00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,909
so like garden is the container

00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,990
management

00:21:39,909 --> 00:21:43,250
there's build packs that have all the

00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:44,809
information about you know they can

00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:47,890
figure out for using Python there go or

00:21:44,809 --> 00:21:51,470
Ruby and put your application together

00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:52,549
di bill pushes your apps across pm's go

00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:56,990
rider does a lot of the communication

00:21:52,549 --> 00:21:58,610
stuff and but I wanted to show here is

00:21:56,990 --> 00:22:00,230
that there's these technologies on the

00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:02,720
right that we are playing with other

00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:05,090
people are playing with an emetic docker

00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,500
here's the example I'm so although you

00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:08,059
may have heard the doctor and a bunch of

00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:10,850
other organizations got together and

00:22:08,059 --> 00:22:13,159
created a standard called run see I'm so

00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:15,289
when they did that we took our container

00:22:13,159 --> 00:22:17,120
technology garden and said okay now

00:22:15,289 --> 00:22:19,429
there's a standard there we'll make sure

00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,530
that all of our users you can't see it

00:22:19,429 --> 00:22:23,000
but the run c logo is in there all of

00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:24,289
our users also have access to the

00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,299
standard so you can use like docker

00:22:24,289 --> 00:22:28,010
containers in cloud foundry or any

00:22:26,299 --> 00:22:31,520
container that uses that that standard

00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:33,919
format and this is basically what a

00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:36,530
container is so it containers a set of

00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:40,250
isolation rules so I has a process ID a

00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:42,530
user and that work IE and then asking

00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:44,510
has a file system and instead of what we

00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:46,820
take then the file system and set of

00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:48,890
processes and we call that a droplet in

00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:50,809
cloud foundry and so that droplet is

00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:52,429
your application so it's enough of the

00:22:50,809 --> 00:22:54,020
operating system application and the

00:22:52,429 --> 00:22:55,909
files that it runs on create that

00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:57,500
droplet and that's what can't manage and

00:22:55,909 --> 00:22:59,419
so containers are awesome but they're

00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:01,220
just really mad enough because you need

00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:02,990
a platform to run your container run and

00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:06,350
even if you don't think you have a

00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:07,669
platform you have a platform so how many

00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:10,730
people have a platform that makes them

00:23:07,669 --> 00:23:16,240
feel like that or it makes some team in

00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:16,240
your organization feel like that you did

00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:23,299
and so this is a CF push that I talked

00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:24,650
about earlier and so these are the

00:23:23,299 --> 00:23:25,970
things that happen when you do is see if

00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:28,220
push and this is how they're bigger than

00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:30,320
just containers so when you do is your

00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:32,590
first it creates your app uploads are

00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:35,360
the app files it's durable than metadata

00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:38,900
it stages the app it creates that

00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:40,429
droplet that I talked about I won't walk

00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:41,630
you through all that going to show you I

00:23:40,429 --> 00:23:43,760
should have showed you first and then

00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:48,140
talked about it and then I went a little

00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:49,660
bit about bird packs so big packs so you

00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:51,370
create your

00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:53,620
your application for cloud foundry and

00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:54,670
any language you like and I say any

00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:55,630
language and I mean just about any

00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:59,890
language someone told me we have a

00:23:55,630 --> 00:24:02,980
cobalt build pack and then let me take

00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:05,380
those when you run your CF push and we

00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:07,690
take we load all the bill packs and the

00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:09,520
build packs actually have three scripts

00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:13,060
to them they try to detect what language

00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:15,100
it is they I just read out the second

00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:16,840
then they build the application and then

00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:18,550
they execute it so each book pack knows

00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,930
how to do that so they all run the

00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:21,610
detects if you don't tell what what

00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:23,740
language you're using each build pack

00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:25,300
will check your application and try to

00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:27,640
detect if that's the language it should

00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:29,980
be involved in so the Python built pack

00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:32,800
will say is this a Python file okay then

00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:34,480
run me and it'll put together all your

00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,560
dependencies if it needs to be compiled

00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,970
if it's a language that needs to be

00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:38,710
compiled it will compile it with your

00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:40,420
dependencies if it's not a language like

00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:42,810
if it's like Python it just takes the

00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:45,280
files it needs with the dependencies

00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:47,110
those were the three so the text and

00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:48,970
then supposed to run it builds up a

00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:50,980
thing if it needs building and when it

00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:54,480
passes on the data to the cloud foundry

00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:56,650
to be deployed on a virtual machine and

00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,600
it's kind of the same thing with with

00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:59,860
services so services if you if you

00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,630
wanted to add a database to Cloud

00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:03,010
Foundry like a database service not you

00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:05,230
didn't want to use one but you wanted to

00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:09,430
create one you would create a manifest

00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:11,680
file that just says it tells it I think

00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:13,210
there's five files it tells it um it

00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,980
adds catalog information so it's like

00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:16,930
I'm a database if someone wants to use

00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:19,060
me it tells cod foundering how to

00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:21,850
provision it if someone calls it so how

00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:23,800
will I can provision mysql is that it

00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:26,260
tells I'm cloud foundry how to bind it

00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:28,060
so how if someone needs that database

00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:30,280
how do they connect it to the app that

00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:32,350
it's using and then it tells it how to

00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:35,620
unbind it and how to kill it so that it

00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:40,090
can easily be scaled put in or removed

00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:42,130
from the the running process and so this

00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:43,570
is all part of turning all of those

00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:45,520
mesophase that you have to worry about

00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:49,900
into one where you only worry about your

00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:52,450
app so I'm gonna do the demo and I I

00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:57,610
don't like live demos so I apologize i

00:25:52,450 --> 00:26:00,280
actually um they're 20 i'm so i'm just

00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:01,190
showing the directory that it's in and i

00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:03,650
did this

00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:06,530
my laptop so you can see at a Python App

00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:08,150
hope I I do that just I showed you

00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:10,880
what's in it throwing dependencies flask

00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:14,090
and then I show you the requirements for

00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:15,890
here you can say always I have rum the

00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:18,440
only requirement is flask and then I'm

00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:19,610
doing my CF push I limited the memory I

00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:21,980
don't know why because it's like a hello

00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:25,130
world app and i called it demo for you

00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:29,000
and so it's creating the app it's

00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:30,590
binding the to the interface where i

00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,400
have set up to push this was pivotal

00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:37,820
squad founder at the moment it loaded my

00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:39,140
files and it's going to start my app and

00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:41,060
look for the bill price's creating a

00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:42,500
container to put it now is downloading

00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:44,270
all the dope packs because i didn't tell

00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,740
her I was using Python so it's going to

00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:48,580
download all the build packs and try to

00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:53,410
figure out for me what language I used

00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:53,410
my head as I didn't upgrade that

00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:03,740
and so you can see it figured out that I

00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:05,870
needed the Python build packet have

00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:07,820
installed the Python runtime and then

00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:10,490
it's creating this droplet for me which

00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:12,440
create has my application the operating

00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:16,220
system in the files for me just for my

00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:17,480
app and then it uploaded it and then for

00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:19,130
some reason when I ran at this time it

00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:20,990
took a couple tries to get my instance

00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:22,220
running it's only a hello world app so

00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:28,040
I'm not quite sure what happens I'm

00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:30,440
there and so it started my app and then

00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:32,450
it tells me that it's running it's not

00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:34,160
using any memory yet and then I always

00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:37,190
do is see if apps because when it gives

00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:39,260
you a URL and my hello world app is

00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:41,780
actually live in the web as soon as I've

00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:44,720
done that so I'm going to Firefox I put

00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:47,030
that URL in and you can see my hello

00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,770
world app I'm any of you could do this

00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:50,570
you can set up a trial account in like

00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:52,520
five minutes and you could get this done

00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:55,640
with you know ink download any demo app

00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:57,110
I'm from the and so now I said I'm going

00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,490
to you know it's Christmas time I'm sure

00:27:57,110 --> 00:28:00,740
everyone's going to use my hello world

00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:04,310
app so I'm going to scale it up I want

00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:06,800
eight versions of it so I did the scale

00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:09,110
with the dash I for eight instances and

00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:10,970
you can see if you start refreshing

00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:13,160
there's actually eight instances of my

00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:14,510
hello world app and so if everybody

00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:19,610
wanted to check it out I could scale up

00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:21,740
to the roof and so this when I did this

00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:23,600
this URL was live and then i said what

00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:28,190
if we added database so i created a

00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:30,260
service um clear to be a database and I

00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:33,470
made some error there I'm going to do it

00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:34,910
again so I'm just creating a service and

00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:37,060
I just tell it what database service I

00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:43,460
want and I tell it what I wanted to call

00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:47,150
be called and it creates the database in

00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:48,590
a second and there's lots of databases

00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:50,680
already built in the cloud foundry so

00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:53,150
you could use any of them and databases

00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:54,620
often used for persistent data because

00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:57,530
you're your application itself doesn't

00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:59,660
store any data and then I'm binding that

00:28:57,530 --> 00:29:02,210
database that I created to my app so I'm

00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:05,320
saying bind my app to that demo db's

00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:05,320
what I called my database

00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:13,370
and I didn't actually do the restage

00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:15,380
here I think and then I'm going to go in

00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:16,820
and I'm going to turn on this good

00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:18,230
environment variable just so i can show

00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:21,650
you that the database is actually alive

00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:22,880
my very complicated demo here and you

00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:24,500
can cheat if you just want to try this

00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,970
out you can write your own demo or

00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:27,560
there's a whole bunch on github if you

00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:29,180
just Google Cloud Foundry demo you can

00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:38,060
download somebody else's demo and play

00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:40,240
with it and so then I do another CF push

00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:43,910
because I've added another service and

00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:54,310
it redeploys my app for me updates it in

00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:54,310
place so it stops it and it starts it

00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:00,980
they create the now here's where if I

00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:02,180
know I'm just using Python I probably

00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:03,350
should have just told it i was using

00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:06,350
python because i don't have to download

00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:09,250
all the build packs again in this case

00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:09,250
it's only a few seconds

00:30:14,659 --> 00:30:23,570
any questions what you can yeah you can

00:30:21,859 --> 00:30:26,599
download the command line interface to

00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:31,639
your laptop and then you do the you do

00:30:26,599 --> 00:30:33,019
the you do a CF 2 sorry on the spot for

00:30:31,639 --> 00:30:34,580
you anything you tell you at which

00:30:33,019 --> 00:30:36,229
server you're using so which quad

00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:38,210
founder instance you're using cloud

00:30:36,229 --> 00:30:40,190
foundry won't actually install on your

00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:41,330
laptop we've tried and you get you can

00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:43,009
get it to work on your laptop but it's

00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:45,139
kind of big for a laptop environment I'm

00:30:43,009 --> 00:30:46,970
so if you're just demoing it as an app

00:30:45,139 --> 00:30:50,809
developer I'm you can see how the whole

00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:52,340
bunch of instances running now and again

00:30:50,809 --> 00:30:55,849
there's the URL that's my actual live

00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:57,080
app and if we go back there and you can

00:30:55,849 --> 00:31:00,769
see that we added all the database

00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:02,119
instance there um so you can run cloud

00:31:00,769 --> 00:31:03,950
foundry on your laptop a little

00:31:02,119 --> 00:31:05,269
difficult I'm you could install cloud

00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:08,479
foundry on the server in your

00:31:05,269 --> 00:31:10,009
environment and then tell your your

00:31:08,479 --> 00:31:12,049
Cloud Foundry command-line interface to

00:31:10,009 --> 00:31:14,989
work with that one or you could sign up

00:31:12,049 --> 00:31:22,309
form a trial from like s ap or IB M or

00:31:14,989 --> 00:31:24,739
pivotal and just use theirs could you

00:31:22,309 --> 00:31:26,929
deploy AWS yeah so Claude funder works

00:31:24,739 --> 00:31:31,039
on AWS OpenStack a number of different

00:31:26,929 --> 00:31:36,279
infrastructure platforms any other

00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:39,169
questions on this yeah is everybody

00:31:36,279 --> 00:31:42,889
doing starting from the same source code

00:31:39,169 --> 00:31:47,450
is everybody in the same binary you

00:31:42,889 --> 00:31:48,950
never see your binaries verify the

00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:53,330
binary running is

00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:55,940
the same for anybody doing I think so

00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:58,460
but I can verify that for you what's the

00:31:55,940 --> 00:32:00,679
case that you're worried about just know

00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:03,200
that we started with this source code

00:32:00,679 --> 00:32:07,519
who the binary that running is also

00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:11,510
security people yeah yeah they all get

00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:13,490
the same yeah typically you would build

00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:15,559
it and then you would be providing this

00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:17,720
URL as a service to somebody else see

00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:19,909
typically you won't be providing your

00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:21,860
quad foundry app to others and expecting

00:32:19,909 --> 00:32:24,529
them to run it in their environment you

00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:29,240
would be hosting your own app for them

00:32:24,529 --> 00:32:30,919
but we build up one day yes thank you

00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:34,220
just rebuilding a month later is it

00:32:30,919 --> 00:32:35,960
exact same hey I think so from some

00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:36,980
conversations I've had but I'm not one

00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:51,080
hundred percent sure so I will

00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:52,210
definitely follow up with you class

00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:54,100
releases

00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:58,060
between the point one at the point you

00:32:54,100 --> 00:33:16,110
will be writing you could specify the

00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:18,190
Virgin hotel very very very difficult I

00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:21,580
could I can put you in touch with some

00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:26,860
and I can just find answer until you do

00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:28,150
you use cloud foundry okay I nobody here

00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:29,410
i usually like recruit all the clubs

00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:30,670
under users and make them sit in the

00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:37,320
front row and help me answer all my

00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:37,320
questions any other questions yeah

00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:47,070
wait

00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:59,970
Bell the point cloud found itself

00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:02,100
yes um if you go to Cloud Foundry org

00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:03,960
slash docs there's lots of information

00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:07,650
there and then we have a mailing list

00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:11,010
called CF dev and there's a slack

00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:12,660
channel black cloud foundry ugh I'm all

00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:14,190
those places the documentation should be

00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:17,070
i'll be there if you run into holes

00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:18,330
please file bug requests yeah and then

00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:19,830
there's the to the mailing list and the

00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:22,920
slack have really active people that can

00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:24,690
help answer those questions yeah I'm

00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:27,630
curious how many people would see

00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:29,580
themselves using their own instance of

00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:30,960
cloud foundry in that company like

00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:32,250
installing it themselves on their own

00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,500
cloud environment or in their own

00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:36,360
company it's a couple of you cool and

00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:38,640
how many of you would see your company

00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:43,680
you know contracting with pebble or IBM

00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:55,850
RS IP or Swisscom both yeah so that's

00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:55,850
fun ok yep cool cool

00:34:55,939 --> 00:35:00,479
that's how i phrase it like really for

00:34:58,619 --> 00:35:02,939
enterprises or what about like I've an

00:35:00,479 --> 00:35:05,189
individual website would you find is

00:35:02,939 --> 00:35:05,590
that a good these panties for that what

00:35:05,189 --> 00:35:07,450
we do

00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:10,090
it's a good use case for both

00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:12,280
individuals and companies companies are

00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:13,870
really right now I would say our most

00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:15,610
visible users are companies who are

00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:17,560
seeing these tremendous changes like

00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:19,000
they have this real problem that they

00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:20,380
need to update their prices to to have

00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,080
billion times a day or something and

00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:25,300
Cloud Foundry helps them scale to that

00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:29,920
level and they replace 20 person teams

00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:32,290
with cloud foundry or more but I think

00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,850
the technology is now also super useful

00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:35,890
to individuals especially individuals

00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:38,470
who couldn't have a 20-person team can

00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:41,560
now deploy an app that's available 24 x

00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:43,750
seven scales restarts itself when it

00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:46,930
fails like that potential wasn't

00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:48,190
available to individuals before so

00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:50,110
that's why I'm here at scale like I

00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:52,210
think there's a huge there's a huge

00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:53,620
message out there right that application

00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:59,620
that we want to empower those individual

00:35:53,620 --> 00:36:03,990
application developers as well any other

00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:03,990
questions anybody have anything to add

00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:08,250
yeah

00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:16,010
by soon

00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,690
so AWS provides a lot of services and it

00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,970
provides a lot of the internet as of

00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:27,160
service services I'm Cloud Foundry

00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:28,630
provides the platform as a service or

00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:30,910
the application management things that

00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:32,800
offers a lot more assistance to you in

00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:34,720
managing your app and making sure it's

00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,880
up and redeploying it and creating the

00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:41,280
VMS for you I'm so you actually put

00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:41,280
Cloud Foundry on top of AWS for example

00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:48,240
and if you want to add to that anyone

00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:48,240
can add to that too

00:37:01,289 --> 00:37:12,130
the database does this to this is what

00:37:04,269 --> 00:37:14,259
time it's not quite that simple because

00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:18,539
you want like one copy of your data but

00:37:14,259 --> 00:37:21,599
but they're also they also scale yeah

00:37:18,539 --> 00:37:21,599
yeah you

00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:38,609
the right side to deploy covering such

00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:40,959
that you know people who

00:37:38,609 --> 00:37:43,150
how much they can restructure you burn

00:37:40,959 --> 00:37:44,799
on that left side they're coming like

00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:47,890
what is the actual is that all good

00:37:44,799 --> 00:37:54,189
located on single now or what's the

00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:59,709
overall so it can all run on a single

00:37:54,189 --> 00:38:00,759
nodes um yeah probably not um so you

00:37:59,709 --> 00:38:02,019
don't need like a whole bunch of

00:38:00,759 --> 00:38:02,919
machines during Cloud Foundry if that's

00:38:02,019 --> 00:38:07,660
what you're saying like he can run a

00:38:02,919 --> 00:38:09,939
single node yeah and that's that's why I

00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:11,469
think that's the power right like once

00:38:09,939 --> 00:38:13,839
we can explain to people the promise

00:38:11,469 --> 00:38:15,279
that it makes like you don't have to

00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:16,390
figure out all those pieces like you

00:38:15,279 --> 00:38:17,769
probably still need to understand how

00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:19,630
they work because that's the kind of job

00:38:17,769 --> 00:38:22,900
where in but you don't have to make sure

00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:25,209
they all work well together anymore but

00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:27,069
the oh you can run it on a single server

00:38:25,209 --> 00:38:29,259
and it'll work it's how many nodes you

00:38:27,069 --> 00:38:31,509
add depends on like you redundancy and

00:38:29,259 --> 00:38:34,809
you know what your application needs and

00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:38,039
I mean can make it work on the laptop a

00:38:34,809 --> 00:38:38,039
few really tweaked stuff

00:38:54,089 --> 00:39:00,790
so I don't know at that level I guess

00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:05,680
where it builds versus where it deploys

00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:06,880
um so it's going to build it within a

00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,950
virtual it's going to create a virtual

00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,970
machine and build it there for you but

00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:11,859
you don't have to worry about the

00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:13,660
virtual which virtual machine it is like

00:39:11,859 --> 00:39:15,880
if something happens you're going to say

00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:29,410
we start my app not restart my virtual

00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:30,970
machine I don't know yeah yeah Can Can

00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:35,460
somebody write down my questions for me

00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:35,460
so I can follow up with people Thanks

00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:56,250
yeah no no the old ones are gone you

00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:56,250
would have to rebuild yeah yeah

00:39:57,230 --> 00:40:04,080
or you have the option of in pushing the

00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:06,300
partisan

00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:08,220
so it's all app based so it has

00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:10,710
containers we come droplets the

00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:12,540
container with your app information and

00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:14,280
they run on virtual machines but the

00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:16,530
only part that you interface was is your

00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:19,500
app which gets created into a droplet

00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:31,410
with a container is that does that

00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:33,810
answer your question yes you're not

00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:34,650
going to think like once you're using it

00:40:33,810 --> 00:40:36,570
you're not going to think about it

00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:37,740
running and virtual various virtual

00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:39,330
machines you're going to think about how

00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:43,050
many instances do you have running and

00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:45,390
then Bosh and in other parts of cloud

00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:47,070
foundry make sure that it's across

00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:48,840
different virtual machines or different

00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:51,450
systems and then it's redundant like you

00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:52,680
don't have to worry about that even

00:40:51,450 --> 00:41:05,040
though you want to worry about that man

00:40:52,680 --> 00:41:06,780
is this new version alongside my old

00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:08,250
version and slowly turned out my old

00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:09,990
versions are still serving to a question

00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:11,790
and bring up my new ones at the same

00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:15,510
time it's which amount of the load

00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:16,680
balancer I don't know the way I didn't

00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:18,630
know how to do it we create new names

00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:26,460
but I don't I don't know if you can do

00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:28,020
that in runtime yes well the databases

00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:29,820
are your persistent storage so the apps

00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:32,610
don't have dedicated persistent storage

00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:34,800
per app but you store data to the

00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:36,270
databases and then so it's a I think

00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,160
that's a problem that's still being

00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:40,020
worked out in the space so there's

00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:41,820
actively conversations about persistent

00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:43,080
storage and where should it be you know

00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:44,820
where's that live and how should it work

00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:46,440
I'm so if it's a space you're interested

00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:48,270
in like now is the time to join those

00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:50,220
mailing lists and like participate or

00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:53,330
you can wait and smart minds we'll

00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:53,330
figure it out hopefully

00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:08,350
so I'm not the openstack experts okay i

00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:09,490
found a deploys on top of OpenStack but

00:42:08,350 --> 00:42:12,120
I wouldn't be able to answer that

00:42:09,490 --> 00:42:12,120
question for you

00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:23,540
that's not one of those seconds it's

00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:25,700
OpenStack you get in virtual machines

00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:28,390
like a physical cheat now you do we do

00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:28,390
on top of that

00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:36,380
and if you do to play cloud foundry

00:42:34,819 --> 00:42:37,790
openstack cloud founders the one that

00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:39,920
requests those virtual machines it

00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:41,390
doesn't you are not working with your

00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:45,440
app space not with the virtual machines

00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:49,730
from OpenStack any other questions or

00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:52,520
our input from anyway okay so it's going

00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:58,549
to talk yeah because obviously if you

00:42:52,520 --> 00:43:01,869
guys think 10 spear servers know once in

00:42:58,549 --> 00:43:01,869
it you tell what about the 10 servers

00:43:03,819 --> 00:43:19,460
yep yep yep yes you need open sack or

00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:20,990
something on them as well so you need do

00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:28,329
you need the whole stack in quad funtage

00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:28,329
kind of a top layer the stack yes yep

00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:35,460
you would have to install it yes yeah

00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:45,390
really

00:43:46,950 --> 00:43:51,460
yeah you can set all sorts of different

00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:55,359
messages to tolerate if we eat for

00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:56,980
different things so yeah yes those

00:43:55,359 --> 00:44:02,500
there's log files and there's messaging

00:43:56,980 --> 00:44:03,880
I should probably repeat the questions

00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:07,960
has everybody been able to hear them

00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:12,369
I'll start repeating them alright so we

00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:13,869
need to platform we did a demo and so I

00:44:12,369 --> 00:44:15,730
think I've said this so we clawed

00:44:13,869 --> 00:44:17,109
founders that it can make a promise to

00:44:15,730 --> 00:44:18,579
you because it offers these constraints

00:44:17,109 --> 00:44:20,619
but we want to do is be able to make a

00:44:18,579 --> 00:44:22,599
promise to the app developers I'm that

00:44:20,619 --> 00:44:27,069
the app will run the little scale that

00:44:22,599 --> 00:44:28,810
it'll be monitored and that will that

00:44:27,069 --> 00:44:30,670
allows us to create this ecosystem of

00:44:28,810 --> 00:44:33,849
apps that can be moved around the people

00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:35,380
that can move between services and when

00:44:33,849 --> 00:44:36,730
I want to point out again here I mean

00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:38,859
these are the cloud foundry foundation

00:44:36,730 --> 00:44:40,450
members cloud foundry foundation is a

00:44:38,859 --> 00:44:43,060
nonprofit that the host the cloud

00:44:40,450 --> 00:44:44,980
foundry project but there are a lot of

00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:46,839
companies here that our users and so I

00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:49,420
think that's really key like it's a key

00:44:46,839 --> 00:44:51,280
moment um because these are companies

00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:53,109
that are willing to invest in the open

00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:54,849
source software that they're using so

00:44:53,109 --> 00:44:56,470
these are companies that want to come

00:44:54,849 --> 00:44:57,880
and they want to have a say in the

00:44:56,470 --> 00:45:00,250
requirements and they want to help

00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:02,140
develop it I'm and so we're getting news

00:45:00,250 --> 00:45:04,150
articles like this but these companies

00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:06,010
are joining the foundation because they

00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:07,300
need with the software and they want to

00:45:06,010 --> 00:45:08,800
have vendors that provide it for them

00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:12,310
but they also want to make sure they

00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:14,020
don't have vendor lock-in and so what

00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:16,180
we're trying to do is make sure that we

00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:17,650
rebalance the system so that the

00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:19,000
providers can still make money and they

00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:21,099
can still provide a service but that

00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:23,380
we're also making sure that the voice of

00:45:21,099 --> 00:45:25,300
the user is heard even before they

00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:28,599
really understand the technology or know

00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:30,520
how to actually work on it and so what

00:45:28,599 --> 00:45:32,200
we're doing is building an individual

00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:33,819
we're calling them cigs which is like a

00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:36,460
kind of overused word I think in this

00:45:33,819 --> 00:45:38,410
space but special interest groups for

00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:39,849
the different vertical platforms it's

00:45:38,410 --> 00:45:42,359
like how many people here are in the

00:45:39,849 --> 00:45:45,640
financial industry anybody in the

00:45:42,359 --> 00:45:49,060
telecom industry awesome and yet what

00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:53,079
other industries are people in health

00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:55,329
care nothing they're willing to share

00:45:53,079 --> 00:45:56,680
CIA secret government stuff the

00:45:55,329 --> 00:45:58,180
government isn't it's actually really

00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:58,690
cool the government's using the US

00:45:58,180 --> 00:46:01,190
government

00:45:58,690 --> 00:46:04,550
the Korean government the South Korean

00:46:01,190 --> 00:46:05,750
government the UK government all of them

00:46:04,550 --> 00:46:07,670
are using cloud foundry and they're

00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:10,100
willing to talk about it and the US

00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:12,560
government actually created it's a cod

00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:14,000
found redox gov I think anyway they

00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:16,100
actually have their own documentation

00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,220
site where they documented how they how

00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:20,330
they use it how other US government

00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:23,090
organizations can use their instance of

00:46:20,330 --> 00:46:25,220
cloud foundry and so we actually created

00:46:23,090 --> 00:46:27,410
these cigs and this was the very first

00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:30,260
one we held last year or the last year

00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:31,670
I'm in New York City nobody told me when

00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:32,870
I went that you're supposed to when you

00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:34,220
go to New York City and you go to Wall

00:46:32,870 --> 00:46:37,370
Street you're supposed to wear a button

00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:38,870
up blue shirt so I was not only the only

00:46:37,370 --> 00:46:42,260
woman in the room I was the only one not

00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:43,460
wearing a button up blue shirt but it

00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:45,140
was really interesting like so they all

00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:46,940
talked about what they're trying to do

00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:48,560
in the space they were really open to

00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:50,150
sharing with each other what they had

00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:51,440
tried and what was working and not

00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:53,890
working in a way that I really haven't

00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:57,080
seen I'm in this kind of industry before

00:46:53,890 --> 00:46:58,820
and if you're curious my favorite

00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:00,230
example like what in the world do banks

00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:02,240
need differently than Cloud Foundry than

00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:05,240
anybody else they needed much more

00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:07,610
specific role based permissions so like

00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:09,230
someone that can start a service is not

00:47:07,610 --> 00:47:11,120
the same person that can stop a service

00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:15,800
in the banking industry I'm due to all

00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:17,570
the financial regulations another thing

00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:19,610
that we've done is we're creating dojos

00:47:17,570 --> 00:47:21,170
I'm so they usually hosted by a company

00:47:19,610 --> 00:47:23,750
one of the cloud foundry foundation

00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:25,910
companies I mean these dojos are places

00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:29,090
where you can apply and you come for six

00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:30,530
weeks and also quad foundry uses the

00:47:29,090 --> 00:47:32,360
pair programming model how many people

00:47:30,530 --> 00:47:34,910
have worked in a pair programming type

00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:36,260
environment or tried it it okay so all

00:47:34,910 --> 00:47:38,030
of our code is pair programmed I'm

00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:39,380
usually the people set in the same room

00:47:38,030 --> 00:47:41,660
if they're in the same company but we've

00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:43,070
also managed to do it virtually and so

00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:44,720
dojo is a place where you can come for

00:47:43,070 --> 00:47:47,120
six weeks I'm you're paired up with

00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:49,130
someone or maybe several someone's who

00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:50,540
are more expert in cloud foundry and by

00:47:49,130 --> 00:47:52,160
the end of the six six weeks it's

00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:54,380
expected that you are now a cloud

00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:56,480
foundry contributor and know enough

00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:58,340
about space or two to be able to

00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:59,540
contribute and typically then it's

00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:01,220
someone who works at a company that's

00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:02,840
going to use cloud foundry they go back

00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:04,520
to their company and take that knowledge

00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:06,530
with them and help spread it pair with

00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:07,790
people in their company and so it's kind

00:48:06,530 --> 00:48:09,890
of a new model hope

00:48:07,790 --> 00:48:11,660
to bring more companies and

00:48:09,890 --> 00:48:14,750
organizations into this open-source

00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:16,610
development model it also has its

00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:20,300
challenges like distributed work

00:48:16,610 --> 00:48:23,060
environments but and then we also added

00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:24,860
certification which is a new and it's

00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:26,510
not certification is it new but it's

00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:28,460
kind of new in terms of open source

00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:30,320
software and so we have these large

00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:32,120
companies that want to use quad foundry

00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:33,770
and they want to know that the version

00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:36,830
of cloud foundry that they're using is

00:48:33,770 --> 00:48:38,720
the cloud foundry and like if they they

00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:39,860
switch providers or they downloaded the

00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:42,050
open-source one that it would be the

00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:43,820
same thing and so we added certification

00:48:42,050 --> 00:48:45,110
and a bunch of our members were ever

00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:47,030
launched in december and are now

00:48:45,110 --> 00:48:49,220
offering cloud foundry certify our

00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:50,780
certified cloud foundry as part of their

00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:54,650
products like if you get swiss comets

00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:55,400
become certified cloud foundry here i

00:48:54,650 --> 00:48:56,990
talked a little bit about what

00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:58,490
certification means you have to certify

00:48:56,990 --> 00:49:01,010
the core you have to certify what like

00:48:58,490 --> 00:49:02,690
an extension is i'm so people developing

00:49:01,010 --> 00:49:04,250
api's and you download those api so they

00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:07,670
also certified do they run against the

00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:08,930
certified version and then i wanted to

00:49:07,670 --> 00:49:10,790
end them like I think there's three

00:49:08,930 --> 00:49:13,130
primary ways you can try out cloud

00:49:10,790 --> 00:49:14,390
foundry and so how many people before I

00:49:13,130 --> 00:49:16,160
tell the three ways I'm curious if

00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:18,170
you've already are here to learn about

00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:20,210
cloud foundry with the little that I

00:49:18,170 --> 00:49:21,740
managed to explain um if you were going

00:49:20,210 --> 00:49:25,810
to block out the door and go try to use

00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:25,810
it what's the first thing you would do

00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:31,850
you would look for crowdfunding on

00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:36,730
github you would install you install

00:49:31,850 --> 00:49:36,730
cloud founder itself what would you do

00:49:36,790 --> 00:49:44,650
you install Python cool write your own

00:49:39,470 --> 00:49:44,650
app anybody else

00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:50,600
uh-huh and create a demo account cool

00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:58,470
anybody else how many people would go

00:49:53,820 --> 00:50:00,840
try to install club oh yeah so do

00:49:58,470 --> 00:50:02,490
another trial account how many people

00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:07,500
would go try to install it themselves

00:50:02,490 --> 00:50:10,140
first and install our cloud foundry okay

00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:13,710
about maybe a third how many people

00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:16,080
would go sign up for trial account most

00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:17,640
people have people how many people would

00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:19,440
even if they're signing up for trial

00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:21,020
accounts go to github or the docs and

00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:23,730
read about cloud foundry eight there

00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:27,570
okay awesome thank you I'm doing my

00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:29,220
market research off you guys so it's

00:50:27,570 --> 00:50:32,040
relays to try it out already signed up

00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:34,290
for trial account so let me have a

00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:37,020
number of providers probably almost two

00:50:34,290 --> 00:50:41,070
handfuls of providers SI PE swisscom

00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:43,140
centurylink bluemix pivotal and a number

00:50:41,070 --> 00:50:44,910
of them have trial accounts so that's

00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:53,420
that's one way to try it out that's how

00:50:44,910 --> 00:50:53,420
I started it's really easy yeah

00:51:12,810 --> 00:51:18,040
that's a really good input and I asked

00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:19,600
before but just show me again how many

00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:23,050
people with eventually if you use it it

00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:24,640
install it in house now that you know

00:51:23,050 --> 00:51:26,800
what it is too yeah cool by eighty

00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:54,790
percent of you my very rough guesstimate

00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:58,360
you had a question yes yes or you could

00:51:54,790 --> 00:52:00,460
go to centurylink or pivotal and they've

00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:02,260
already done all that for you you sign

00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:04,210
in for an account and then on your

00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:07,450
command line interface you say you know

00:52:04,210 --> 00:52:10,030
you know link me to this pivotal or

00:52:07,450 --> 00:52:11,680
CenturyLink or bluemix instance and then

00:52:10,030 --> 00:52:16,360
you can just do your CF push from your

00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:18,040
machine and it they all have some sort

00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:20,920
of trial they all obviously have a

00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:22,300
business model off that so if you do run

00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:23,470
your app that way it's really easy and

00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:31,870
then you'll pay them our monthly fee of

00:52:23,470 --> 00:52:33,760
some sort yeah I I would find that

00:52:31,870 --> 00:52:35,440
unlikely but if you're a business you

00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:37,810
might because you're you want to know

00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:41,920
exactly how it all works and have it on

00:52:37,810 --> 00:52:43,360
your own hardware or whatever yeah so

00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:45,310
that's that's one option go sign up for

00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:47,800
the trial account the second one is

00:52:45,310 --> 00:52:49,480
downloaded play with it contribute it so

00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:52,360
a number of you said you would maybe do

00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:54,970
both but that's one way and when the

00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:56,830
third way that I had amid they're no

00:52:54,970 --> 00:52:58,420
longer work actively working on lattice

00:52:56,830 --> 00:53:00,460
but lattice had a lot of the

00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:01,870
technologies that cloud foundry did but

00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:03,310
it was kind of a standalone installer

00:53:01,870 --> 00:53:05,410
your laptop version so it's still a

00:53:03,310 --> 00:53:06,640
totally functional I mean it's kind of a

00:53:05,410 --> 00:53:07,750
good way if you know you're on your

00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:10,060
laptop this weekend here at the

00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:11,560
conference you can download baddest and

00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:13,720
play with it and kind of get a feel for

00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:15,460
quad foundry in a smaller package

00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:18,810
without having to install cloud foundry

00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:18,810
and all those dependencies and all that

00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:25,930
all in the docks yeah I mean the other

00:53:25,030 --> 00:53:28,390
way you can do is come to the cloud

00:53:25,930 --> 00:53:30,390
foundry summit like 2,000 people that

00:53:28,390 --> 00:53:32,800
all cloud foundry fans it's awesome

00:53:30,390 --> 00:53:35,380
maybe not as awesome as scale but pretty

00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:36,550
awesome and you can also come there and

00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:39,040
then around the world if you're not

00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:41,730
based here we have three of them one in

00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:44,140
Asia one in Europe one in the u.s. so

00:53:41,730 --> 00:53:46,510
any other questions that I can help

00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:51,100
anybody with or I can follow up with

00:53:46,510 --> 00:53:54,310
afterwards yes there will be wherever

00:53:51,100 --> 00:54:08,080
scale post them or also my slide share

00:53:54,310 --> 00:54:10,060
count any other questions and yeah so

00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:13,780
the ops the number of apps that are

00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:15,370
already built in as services so you can

00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:20,050
use MySQL you can use that spark

00:54:15,370 --> 00:54:21,700
database you can use um red is postgres

00:54:20,050 --> 00:54:23,980
you can use all the big ones are there

00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:27,180
and you can add your own if for some

00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:27,180
reason you wanted to yep

00:54:35,590 --> 00:54:39,980
so if you're an app developer and you're

00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:41,840
willing to use one of the services

00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:43,850
that's out there it's a really small

00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:45,380
learning curve so I'm not an active app

00:54:43,850 --> 00:54:46,880
developer anymore like I play every once

00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:48,740
in a while and I mean I literally

00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:50,870
figured it out I asked a few questions

00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:53,270
on the mailing list and got myself up

00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:56,900
with my first demo app within an hour I

00:54:53,270 --> 00:54:59,180
mean it's like really quick if you're

00:54:56,900 --> 00:55:00,740
installing it yourself in house then

00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:02,170
then you're going to need to train some

00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:05,120
people to be cloud foundry experts

00:55:02,170 --> 00:55:07,370
there's a number of consultancy

00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:09,350
companies that help out with that so I

00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:13,700
think the centurylink have consultants I

00:55:09,350 --> 00:55:16,070
help with the okay so pivotal the big

00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:17,540
companies do like piffle okay the big

00:55:16,070 --> 00:55:18,620
companies do like pivotal an IBM and

00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:21,500
also there's a bunch of smaller ones

00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:24,170
like all Tauros and ecs and and cod

00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:25,910
credo and it was a number of smaller

00:55:24,170 --> 00:55:28,100
companies that help and I was talking to

00:55:25,910 --> 00:55:31,190
the ecs guys and like when do you tell a

00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:34,010
client okay you now know enough like you

00:55:31,190 --> 00:55:36,170
can do it on your own so we're looking

00:55:34,010 --> 00:55:38,060
at at providing trainee we have training

00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:39,950
and we're looking at certifying

00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:41,600
individuals as cloud foundry experts and

00:55:39,950 --> 00:55:42,890
we're kind of trying to define like how

00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:44,440
many cloud foundry experts does a

00:55:42,890 --> 00:55:48,560
company need to feel like they're

00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:49,640
sufficient I'd say it's measured in

00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:52,060
months probably if you're going to

00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:55,060
install it yourself and use it in house

00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:55,060
yeah

00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:03,769
yes I like all the databases there's

00:56:01,849 --> 00:56:07,839
there's a number of services built into

00:56:03,769 --> 00:56:07,839
it is that what you're asking

00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:17,180
like

00:56:24,290 --> 00:56:28,130
yeah we there's been talk about that

00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:29,800
there's nothing as part of the core

00:56:28,130 --> 00:56:32,660
Cloud Foundry right now that's like I

00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:35,570
like an app store type thing that that

00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:38,270
doesn't exist yet all of the providers

00:56:35,570 --> 00:56:40,070
do add value add usually so they have

00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:42,020
cloud foundry and then they have their

00:56:40,070 --> 00:56:43,640
own gooeys and their own tools around it

00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:46,310
so if you're looking to use it you

00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:47,660
should evaluate bluemix force pivotal or

00:56:46,310 --> 00:56:50,840
so CenturyLink you should take a look at

00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:52,250
them but not we've talked about it

00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:53,660
because it would also be nice if there's

00:56:52,250 --> 00:56:55,310
an app store where individuals could put

00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:57,290
their apps and it didn't matter what

00:56:55,310 --> 00:57:09,260
cloud foundry they ran on but some

00:56:57,290 --> 00:57:11,150
places to highlight them yeah you can

00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:12,530
add your own languages um you can add

00:57:11,150 --> 00:57:18,950
your own databases you can add your own

00:57:12,530 --> 00:57:22,120
services yeah if we have cobalt we must

00:57:18,950 --> 00:57:24,830
have a lot of them but you can imagine

00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:26,780
any other questions anything you were

00:57:24,830 --> 00:57:32,420
hoping to get from this presentation

00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:35,770
that you haven't yet okay well I'm

00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:35,770
