hey everyone we're here two protons in a

00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:11,580
cloud a weekly live dialogue connecting

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,040
industry experts and influencers to the

00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:16,859
online technical community that's you

00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,560
you can join us every thursday for a

00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:21,539
virtual hangout we chat with our guests

00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,189
of the week about all things cloud and

00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:26,490
dig into projects they're passionate

00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:28,289
about sometimes we share demos always

00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:30,660
having a good laugh and trying to learn

00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:32,399
something along the way I major in craft

00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:35,790
one of your host and a technical

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:38,040
evangelist for HP Helion high and I'm

00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:41,820
Sergio my Cherie your second host and a

00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:44,940
dev evangelist at HP welcome right so

00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:47,610
today we're combining evangelism forces

00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:49,890
in talking with storming Peters today vp

00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:52,620
of technical evangelism at the cloud

00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:54,750
foundry foundation not only do we watch

00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:57,270
her cloud foundry Morning Edition every

00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:59,190
week but we've also participated in some

00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:01,350
great activities cloud foundry

00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:03,750
Foundation has put on like the doc

00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:06,180
sprint in san francisco in September and

00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:08,400
the cloud foundry summit in Berlin just

00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:11,040
this last week so we'll get an update on

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:15,360
what's been happening in her world and a

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:17,430
few CF scenarios and make sure you stick

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,830
around for this full episode at the end

00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:23,960
of this episode we are announcing our

00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:30,900
first HPE he lien app that's the hashtag

00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:34,460
Challenge winner yay exciting but first

00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:37,020
this week's headline Adrian so did you

00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:39,360
hear about Microsoft and redhat

00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:43,649
announcing a new hybrid cloud

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:45,270
partnership so red hat solutions will be

00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:47,850
available natively to Microsoft

00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:50,670
customers and in turn Microsoft will

00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:52,939
offer red hat enterprise linux as a

00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:56,670
preferred choice to enterprise customers

00:01:52,939 --> 00:01:59,040
so okay cool I mean that's that's

00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:02,009
obviously an impacted that's gonna be

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,049
for a long time yeah another Horseman is

00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:09,179
joining coming to the other so you know

00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:11,920
yeah it works so unrelated but a note on

00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:15,099
how the cloud has gone to Hollywood

00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:17,440
Us Weekly reports and I'm considering

00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:22,239
this a reliable news source today so

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:25,330
just humor me um gwen stefani and recent

00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:27,459
ex gavin rossdale and as their marriage

00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:29,980
after Glenn discovered proof of an

00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:32,020
affair between Gavin and the nanny from

00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:35,260
the family iPad that would sink to

00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:37,420
Gavin's phone so sinking your device's

00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:42,450
means the cloud knows all of your

00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:46,480
secrets oh yeah I don't for myself

00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:49,600
because of this invention right so and

00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:52,060
it's not all about enterprise all the

00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:55,180
time when we talk about cloud cornell

00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:58,120
university announced plans for five year

00:02:55,180 --> 00:03:00,069
which is a five million project funded

00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:03,130
by the National Science Foundation the

00:03:00,069 --> 00:03:06,519
plan is to develop the aristotle cloud

00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:08,830
Federation and because of the benefit of

00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:11,950
cloud computing is that it enables

00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:14,980
access to shared resources and

00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:19,239
information on demand and in simplified

00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:21,549
terms Aristotle eliminates the wait for

00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:23,590
resource availability locally so

00:03:21,549 --> 00:03:26,739
researchers can share the resources

00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:28,090
across institutional boundaries and this

00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:32,880
definitely would have been a great tool

00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:36,250
when I was working in academia so yeah

00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:38,650
moving on you know from a university to

00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:41,350
the government right the Korean

00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:43,600
government presented a blueprint for the

00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:47,440
promotion of cloud computing yesterday

00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:50,410
the roadmap outlines that the government

00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:53,320
will turn its IT centers into cloud

00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:57,069
computing centers and elevate the number

00:03:53,320 --> 00:04:00,130
of cloud companies to 800 and the cloudy

00:03:57,069 --> 00:04:03,239
user eight to thirty percent by 2018 and

00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:05,769
pretty cool because a few weeks ago and

00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:07,510
story announced that they joined the

00:04:05,769 --> 00:04:11,530
cloud foundry foundation so we're really

00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:13,389
keeping up with that CS momentum so kind

00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:16,690
of transitioning now we want to welcome

00:04:13,389 --> 00:04:18,519
stormy Peters as I said VP of technical

00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:20,440
evangelism at the cloud foundry

00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:23,140
foundation she has a long-standing

00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:25,060
career in educating and advocating for

00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:28,090
open source software

00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:30,250
stormy's led mozillas seven thousand

00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:31,600
strong developer network and has been a

00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:34,330
leader in the open source community

00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,940
effort through multiple positions and

00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:40,150
philanthropic projects so we're really

00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:42,970
excited and thank you stormy for joining

00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:45,760
us today I can see you're currently at a

00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:47,800
conference and head to Shanghai for the

00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,380
next moment in December so tell us a

00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,210
little bit about what you're up to

00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:53,650
thanks Adrian so just a couple weeks ago

00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:55,870
we were together at the cloud foundry

00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:58,990
summit in Berlin it's an awesome crowd

00:04:55,870 --> 00:05:00,669
and a lot of energy and right now i'm at

00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:02,740
the deep-fried conference in Broomfield

00:05:00,669 --> 00:05:04,150
Colorado so i'll just give you a view of

00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:07,570
what it looks like out the window here

00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:09,010
like it's a really great crowd i gave a

00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:11,380
keynote yesterday about cloud foundry

00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:13,300
and about how open source cloud software

00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:16,210
is really bringing the power of

00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:18,070
computing to everyone so not just big

00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:19,510
technology companies but also the

00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:21,520
companies that aren't traditionally

00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:22,960
technology companies and also the

00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,600
individuals and i gave them like a

00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:28,510
little the 30 second demo of how

00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,070
actually pushed a hello world app and i

00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:31,330
did that on screen so that worked out

00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:33,520
all right and there are lots of tweets

00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:40,300
it's a good crab awesome you're gonna

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:42,970
give CJ a run for his money all right so

00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:46,660
we'll kick into some questions for you

00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:49,300
store me CJ yeah so strongly as you

00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:52,810
mentioned right last week and see if

00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:55,060
somewhat Berlin where we heard Colin

00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:58,240
Humphries say in a ski note right that

00:05:55,060 --> 00:06:00,820
CF is not exciting it's what you can do

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,160
with the cloud foundry platform is

00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:07,240
exciting and as soon as you mentioned it

00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:09,580
we all noticed a kind of a cheer in the

00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:12,789
crowd and and quite a few number of

00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:16,210
tweets during the summit why do you

00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:19,840
think this resonated so well with the

00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:22,180
audience yeah I think first off I think

00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,710
most of us in technology like we like

00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:25,479
our gadgets we like our technology but

00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:27,039
we're really trying to do something with

00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:29,500
it like we have a goal and we think

00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:31,479
either it can help us make a difference

00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:33,039
or help change the world or can help our

00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:34,780
business be better but we have something

00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:38,560
we're trying to do with it and in the

00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:38,900
case of like cloud computing companies

00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,360
have

00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:42,470
teams of like 20 to 30 people that help

00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,900
them maintain all that infrastructure

00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:46,550
and what cloud foundry does is make it a

00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:48,289
lot easier to maintain that cloud

00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:50,750
infrastructure so now instead of a team

00:06:48,289 --> 00:06:53,000
of 20 or 30 dedicated to just like

00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:54,770
thinking it work you can have a much

00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,900
smaller team maintaining that platform

00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:58,340
and then your company can focus on all

00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:00,440
the value adds so all those people's

00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:01,759
time can be freed up to solve whatever

00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,560
problem it is they're trying to solve

00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:05,660
for the world so I think it resonated

00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,550
with everybody because like instead of

00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:09,320
like just trying to make the basics work

00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:11,389
all of a sudden like they all work

00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:13,030
fabulously and you can like focus on

00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:18,440
what you're trying to do for the world

00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:21,289
right right I absolutely agree to and in

00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:23,210
those use cases that were presented by

00:07:21,289 --> 00:07:25,220
some of the speakers you could really

00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:27,650
feel the enthusiasm so I'm right on

00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:30,860
board with with what you said and

00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:33,199
another note there was that unconference

00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:36,560
with with the short lightning talks on

00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:39,740
Sunday before the actual summit and a

00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:43,490
lot of the discussion during that was

00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:45,770
around docker and/or platform as a

00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:50,539
service so you being an evangelist

00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:52,400
what's your take on that topic I take on

00:07:50,539 --> 00:07:54,050
platform as a service is that the reason

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,210
I'm a cloud pottery is because I think

00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:57,919
we need an open source solution one that

00:07:56,210 --> 00:08:00,050
we can make sure it's accessible to

00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:02,270
everybody across the entire world across

00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:04,550
all economic differences are cost all

00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:06,590
types of companies and I think one of

00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:08,270
the messages we need to push as

00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:10,400
evangelist for Claude foundry and as

00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:12,349
developers is depend on it is a lot of

00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,900
people have realized the potential

00:08:12,349 --> 00:08:16,520
finally of containers so they realize

00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:18,199
that containers are really powerful and

00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:20,060
do some really awesome things and so

00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:22,340
they love containers and they talk about

00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:25,039
docker and what they don't always catch

00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:26,990
on to is that platform as a service uses

00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:29,449
containers as part of its components so

00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:31,880
Cloud Foundry has containers and one of

00:08:29,449 --> 00:08:33,620
those container types can be darker but

00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:35,810
it offers a whole bunch of other things

00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:37,700
around the containers to continue to

00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:39,800
help you like schedulers and optimizers

00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:42,380
so I think I think the message is like

00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,940
containers are awesome and you still

00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:47,029
need a bunch more features from the

00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:50,209
platform as a service offerings correct

00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:52,550
yep I think containers just won't exist

00:08:50,209 --> 00:08:54,950
by themselves and as you rightly said

00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:57,649
platform as the services the the whole

00:08:54,950 --> 00:09:02,269
enchilada or you know it offers more and

00:08:57,649 --> 00:09:04,850
beyond container so totally you you

00:09:02,269 --> 00:09:06,830
mentioned you know that you know cloud

00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:09,890
foundry and we all know is an open

00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:14,839
source project and and and it has been

00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:17,019
quite a journey so can you can you tell

00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:20,300
us how the cloud foundry cool team

00:09:17,019 --> 00:09:23,930
prioritizes the challenges the work give

00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:26,269
us an inside scoop of what a meeting is

00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:29,450
like you know when you guys said you

00:09:26,269 --> 00:09:31,610
know the core team sites yes there's not

00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:33,589
a single meeting or a single place where

00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:35,089
everything is decided but there but

00:09:33,589 --> 00:09:37,130
there's a really good structure so that

00:09:35,089 --> 00:09:40,040
you can follow it and the cloud foundry

00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:42,260
foundation is a nonprofit that has 53

00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:44,209
member companies and all of those member

00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:45,769
companies are either people that take

00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:48,170
cloud foundry and offered as a service

00:09:45,769 --> 00:09:51,680
such as AC average HP Helion and

00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:53,149
staccato to people or their users like

00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,350
people who depend on Cloud Foundry is

00:09:53,149 --> 00:09:56,300
proud of their business and want to be

00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:58,250
actively involved to make sure that

00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:00,980
their their needs are met in the

00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:03,170
platform and so the way we've done it in

00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:07,940
the code base is that each code each

00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:10,040
code base has like an owner that owns

00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:12,170
that piece of code and they work with

00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,910
all of the maintainer Xin that code base

00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:16,760
and then I believe they meet most of

00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:18,050
them meet on a weekly basis and some of

00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:20,060
them have moved there's actually get hub

00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:21,829
project that you can follow where you

00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:23,089
can follow all the notes from all of the

00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:24,890
weekly meetings from all of the

00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:25,850
technical components of Cloud Foundry so

00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,709
if you're interested in following the

00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:29,510
project it's a great way to get the

00:10:27,709 --> 00:10:32,149
notes it's called pmc notes i think is

00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:33,620
the name of the github project and then

00:10:32,149 --> 00:10:36,230
the leads from all of those different

00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:38,630
components meet in a community council

00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:40,730
meeting every tuesday morning every

00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:42,470
other week on tuesday morning and they

00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:44,270
talk about the status of their project

00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:45,800
and then they they compare notes to make

00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:47,570
sure there's not any issues they need to

00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,699
talk about the cross components so

00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:52,430
that's a PMC council meeting on tuesday

00:10:49,699 --> 00:10:55,790
mornings every other week i believe okay

00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:57,230
nicely yeah and i think there's an

00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:59,630
interesting it can add a little bit

00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:01,370
there one of the things that's really

00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:02,810
interesting about cloud foundry that's a

00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,649
little different than other projects and

00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:05,959
a little different than other

00:11:03,649 --> 00:11:06,370
open-source software projects is that we

00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:09,160
have these

00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:11,170
called dojos and so all of cloud founder

00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:13,060
is written in pair programming format

00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,290
where two people actually sit next to

00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:16,390
each other and write the code together

00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:18,180
and so if you want to become a cloud

00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:20,470
foundry committer at a full-time

00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:22,630
developer on the project you can

00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:24,490
actually go to a dojo and you go and you

00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:25,930
spend several weeks at this dojo pair

00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:27,910
programming with a more experienced

00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:29,440
developer and then at the end of it

00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:31,089
you're like a legitimate cloud foundry

00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,790
developer but it gives you this

00:11:31,089 --> 00:11:36,640
mentoring like on-site person-to-person

00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:39,760
mentoring process and those work across

00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:41,230
companies across projects so many of our

00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,450
member companies have dojos we have one

00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:46,510
of the foundation pivotal has one other

00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:49,510
members have one and it's a very unique

00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:52,420
way to get new contributors up to speed

00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:55,150
quickly on the project yes absolutely I

00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:57,640
saw that and you've got that program up

00:11:55,150 --> 00:12:00,160
on the website as well cloud foundry

00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:02,350
dork so it's reading through that is it

00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,480
correct you have four locations I think

00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:06,970
London Massachusetts and two in

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,500
California right now yeah the two in

00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:12,010
California would be the pivotal of the

00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:13,089
foundation when a message is CMC and we

00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:17,050
have several other members who are

00:12:13,089 --> 00:12:20,560
opening dojo so stay tuned super yeah

00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:22,810
well we're excited so awesome and

00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:26,170
another thing like I want to touch base

00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:29,260
on and you did do this at the summit you

00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:33,279
had a meetup for meetup leaders we love

00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:35,560
meetups sujay travels all over to

00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:37,930
present at them but I kind of want to

00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:41,529
get your take on what are some of your

00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:44,529
goals in order to grow this cloud

00:12:41,529 --> 00:12:46,330
foundry meetup community anything kind

00:12:44,529 --> 00:12:49,750
of come out from either the summit or

00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:52,930
stuff that you've been stewing on yes we

00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:54,670
think meetups are a really great way to

00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:56,230
reach people because there's like 150

00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:58,779
something meetups that have cloud

00:12:56,230 --> 00:13:00,910
foundry is one of their topics and each

00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:03,250
one of those meetup groups gets people

00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:04,839
together once a month and to have you

00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:07,029
know probably some pizza and drinks and

00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:08,080
to talk of you know to hear what

00:13:07,029 --> 00:13:09,610
somebody else has done with cloud

00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,620
foundry so a really great way to reach

00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:14,320
out to people and to give them a network

00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:15,520
to ask questions and to kind of hear

00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,900
from a more experienced person or

00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,640
somebody else who's also starting like

00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:20,020
how they could do things

00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:22,030
in the cloud foundry Morning Edition

00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:24,370
which is the podcast that I do every

00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:26,620
week um I actually asked a couple people

00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:28,450
at them at the summit how they do meet

00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:30,880
up so there was a great quote from

00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:33,040
someone who rent a meetup in a pub every

00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,630
month in London and the person that were

00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,100
in the unconference at the summit

00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:39,250
actually talked about how she does that

00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:41,260
Paula did from colic credo and so what

00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:43,420
I'm trying to do is help all these

00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:45,760
meetups be more successful and one of

00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:47,680
the things that's really a most heart is

00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,420
getting great speakers circulating

00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,560
because you know you ask your 10 friends

00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:52,420
that aren't cloud foundry and then how

00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,460
do you reach the next person I'm so we

00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:56,110
put together a speaker page with 12 bios

00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:58,240
if you're a speaker we'd love to have

00:13:56,110 --> 00:14:00,940
you know add you to that page and then

00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,470
we have some funding to help send send

00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,880
people to pay for their travel to go to

00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:05,530
different meetups around the world and

00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:08,260
its really creating this global

00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:10,780
community of over a thousand people

00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:15,550
that's just really awesome Wow very

00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:17,830
exciting so and and we were part of of

00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:20,710
the meetup evening you know which which

00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:25,480
was on the audience or Sky Lounge it was

00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:30,160
yeah so I think we are coming towards

00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:32,110
the end of our episode if and I want to

00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:36,220
ask this question to you so if you were

00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:39,040
to ask this one question to the

00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:40,480
developer community or or this one thing

00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:44,500
to the developer community what would

00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,970
that be from a foundation perspective so

00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,530
would be a question that I wanted to

00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:51,220
know from them or something I would like

00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:53,260
them to do like yeah maybe maybe

00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:55,090
something they want to do not a question

00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:58,510
they should do something you know uh

00:14:55,090 --> 00:15:00,520
what would that be yeah so my keynote

00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:02,980
yesterday at this comfort set defrag I

00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:05,890
asked everybody to explain to somebody

00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:07,240
else the power of the cloud so like what

00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:08,770
they can do on the cloud because it's

00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,630
really amazing you could write a

00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:12,640
HelloWorld app or whatever app you

00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:14,470
create and you can push it out there in

00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,910
like 10 minutes and then it's accessible

00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:17,560
to all your friends and family and

00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:19,900
everybody around the world and it can

00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:21,280
scale and that's just a crazy amount of

00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:25,270
power to put in the hands of individuals

00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:27,700
and so my request to developers would be

00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:29,170
go try it out like just go take your

00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:31,470
favorite hello world app that's here

00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:34,410
like standard test that you fall on

00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:36,870
and go push it out to HUD foundry and

00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:39,690
see how easy it is and then go explain

00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:41,070
to someone who's like a start-up or who

00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:42,480
has a great idea who might not be a

00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:44,280
technologist like explain to them the

00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,530
potential of being able to push out an

00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:49,500
app that then a platform like Cloud

00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:52,140
Foundry maintains 24 by 7 and scalable

00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,820
to millions you know without the

00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:56,520
developer having to do that work so that

00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:59,760
would be my ass per my request very

00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:03,240
clever nice nicely put definitely I

00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:05,160
think people can go and and our viewers

00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:07,080
I'll also request them go to Cloud

00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:09,450
Foundry Oregon and you know you will see

00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:11,130
a whole lot of instructions and steps

00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:13,250
which will hand hold you and you know

00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:16,470
you can get started pretty quickly so

00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:20,400
thank you again show me for that yeah so

00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:22,950
I think that was great and as always we

00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:24,810
really appreciate your time amid sitting

00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:27,300
in the hotel lobby at least you have the

00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:30,060
good view but are there any final nor

00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:32,400
note strumming on on maybe what you're

00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:34,640
up to or what we can expect in Shanghai

00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:37,470
that might resonate with our viewers

00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:40,830
yeah so the next Cloud Foundry summit is

00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:42,780
in Shanghai and it's the second and

00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:44,490
third of december i strongly encourage

00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:45,960
anybody in the area or even if you just

00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:47,790
want a trip to china to come join us

00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:49,680
because we have another awesome lineup

00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:51,270
of speakers we're looking at whether we

00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,550
