those overused technology terms in the

00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:07,319
world and before I get started on that I

00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:10,019
have a disclaimer i work for the clock

00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:11,309
on during foundation so i have a bias so

00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:13,679
a lot of my examples will need from

00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:15,360
Cloud Foundry but the reasons that I'm

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,890
not the cloud foundry foundation is

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,470
because I think we're at a pivotal

00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:21,480
moment if we don't make sure that the

00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,949
technology that we're creating the

00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,560
technology that's available to the

00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:27,750
entire world is open source and is

00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,580
accessible to everybody we're going to

00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:31,140
miss we're going to miss happen to know

00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,219
any of the human race we're going to

00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,680
miss out on some really awesome

00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:36,600
opportunities I think we already have

00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,760
them and we have people creating great

00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,290
things how many of you would turn around

00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,719
immediately if you left your phone at

00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:44,280
home because we've gotten so used to

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,160
having the world in our pocket and

00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,050
having access to everything a few years

00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,379
ago driving down the road with my son

00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:53,879
and he said mom what was my first word

00:00:51,379 --> 00:00:57,210
and I felt like a terrible mother I was

00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:58,440
like I don't remember and I said but

00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:01,140
it's okay I'll look it up and we get

00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:03,539
home I wrote it down and so we drive

00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:06,060
another mile or two and go so mom was my

00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:07,560
first word I'm like we're not home I

00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:10,320
can't look it up he's like we use your

00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:15,710
phone and I was like well I wrote it on

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:18,060
a piece of paper with a pen and so it

00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:19,890
super carrying so if someone even

00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,930
recommends a book to me I look up a Down

00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,250
amazon i asked my friends think i can

00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:25,229
follow where my friends are at every

00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:28,799
point in the world i can ask them for

00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:30,210
advice we can control not just our own

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,939
lives in our own computers we can

00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:35,159
control windmills we can control like

00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:37,409
touching in the ends up forest all this

00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:39,090
through our phones through the cloud and

00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:40,890
it's really important that we make sure

00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:42,990
that that's accessible to our kids and

00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:44,759
then they understand what they can

00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:46,880
create I'm so right now in the high

00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:48,439
schools they're teaching PowerPoint

00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,049
my older son glad to sign up for

00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:52,009
computer science and middle school and I

00:01:51,049 --> 00:01:53,780
said they're just going to teach you

00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:56,299
powerpoint and he says yeah I know my

00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:58,070
like computers and then I saw what they

00:01:56,299 --> 00:02:00,170
looked like what they did the PowerPoint

00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:02,119
like I didn't even know how I could look

00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:04,220
like that or create those kinds of music

00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:06,530
and slideshows and to imagine if they

00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:07,759
had taught them cloud computing imagine

00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:10,819
that they taught them that they could

00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:13,040
grab a use api's to grab data from

00:02:10,819 --> 00:02:14,530
amazon or for Edmunds redbook are from

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,489
the music playlist that they like

00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:17,780
imagine the mashups that they can make

00:02:16,489 --> 00:02:20,540
and the things that they could do

00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:22,700
because one of my friends use the API to

00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:24,440
pull data edmonds that serves the local

00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:26,480
classifieds and tell them when there is

00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:29,480
good car dealer in right away so just

00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,069
imagine what our kids could do and just

00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,510
imagine what kids in developing

00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:35,030
countries or adults in developing

00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:37,069
countries could do to create make their

00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:39,410
world a better place if we gave them

00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:42,290
access to this computing power so this

00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:45,590
is actually a group in I think it's

00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:47,030
Nigerian commute Nigeria not looking at

00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:49,340
the firefox slash bone that was all I

00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:51,200
made it's a completely web-based open

00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:54,470
phone and figuring out how it could

00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:57,049
impact their lives and so the world this

00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:58,700
world of cloud computing is here and

00:02:57,049 --> 00:02:59,810
we're creating awesome things and I

00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:02,000
think we just need to make sure that

00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:04,010
it's available not just the technology

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,290
companies not just to the large

00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:08,480
companies that can afford 20 or 30

00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:10,730
person teams to put the solution

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,459
together but it's available to all of us

00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:15,470
and I'm not going to say it's the year

00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:17,630
of cloud computing because how many

00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:20,660
people heard of the year of Linux

00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:23,000
desktop I heard it was the year of the

00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:25,549
Linux desktop in 2001 when I was

00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,100
bringing down the gun a desktop to a tu

00:03:25,549 --> 00:03:30,950
ex I heard it was the year the Linux

00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:33,739
desktop in 2007 when I went to run the

00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:36,110
kinetic foundation I heard it was the

00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:39,500
year in Linux desktop in 2010

00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:41,660
what a bubble worker but I don't think

00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:44,450
that any of those were wrong I think

00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:46,550
trying to define one year that is the

00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:48,440
year of a technology is not the right

00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:50,060
way to look at technology you need to

00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,950
look at the impact that it's having on

00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:54,110
the world of that given here so if you

00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:56,420
look at the Linux desktop how many

00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:58,670
people remember all pc how many people

00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:00,620
actually bought one give it to somebody

00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:02,540
they had this great program where

00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:04,250
they're going to bring a laptop to every

00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:06,110
child in the world for a hundred dollars

00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:08,240
and when they first launched you could

00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:10,850
buy two laptops for four hundred dollars

00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:12,920
they would send one to you and I would

00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:14,989
send one to some a kid in a developing

00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:17,450
country that needed it so my kids got

00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:19,250
someone else happened and they didn't

00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:20,450
succeed in the end in the way that they

00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:23,120
had they're still around are still

00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:25,610
working they didn't see what impact they

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,470
could have had but I do believe that

00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:30,140
they had a huge impact on the whole

00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:31,610
network a Chromebook industry but

00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:33,620
because before they announced their

00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:35,750
could make a hundred-dollar laptop with

00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:39,380
open technologies nobody else was aiming

00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:40,729
for that another impact that they had

00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:42,950
during all those years of the Linux

00:04:40,729 --> 00:04:45,110
desktop and was the Raspberry Pi and

00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:46,940
this is bringing technology into the

00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:48,919
hands of anybody you can buy a little

00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:50,870
raspberry pi kit for like forty dollars

00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:52,430
i think and you can create some awesome

00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:54,440
things with it so not only can you

00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:55,760
create a desktop that runs like you know

00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,919
you attach it to a monitor and a

00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:00,560
keyboard and it looks like a computer at

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:02,960
that price but you can also like attach

00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,820
it to your quintessential internet on

00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,350
your fridge you can touch it to look

00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,310
robot and touch it to your car you can

00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:09,620
do all sorts of really interesting

00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:11,540
things to it and this is something that

00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:13,460
we've taken to Mexico have a non-profit

00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:17,750
kids and repeaters and then let the kids

00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:19,570
that play with it build cool things and

00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:22,520
so there's been a lot of waves over time

00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:25,669
and I'm talking like the baby waves like

00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:30,050
mention of the Leo electricity the

00:05:25,669 --> 00:05:32,570
internet which goes for me huge the

00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:34,850
assembly line is like a wave this effect

00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:37,160
the idea factory work in the York from

00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:39,470
nine to five or seven to seven or

00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,660
whenever whole days with the work these

00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:43,520
technology waves don't just affect the

00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:45,560
technology that they have they affect

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,570
the way we live our lives so because

00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,979
they invented the assembly line how many

00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:50,330
of you still feel like you start your

00:05:48,979 --> 00:05:51,979
work about nine o'clock in the morning

00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:53,630
or seven o'clock in the morning and you

00:05:51,979 --> 00:05:55,550
work until five or six which you

00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:57,680
consider family time and that's not

00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:59,900
really the way our world could work

00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,979
these days but it's a legacy from a wave

00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:06,260
that came through and transform society

00:06:02,979 --> 00:06:09,020
and I think pod computing is one of

00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:10,910
those ways so the way that we that we

00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:12,289
accomplish things the way that we build

00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:14,810
things the way that we put them together

00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:16,580
is going to change the world so when you

00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:19,460
see happening in this next year or two

00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:22,310
is going to become the new normal for

00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:23,690
our children so to the year of the cloud

00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:26,000
in the sense that I think we're going to

00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:28,130
see the impact of bringing cloud to the

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,650
average person and to bring pods of

00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:33,260
technologies that are two companies that

00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:34,970
are not technology companies and we're

00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:36,289
already seeing it we're seeing people

00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:39,260
come together we're seeing companies

00:06:36,289 --> 00:06:41,300
come together and work together this is

00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:43,729
a list of cod foundry foundation member

00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:45,140
companies and what I think is

00:06:43,729 --> 00:06:47,750
interesting about those of you look at

00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:49,970
this five or six of them a handful of

00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:52,010
them actually take the pod founder

00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:53,960
software which is open source and they

00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:56,750
build on it and they offer services to

00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:59,150
their customers the rest of them are all

00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:01,580
users so the rest of them are companies

00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:03,140
that take the Condors software and use

00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:04,849
it within their business to change their

00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:07,400
business model in there across

00:07:04,849 --> 00:07:07,940
industries there's financial companies

00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,520
here

00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:12,140
there's if you take a look there's a

00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,970
broad range of different types of

00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,740
companies there's competitors in the

00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:17,990
list and they're all working together on

00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:19,610
those open source software is changing

00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:23,180
the way they do business and I'll give a

00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:24,800
few examples on later but how many

00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:26,810
people here are familiar with cloud

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,120
native apps is a tournament familiar

00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:33,530
team I mean people are familiar with

00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:37,220
micro services so this do this new way

00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:39,080
of working at the cloud brings with it a

00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:41,030
new way of thinking about how you solve

00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:42,590
your problem with technology so now

00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:44,660
you're creating little bits of

00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:46,790
technology that interact with each other

00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:48,560
it interacted the world and if one of

00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:51,050
them fails the rest of them go on and

00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,480
each one of them has access to all of

00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:56,090
those others so i think when our kids

00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:58,190
look at like a amazon they see like a

00:07:56,090 --> 00:08:00,650
great big legacy application like we

00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:02,990
used to build we think it's amazon they

00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:05,660
don't see that each piece of that the

00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:07,400
rating system the grocery cart all of

00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:09,230
those are being updated multiple times

00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,660
of senate and each one of those was

00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:13,700
independent so if a company like Amazon

00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:15,710
can do it their product imagine what a

00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:17,120
school system to do matter what use

00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:19,610
individuals working with your friends

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,440
could do you could offer up something

00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:23,510
you have some data that you have about

00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,100
your house or your neighborhood or who

00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:26,750
walks by or what parties you know about

00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,760
and I could interact with the whole

00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:30,919
ecosystem of data and a whole ecosystem

00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:34,430
of people in a much easier way to

00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:36,979
consume the Facebook and to be useful

00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:39,979
and as if that new way of thinking is

00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:41,090
what we need to teach people and we need

00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:43,430
to teach them that things can be

00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:46,160
scalable at a really massive scale and

00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:48,020
the individuals can create applications

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,260
that are scalable at a massive skin

00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:53,690
Madame exercise so this is a picture of

00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:55,400
the oktoberfest hall at munich how many

00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:59,140
who wants to guess how much beer they

00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:59,140
serve during oktoberfest

00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:08,860
lot 8 million liters 8 million liters of

00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:11,500
beer is like one week festival so we

00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:13,149
need is that you know there's some in

00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:15,370
the town of 5,000 here in Colorado how

00:09:13,149 --> 00:09:16,480
many people from Colorado how many

00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:18,490
people from out of state actually

00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,970
managed to make it here this filter mark

00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:23,769
huge snowstorm so in my town of 5,000

00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:25,990
people there are two micro breweries and

00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:28,570
12 story so it's obviously a cultural

00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:31,959
thing and you need to build a world

00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:34,420
where Whitney who runs the brewery free

00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:36,579
watching my house can dream at a scale

00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:38,589
of affecting if not creating 8 million

00:09:36,579 --> 00:09:40,269
liters of beer affecting the lives of

00:09:38,589 --> 00:09:41,950
eight million people and she does a

00:09:40,269 --> 00:09:43,959
pretty good job she actually creates

00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:45,459
fundraisers for the entire town we have

00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:47,800
parties on the park to raise money for

00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:51,550
Humane Society she's thinking big but we

00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:53,430
need people with really big and we need

00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:57,130
to think that even as a small company

00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:59,110
even as an individual they can be up 24

00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:01,209
by 7 with this new technology so they

00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:03,640
don't need a team of 20 to 30 people

00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:06,279
wearing a pager they can actually create

00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:10,209
solutions that run all the time and are

00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:12,160
available around the world and they need

00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:13,959
to think in terms of micro services so I

00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,149
was brainstorming a friend of mine that

00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:19,810
teaches computer science I'm Heidi Ellis

00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:21,550
about how we could build in api's into a

00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:23,740
computer science class to involve more

00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:25,540
people because if these middle school

00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:27,519
students are creating awesome mashups of

00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:29,680
PowerPoint I just can't imagine what

00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,600
also matched up it would create with a

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,190
little bit of JavaScript or Python

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:37,079
whatever they wanted to write it and

00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:37,079
access all the api's that are out there

00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:42,769
and right now when companies use a lot

00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:45,920
of cloud technologies they end up having

00:10:42,769 --> 00:10:47,480
to use a whole bunch of services so so

00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,420
when I started programming you got your

00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:52,850
desktop and maybe downloaded your

00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:55,220
programming language everything you had

00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:57,019
was on your desktop you compile it and I

00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:58,670
am actually I started in low-end server

00:10:57,019 --> 00:11:00,170
he had to go into the lab it uses but

00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:01,970
everything was pretty self-contained in

00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:03,529
your world now when someone starts to

00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:05,149
programming they have to sign up for

00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:07,100
three or four different services yet how

00:11:05,149 --> 00:11:08,660
probably to get started and then once it

00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:10,250
is fined up to 30 different for

00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:12,230
different services they need to make

00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:14,930
them work on well together and we take

00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:17,449
this you say you want to be 24 by 7 365

00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:19,430
days a year I'm you end up depending on

00:11:17,449 --> 00:11:22,070
a lot of different technologies and you

00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:24,139
end up with a team of you know 10 20 30

00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:25,820
people whose job is to make sure that

00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:30,019
the infrastructure underneath your

00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:31,130
application continues to run and so

00:11:30,019 --> 00:11:33,170
we're trying to do it cloud foundry

00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:35,449
that's the others doing as well is on

00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:36,980
the right TC technologies that have been

00:11:35,449 --> 00:11:38,930
coming up awesome open source

00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:41,209
technologies that do things like

00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:43,010
containers and schedulers and companies

00:11:41,209 --> 00:11:44,930
that are on the leading edge companies

00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:47,329
that are leading the charge have been

00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:48,649
taking these technologies and putting

00:11:47,329 --> 00:11:50,959
them together and make them work well

00:11:48,649 --> 00:11:52,370
together and as they do that we are

00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,870
trying to incorporate them into more of

00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:56,990
a prescriptive model and cloud foundry

00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:58,579
and so that it's available for everybody

00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:00,470
even those that don't have a team of

00:11:58,579 --> 00:12:02,300
people to put that together so you can

00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:04,490
just sign up for service for your app

00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:07,959
runs and all of that all of those

00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:10,970
services underneath are available to you

00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:12,199
so i'm going to show you will demo i'm

00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:14,209
not going to walk through the demo i

00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:16,490
took those little hello world script

00:12:14,209 --> 00:12:17,959
that I made I sign in right at I

00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:20,690
borrowed the HelloWorld script it's like

00:12:17,959 --> 00:12:22,000
a 10 mike loong and I signed up site

00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:24,220
into a cloud foundry

00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,470
and I pushed my hello world script out

00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:29,050
there and it put it out there in the

00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:31,030
internet in the cloud I was in a place

00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:33,430
where anyone can use their web browser

00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:35,500
to check out my hello world app I told

00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:36,880
it I wanted to scale so in case all of

00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:39,340
you the audience wanted to check out my

00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,320
hello world app it wouldn't crash and I

00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:43,570
did all this in like half an hour so if

00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:45,610
in half an hour I could create a hello

00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:47,710
world app that's available to anyone

00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:50,680
around the world no matter how many

00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:52,660
millions of people try to access it that

00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:54,420
available 24 by seven if it goes down

00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:57,130
and we'll come back up on its own

00:12:54,420 --> 00:13:00,040
imagine what we could do if we offered

00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:01,900
that all about love not just us in the

00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,880
room the technologists but all of our

00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:05,470
colleagues all of our children and all

00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:07,090
the people in the developing world if

00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:08,710
they could in half an hour take

00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:12,730
something that they do where they go and

00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:14,380
put it out there for everybody I'm

00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:16,300
coming with interesting note of like how

00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:18,640
it changes people's lives in different

00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:20,710
countries at Mozilla we were doing

00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:23,530
interviews of people who might be using

00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:25,530
Firefox OS phones and we interviewed

00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:28,330
someone who was a hairdresser in India

00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:30,610
in which she had a client she would take

00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:32,680
a picture of their hair after she

00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:34,660
finished cutting their hair and then she

00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,500
would wait three weeks or four weeks or

00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:37,720
however long you're supposed to go

00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:39,850
between haircuts and then she would send

00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,930
them a picture of their haircut and say

00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:43,660
would you like to get your hair cut

00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:45,010
again so people need these solutions we

00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:48,640
just need to give them the right tools

00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:51,640
and tell them what's possible I'm so as

00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:53,710
you can see this give the I pushed my my

00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:55,960
little simple hello world app and then

00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:58,230
they can go to the browser and I can put

00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,230
it up there

00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:04,990
and anyone could see could see my app

00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:06,700
actually think i deleted it like i do

00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:10,720
all my gentle off so you can't actually

00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:13,960
go there right now but and then I scale

00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:16,030
it to more users so if I could if I can

00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:17,650
do this in half an hour in great I know

00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:19,390
how to write code so i know how to write

00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:20,290
my home world app but i learned all that

00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:21,940
you know you can do all the cloud

00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:23,680
project stuff and just a half an hour

00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:25,540
imagine what we could be teaching kids

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,190
in school and what we can be teaching

00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:31,570
small startups to do without having to

00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:34,750
hire out all that expertise so i'm going

00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:36,340
to try to skip the rest of us so i

00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:38,110
thought i told you to give a couple of

00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:40,360
examples is there confound your examples

00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:42,310
are the ones i know we just had a

00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:44,860
conference in Berlin where we had four

00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:46,660
hundred and seventy people or show that

00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:49,860
are using cloud foundry show up to talk

00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:52,450
about it in one of the examples that are

00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:54,310
mikuni a consulting help somebody gave

00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:56,350
us it's comic relief how many people

00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:58,090
know comic relief many hide ribbons it's

00:14:56,350 --> 00:15:00,130
kind of like it's a big nonprofit

00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:04,120
charity in the UK and kinda like a Red

00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:06,460
Cross is here and comic relief does one

00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:08,830
big fundraiser in here and they have a

00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:11,140
seven hour window in which they raised a

00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:13,330
billion dollars so they work with the

00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:15,760
local TV channels and without seven hour

00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:18,580
window they talk comic relief push comic

00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:21,190
relief and they get 800,000 donations

00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:24,490
not seven hour window delayed dollars up

00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:26,350
to 400 transactions a minute and so they

00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:28,120
need they need to work all year to make

00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:30,370
sure that the seven hour window is up

00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:31,870
and they actually they take medicines to

00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:33,640
babysit developing countries they do

00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:34,700
also stuff with the money once they've

00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:37,040
gotten it

00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:39,020
and so the small consultancy is actually

00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,510
created the guy actually created it

00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:43,520
Timothy savage to help them and it's a

00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:44,870
team with like four or five people in a

00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:47,570
couple days they set them up with Khan

00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:50,450
foundry to be able to process 100

00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:52,220
transactions a minute a you know a

00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:54,590
billion dollars with a seven hour window

00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:56,960
and so a very small team was able to get

00:15:54,590 --> 00:16:00,190
this nonprofit in a place where they

00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:05,930
could have a global scalable reliable

00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:08,420
infrastructure another example where we

00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:10,580
see cloud technologies going into areas

00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:12,320
that are typically not technology

00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:14,870
companies that typically haven't used

00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:17,180
technology come technology in the most

00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:19,250
efficient ways possible is the

00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:20,780
industrial Internet and GE is one of

00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:23,030
these players there was a Harvard

00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:24,890
Business Review article I've done on how

00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:26,930
they use the cloud to reanimate their

00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:29,090
business but when they did their initial

00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:30,830
they did like an initial survey of all

00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:33,770
the software they had and they have like

00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:35,450
139 different software products of which

00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:38,240
like less than twenty-five percent were

00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:39,860
were profitable so they went through and

00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,870
said you know what what can we do how

00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:43,490
can we change how we do things in the

00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:45,830
end and upgrading our protocol predicts

00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:47,480
on top of cloud foundry and that enables

00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:49,910
them to continuously innovate

00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,740
continuously push out new changes in a

00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:53,180
way that the developers don't have to

00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:55,040
worry so much about the infrastructure

00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:56,960
underneath so their team maintaining the

00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,940
infrastructure smaller and the software

00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:01,100
teams that they have on can push out

00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:03,680
solutions more quickly and the

00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:05,180
industrial Internet is kind of out of

00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,770
the new buzzword how many people then

00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,970
must dustrial internet you didn't even

00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:10,520
have to raise your hand so many times

00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:11,990
during this talk

00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:14,510
let's listening to a podcast of the land

00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:17,410
this is things like sensors in the

00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:20,420
middle of the Amazon that have to

00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:22,640
monitor or someone's poaching what

00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:24,350
department looks like if the rivers

00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,910
running and so these things live up

00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:28,070
there without a battery charge for

00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:29,990
several weeks or several months and they

00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:31,760
need some kind of networking connections

00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:34,400
back to a station that might be several

00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:36,260
miles away ge in particularly been

00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,970
working a lot on objects like windmills

00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:40,190
so you've seen the great big white

00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:43,490
windmills we have some in Colorado

00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:45,020
pilots when we live and those windows

00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:47,120
can be made much more efficient if you

00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:48,500
put a lot of sensors on them I'm sensors

00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,420
that know how well they're functioning

00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:52,610
if they need to be serviced how how much

00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:55,190
the wind is going and they see huge

00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:57,350
leaps and productivity by attaching the

00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:59,930
internet basically to these sensors to

00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:02,420
all these different industrial

00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:04,670
applications and then feeding all that

00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:06,170
data back into the crowd and letting

00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:08,540
people play with that data or letting

00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:10,550
the system partially that data and it's

00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:12,170
really changing a business where

00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:14,960
technology was a necessity but

00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:17,600
technology wasn't a competitive

00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:20,570
advantage in any way and nowadays and

00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:23,150
this is from a conference I went to a

00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:25,460
couple weeks ago SI p Tekkit and they

00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:27,440
were showing how the cloud has helped it

00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:28,790
has helped many of their customers so

00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,590
you think see things like you know

00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:33,230
reports they take four hours take two

00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:35,450
seconds ITV reduced by eighty percent

00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:37,490
which makes IT nervous that there's lots

00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:40,850
of work for IT people to do so their

00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:43,160
worries and saving days of planning so

00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:45,110
you're seeing that the impact of being

00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:47,390
able to have applications that are

00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:48,950
scalable reliable and use these micro

00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:51,020
services that are much smaller much more

00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:53,320
maintainable I'm having impact across

00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:55,419
businesses

00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:56,590
into this new app central they don't

00:18:55,419 --> 00:18:58,509
mean like apps like you have on your

00:18:56,590 --> 00:19:00,730
phone but like apps in the sense that

00:18:58,509 --> 00:19:03,190
they are small like their services that

00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:05,380
run on the internet which could be on

00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:08,019
your phone is a new way of thinking for

00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:09,610
people and it's often challenging if

00:19:08,019 --> 00:19:11,620
you're used to writing legacy software

00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:13,809
applications where your application is

00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:16,240
everything about the world is in it does

00:19:13,809 --> 00:19:18,519
it state it knows its data in those

00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:21,490
dependencies it has it's all in the same

00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:23,500
place moving from that huge legacy I

00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:25,690
know everything about myself to a world

00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:28,179
where you do your task can you pull data

00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:30,100
from other places and you query the

00:19:28,179 --> 00:19:31,629
world to find out what a state is a hard

00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:34,389
transition from people it's a hard

00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:35,769
transition for normal humans and it

00:19:34,389 --> 00:19:39,789
creates this new culture that would call

00:19:35,769 --> 00:19:41,649
continuous integration so we see in

00:19:39,789 --> 00:19:43,570
companies in this new model you have to

00:19:41,649 --> 00:19:46,419
continuously innovate new ideas

00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:48,909
continuously deliver I forget I think

00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:50,710
Amazon rolls out their website like

00:19:48,909 --> 00:19:52,539
multiple times per second so that

00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:53,950
website is always changing if you hit

00:19:52,539 --> 00:19:56,019
refresh you can prolly can't see what it

00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:57,909
is but it's changing and then they have

00:19:56,019 --> 00:20:00,250
to continuously integrate all the new

00:19:57,909 --> 00:20:02,259
code that their writing and everyone

00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:03,970
knows how to think about new ideas most

00:20:02,259 --> 00:20:05,830
software shops have figured out how to

00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:07,750
integrate to the new ideas into the code

00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:10,210
where it gets hard as the delivering

00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:12,340
part updating your website putting up a

00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:14,590
new stuff making sure you've tested it

00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:17,110
making sure that the security team is

00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:18,730
happy with it and so what we see is

00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:21,759
people fall into what we call the water

00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:23,620
scrum call those are using used to

00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:25,360
software development with waterfall

00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:27,429
model and the scrum method which is

00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:30,179
Angela some water scrub fall it looks

00:20:27,429 --> 00:20:30,179
kind of like this

00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:35,230
one of my kids really puzzles over this

00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:38,830
like why was it just do this picture why

00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:42,040
had somebody did this and so we need to

00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:43,360
see the new cloud model as helping to

00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,950
solve that problem so you take these

00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,500
cloud native applications which are

00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:49,720
micro services in containers you know

00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:52,480
reliable scalable and combine that with

00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:54,309
this continuous delivery of ideas that

00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:57,940
companies have that's when you can

00:20:54,309 --> 00:21:00,910
really create this new world it's a new

00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:03,760
world that's ephemeral scalable agile

00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:06,130
people and individuals and companies

00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:08,350
even move quickly and it runs in what we

00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:10,390
call this cloud with this internet it

00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:11,380
supports a whole multitude of devices so

00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:14,559
you no longer have to worry about

00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:16,690
holding iPhones or androids are thrown a

00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:18,940
curve drawn linux and it connects still

00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:22,440
to all of the legacy data that the

00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:26,200
companies might have um through apic and

00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:27,670
it's it's changing our culture and I

00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:31,450
think we need to make a culture change

00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:33,490
to make it happen so Calvin Conway one

00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:36,100
of the fathers of computer science and

00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:38,980
said that any organization that defines

00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:41,110
a system will produce a design

00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:42,940
structures a copy of that structures

00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:44,650
communication structure however you

00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:45,640
communicate your organization if you go

00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:47,770
to create something you're going to

00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:49,030
create something that looks like that so

00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:52,809
if you have your developers on one side

00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:54,970
your IT on one side your your data

00:21:52,809 --> 00:21:57,580
another your end product is going to

00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:59,500
also communicate that way and so if

00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:02,020
we're looking for small mobile

00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:04,809
applications then we need to have small

00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:06,970
mobile teams and so I believe it I

00:22:04,809 --> 00:22:08,559
talked about Emma's alive with names on

00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:11,890
person who came up with the two Pizza

00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:15,010
team model so any team that cannot be

00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:16,390
fed by two pizzas is too big and this

00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:17,539
really depends on who's on your team

00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:19,369
because if you haven't

00:22:17,539 --> 00:22:22,729
son you could have a two-person team

00:22:19,369 --> 00:22:26,090
with the two Pizza team but that is and

00:22:22,729 --> 00:22:28,489
you have probably a 44 27 person team

00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:30,859
and that way I'm you create something

00:22:28,489 --> 00:22:32,330
that's small enough to be agile it small

00:22:30,859 --> 00:22:34,100
enough that it needs to interact with

00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:37,190
others to get its data it doesn't do

00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:38,509
everything itself and it creates this

00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:40,100
culture of DevOps where you have

00:22:38,509 --> 00:22:42,889
developers operators working together

00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:44,690
not huge teams of operators maintaining

00:22:42,889 --> 00:22:46,039
an infrastructure that huge team is a

00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:47,149
developer to rely on you get the

00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:50,149
developers the operators working

00:22:47,149 --> 00:22:52,099
together in the mega rates this

00:22:50,149 --> 00:22:54,830
mentality that we should all have and

00:22:52,099 --> 00:22:57,529
that we should push to our kids to our

00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:59,720
friends this idea that you should be

00:22:57,529 --> 00:23:02,149
able to say here's my source code run it

00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:03,769
in the cloud for me I don't carry out so

00:23:02,149 --> 00:23:06,109
when I roam in the hole hello world app

00:23:03,769 --> 00:23:08,299
that right on the web browser I didn't

00:23:06,109 --> 00:23:10,369
ask the system that I log into so I how

00:23:08,299 --> 00:23:12,320
are you pushing my app and what database

00:23:10,369 --> 00:23:14,029
you're using use and what interest you

00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,039
should have to worry about that you as

00:23:14,029 --> 00:23:17,299
an application developer are you as a

00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:18,889
small business owner that wants to

00:23:17,299 --> 00:23:20,119
create an application you should be able

00:23:18,889 --> 00:23:23,059
to create the functionality that you

00:23:20,119 --> 00:23:25,549
want and then just hand it over and it

00:23:23,059 --> 00:23:29,299
should automatically be 24 by 7 than

00:23:25,549 --> 00:23:32,090
reliable and that hasn't been possible

00:23:29,299 --> 00:23:33,679
until this year maybe last year so

00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:35,749
that's if there's a year of the cloud

00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:39,139
that's this change that we can rely on

00:23:35,749 --> 00:23:40,999
that it is awesome competitors working

00:23:39,139 --> 00:23:42,859
together individuals working together in

00:23:40,999 --> 00:23:44,179
an open-source fashion and we're seeing

00:23:42,859 --> 00:23:46,309
a lot of open source software patches

00:23:44,179 --> 00:23:48,379
the whole stack is open source to

00:23:46,309 --> 00:23:50,509
support this so this was my this is like

00:23:48,379 --> 00:23:52,220
Linux right linux made was a huge game

00:23:50,509 --> 00:23:53,690
changer because it brought a lot of

00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:56,570
individuals with a lot of companies

00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:58,150
together or a lot of things for a

00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:59,920
picture

00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:02,080
so we see these companies working

00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:06,040
together in their creating an entire

00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:07,480
stock so it you can use open source

00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:09,790
hardware you can use open source

00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:11,800
databases you can use open source across

00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:14,140
the entire stack which really means that

00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:16,060
anyone can participate and anyone can

00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:18,160
depend on it without worrying that they

00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:21,100
have to pay a provider or that they have

00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:22,720
to depend on that company want to speak

00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:24,670
in Europe people are actually really

00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,320
worried about depending on one US

00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:28,000
company that actually makes them really

00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:30,490
worried there's just an example I have

00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,650
in mind but they don't want to base the

00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:34,780
whole business on depending on a product

00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:36,760
from one US company in this open source

00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:39,310
model all of that dependency spread out

00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:40,870
a lot of different companies and what I

00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:43,600
think it's interesting about this slide

00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:45,940
is that these logos are all logos from

00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,650
projects if I have with the slide up ten

00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:49,990
years ago all of these would have been

00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:51,850
logos from companies and now there are

00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:53,980
all the logos of projects had lots of

00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:59,230
companies participating in them so the

00:24:53,980 --> 00:25:01,180
world has already changed and we see big

00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:02,470
companies saying that this is helping

00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:05,380
them it's helping prevent a vendor

00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:07,390
locket and it's creating a whole new era

00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:09,340
that we get to shake the way we want to

00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:10,990
begin you know we need to be where every

00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:12,640
pic like the assembly line what impact

00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:15,370
we're having for decades ahead of us on

00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:17,110
the 925 schedule we're bringing the

00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:19,240
Internet to everything not just to our

00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:22,000
refrigerators but to the large windmills

00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:23,830
on to our shoes like everything is going

00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,420
to be plugged in to this internet and

00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:27,570
that data is going to be available for

00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:30,700
people to create really awesome things

00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:32,950
thanks for people from our middle

00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:34,930
schoolers up to people running small

00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:37,150
businesses and that's causing us to

00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:39,700
shift our behavior and our businesses

00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:42,010
are going to match the things that these

00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:43,510
things that we create are going to notch

00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:45,910
what what are you and behavior

00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:47,410
needs and one of the problems that one

00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:49,050
of the earlier speakers was very similar

00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:52,000
quote her numbers are a little different

00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:54,220
but since two thousand fifty two percent

00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,890
of the fortune 500 or no longer coolest

00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:59,530
so they didn't make this transition to

00:25:56,890 --> 00:26:01,420
continuous innovation so this is a book

00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:02,590
by Buena Gunther McGrath and so at this

00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:05,020
point I always pull out my phone and

00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:06,400
search on amazon in the cloud my dad and

00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:08,500
I had good ratings speaker was

00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:11,620
recommending something good but she says

00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:14,170
that the world where a company figured

00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:16,360
out that their inch was and you know

00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:18,610
like HP i can pick on HP Network today

00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:20,290
it's like HP figured other than she was

00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:21,670
printing a long time and they were

00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:23,410
really good at making printers and

00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:26,620
really good at making inc pay the money

00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:27,790
off the ink and so they made them when

00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:29,440
you have the ink and they didn't better

00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:31,060
than anybody else and so they just kept

00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,670
making printers at eight and they

00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:35,260
dominated that that's no longer

00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:37,240
the way businesses can function in the

00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:39,190
future so you can no longer pick a ditch

00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:40,240
and just solve that niche you will go

00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:42,190
out of business you'll be one of the

00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,050
fifty two percent of your business the

00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:46,150
world of the future is figuring out what

00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:48,940
your customers needs in evolving with

00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:50,650
them so if your customers are are buying

00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:53,260
lots of books but they want mark ebooks

00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:54,520
or they're using netflix and they want

00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:56,110
to watch movies in a different way or

00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:57,970
they want to watch different content the

00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:59,860
key to the future is evolving with your

00:26:57,970 --> 00:27:01,570
customers and being able to figure out

00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:04,330
what they need so being able to

00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:05,950
communicate with them it says that's

00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:07,660
what companies are doing what about

00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:09,010
individuals we need to make sure that

00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:10,750
fifty two percent of our high school

00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:12,250
graduating class doesn't end up not on

00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:14,770
the fortune 500 list or whatever it is

00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:16,000
for individuals I mean to make sure that

00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:18,460
even though they didn't get a computer

00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,080
science degree that they understand the

00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:21,990
power that's out there and available to

00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:24,270
them

00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:25,470
this is not individuals like those high

00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:27,030
school students but one of the things

00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:28,590
we're going to confound reads trying to

00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:30,420
make sure that the non technology

00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:31,890
companies and so the industry that

00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:34,140
typically would not play in creating

00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:36,660
software that they get a voice so this

00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:39,179
was a room full of this is a room full

00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:40,770
of bankers in the army and they're

00:27:39,179 --> 00:27:43,590
talking to us about their requirements

00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:44,940
for quadcopter nobody told me before I

00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:48,510
went that you were supposed to wear a

00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:50,550
blue button-up shirt my gentle meeting

00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:51,510
in New York so I was the only woman and

00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:57,090
the only one not wearing a blue

00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:59,490
button-up shirt I'm so i pod foundry we

00:27:57,090 --> 00:28:01,380
see a world of cloud computing that's

00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:04,530
ubiquitous and flexible so it supports

00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:06,690
private and public clouds it's portable

00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:08,490
and interoperable so it it should be

00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:10,590
able to move wherever users or

00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:12,690
developers need it to move and if you're

00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:14,370
on one cloud and for some reason you

00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:15,480
need to move to your own hosted cloud or

00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:17,760
to a different host you should be able

00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:19,500
to do that I mean it's vibrant and

00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,780
growing so with the whole world to be

00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:23,670
participating in this continent and

00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:25,380
helping us to find what it means to run

00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:27,750
things in the cloud and how does that

00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:30,929
impact what you can do and what your

00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:32,490
neighbors can figure the human

00:28:30,929 --> 00:28:34,410
communities are really important part of

00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:36,809
this because technology is created by

00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:39,300
humans our future is created by humans

00:28:36,809 --> 00:28:41,160
and we see a human community that's a

00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:43,500
pragmatic so very practical trying to

00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:45,900
solve real problems we see a human

00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:47,610
community that's really diverse we can't

00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:49,170
leave anybody behind or we're going to

00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:51,660
create solutions that are not all they

00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:53,190
can be and we see a community that's

00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:57,510
very respectable that listens to each

00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:58,990
other and helps each other out and it's

00:28:57,510 --> 00:29:02,270
a global phenomena

00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:04,040
so any talk you go to I believe you

00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:06,230
should take away one thing are you

00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:08,150
wasted in the half hour of your life so

00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:11,960
take a moment here to reflect what's the

00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:13,520
one thing you heard me say they kind of

00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:16,550
in an AHA or will make you think of

00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:20,270
something later and then I haven't asked

00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:23,120
of you think of one way that you could

00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:25,580
do something today preferably today or

00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:27,950
tomorrow that would help us show the

00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:30,050
power of this new Internet cloud

00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:31,940
computing world to somebody who might

00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:33,200
not realize it and that one thing maybe

00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:36,950
a conversation you're going to have

00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:39,140
tonight / beer it could be you're going

00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:40,960
to go into your child's class next week

00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:43,400
and talk to them about what you do and

00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,990
you know maybe show them code.org or

00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,220
something but think of one thing that

00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:48,350
you're going to do to help bring this

00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:51,920
power of the cloud to somebody who might

00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:53,090
not realize it they'd like you to turn

00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:55,040
your neighbor and tell them what that

00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:57,800
one thing is i'm going to give you like

00:29:55,040 --> 00:30:01,480
30 seconds you actually it's a turn to

00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:01,480
your neighbor and tell me what i want it

00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:22,020
all right thank you very much I will be

00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:25,490
around the lake and around four beers so

00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:25,490
I will ask you what your one thing was

00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:33,200
