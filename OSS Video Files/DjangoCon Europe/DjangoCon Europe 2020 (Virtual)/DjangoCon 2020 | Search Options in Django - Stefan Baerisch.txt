"Search Options in Django" by Stefan Baerisch

I like websites with search bars. If the search function works well, I can enter a few words and get a list of results, with the things that interest me at the top. Whether you use it as a help system or for product information, search functionality can add a lot of value to a Django application. But implementing proper search functionality is not easy. Django offers multiple ways to implement search functionality, each with its advantages and disadvantages. This talk will give you an overview of the different ways in which you can implement search functionality in Django. We will look at the full-text search options that come with databases and the use of a dedicated search engine like Elastic Search or Postgres. Along the way, you will learn about the different ways in which you can index your data to learn how to evaluate your search results.
