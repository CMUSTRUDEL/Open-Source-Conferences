hello everybody my name is mark smith

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,200
although i'm

00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,480
known as gd2k pretty much everywhere

00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,400
online um

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,080
and this is my talk how to get on the

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,680
stage and what to do when you get

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,760
here so early last year i submitted this

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,760
talk to djangocon europe and i was very

00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,160
excited about getting to visit porto

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,680
i love portugal i took this photo in

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,000
lisbon a couple of years ago and i

00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:33,200
learned to surf in portugal last year

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,320
and then covert 19 hit so i'm still at

00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,800
home in edinburgh

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,440
and not only that i'm giving a talk

00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,520
called

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,640
how to get on this stage and what to do

00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,440
when you get here

00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,640
and there's no stage and there's no here

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,640
um

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,920
but and i'll be using the word stage a

00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,719
lot during this talk

00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,440
but almost everything that i say applies

00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,360
equally

00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,879
um to the world of virtual conferencing

00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:58,719
and doing these things over zoom and

00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:00,800
other video conferencing platforms

00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,640
so this is my fourth djangocon europe

00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,479
and my eighth django conference all

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,680
together but i'm not really a django

00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,360
developer

00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,520
but i love the community and i really

00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,119
wanted to speak and i do know something

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,600
about public speaking

00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,600
i'm a developer advocate for mongodb

00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,280
which means my job is to educate and

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,560
inspire developers with what they can do

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,560
with mongodb

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,799
and to speak as the voice of the

00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,840
developer when talking to

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,360
engineers within mongodb and normally

00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,720
when there isn't a worldwide pandemic

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,240
problem i'd be speaking about different

00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,159
technical topics at one or two

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,920
conferences a month

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,840
and i'm not an amazing speaker but

00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,159
public speaking over the last few years

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,680
has changed my life i've traveled all

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,079
around the world and i've given talks in

00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,000
many

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,600
places and i've met so many people from

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,200
this community

00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,240
and it's always nice to be part of that

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,520
community and to be able to give

00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,360
something back

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,720
and in the past few years i've been

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,439
hosting the lightning talks

00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,960
at euro python and pycon uk and my

00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,799
predecessors

00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,799
used to fill the time by telling jokes

00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,680
in the case of harry percival

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,520
telling one joke across all of the gaps

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,200
between all of lightning talks over two

00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,160
or three days

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,599
but i don't know any jokes and i looked

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,360
some up online and they weren't very

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:12,319
funny and i thought well what am i going

00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,000
to talk about

00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,280
in these gaps while people are setting

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,040
up their laptops in between these

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,920
five-minute talks

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,319
and i thought well public speaking has

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,879
been

00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,720
such a great thing for me that i could

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,120
encourage people to give a lightning

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,520
talk

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,959
really the whole purpose of lightning

00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,000
talks is to encourage

00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:34,560
new speakers to speak

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,560
which hopefully leads to them submitting

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,400
talks to the call for proposals at a

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,840
later conference and giving full-length

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,879
talks on things that

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,319
maybe only they know

00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:46,400
so i thought i would turn some of my

00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:48,160
little lightning talk pet talks into a

00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,760
full-length talk with some structure

00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:54,480
and that's what this is

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,599
so giving a talk at a conference like

00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,840
djangocon europe can be broken down into

00:02:56,599 --> 00:03:00,959
approximately

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,400
five stages the first is that you submit

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,519
a proposal

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,640
and that proposal will be accepted and

00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,800
at which point you then

00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,120
write your talk and build your slide

00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,879
deck if you're using one

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,480
and then you practice and you practice

00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,280
and you practice and i will come back to

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,319
this

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:21,200
and then you perform you give your talk

00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,400
um you step onto the stage and behind

00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,920
the lectern and

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:28,400
um you explain or expound or inspire

00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,640
a group of developers about things that

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,799
you know or things you've experienced

00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,560
and then finally you get to bask in the

00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,799
glory of a job well done and the

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,840
admiration of your peers

00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,360
but before you start this first step of

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,799
submitting a proposal to a call for

00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,440
proposals

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,159
um there is uh one there are a couple

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,319
more steps

00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,239
and the first one is you need to decide

00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,599
to give a talk i don't think anybody has

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,159
ever submitted a proposal to a

00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,040
conference

00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,920
without first deciding that they want to

00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,280
give a talk

00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,560
and i'm not going to cover this right

00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,519
now i'm going to come back to i'm just

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,000
going to assume at the moment that

00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,640
you're going to be

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,920
so inspired by this talk that you've

00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,239
already decided

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,680
that you want to give a talk so once

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,200
you've decided you want to give a talk

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,319
you need to work out what you're going

00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,000
to talk about and this

00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,519
in many ways is the difficult thing

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,519
because it relies on

00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,799
inspiration and inspiration is not one

00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,519
of those things you can necessarily

00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:21,359
control

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:23,280
but you can help it along so

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:25,120
i recommend keeping a notebook of some

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,720
kind it can be a physical notebook or it

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,040
could be a text file

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,240
or a google doc or some notes

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,040
application that you already have on

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,720
your phone

00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,960
um and just every time you come to come

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,800
up with an idea um of a talk that you

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,320
could get of a give a conference

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,840
write it down make sure that you don't

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,440
lose it even if they're bad ideas

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,759
keep a list of every idea that you come

00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,240
up with um

00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,840
think about the things that you know or

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,360
the things that you've experienced that

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,560
maybe aren't so widespread

00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,840
that you could explain or describe to an

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,360
audience of people

00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,520
talk to your co-workers and friends

00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,880
maybe even ask them what you're good at

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,320
and the kind of things that you should

00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,320
be communicating to an audience

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,000
watch other talks go to meetups talk to

00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,600
people

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
learn from other speakers and copy

00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,320
techniques if you want to

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,080
if you see a talk that isn't very good

00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,919
or perhaps doesn't explain something in

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,320
a way that was helpful to you

00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:20,400
maybe take that topic and write your own

00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,160
talk on that topic that is better

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,400
for people maybe with your experience or

00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,520
your background you can take a blog post

00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,120
either one of your blog posts or

00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,479
somebody else's blog posts and you can

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,320
turn that into a talk

00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,520
again be careful of plagiarism like

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,440
you're not supposed to just take

00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,759
somebody else's content although there's

00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,600
always the potential that if you ask

00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,440
somebody who wrote a blog post nicely

00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,919
they may be quite happy for you to write

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,440
a talk

00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,600
around their topic and then maybe you

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,560
just credit them in your talk and say

00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:49,520
where the original inspiration came from

00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,919
um some of my talks have actually come

00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,759
from rants or raves in the pub so just

00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:55,360
talking about people building things the

00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,479
right way or the wrong way

00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,160
or the latest blog post that i've

00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,440
written in the pub and then you start to

00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,919
realize that what you're essentially

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,080
doing

00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,280
in an exchange with your friends is

00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,800
describing a talk

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,240
you could give at a conference so make

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,360
sure you get all these ideas down on

00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,360
paper

00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,800
and then when it becomes time that your

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,319
conference opens up its call for

00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,759
proposals at which point they will be

00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,880
broadcasting on twitter and other

00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,720
mediums that they are

00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,400
accepting proposals for their conference

00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,840
then hopefully you have a good list and

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,400
you can filter it down to the ones that

00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,039
best

00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:26,240
pick the idea that you like best and

00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,240
fill out the proposal form

00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,400
if you're looking for ideas actually the

00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,600
best place to look is the cfp page for

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,880
the conference that you're applying to

00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,960
they will almost

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,319
always have a section like this this is

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,680
actually from the djangocon europe

00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,240
website this year

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,880
and they've listed the things they would

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,960
like to see

00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,800
talks about some of those are basically

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,800
titles for a talk

00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,000
and i can guarantee i'm on a couple of

00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,319
program committees

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,400
that probably only about half of these

00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,880
were submitted as talk ideas in the end

00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,400
people

00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,759
either read the list and decided they

00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,440
couldn't write a talk or didn't want to

00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,039
write a talk on that subject or they

00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,400
decided everybody else would be writing

00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,880
a talk on that subject so they didn't

00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,280
want to

00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,400
compete or they didn't read the list at

00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,800
all

00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,080
and so all of these the organizers who

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,440
really wanted to see these talks there's

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,520
no proposals

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,520
for them so you're already at an

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,800
advantage if you submit a talk that

00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,759
matches one of these

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:20,000
topics because it's or it's pre-vetted

00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,440
by the organizers it matches exactly the

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,880
kind of thing that they want to see

00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,440
so you already be somewhere towards the

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,440
top of the list

00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,759
now you need to submit your proposal and

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,360
i've been on the programme committee as

00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,319
i say for a handful of conferences and

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,000
the truth is

00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,479
that about half of the proposals you

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,800
receive are not very good

00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,520
and that doesn't mean then they're a bad

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,520
idea

00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,960
but often people either don't read the

00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,160
instructions properly on how to fill out

00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,080
the form

00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,680
or for whatever reason that the proposal

00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,840
is just only half thought through

00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,440
so don't submit a low quality proposal

00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,919
if you want to be accepted to speak at a

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,680
conference

00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,960
submit a high quality proposal and i'm

00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,560
going to go through some steps you can

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,240
do to ensure that in a moment

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,840
get someone else to read it through make

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,280
sure all the sentences make sense make

00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,759
sure everything's in the right order

00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,720
make sure it's coherent so it everything

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,319
builds on the thing

00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,759
previously so it's not just a grab bag

00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,120
of random thoughts that you've had that

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,759
you've written down

00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,599
in a text field and make sure that your

00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,120
proposal describes what you're going to

00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:19,440
talk about

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,520
so we've decided we want to submit a

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,440
proposal how do we go about that well

00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,520
the first thing to do is to write an

00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,280
outline this i usually write this as

00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,759
bullet points in a text file

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,800
in markdown um but it could i know other

00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,200
people who do this

00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,120
in uh with mind maps either physically

00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,120
on paper or in the computer

00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,479
but either way you need a hierarchical

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,240
idea of what you're going to talk about

00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,479
so you need your um

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,720
top level points which i write down as

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,959
for a 25 minute talk it would be five to

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,600
ten bullet points ideally more towards

00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,920
five

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,080
and that means you can talk about that

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:55,040
subject for two to five minutes

00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,560
in general um at this point you probably

00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,600
need to step away from your mind map

00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,519
maybe get things down

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,720
in a chronological order you need to

00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,760
order the things you're going to talk

00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,399
about so they make

00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,839
sense either as a story or as a series

00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,320
of concepts building

00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,519
upon the previous concepts it doesn't

00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,360
have to be set in stone

00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,640
this is just a proposal the proposal is

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,560
actually the easy bit

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,080
um you can change your talk outline a

00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,279
bit um

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,360
it will usually change while you're

00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:21,120
writing the talk anyway but don't change

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,839
it too much after it's been accepted

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,839
because that's rude

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,760
once you've taken your app once you've

00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:30,160
written your outline you take it and you

00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,519
condense it down to a pitch and these

00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,519
three exclamation marks are here on

00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,680
purpose because this is the exciting

00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,279
bit of your proposal this is usually

00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,360
every cfb is different but this is

00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:42,240
usually one to two paragraphs

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,080
um that's designed to excite people

00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,440
about your talk idea to of both the

00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,040
organizers for accepting your talk in

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,120
the first place but also it usually goes

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,800
in the brochure so it's

00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,399
to encourage people to actually attend

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,920
your talk or even

00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,080
to attend the conference in the first

00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,720
place so

00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,000
write one paragraph answer the questions

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,320
what is the talk about

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,240
what broad topics will you cover why

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,920
should somebody come to see your talk

00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,920
if you can make it dramatic then

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,160
definitely do so if you're comparing

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,240
laying transatlantic telegraph cables

00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,160
um to dysfunctional software teams

00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,680
definitely make sure that story is front

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,760
and center in your pitch

00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,760
it's a pitch for your talk not you or

00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,519
your company nobody is interested in how

00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,920
great you think you are or how great

00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,440
your company thinks your company is

00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,680
so make sure that you're actually

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,279
talking about a technical topic or

00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,200
at least a topic that the audience will

00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,560
be interested in

00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,560
if you've done something good or

00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,320
terrible or interesting also make sure

00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,079
that story is front and center this is

00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,399
this is very much this is your chance to

00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:42,720
sell your story

00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,560
i usually take i usually write up my

00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,440
pitch in markdown and then i copy and

00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,160
paste it into

00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,120
an app called hemingway um hemingway is

00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,880
really good

00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,720
at just sort of checking grammar and

00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,320
style and making sure that your language

00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,560
is punchy and you're talking about

00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,440
doing things rather than having done

00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,880
things or

00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,200
maybe considering doing things in the

00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,279
future

00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,120
so let's look at a cfp form this is

00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:08,160
actually the proposal that

00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,279
i wrote for this talk right now and i

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,279
think it's pretty good

00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,800
and because it's not a deep dive into a

00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,120
technical topic i think it works quite

00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,440
well

00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,399
as a case study of a proposal for a

00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,160
conference

00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,519
so there's a title which i try to make

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:23,120
as exciting as possible again

00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:26,160
how to get on the stage um

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,440
i actually think titles sell talks more

00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,120
than a lot of the the rest of the

00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,240
content in the proposal

00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,360
um so again like do write down several

00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,800
ideas try to pitch the

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,560
pick the punchiest because this is the

00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,560
thing that often the reviewers will see

00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:41,040
before clicking through to even decide

00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:43,120
to review to add a review to your talk

00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,720
then i've selected a 40-minute talk as

00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,240
the format

00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,480
and then i've got an abstract a

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,639
description and my notes

00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,399
um so the abstract again this is usually

00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,240
the thing that goes in the brochure or

00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,639
at least in a little box

00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,920
on the website and this is i'm going to

00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,200
read this in full

00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,519
would you like to give a talk at

00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,519
djangocon but don't know where to start

00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,639
does the idea of getting on the stage

00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,959
terrify

00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:09,279
you of course it does everybody is

00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:11,040
terrified of public speaking

00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:13,040
this talk will tell you why you should

00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,440
give a talk and how to go about it

00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,079
i'll cover submitting a proposal writing

00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,000
your talk

00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,200
preparing to speak and actually getting

00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,760
behind the lecture into

00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,560
thunderous applause and obviously that

00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,800
last bit

00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,680
is has turned out to be a lie because

00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,519
there is no

00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,720
no stage there's no lectin and no

00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:32,320
impulse

00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:35,360
um i'm just imagining it it's fine

00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:37,040
so i i'm quite proud of this because it

00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,240
starts off with a couple of questions

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,480
they're relatively

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,440
universal the first one tries to the

00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,279
first sentence

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,639
um tries to hook in people who would

00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,560
like to already like to speak at

00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,880
djangocon but don't know how to do it

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,399
um the second one is more universal as i

00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,079
say everybody here is terrified of

00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,680
speaking on stage

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,200
it is weirdly addictive though i do

00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,440
highly recommend it

00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,760
and then the the third sentence starts

00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,399
to bring you into this talk will

00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:04,000
tell you um certain things and then the

00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,120
last sentence is really a breakdown just

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,399
for the people who actually want to know

00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,839
a little bit more detail without going

00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,839
through to the full description

00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:12,800
it says writing the talk preparing to

00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:15,200
speak actually speaking

00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,600
the description is a much longer version

00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:20,160
of that and i'll read this in full

00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,600
i'm only kidding so the important thing

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,360
here is actually the headings

00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,279
um coming up with an idea submitting a

00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,800
proposal this is my outline this is the

00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,480
out of the first thing that i did

00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,920
when proposing when putting together

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,519
this talk proposal

00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,959
these are my top level outlines and then

00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,639
for each one if i go back

00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:36,639
there's one to two sentences for each

00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:39,360
one just showing that i really can talk

00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,959
about that topic for a few minutes um

00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,000
the introduction at the very start

00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,920
before the first heading

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,680
is basically the same as the abstract

00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,800
with a little bit more detail

00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,279
and then there's a little sentence at

00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,040
the end to just kind of wrap up um

00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,720
the the exciting feeling of having given

00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:55,120
a talk and receiving applause from your

00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,120
peers

00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,199
and then in the notes the notes often

00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,519
nobody writes anything in those

00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:03,279
but they can be really useful um to get

00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,720
your point across to the organizers so

00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,199
something that maybe is even a little

00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,160
bit more

00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:09,279
too unde mundane to um to put in the

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,560
description

00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:12,320
but you you want to make sure the

00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,079
audience that the organizers

00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,760
understand what you're trying to do so

00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,519
here i've just said although it's aimed

00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,399
at beginners and to encourage new

00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,800
speakers

00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:23,120
to speak there's it should have enough

00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,959
content in it that it should be useful

00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,600
or maybe just inspirational for more

00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:30,560
experienced speakers

00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,440
so now you've submitted your call for

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,560
proposals

00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,920
um prepare to be rejected i.e get

00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,399
rejected all the time

00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,360
all speakers do um you sometimes get

00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,160
feedback but you

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,440
usually don't there are many reasons

00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,519
that you may be rejected

00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,040
and some of them are things you can fix

00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,800
and some of them just aren't

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,639
your proposal may be bad it may not have

00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,320
been very well put together

00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,560
if you follow the tips i just gave you

00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,639
then that shouldn't be the case

00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,399
maybe your talk idea just isn't that

00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,079
engaging and you might need to go back

00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,480
to the drawing board and either tweak it

00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,160
or

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,760
perhaps pick a different topic to speak

00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,680
about

00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,600
something more subtle is that perhaps

00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,240
there was another proposal on the same

00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,440
topic

00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,360
that was slightly better than yours

00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,800
and maybe they're just the speaker is

00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,600
just more of an expert on that subject

00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,360
than you are

00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,120
um and you will probably never know that

00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,639
this happened um

00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,240
but don't you should never feel

00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,000
disheartened when you're rejected this

00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:27,839
is something that happens to everybody

00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:30,079
um and uh yeah it's it's just part of

00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,759
the the proposal process

00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:33,040
um perhaps your topic or proposal was

00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,480
just considered a bad fit for the

00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,160
conference again if you looked at the

00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,600
cfp page properly and looked at that

00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,800
list then hopefully you should have a

00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,560
good idea of whether

00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:46,160
your talk is a good fit a

00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:48,160
secret of people on programme committees

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,680
is that they're very busy and they only

00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,519
have a certain amount of time per

00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,720
proposal to actually decide whether it's

00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:55,279
a good fit or not

00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,800
perhaps a quick skim of your proposal

00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,759
didn't excite them enough to read it in

00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,160
more detail

00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,600
and you've got to know even though maybe

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,000
they didn't understand the nuance of

00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,920
what you were trying to say

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,079
there's nothing you can do about this

00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,920
except volunteer to help

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,519
organize a community conference and join

00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,199
the programme committee because the more

00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,360
reviewers you have the more time

00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:17,759
everybody can spend reviewing the talks

00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,680
it's also a really good way to learn how

00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,120
to get better at writing proposals for

00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,120
conferences because you're going to see

00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:26,160
a few of them

00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,040
if you're rejected don't throw away the

00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,240
proposal

00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,160
so you can submit it to other

00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,160
conferences or perhaps even the same

00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,440
conference the next year

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:37,199
where it may get accepted i've known

00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:39,440
that to happen in a few cases

00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,480
so if you've submitted a few proposals

00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,519
to different conferences

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,120
and eventually you get accepted

00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,920
your first job is to confirm with the

00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:50,079
organizers that you can still speak

00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,440
in most cases and now you can start

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,600
working on your talk

00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:56,079
build yourself a timeline that leads up

00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,720
to you either submitting the talk video

00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:00,160
um or giving the talk live on the day do

00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,800
not forget about your talk

00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,279
until a week or two before the event

00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,199
come up

00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,559
yeah come up with this type timeline set

00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,000
yourself a deadline for starting to

00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,039
write the slides completing the slides

00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,720
coming up with ideas

00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:13,039
all of the different steps of the

00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,079
creative process keep a working document

00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,839
from the beginning

00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,679
um much like trying to come up with

00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:20,959
ideas if you can jot down

00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:22,000
every idea you have for the content of

00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,360
your talk

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,959
when they come to you then you're going

00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,919
to have more content to put into your

00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,360
slides

00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,039
when it actually comes to building your

00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,720
presentation

00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,160
so now you write your talk and this is a

00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,679
very difficult thing to to

00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,280
even speak to you about because

00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,919
everybody has a different process for

00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,400
this and

00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:39,679
a different set of skills i am not

00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,919
fantastic at design

00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,679
so i tend to work a lot with kind of

00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,600
default templates and these big title

00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,039
slides that i talk over

00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,679
everybody has a different style for

00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:51,039
presentation um i could just be speaking

00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,720
in front of a photograph

00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:54,559
of let's say somewhere in portugal right

00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,840
now i find the titles are quite good for

00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:57,280
sort of anchoring the

00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,080
the general subject area that i'm

00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,760
talking about at the time

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,280
before you start designing your writing

00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,919
your talk or slightly designing your

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,160
slides

00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,919
read the code of conduct because you you

00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,960
are now a content provider for

00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,600
the conference and so um everything you

00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,960
need to do

00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,640
needs to fit well within the code of

00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:18,640
conduct don't break the code of conduct

00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,640
that's genuinely a terrible thing to do

00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,960
and now a short segue about bullet

00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:26,160
points

00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:28,640
bullet points are the default option

00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,480
in many slide packages if you create a

00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,160
new slide you get a big text box it's

00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,799
already got bullet point placeholders in

00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,160
there

00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:35,600
they're really quick it's really quick

00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,440
to just write down some bullet points

00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,080
and hit return and add some more bullet

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,600
points

00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,799
they're easy you don't even really need

00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,240
to know how to use the package you just

00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:44,080
need to be able to type a little bit

00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,000
you don't need to be good at design you

00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,440
don't need to arrange things on the page

00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,280
because the more you type it just

00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,039
it just arranges them for you but they

00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,559
are kind of one-dimensional they don't

00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:54,320
tell you much other than the words that

00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,760
you put up there and if you put up all

00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,960
the bullet points at the same time then

00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,320
people will read ahead

00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,000
and they won't really be listening to

00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,360
what you're saying

00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,840
and they're kind of boring i mean this

00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:05,280
is this isn't the most

00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,720
exciting slide deck i've ever put

00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,840
together in general but this is also the

00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:11,039
most boring slide in the entire

00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:12,000
presentation the problem with bullet

00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,640
points is

00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,799
the notes for you and most presentation

00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,640
packages already have a note section

00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:20,000
and that you can keep up on the speaker

00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,240
display while you're speaking

00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,280
so i'm reading notes that i wrote for

00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,039
myself

00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,360
right now while you are looking at a

00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:29,039
slide of bullet points

00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,400
so i have strong opinions about bullet

00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,919
points but

00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,520
if you know how to put together a

00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,039
presentation with bullet points

00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,960
and that's what you're comfortable with

00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:39,679
or maybe that's all you have time for

00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,360
do it anyway tell your story communicate

00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,679
your experiences to an audience

00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,760
the bullet points can just be there to

00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:48,400
help you to give you that comfort

00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,120
in giving your talk providing you have

00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,559
um

00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:54,880
exciting content or useful content

00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:57,760
your talk will still be hugely a hugely

00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,919
valuable contribution to the community

00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,799
so the way i think about useful and

00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,600
interesting

00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:04,720
is as a graph with these two axes so

00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,600
we've got interesting at the top and

00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,679
useful on the right

00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,039
and so that gives us some quadrants and

00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:12,480
the quadrant you should really be aiming

00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,600
for is this one up the top right you

00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,600
should be useful and

00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:20,320
interesting but don't think for a second

00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,760
that you have to be if you don't think

00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:25,200
you're very interesting

00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:28,480
it's okay to put together a talk um

00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:30,960
that's useless interesting or

00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,080
useful but boring people come to

00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,080
conferences to learn

00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,159
new things not necessarily to be

00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,760
entertained sometimes it's nice to be

00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:40,559
entertained by something lighthearted in

00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,840
between two deeply technical talks

00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:43,600
fundamentally this is how we put

00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:46,400
together a program that's

00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,679
diverse and works towards different

00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,960
audiences

00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:53,919
so both of if you think you're um

00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,320
clever but boring or really interesting

00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,240
but

00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,600
not very clever still put together those

00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,600
talks they are still valuable

00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,280
contributions to the community

00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,520
the thing that you should be avoiding is

00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,320
this quadrant here just don't stray into

00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,520
useless and

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:09,039
boring um it's that's

00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,280
i don't need to say anything more about

00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,280
that

00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,440
if you would like help with designing

00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:17,760
slides

00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,440
i really recommend these books there are

00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,880
also websites presentations then

00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,840
specifically as both a book and a

00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,440
website

00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:27,120
um these will really help you up your

00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,760
game with slide design especially if

00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,320
you're

00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:33,039
trying to wean yourself off bullet point

00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:35,360
dependency

00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:36,799
the presentation zen especially the

00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,840
website is a fantastic resource

00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:39,600
describing different people's

00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:42,159
presentation styles how you tell

00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,120
stories how you create drama how you

00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,880
tell technical

00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:47,520
how you educate people on technical

00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:50,799
topics ted talks as a general

00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,760
thing have been hugely inspirational

00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:54,240
especially to me

00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:56,480
in terms of these short talks that often

00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,960
say something quite profound

00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,159
and they emphasize rehearsing and

00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,919
rehearsing and rehearsing so their

00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:04,159
speakers are always very polished

00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,840
um and i'm yeah i've watched so many of

00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,799
those i i don't think i could even pick

00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,559
a favorite

00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:10,799
this third book here slideology is one

00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:12,559
that i own and i refer to quite a lot it

00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:14,480
has a whole sections on

00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:15,760
slide design in general how to come up

00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:19,120
with a speaking

00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:20,640
style um how to replace bullet points

00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,320
with lots of different diagrams add

00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,000
extra dimensions to the thing that

00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:27,120
you're talking about

00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,960
so i highly recommend that book so

00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,559
once you've written your presentation

00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,640
you've put together all your slides

00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:35,360
you've added your holiday photos you're

00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:39,200
going to see some of my holiday photos

00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:42,799
then you can you need to start preparing

00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,120
to speak and the this comes down really

00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:45,760
to

00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:47,039
one thing which i'm going to repeat

00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,919
three times

00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:50,559
rehearse rehearse rehearse i put out a

00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,440
question

00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:54,720
on twitter a few weeks ago about what

00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,240
people thought the secret

00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,840
was to to giving good presentations and

00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,600
almost everybody came back with this

00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,919
there were a couple of people who said

00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,360
if i rehearse a talk then i can't

00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:05,919
present it because i find it really

00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,080
boring

00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:10,000
so i put together my slides and then i

00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,760
just make it up as i go along

00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,679
and i happen to know those people are

00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,159
incredible speakers so if you can do

00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,559
that

00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,679
uh fine but i would very much recommend

00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,600
that you rehearse and rehearse and

00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,880
rehearse i underestimated this so much

00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:24,000
when i started

00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:26,880
nowadays i tend to rehearse my talks

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,840
around 8 to 12 times before anybody else

00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,840
ever gets to see them

00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,640
as well as rehearsal i really recommend

00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,080
giving your talk to a meet-up or a group

00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:39,200
of friends or group of colleagues

00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,559
beforehand apart from just finding out

00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,919
whether you speak faster when you're

00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:44,000
nervous

00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,520
it will give you accurate timing

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,039
hopefully

00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,039
for how long your talk is actually going

00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:50,559
to take i've had talks i've written and

00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,679
i thought were about the right length go

00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:53,440
over by 50

00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:55,600
sometimes with my first reading in front

00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,360
of other people um or come in

00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,640
very short so giving a talk in front of

00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,000
other people is definitely something

00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,640
that's very valuable especially if

00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,159
you're a less experienced speaker

00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,799
so now you've rehearsed and rehearsed

00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:08,799
and rehearsed it's time to give the talk

00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:10,080
and there's not really anything i can

00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:13,200
say about this

00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,799
um except you'll be nervous but if you

00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,279
followed the previous step

00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:18,240
you won't be too nervous because you

00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,919
know how

00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,279
how your talk goes you're not going to

00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,720
be trying to squeeze it into time that

00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:25,600
it doesn't fit into

00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,880
um you know if you've given it to a

00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,320
smaller group beforehand you know the

00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,840
bits that people will laugh at

00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:33,360
um or be educated by or things that they

00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,080
have questions had questions about that

00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,240
you've fixed

00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,120
in your presentation so preparation is

00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,720
really the key

00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,480
once you get up on the stage you're

00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,240
allowed to be nervous everybody is

00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:45,440
nervous

00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:49,600
but you will also be practiced and

00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:51,200
your speech your talk will be excellent

00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,400
at the end of the talk there's a q a

00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,000
section and this is probably the

00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,799
scariest bit especially if you're less

00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,880
experienced

00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:58,799
where there will be five to ten minutes

00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,440
where people will be allowed to ask you

00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,880
questions

00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:04,000
live that you don't get a chance to

00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:06,400
prepare for but there's a big secret

00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,440
you don't have to take questions if you

00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,960
tell the room chair

00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,640
before you start speaking that you won't

00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,880
be taking questions

00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,240
then they shouldn't get it start handing

00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,400
a microphone around at the end or asking

00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:19,440
the audience to submit questions to you

00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:22,720
um but question and answer can be

00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:25,120
a really rewarding part of the talk

00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,320
for people it helps the audience drill

00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,360
down into parts of the talk that maybe

00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,120
they didn't understand

00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:31,760
correctly or aren't sure that they

00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:34,159
understand correctly

00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,799
beware non-questions if somebody stands

00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,279
up and

00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:38,640
makes a statement thank them and move on

00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:40,159
as quickly as possible they're not

00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,600
supposed to do that but for some reason

00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:43,279
people do anyway

00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,720
if you got asked a question and you

00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,440
don't know the answer don't make

00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,360
something up

00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,480
say you'll talk afterwards or you need

00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,840
time to think about it

00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,440
you don't need to be an expert in

00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,919
everything to give a talk at a

00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,919
conference

00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,760
now obviously everything's changed in

00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:00,080
the age of covert 19

00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,760
i used to pack my viking helmet into my

00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,679
bag along with my django

00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,679
girls t-shirt and then i used to get on

00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:06,559
a plane to shippel and fly somewhere in

00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:08,559
the world

00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:10,880
where i would be told i looked great and

00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:12,320
take a selfie in the bathroom

00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,919
and then i would stand up on the stage

00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,039
possibly wearing a kilt because i live

00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,840
in scotland

00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:20,080
um and this is and you hear your rumbles

00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,600
of laughter or applause as you give your

00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,760
talk

00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,200
and all of this has gone away and i kind

00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,520
of miss it instead we get

00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,520
this

00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:32,880
but there are still big pros to actually

00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:34,880
this new world with virtual conferences

00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,880
they are cheaper they're easier to get

00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,000
to so much more accessible for vast

00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,240
parts of the world which is

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,600
wonderful for our community overall and

00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,200
the conferences are still happening

00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,640
that's the best thing we're still able

00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,760
to have conferences even though we're

00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,840
all remote

00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:49,200
the thing for you as uh maybe a

00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:52,559
beginning speaker

00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,919
is that many um allow or even insist on

00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:55,360
pre-recorded talks

00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:56,799
which is wonderful because it means you

00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,080
get to do your rehearsals while

00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:00,640
recording them and then when you get

00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,360
do one that you think is good enough you

00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,360
submit that

00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,799
as your pre-recorded talk there's no

00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,120
live um

00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:07,840
giving a talk nerves you get as many

00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,400
chances

00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:12,080
um as you want to to give the talk at

00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,159
the way that you want to

00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,679
the cons i find it's really difficult to

00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,400
be expressive in front of a camera i

00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:18,000
tend to

00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,320
resort to a monotone when i'm not

00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,760
thinking about it explicitly

00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,520
and it's really difficult to simulate

00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,440
that community feel and the

00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,039
positive feedback from the audience the

00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,279
django and python community

00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:30,240
is one of the most wonderful in the

00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:33,760
world they are

00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:36,159
warm and encouraging and

00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:38,559
there i i've never had a bad experience

00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:39,840
with a with a python audience

00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:40,880
so once you've given your talk and

00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,840
you've answered some questions

00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,480
potentially

00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:48,240
you can bask in the glory of a job well

00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:51,600
done and the admiration of your peers

00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:55,760
and now i'd like to take a step behind

00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:57,600
in front of the um lectern for a moment

00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,440
i i've described how much work it takes

00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,279
to speak at a conference

00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,600
and you're about to see some talks given

00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:05,440
by volunteers prepared in their own time

00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,679
purely because they want to tell you

00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,640
something so please be effusive with

00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:10,320
your praise

00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,919
quiet with your criticism and keep any

00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:14,480
challenges you have to yourself

00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:16,000
during the q a session ask questions

00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,240
which help encourage the speaker

00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,520
to expand on the topic that they were

00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,120
already talking about

00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,559
don't use them to show how clever you

00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,640
are don't ask a speaker who's just

00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:25,360
spoken about x if they've also heard of

00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,880
why

00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:30,960
um don't use them to show yeah

00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,240
don't ask them to go back a few slides

00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,520
and explain something in more detail

00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,559
that you didn't quite understand if you

00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:37,440
didn't understand it

00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:38,480
then probably other people didn't either

00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,000
and if you want to ask anything that

00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,919
wasn't directly covered in the talk

00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,760
ask afterwards in a private chat or a

00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:45,200
private discussion

00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:47,120
so to circle around to my original

00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,760
question why might you want to give a

00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,840
talk

00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,840
and the answer is be part of this

00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:53,520
community this conference exists because

00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,520
the community organizes it and because

00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:58,159
the community provides the content

00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:59,600
it's good to give back um if you've ever

00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:00,720
learned anything useful in a talk you

00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,720
can be on the other side of that

00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,480
imparting your knowledge to other people

00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,760
it's a conversation starter people will

00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,440
come up to talk to you

00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,880
because they know something that you

00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,880
know that so they

00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,399
you have a shared topic of conversation

00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,360
it's a challenge learning to public

00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:16,799
speak is

00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:18,480
difficult and so it's a life skill it's

00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:19,200
something that makes you a more rounded

00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,039
person

00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,399
you can also learn subjects by speaking

00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:22,720
on them if you pick a subject you don't

00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:24,559
know

00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,159
in detail and you learn it in detail in

00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:29,039
order to give a talk that's actually

00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:30,559
made you a better developer

00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:32,240
and writing a talk is a good opportunity

00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:34,080
to learn something really well it's

00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,799
great for your cv or resume

00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,360
and one day when this new normal is all

00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:39,520
over

00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,880
hopefully we'll get to travel again and

00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,799
i get to meet you all in person

00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,159
and get to come and watch the talk that

00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:55,840
you give

00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:55,840
thank you very much any questions

00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:02,640
