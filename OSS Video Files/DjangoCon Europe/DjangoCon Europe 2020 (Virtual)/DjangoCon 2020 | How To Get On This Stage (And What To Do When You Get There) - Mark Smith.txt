"How To Get On This Stage (And What To Do When You Get There)" by Mark Smith

Would you like to give a talk at DjangoCon, but don't know where to start? Does the idea of getting on the stage terrify you? This talk will tell you why you should give a talk and how to go about it. I'll cover submitting a proposal, writing your talk, preparing to speak and actually getting behind the lectern to thunderous applause!
