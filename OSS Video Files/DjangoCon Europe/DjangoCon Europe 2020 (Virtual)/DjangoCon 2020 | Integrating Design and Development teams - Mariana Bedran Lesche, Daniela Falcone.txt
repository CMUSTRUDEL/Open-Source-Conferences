"Integrating Design and Development teams by implementing a Design System" by Mariana Bedran Lesche, Daniela Falcone

In the software industry, developers, designers and stakeholders should be working together to achieve the same goals and deliver high quality products to the final users.

In this talk, we're going to share some lessons learned about how to integrate both teamsâ€™ work with a solid management process.
