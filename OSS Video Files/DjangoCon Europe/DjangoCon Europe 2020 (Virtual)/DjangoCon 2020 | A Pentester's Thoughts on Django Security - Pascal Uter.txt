“A Pentester's Thoughts on Django Security” by Pascal Uter 

Django can make you feel like you are in security heaven and yet there are some pitfalls to avoid. In this talk, I want to praise Django design choices, give an overview of Django's security features and their limitations and conclude with some general security best practices to keep in mind.
