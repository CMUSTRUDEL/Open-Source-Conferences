KEYNOTE: “Biometric Unsecurity” by Carina C. Zona

Biometrics are widely regarded by the public, and many developers, as heightened security. Their actual track record tells a very different story. Biometric technologies are systematically making the world a less safe place. We have an obligation to do something about that. And we can.


Note: Q&A not available due to technical problems.

hi

00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,360
i'm karina suzona and this is biometrics

00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,280
and security

00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,280
biometrics are widely regarded by the

00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,560
public and i think by many developers as

00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,320
heightened security

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,039
but the actual track record tells a very

00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,640
different story biometric technologies

00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,320
are systematically making the world the

00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,920
left safe place and

00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,000
i think we truly have an obligation to

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,279
do something about that i also

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,719
really know that we can so i do want to

00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:33,440
start with a content warning because

00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,800
this has

00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,239
a lot of stuff going on um so

00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,079
i'm going to be talking definitely about

00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,320
surveillance clearly stalking human

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,960
rights violations and genocide

00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,920
policing incarceral systems immigration

00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,399
border control

00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,360
religious bias and persecution refugees

00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,600
famine

00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,120
wildfires transphobia ableism

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,079
psychological abuse

00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:59,559
sexual abuse and there are uh images

00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:02,559
that are censored uh that are

00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:05,439
semi-pornographic um again

00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,080
censored uh and then there are some

00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:08,880
racial

00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,880
and misogynistic slurs uh some of which

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,080
researchers censored and some that they

00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,600
didn't

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,280
so just want to make sure that you're

00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,920
aware that there's some stuff coming up

00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,840
that is

00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,960
potentially offensive and we've done our

00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,799
best to

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:26,479
to make it uh as as

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:29,119
discrete as possible

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,479
so i think a valid question is why are

00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:33,439
we talking about biometrics

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,320
at a django conference right but python

00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,799
and django

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,000
are deeply entwined with biometrics

00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,600
first of all if you think about just

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,799
python's history

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,040
in research and science and academia and

00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,880
the libraries we have for data science

00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,960
it was kind of inevitable it was the

00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:52,079
place to go

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,280
and so we have already so much being

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,680
built in

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,479
and through and just starting with

00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,640
authentication and going far beyond that

00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:03,759
it's it's deeply integrated into all

00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,520
sorts of things including django

00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,600
and being used in all sorts of ways

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,800
including using raspberry pi's for

00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:13,280
biometric sensors

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,040
so taking a step back when we think

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,920
about biometrics typically we're

00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,680
thinking about

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,280
it as sort of like an upgrade on

00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,720
conventional security and upgrade on

00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,400
passwords

00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,879
typically you want to think of

00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:28,239
authentication authorization as being

00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:29,680
that starting point right so passwords

00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,959
deal in absolutes

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:35,680
so do usually the other authentication

00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:39,120
methods we use like say security token

00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:42,319
or an sms code

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:45,200
and then you have authent authorization

00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:46,720
which is not saying you are you are who

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,640
you are but rather that

00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,760
you are permitted to do something

00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,879
because you are

00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:55,040
authenticated so you can spend money or

00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,599
you can get insurance you can get health

00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,080
care

00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,879
you can drive a car um and all those

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,519
things require

00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:04,080
exact matches there's no such thing as

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,400
it's pretty close to your password

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,920
you can go through whereas with

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,640
biometrics we're getting into a whole

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,680
other world

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,040
of probabilistics where verification and

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,560
identification

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:19,840
are only looking for is this like it

00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:24,239
is it close does it seem about right

00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:27,120
um and categorization being a percentage

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,519
possibility of like how confident are we

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,319
how

00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,720
how likely is it that this could be an

00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:36,000
attribute of a thing

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:39,599
so all these turn from exactness

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,519
into something very different

00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,519
and it's important to recognize that

00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,599
identification is not the same thing as

00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,599
identity especially because biometrics

00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,040
is using terms in ways different than we

00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,120
do in everyday life

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,400
when we talk about say an id as being

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,560
you know something for instance like a

00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,159
driver's license or passport

00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,519
and biometrics when we're talking about

00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,200
identification we're talking about

00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,920
comparing credentials

00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,560
so that authorization and authentication

00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,799
part right

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,840
comparing data has to be exact match one

00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,599
to one

00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,319
biometric identification on the other

00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:13,120
hand is comparing physical traits

00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,640
so it's something that a sensor produced

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,519
and it's finding things like

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,120
looking for face or the way you walk or

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,600
how your heart beats

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,800
whereas identity is much more personal

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,600
it's who we know

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,759
ourselves to be whether that be

00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,240
individually or also part of something

00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:32,720
greater than ourselves so our culture

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,960
the way we group ourselves with others

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:43,840
in terms of things like race or gender

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:43,840
or religion or ethnicity

00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:50,800
oh sorry um

00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,479
unsecurity is not a euphemism euphemism

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,680
for just poor security

00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,720
unsecurity is poor people losing food

00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,880
rations

00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,039
it's when the least privileged people

00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,199
lose even more autonomy

00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:05,120
than they already had lost and it's to

00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,320
streamline inconveniences to the lives

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:11,840
of those who have

00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,840
more privilege more power

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,560
unsecurity is the undoing of safety

00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:21,919
and unsecurity is unraveling autonomy

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,680
safety human rights and exit existential

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,680
threats

00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,600
so we're trading in that exactness for a

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,360
percentage let's delve into a little bit

00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,479
about what that really is

00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,560
when we talk about security we're

00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:36,479
talking about access control

00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:38,720
preventing loss of something valuable

00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,880
by metric and security is talking about

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,120
access plus control

00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,000
access to the public sphere is

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,880
conditioned on

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,520
seeding personal control over some

00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,120
aspect of your body

00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,720
and what does that look like what kind

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,800
of things are you

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,840
ending up having what access is being

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,600
gate kept

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:05,520
so being able to use a credit card

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:07,759
banking get insurance buy real estate

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,560
being able to enter your home or a

00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,880
friend's home

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,400
being able to even enter a neighborhood

00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,880
or in some cases an

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,600
entire city and it's being used to

00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,720
control

00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,600
basic services to get access to a sim

00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,600
card

00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:26,800
to get food to get on public transit

00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:29,440
to go to school or to use your education

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,800
getting a pension welfare benefits

00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,600
getting jobs

00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,080
being able to immigrate being able to

00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,000
even

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,440
get your medications your prescribed

00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,639
medications

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:43,120
all these are technologies in use today

00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:46,240
programs in use today by government and

00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,240
commercial entities

00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,599
and it's interesting because passwords

00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,720
of course uh

00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,599
you know all this time we've been

00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,240
telling people don't do password reuse

00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,520
right like

00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,680
every everything should have a

00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,520
distinctive password and then in

00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,319
biometrics you know what do you have

00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,240
here

00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,360
you can't do a body reset when there's a

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,680
breach

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,919
and data breaches happen all the time

00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,360
but biometric data is not some special

00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,520
case it's not immune

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,840
the tightening use of biometric data

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,880
linkage makes biometric authentication a

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,840
really fragile

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,400
precipice for people to be on and each

00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,240
time

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,560
those data sets are linked the data

00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,840
breach becomes tantamount to having

00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,800
one password for everything and unlike

00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:31,599
that password

00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:35,759
again you can't hit reset

00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:39,039
bodies are mutable our biometrics

00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:41,039
change biometric insecurity hits from

00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:43,840
both sides because of that

00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:45,280
changes can be natural or unnatural they

00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,800
can be accidental they can be

00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,680
unconscious or deliberate

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,520
temporary or permanent for instance your

00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,240
gait can be altered by an injury

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,960
pregnancy

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,120
amputation fingerprints are worn down

00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,599
all the time by manual laborers

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,080
to the point even of being undetectable

00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:04,000
or at least unauthenticatable

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,199
in the new normal of our pandemic it

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,080
should be noted too that

00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,440
fever detection is a really suspect

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,520
technology because

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,639
uh skin temperature isn't the only

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,960
explanation

00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,800
for an elevated temperature it can also

00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,840
be caused by things as basic as

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:23,039
exertion like biking to work or

00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:26,319
menstrual cycle or wearing warm clothing

00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:28,080
etc things like pain medication

00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,680
or a stroke can affect your head

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,400
movements your gaze your facial

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,719
expressions

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:35,360
gestures vocalizations all these are

00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:38,560
things that are biometrics being used

00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:41,919
for controlling access

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:45,519
and our behavior also changes when we

00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,519
know we're being watched

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,240
so what are the basic types of data

00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,480
taking a step back

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,279
okay so we have phenological which just

00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:58,399
means visual expressions of genetics

00:08:55,279 --> 00:09:01,279
nose ears eyes etc

00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,880
actions so things like the way you walk

00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,279
or the gestures you use

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,120
or the way you sign your name different

00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,760
from how your name looks on a page for

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,399
instance

00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,959
do you cross your t's going this way or

00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,959
this way

00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,320
and then what's sometimes called

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,240
cognitive but it's probably better

00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,959
considered bio signals because it goes

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,279
beyond

00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:23,839
the mental part but neurological system

00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,839
responses

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,360
and that basic process of probabilistic

00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,399
analysis that we're going through is

00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,519
taking data

00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:35,600
pulling out some record and asking

00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,120
okay what kind of object is this is

00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,760
there an object even

00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,360
oh okay there's a person object what

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,839
kind of traits can we recognize in the

00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,240
person

00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,839
object and then analyzing those traits

00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,440
for one of three purposes

00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:50,560
and it can be more than one obviously

00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,920
but verification which is a one-to-one

00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:56,000
comparison

00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:59,040
uh is this person who she claims to be

00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,760
whereas identifying is

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,040
is this person somewhere within this

00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,000
larger data set

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:08,000
is the person in this crowd and the

00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,360
classification is assigning

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,040
some sort of meaning to traits

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,040
and that could be really kind of

00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,920
questionable because again

00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:20,560
all of this is essentially educated

00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,560
guesswork

00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,839
so we're collecting biometric data from

00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,920
a variety of sensors

00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,680
some like optical thermal and infrared

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:33,040
which are being used particularly for

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,920
things like temperature detection

00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,920
using those bio signals using

00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:40,160
electrocardiogram and others

00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,560
of course our our you know standard

00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,399
device stuff has like the microphone

00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,760
camera accelerometer things that we're

00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,920
already using for

00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,920
sort of routine everyday biometrics to

00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,000
get into our devices

00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,160
and then things that we associate more

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,640
with surveillance in the typical sense

00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:59,360
things like

00:10:54,640 --> 00:11:02,560
cctv webcam body cameras

00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:05,839
and data sources of record sets are just

00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:07,120
enormous you get stuff that's uh sort of

00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,839
conventionally

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:12,320
government records you know stuff from

00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:15,360
police from intelligence agencies

00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:18,320
from various identification services

00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,399
from permitting and then you've got

00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,640
stuff like social media gets scraped

00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:25,120
all the time a lot of training data sets

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,680
actually are scraped

00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,399
stock photographs paparazzi photographs

00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,200
again

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:33,680
some major training sets are using these

00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,440
as their source data

00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,839
and then things that are smart home

00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,000
speakers like alexa

00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,480
doorbell like ring smart appliances

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,640
there's an alexa microwave

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,959
um and then the stuff that we wear on

00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:49,200
our body like activity trackers

00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:51,760
there's now smart glasses and other

00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:55,440
kinds of wearables

00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:58,240
and finally military using drones

00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,079
to do facial recognition and make

00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,360
decisions as to

00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:06,000
what that face is what that body is and

00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,800
what to do about that knowledge

00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
and then we have underlying all this

00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,880
ghost workers who are

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,600
doing the labeling often times of this

00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,959
data

00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:19,680
creating data out of say photographs or

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:22,560
recordings

00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,079
and finally generated photos this one

00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,639
was really interesting to me

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:27,279
for instance researchers have not

00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,959
actually

00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:31,920
used multi-racial people's photographs

00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:35,680
to do labeling

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:38,880
instead they make generated photos

00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:40,079
merging people who have been identified

00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,079
as different races

00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:43,360
and creating this sort of imagined

00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:46,720
composite

00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,160
in order to train on what a multiracial

00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,480
person might look like

00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,480
so it's starting from a sort of

00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,160
algorithmic hallucination

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,320
in order to make judgments about

00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,120
something that is incredibly personal

00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,639
and frankly

00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:04,639
outwardly not knowable at all

00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:08,240
so how do we define biometrics in

00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:11,440
a sort of uh canonical sense

00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:13,760
well supposedly it's unique um that it's

00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,320
a measurable stable kind of body trait

00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,120
that is unique in the world like say

00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,399
your dna

00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,800
you're supposed to be the only person

00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,399
with it right fingerprints supposedly

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,360
are like snowflakes there's only one

00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,720
each right

00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:29,360
so exactly one person period uniqueness

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:32,079
is absolute

00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,519
this isn't how biometrics are in

00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:36,399
practice

00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,680
it's more just like body traits body

00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,839
something

00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,680
and it gets a lot less precise from

00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:44,959
there so let's look at some specific

00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,720
traits to really get an idea

00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,959
first look at the the ones in white on

00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,399
the left clearly none of these are

00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,880
unique to just one person

00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,079
more than one person can have the same

00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:57,519
skin temperature

00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:59,279
they can have the same skin color dna

00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,360
might be unique

00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:03,199
but things like say the clothes you wear

00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,959
the accessories you wear the tattoo that

00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,639
you have

00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:09,040
it's possible that someone else has the

00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:11,040
same one

00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,079
stuff like brain activity and cardiac

00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,079
signature

00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:17,279
are probably more distinct it's really

00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:21,279
hard to find accurate data on

00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:23,680
how precise which things are

00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:25,680
genuinely unique demonstratively

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,560
scientifically unique and which things

00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,360
are

00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,320
pretty likely unique so let's put these

00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,040
in the category

00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,800
of leaning heavily towards unique but

00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,320
it's not clear whether they definitely

00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:39,360
are

00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,000
and then we have traits of the face iris

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,880
retina

00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,279
face geometry voice right ones that are

00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,880
more

00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:48,959
unusual but are again in consumer use

00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,959
facial veins periocular geometry

00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:53,120
periocular meaning the area around the

00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:56,160
eyes and the eyebrows

00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,720
earlobe geometry various things having

00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,519
to do

00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,279
with the way the behavior of our heads

00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:04,079
so the way we tilt it

00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:05,920
movements that we make the expressions

00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:08,079
eyes and gaze as well

00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:11,279
even the way we laugh are considered

00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:13,040
ways to identify us

00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,480
face coverings eye coverings head

00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:17,839
coverings as well

00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:21,600
um is this person wearing a veil a hat

00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:24,480
are they wearing sunglasses um

00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,519
are they wearing a mask um and then we

00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,240
get into hands

00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,880
so hand geometry itself fingerprint of

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,120
course is

00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,000
uh conventional but also things like

00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,800
palm prints

00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,680
and various veins so finger veins palm

00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,480
veins

00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,240
thumb veins um and then going down to

00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,600
the wrist we have things like

00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:45,199
pulse and cardiac electrical activity

00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,880
and these are pretty standard to find

00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:50,720
these days on activity trackers right

00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:53,120
and then the things that you use your

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,199
hands for like typing speed

00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,720
handwriting speed that stroke order i

00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:59,920
mentioned of crossing the t

00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,759
right and the legs we have gate

00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,600
how do you walk what are the mechanics

00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:06,399
of it

00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,199
the actual geometry of the leg

00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,000
footprints

00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:11,519
like like fingerprints and palm prints

00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,519
um

00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,519
so there's a sense of objectivity right

00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,240
this is something that is absolutely

00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,920
measurable

00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,160
and if you're having problems getting

00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,959
exactitude measure more things

00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:24,639
so that you can get closer numbers right

00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:28,000
but the reality is that biometrics are

00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:31,120
full of biasing variables

00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,880
traits have distinctiveness they differ

00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,160
in terms of poise elimination and

00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,279
exposure

00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:40,480
all these various things are affecting

00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:42,079
how good the data is how accurately you

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,440
can interpret it and whether you can

00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:45,440
really interpret it at all

00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:54,639
so things like culture class gender race

00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:58,160
these are not things that actually

00:16:54,639 --> 00:17:00,720
can be evaluated externally despite

00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,399
everything else that we think we can do

00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,120
however they can be

00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,679
biases they can change the way we

00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,799
reflect

00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:10,400
all of these other things our gender our

00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:12,640
race affect things like

00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:15,919
you know how we how we interact with the

00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:18,480
rest of the world sometimes how we speak

00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:20,160
for instance context switching changing

00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,720
the way you talk depending on who you're

00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,720
talking to

00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:28,240
biometric data sets and platforms like

00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:33,520
biometrics as a service

00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:36,160
are powering in security amazon being

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:38,000
kind of the classic example of that um i

00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,640
think it's ironic because this is a new

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,039
poster

00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,120
in berlin but they actually do uh

00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:44,640
package mass surveillance uh they call

00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,280
it alexa and ring

00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,559
and recognition so they've got plenty of

00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,960
that already going on

00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:52,799
um so when we talk about technical debt

00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,080
what are we talking about we're imposing

00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:57,120
something we're talking about something

00:17:54,080 --> 00:18:00,559
that imposes cost onto a project

00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:02,960
whereas ethical debt imposes costs onto

00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,960
people

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,960
its debt collector comes only after harm

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,080
has been

00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:12,400
inflicted on someone

00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,559
and this is kind of an example of what

00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,000
i'm talking about is that we have

00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:20,160
researchers

00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:23,440
really committing acts of ethical debt

00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:26,720
things like using external

00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:29,360
physical attributes in order to predict

00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:31,200
who supposedly is criminal and where you

00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,520
can find the most criminals

00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,520
and i do think this is a good point to

00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,720
quote every time i see this kind of

00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,320
i think about machine learning

00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,600
researchers back in grad school who

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,919
expressed the fence that i wasn't

00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:44,240
charitable enough in my characterization

00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:46,640
of their fields widespread ignorance

00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,080
and complicity with racist sexist and

00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,600
ultimately deep full

00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,600
deeply harmful work

00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,520
and it's a valid question what makes us

00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,280
think that a b i

00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,880
won't be mobilized to work towards

00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:01,039
anything but the detriment rather than

00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,440
the interests of black people anyway

00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:05,360
why would we go out of our way to more

00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,440
accurately identify

00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,480
black people if it's going to be used

00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,120
against them

00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,039
and by if i mean is it is being used

00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:16,640
against them

00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:19,840
um we never thought about misuse

00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:23,039
is a common excuse for

00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:25,200
harm having been done um and it's the

00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:29,440
precursor to that ethical debt

00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:31,760
it's when um it's the cost of humans

00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:35,760
to humans from developers just ignoring

00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,760
insecurity and hoping it goes away

00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,080
so ibm's diversity and faces data set

00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,280
was

00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:46,320
released in 2019 and it was touted as

00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:48,400
this great innovation of

00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,000
introducing much more diversity which

00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,840
would make predictions much more

00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,919
accurate

00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:55,039
fantastic it turns out though that it

00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:58,559
actually was

00:19:55,039 --> 00:20:00,160
scraped from flickr

00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,840
and people had not given their consent

00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,960
they were creative commons license but

00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,960
creative commons

00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,320
is a copyright release it's not a model

00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,200
release and

00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:10,640
it's not consent to be defamed which is

00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,039
exactly what was happening

00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,640
not just in diversity in faces but in

00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:17,120
other data sets as well

00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:19,280
first of all none of the major data sets

00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:22,720
have any consensual images

00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:24,320
this was found just a year or so ago by

00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,480
researchers oh no i'm sorry this was

00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:30,320
released this summer

00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:33,840
so very recent research and here we have

00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:36,480
as i said slurs various ways that people

00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:39,679
were being labeled in these photographs

00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:41,440
with really offensive terms including as

00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,280
offensive as you can get

00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,120
and there's a reason obviously why they

00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,240
blurred those photos but there is enough

00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,960
here to see

00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,080
that there were things that were really

00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,559
indulging in

00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,400
stereotypes in order to come up with

00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:57,600
labels that were never appropriate to

00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,600
begin with anyway

00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:02,720
so we move on to education and on

00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:05,760
security

00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:07,200
in schools and physical get to go to

00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,880
school schools

00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,799
face fingerprint behavioral and

00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,520
temperature checks have become a new

00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:14,559
norm

00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,520
especially because of covid19 so at an

00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:18,640
entrance

00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,440
checking attendance getting access to

00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,679
meals

00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,520
even doing messaging with teachers are

00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,360
all becoming things that require

00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,840
students to hand over some sort of

00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:30,720
biometric information if not several

00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,240
bits of biometric information and remote

00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,960
edtech is doing it as well

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,640
facial behavioral cognitive also for

00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,360
checking things like attendance but also

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,640
doing

00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:44,080
tech proctoring sorry test proctoring or

00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,640
in vigilation regulators in sweden

00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,799
france

00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,720
poland and norway have all ruled that

00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:51,840
facial recognition in schools

00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,600
violates gdpr because first of all

00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:56,240
its schools abusing their power to

00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:58,080
withhold children's access to education

00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,440
and meals that makes consent just

00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,280
illegally coercive

00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,120
there's too much of a power imbalance

00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:05,039
and secondly that there were less

00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,880
intrusive ways to meet a goal if someone

00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:09,120
could just present say their school id

00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:11,520
card instead of having to give over

00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,480
their face and their voice and their

00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:16,400
fingerprints

00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:19,120
then that is a more appropriate solution

00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,799
so a school that used facial recognition

00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,559
in fact did have a data breach

00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:26,080
and it ended up exposing teachers and

00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:28,240
families communications completely

00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,760
and now let's look at proctoring which

00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:33,200
is exam monitoring

00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,200
also called in vigilation

00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:40,640
and it's really become such a strong

00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:42,720
set of mental burdens at this point

00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,280
that even young children are being

00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:47,200
tested this way

00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,559
proctoring you think of normally as

00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,080
something that's from a bit of a

00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:53,360
distance

00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:56,480
it's in a regulated environment you have

00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:59,600
pretty simple uh you know clear room

00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,480
whereas online proctoring is in your

00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:04,080
home

00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:06,240
and it's close up it's a camera

00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,400
this close to your face suddenly instead

00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,440
of way over on the other side of the

00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,240
room

00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,840
it's tracking all sorts of stuff that a

00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,760
in real life proctor

00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,440
would not get to know they're not

00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,799
supposed to be staring to watch your

00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,960
every eye movement

00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:22,080
or to hear every cough you make and

00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,840
decide just how

00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,440
much your brain is engaged while you're

00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,760
taking the test

00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,120
and all these things that are being done

00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:32,000
remotely then

00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:33,440
are accumulating bias invading privacy

00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,280
inviting abuse

00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:39,039
and indulging in ableism

00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,640
the premise really starts with that

00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:42,000
you're a liar

00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,919
if you're working from home you must be

00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,039
dishonest if

00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:48,480
you are uh you know if you are are not

00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:51,600
accepting of these terms

00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,039
then get used to it get used to being

00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:56,240
psychologically abused

00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:57,039
in school and at work by being called

00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,600
constantly

00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:59,600
a liar

00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,600
and now i'm going to just run through a

00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,159
quote here

00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,919
so all of you but one student violated a

00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:08,559
major testing protocol this is from a

00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,480
teacher

00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:11,840
everyone except one student resize their

00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,360
browser which means that you went to

00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,799
another website if that happens again

00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,600
you will get a zero on the next

00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:17,440
assignment

00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,120
you have to have a well-lit room you

00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,520
cannot take the test in the dark

00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:23,120
sit up if i only see your eyes then that

00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,880
is a violation of testing protocol you

00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,919
have to video record it clearly states

00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,080
in the syllabus

00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:29,679
you will get a zero no head coverings

00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,600
either for both males and females this

00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:32,000
means not what i call skull cap or

00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,919
regular

00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,440
caps and there were a lot of head and

00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,000
eye movements for such a short time

00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,080
period

00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,600
one student had six minutes of head and

00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:43,600
eye movements another had

00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:45,919
624 eye movements in eight minutes

00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,760
that's an indication of eyes moving away

00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:49,440
from the screen

00:24:47,760 --> 00:25:01,520
and this was followed by a threat to

00:24:49,440 --> 00:25:04,559
report people for academic discipline

00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:05,279
so psychological abuse has some key

00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:07,600
features

00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:08,400
like name calling calling someone lazy

00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,200
suspicious

00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,480
liar etc needing to know where you are

00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,400
at all times

00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:17,039
making threats to take away something

00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:19,279
important isolating the person from

00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:21,520
other assistant support

00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:23,120
digital spying keeping track of every

00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,720
little thing that you do with your

00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,799
computer

00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,039
violating boundaries otherwise invading

00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:30,880
privacy all these things collectively

00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:32,400
are the picture of psychological abuse

00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,760
they're also the picture

00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:37,360
of online and vigilation

00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,679
children who have been psychologically

00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:41,200
abused suffer from anxiety depression

00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:43,679
low self-esteem symptoms of

00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:46,159
post-traumatic stress and suicidality

00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:47,760
at about the same rate and in some cases

00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,840
at a greater rate than children who were

00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,279
physically or sexually abused

00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,279
among the three types of abuse

00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:55,760
psychological maltreatment was the most

00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:57,840
strongly associated with depression

00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:02,080
general anxiety social anxiety

00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:02,080
attachment problems and substance abuse

00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:09,919
all of this stuff is exposing

00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:11,760
students to racial bias and if you need

00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:13,600
more information about why i've actually

00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,840
done a talk on that and at the bottom

00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:18,159
there's a footnote telling you where

00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:20,159
against religious coverings your yamaka

00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:22,400
or your veil are off limits

00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:24,159
neurodiversity the fact that you move

00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:27,440
around your eyes because you

00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:28,880
have something like adhd or tourette's

00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:32,000
syndrome

00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:34,159
other disabilities class differences now

00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,159
that your whole home can be seen

00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:38,000
it becomes much more disconcerting to

00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:41,440
have the idea of your teacher being able

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,679
to see that you don't live as you know

00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,600
fancily as you would like others to

00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:47,520
believe if you're homeless this is

00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,279
particularly an acute fear to have to

00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,960
have that revealed

00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:52,720
even the privacy of your thoughts and

00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,960
interests become something open to

00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:57,120
inspection by the proctor

00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,440
and that means that also your home and

00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,960
everyone in it is also being subject to

00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,799
that same invasion

00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:07,840
it also provides opportunities for

00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:07,840
bullying and stalking

00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,919
so once you've shown that whole space

00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,360
sorry

00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:15,200
let me start over so before taking a

00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,799
test you must provide a photo id

00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,640
which it takes a picture of using your

00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:20,399
computer webcam then

00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,240
an example service proctorio takes a

00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:23,679
photo of the person taking the exam

00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,279
just to make sure that it really is you

00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:26,720
and it flags if the photos don't match

00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:28,080
this means anyone who doesn't look the

00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,720
same with their photo for very good

00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,799
reasons

00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,720
is called cheater you have to move very

00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:34,000
carefully record your workspace

00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,440
everything nearby

00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,360
make sure you're not in the room with

00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,559
anyone else if you share a room

00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,080
that's a problem because that's going to

00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:41,440
be flagged as cheating anyway and if

00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,440
your roommate has something

00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,880
sitting out that's also going to flag

00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,120
you with cheating so you have all these

00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,480
reasons for shame discomfort

00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,000
and then once you've finally shown that

00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,799
whole space you are able to take the

00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,240
exam

00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:54,559
but for the duration of the exam the

00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,760
camera and microphone are on recording

00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:57,360
the test taker

00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,960
not only are sounds picked up by the

00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:01,200
microphone going to be flagged

00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,720
but also flags every time the test taker

00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,279
looks away from the screen at

00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,799
all in the least problematic cases it

00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:09,600
flags for looking away

00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:11,120
while you're thinking in the worst cases

00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,240
it flags folks with physical

00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:16,559
disabilities

00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:18,480
as cheaters so some examples of the

00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:21,360
software that are in common use

00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,480
are proctorio proctor track proctoru and

00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,640
examity

00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:27,039
and all of the first three are using

00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:31,679
automated proctors examity uses

00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:33,440
a human for at least part of it

00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:34,960
and they variously are using some

00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,480
combination of

00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:41,039
phenotypical and behavioral biometrics

00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:43,200
as well as also non-biometric stuff that

00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:44,720
are really big invasions of privacy

00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,399
and the kind of stuff they require are

00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,120
things i was talking about they also

00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:52,399
require a fairly high level of technical

00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:53,679
um availability so it becomes another

00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:56,080
issue of i have to

00:28:53,679 --> 00:29:00,159
spend a whole bunch of money in order to

00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:02,240
be able to be spied on like this

00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:03,279
and all of it really is elevating

00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,600
speculation

00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:08,240
to some really harmfully false sense of

00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:10,159
objectivity

00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:13,840
it's not just gays tracking of students

00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:13,840
but also of workers

00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,520
so we get all of these assumptions and

00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:19,840
all of them really have

00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,200
alternate explanations that are not

00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,880
taken for granted

00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,960
there could be medical reasons that

00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,720
you're tired or you just want some

00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,720
privacy or you're thinking

00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,240
taking notes off to the side you're not

00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,120
someone who touch type so has to look

00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,520
down at the

00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,799
the keyboard maybe you're connecting via

00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,480
a handhold device

00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:39,360
there's so many different ways in which

00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:42,080
your supposed inappropriate behavior

00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:43,679
is just mundane behavior that is

00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,320
completely honest

00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:47,520
but is being now judged in ways that it

00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:50,640
never was before

00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:53,600
and the consequences of it are so high

00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,000
and note also that there's inherent cost

00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:57,360
to the

00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,240
system now teachers have to review hours

00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,960
and hours

00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,360
of video of students just moving their

00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,440
eyes

00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:05,360
or doing a little cough or someone just

00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:08,159
happened to poke their head in and say

00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:11,440
hey are you coming to dinner later all

00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:11,440
these things are enormous

00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:19,600
um and then we have the notion of phys

00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:23,840
physio

00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,840
physique on

00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:30,000
okay sorry which is a debunk junk

00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:30,880
science that the outer appearance can be

00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,120
used to infer

00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:38,240
inner character it's complete nonsense

00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:39,520
it's long been disproven but it ends up

00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,000
contributing to things like

00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,559
in some income on security higher view

00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,840
is

00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:48,799
a platform for recruiters

00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:51,360
and in it they track things like

00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:53,440
vocabulary word choices expressions

00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:55,039
and in a just 20-minute interview they

00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,919
collect all sorts of data

00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:59,600
and judge it based on things like um oh

00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:02,320
your use of pronouns

00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:04,640
that's not at all problematic for trans

00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,919
people is it

00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,760
so all these things are being used to

00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:10,720
make an assessment of your worth as a

00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:13,039
potential employee

00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,799
and here's another one eight and above

00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:18,640
and you can see this is actually

00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:20,720
done on a 30 second video cover letter

00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:23,919
is used to make all of these judgments

00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,919
about your character

00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:28,960
this is all called effectometric effect

00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,559
metrics

00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:35,519
and it's just it has

00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:36,640
no basis it's not supported by research

00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:39,200
it's mind reading

00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:41,279
in its latest form and there's so many

00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,320
ways that this stuff is being applied as

00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:46,000
if it is

00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:49,600
genuinely useful true and should be

00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:52,480
attended to but there is no substantial

00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:54,880
evidence at all for effectometrics

00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,919
it's just mind reading charlatanism and

00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,000
projection

00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:59,519
and projection is what really concerns

00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,360
me because

00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:02,799
this kind of pseudometric uh

00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:06,159
pseudomedical stuff

00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:08,880
has real problems when it's viewed as

00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:10,640
genuinely medical so for instance apple

00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:13,519
watch at least goes through some kind of

00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:16,159
scrutiny by federal authorities

00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:17,760
as a somewhat medical device whereas

00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:21,440
amazon halo the new

00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:24,000
um watch like tracker

00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:26,640
from amazon does not they haven't even

00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,240
tried to get that clearance

00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,919
so they make all these extraordinary

00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,760
claims but when you look down

00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:33,360
at what they're claiming on behalf of

00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:36,159
halo it's really

00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:37,600
shallow claiming that their expertise

00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:39,760
and artificial intelligence

00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:41,039
somehow implicitly make some experts in

00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,919
psychology

00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:46,320
that the way you speak can be used to

00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:49,519
tell you something about how others

00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:52,240
perceive you who is the other

00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:55,120
that this can all be used by judging

00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,880
your vocal expression your vocal tone

00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,640
to improve communication and

00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,640
relationships more of this

00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,679
more of it and third party consent is

00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,720
not in this picture

00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:05,360
at all so we're using this device to

00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,480
record

00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:09,519
the tone of your voice and then to judge

00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,799
from that

00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:14,880
something that is unknowable really and

00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:16,240
here's their research there's three data

00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:19,039
points

00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:20,399
and the first one is not about what

00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:22,159
they're claiming it's about the second

00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:22,960
one is not about what they're claiming

00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:27,120
it's about

00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:28,799
and the third one doesn't exist

00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,320
also the first two don't even link to

00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:31,519
any research at all they link back to

00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:34,320
the same page

00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:35,760
so we have the least amount of evidence

00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,840
it turns out to be zero amount of

00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:39,919
evidence

00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:42,480
no rigorous independent science going on

00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:42,480
here at all

00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,720
so here's the thing about that

00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:48,320
projection it's someone saying well i

00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,720
said a thing

00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,519
and the device saying well they think

00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:54,559
that what you

00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:54,559
feel is

00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,480
well the person didn't get any say in

00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,640
this at all

00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,600
they didn't get to consent to even being

00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,519
judged this way

00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:06,640
let alone having that judgment passed

00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:08,320
back projection casts an image onto a

00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,280
blank screen it's a psychological

00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,760
projections

00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:13,280
that are external representations that

00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,879
bear little result of little

00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,359
relationship with the person that

00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:20,639
they're being ascribed to

00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:22,079
and abusers love projection whether it's

00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:25,119
positive or negative

00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:28,159
it's really feeding into the abuser's

00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:30,320
tactics and satisfaction

00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:31,679
and something like this is right for

00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,960
that kind of abuse

00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,200
and while it certainly may not be

00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:37,440
intended that way again

00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:39,679
just because you didn't think about it

00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,280
doesn't mean it's not abusive

00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:43,520
it's up to us to actually think it

00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:48,159
through biometrics

00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:52,240
are altering power in so many ways

00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:52,240
and that hype is a weapon

00:34:53,040 --> 00:35:00,160
so for instance in india there was

00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:01,520
introduced nationwide an identification

00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,280
system that was supposed to be just a

00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,400
number essentially a primary key in a

00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:07,599
database

00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:09,200
based on face iris and fingers and the

00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:10,320
idea was that people who don't have an

00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,079
id can have an id

00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,760
this way it's inclusive it's easy and

00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:15,520
it's strictly up to you if you want to

00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:18,720
use it

00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:20,560
and so lots of people did and then it

00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:22,240
became much more compulsory in order to

00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:24,560
get basic benefits

00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:26,720
and the problem with that is that the

00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:28,720
system has shortcomings it didn't always

00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:31,920
work it doesn't always to this day

00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:33,440
work and nearly 300 000 people as a

00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,240
result ended up not getting their

00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,040
pensions

00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:38,640
who were deserving who earned them who

00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:41,280
were entitled to them

00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:43,680
but the system itself ad har was cutting

00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:46,480
them off

00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:47,760
here's an example someone who literally

00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:51,520
was unable to get

00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:52,640
a handful of wheat a smear sack of wheat

00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,480
because

00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:56,000
her fingerprints weren't recognized well

00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,240
as i mentioned earlier you know

00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,599
physical laborers certainly run into

00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,599
this issue all the time

00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:03,760
of your fingerprints being highly

00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:06,720
mutable

00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,760
um as of this january 1.2 billion

00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,920
indians

00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,920
already have an ad har and the ultimate

00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,040
goal is to have every single indian have

00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:17,280
an ad har

00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:19,440
very soon so two thirds of 4.7 percent

00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,560
of people whose biometrics failed during

00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,560
authentication

00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,760
were still able gate rations that sounds

00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,200
great right

00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:27,440
what a great claim except that the

00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:30,320
remaining one-third remain an

00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,960
urgent action item for india okay well

00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,920
that

00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:35,359
translates to 1.56 percent of highly

00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,599
impoverished people who

00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:38,960
still after all that couldn't get their

00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:40,400
food rations

00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,160
this is a really big deal those are

00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,839
people who could before

00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,440
and now they've been forced into using

00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:48,880
this biometric system

00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,520
they're much more vulnerable so mission

00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,920
creep

00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:54,000
designed for privileged bodies income

00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,160
insecurity food insecurity it

00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,280
all becomes issues that contribute to

00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:01,680
trust and safety on security

00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,480
unsecurity is constantly exploiting

00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:06,000
right now

00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:07,520
pandemic and protest temperature sensors

00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,200
i think i already mentioned are being

00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,560
widely used in schools as well as

00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,720
workplaces

00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:14,079
to try to detect whether someone may be

00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:16,720
infected

00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:17,760
it's junk science as well for reasons

00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,599
that i've already mentioned

00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:22,720
and others scientists have weighed in on

00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:25,760
this it's not reliable at all has really

00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:29,599
very little if no value

00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:33,520
as well surveillance to prevent contact

00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:36,079
so for instance this is a nurse in

00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:37,680
india saying at every step there were

00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:40,000
police present and there were drones

00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:42,640
being flown overhead constantly

00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,800
all through the night and in the morning

00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:46,320
all just to make sure that even just

00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,359
going out into the streets to give

00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,599
medical care

00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:52,480
with something treated with suspicion

00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:54,880
and surveillance

00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:57,520
clearview ai is one of the biggest

00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:01,280
aggregators of facial recognition

00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:02,720
data sets most of it is scraped

00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,720
and it's being used repeatedly to

00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:06,880
identify protesters they form

00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:08,720
partnerships with police agencies all

00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:12,160
over the country

00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:14,800
and this is what has resulted

00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:16,160
and this is an actual screenshot from a

00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:19,280
website of a company

00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:21,119
who makes facial recognition software

00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,880
and they go out of their way to show you

00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:24,880
exactly what they can do about

00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,560
identifying someone whose face is

00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,560
obstructed

00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,240
you've chosen these images very

00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:32,640
pointedly

00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,280
i can't help but wonder okay so you're

00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,520
saying

00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:37,280
you'll identify people who have

00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:39,440
religious head coverings

00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,640
people who are wearing masks and people

00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,000
who are protecting themselves from

00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:44,640
chemical attacks

00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,440
this is not a benign technology that you

00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:50,320
are selling today

00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:52,160
and unmasking is a really popular new

00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:55,119
application

00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:57,680
so you can use periocular as well as

00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:59,520
voice gait tattoos clothes mask

00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:02,720
all of them collectively especially by

00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:08,720
layering them in multimodal

00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:08,720
analysis become very tightly identifying

00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:13,359
civil insecurity so being a civilian on

00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:17,200
the ground

00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:18,320
during military activity killer robots

00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:21,520
is the term given for

00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:23,520
lethal autonomous weapon systems that is

00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,800
systems that are meant to make decisions

00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:28,079
on their own about

00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:31,200
who to kill and when so using

00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:36,480
entirely the systems biometrics

00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:39,920
and other you know data points to decide

00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:41,599
you choose go ahead

00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,960
as technology becomes more advanced and

00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:45,119
especially as things like facial

00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,800
recognition are adapted to drones

00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:48,000
you wind up with situations where you

00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,760
can literally be conducting

00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,839
individualized surveillance

00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:54,079
on dozens or more people potentially

00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:56,880
even hundreds at a time

00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:58,160
and this is being used as well by us

00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:01,440
immigration

00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:03,599
um and homeland security all of them

00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:06,160
that are not military they are

00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:09,200
paramilitary they are civilian

00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:12,160
uh and yet using this the same way as if

00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:13,760
it were as it was originally intended

00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:16,880
for military use

00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:19,440
not so far to kill people but certainly

00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:22,960
to engage in practices that have

00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:25,440
uh the side effect of being dangerous or

00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:28,079
deadly

00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,440
military biometrics is themselves so

00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:31,839
project maven was

00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,599
a project that formerly was at google

00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:37,040
and now is a palantir

00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:38,560
that would uh enable drones operated by

00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:41,040
the army and air force

00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:43,599
to automatically identify people among

00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,599
other things

00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:47,359
and this actually got pushed back and

00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:49,599
i'm really happy to say that and we'll

00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:52,319
delve into that more a little bit later

00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:55,040
but moving on to refugees

00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:55,920
there are over 100 million i'm sorry one

00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,560
million

00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:01,440
muslim rohingya in the world's largest

00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:04,560
refugee camp

00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:07,760
they're in an area of bangladesh

00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:10,640
i'm sorry in myanmar going back okay in

00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:15,119
bangladesh having fled myanmar

00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:15,119
and it's an enormous set of camps

00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,960
the united nations investigators

00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,160
detailed atrocities

00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,000
that they were fleeing that were

00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:23,599
committed by the myanmar military

00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,800
against the rohingya

00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:28,880
during the 2017 crackdown

00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:31,040
and the government called for those

00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:35,359
responsible to be prosecuted

00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:38,400
for genocidal intent

00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:41,280
rohingya refugees have gone through

00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,160
atrocities the photographs the

00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:45,280
descriptions

00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:46,720
are really hard to hear but if you're

00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:50,400
willing this article

00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:54,000
is a really comprehensive look

00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:56,400
at how biometrics are endangering

00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,040
the lives of rohingya who are already

00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:00,720
fleeing

00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:02,079
violence and that's sort of the premise

00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:05,119
the united nations is

00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:06,720
forcing them to use biometric ids for

00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:10,000
its own purposes

00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:11,520
which are giving aid but they are

00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,440
forcing this on

00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:15,280
populations all around the world that

00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:17,040
they are there to help

00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,720
and the premise essentially is give us

00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:22,000
your biometrics or

00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:23,599
you know your life is at stake we won't

00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:27,359
kill you but we will

00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:29,920
leave you with no food no shelter

00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:31,839
so without having to say that everybody

00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:35,280
understands that that is the price

00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:35,280
and so it's very coercive

00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:39,760
when there's nothing left but your body

00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:42,319
and now they want that too

00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,119
how does that feel when literally you

00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:47,680
have left

00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:49,839
everything behind your entire life

00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:51,760
and this is all you have is your

00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:54,240
physical self

00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:56,079
and then that too is being stripped from

00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:59,200
you

00:42:56,079 --> 00:43:01,200
7.2 million refugees biometric data has

00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:03,359
been taken by the u.n already and they

00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:06,560
continue to increase those numbers

00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:08,640
that was two years ago

00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:10,960
they're fleeing violence and persecution

00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:12,720
on the basis of their very identities so

00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:14,160
now their most infinite intimate

00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:15,280
information is being collected and

00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,280
stored

00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:18,480
in a database that they have no control

00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:21,520
over

00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:23,359
um and the un really makes us they sell

00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:25,200
this this is their own

00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:26,720
data sheets in which they talk about how

00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:29,119
great this is and out of those

00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:31,040
seven plus million people the only quote

00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:33,280
they could manage to find was um

00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:35,760
and now you'll always know me that's the

00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:38,880
biggest testimonial how warm is that

00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:41,839
um it's about

00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:43,599
it's about bureaucratic assistance about

00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:46,240
bureaucratic convenience

00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:47,040
and there is benefit to that but for the

00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:49,440
individual

00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:52,160
it's taking something well giving their

00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:54,640
very little back

00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:55,920
so their fingers all the fingers both

00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:58,079
irises and their face

00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:01,440
all have to be scanned in order to be

00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:01,440
able to get aid

00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:08,720
um but you know this whole notion of

00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:10,720
consent obviously is an obscene fiction

00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:12,000
because of that extraordinary power and

00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:14,720
balance

00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,720
and as well the agencies because they're

00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:18,560
controlling the food

00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:20,079
and in cooperation with governments the

00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:23,920
governments themselves

00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:26,960
the host governments are also trying to

00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:28,240
control the data it's useful to them and

00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:31,280
the countries they're fleeing

00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:32,560
also want to control the data everyone

00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,880
has an argument as to

00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:36,720
why it should not just be the uns or the

00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,240
peoples but also belong to other

00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,920
governments

00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:41,760
and they're weaponizing that access

00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:43,599
using it to control people's movements

00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,800
deny access to driver's license and

00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:47,280
other privileges

00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:48,240
enforce bans on employment maintain

00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,880
forcible

00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:52,800
forcible segregation surveil refugee

00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:55,680
populations and individuals

00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:58,160
crack down on protests and even commit

00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:01,680
atrocities

00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:01,680
all with the u.n zone data

00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:04,960
which brings us to genocide human rights

00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:07,680
experts

00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:09,119
agree that cultural genocide is the

00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:11,280
accurate term

00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:15,680
for what is happening to ethnic muslim

00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:15,680
uighurs in china's xinjiang province

00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:20,560
these are pictures just published a few

00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,319
weeks ago by buzzfeed

00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:23,760
which did a really comprehensive

00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:27,680
investigation

00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:30,240
using images from web

00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:31,520
mapping service in china it found

00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:33,760
blurred out areas

00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,560
and compared them to other satellites

00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:37,680
images

00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:38,560
and discovered uh numerous prisons had

00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,880
been built

00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:41,880
that were accommodating thousands of

00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:47,839
people

00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:47,839
268 newly built imprisonment compounds

00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:53,200
one million people which is every person

00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:54,880
in either clone or odessa

00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:56,240
that's how many people have been sent

00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:58,720
into mass detention

00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:01,599
into these camps with no trial no

00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:03,760
charges they're not considered

00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:05,359
criminals they're not conflicts they're

00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:09,119
just people who are suspect

00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:09,119
and that's the basis for their detention

00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:14,000
one million uighurs is half the

00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:16,079
population of paris or vienna

00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,280
this is the context for just how big

00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:20,560
these numbers really

00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:22,400
are it's the largest scale detention of

00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:23,119
ethnic and religious minorities since

00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:26,319
world war

00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:28,319
ii and muslims in xinjiang half the

00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:31,440
entire population of the region

00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:34,640
are under perpetual surveillance as well

00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:35,359
so panopticon is a concept that's pretty

00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:37,839
old

00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:39,280
and it's the concept of essentially

00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:41,680
being able to create an environment in

00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:44,079
which only one person has to watch

00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:45,920
in order for everyone to feel watched

00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:48,720
and it's that sense of uncertainty about

00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:51,599
who is being watched right now that ends

00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:54,240
up making people self-police themselves

00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:55,680
so the system makes it possible to scale

00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:58,720
greatly

00:46:55,680 --> 00:47:00,560
with very little effort ethic and

00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:02,400
religious minorities in china are being

00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:04,800
faced with that panopticon

00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,400
so many ways in which their biometrics

00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:08,160
are being collected and used to

00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:10,319
constantly surveil them

00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:11,280
and collected via things like mandatory

00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:14,319
physicals

00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:18,160
police checks and constant monitoring by

00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:18,160
public video on cctvs

00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:22,640
so i've kind of skipped over data ethics

00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:24,800
and that's because

00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:26,640
it's first of all it's a subject that

00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:28,000
deserves a whole talk in itself and

00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:29,359
there's already quite a few of those

00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,720
talks so i'm not going to worry that it

00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:33,119
hasn't been covered

00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:35,440
but an interesting new premise has been

00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:37,920
raised recently that we are in

00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:39,599
we've been in a series of waves of how

00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:40,559
we conceptualize data ethics and that

00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:44,880
right now we're in

00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:47,920
a third wave and it's from this article

00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:50,960
which i again recommend by the leader of

00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:52,880
the ada lovelace institute

00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:54,319
and where we've been do what we've been

00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:56,880
doing is progressing from

00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:59,359
a sense of well what should we do and in

00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:01,280
that first wave it's very philosophical

00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:03,680
talking about principles of you know

00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:06,960
fairness accountability transparency

00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:08,559
a notion of uh you know in the end ai

00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:11,119
is going to solve a lot of problems we

00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:14,160
just need to philosophically work out

00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:17,920
how to do this right um and second wave

00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:20,160
focuses on the technical that it centers

00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:21,440
technology and technologists that we can

00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:24,079
fix this stuff

00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:26,480
just by doing a little more tuning

00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:29,599
adding some more data to training sets

00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:32,800
that intervening in some way will

00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:33,760
finally result in just the perfect

00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:36,960
algorithm

00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:40,160
and then everything will be ethical

00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:42,000
and third wave which is where we are now

00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:44,720
looks at a much bigger picture of

00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:47,200
societal impact

00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:48,240
how is power impacted how is equity

00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:52,000
impacted

00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:55,760
what action can we take so expose

00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:57,599
critique and change systems of power

00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:59,680
and these are not mutually exclusive

00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:00,319
it's not that the first and second waves

00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:02,160
are wrong

00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:04,559
or need to go away they're all

00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:05,839
progressive so we have to move along

00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:08,079
this continuum

00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:11,040
and a big problem is that right now the

00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:13,440
industry is kind of stalled at wave one

00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:14,960
and a bit at wave two and we really need

00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:17,599
to be moving forward

00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:18,640
definitely at least into second wave but

00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:20,480
realistically

00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:23,839
we need to all get together on third

00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:26,000
wave because impact is a really big deal

00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:28,319
whose power are we reinforcing whose

00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,319
vulnerability are we exacerbating

00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:32,480
what threats do our actions and

00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:34,559
inactions contribute to that

00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:36,480
and whose problems are we trying to

00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:37,760
solve we start off with this premise

00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:39,599
that everything's going to be solved

00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:41,359
well whose

00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:45,839
and whose solutions might we be

00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:45,839
unraveling in the process

00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:52,000
the narrow focus on technical fairness

00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:53,680
is really insufficient it confines us to

00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,400
thinking only about whether something

00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:56,720
works

00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:59,839
but doesn't permit us to ask whether it

00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:59,839
should work at all

00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:05,200
the movement tech won't build it was

00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:08,880
started

00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:13,040
in response to project maven google

00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:15,200
employees organized and refused to build

00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:18,800
oppressive technologies such as

00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:20,800
automated weapons

00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:22,000
and one of the leaders actually ended up

00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,920
resigning and he says

00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,079
i resigned and i walked out with a big

00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:27,920
smile on my face after i orchestrated

00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:29,760
with co-workers a huge campaign to stop

00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:31,520
google from building ai drones for the

00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:33,440
us military

00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:35,920
so taking that kind of big step can feel

00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:39,280
really scary and legitimately so

00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:41,440
but it also can feel really good

00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:43,359
it can really feel like i have done

00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:45,760
something that brings meaning

00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:46,800
to the world and how does that make me

00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:49,760
feel

00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:51,280
so when we evaluate really hard choices

00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:55,040
it helps to evaluate them

00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:56,559
in a bigger picture in context

00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:58,720
some of the commitments that we've been

00:50:56,559 --> 00:51:00,640
asked to make are

00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:02,720
to sign this pledge from the

00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:05,359
reprogramming war project

00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:06,960
also called pax and you can see their

00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:08,559
url there

00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:10,640
so setting out some real public

00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:12,559
commitments and policies

00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:14,079
for building this stuff and essentially

00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:16,559
those are we won't

00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:19,040
i won't tech won't build it our company

00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:22,000
won't and i individually won't

00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:24,319
further asks are to please defund facial

00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,680
recognition as part of the defund police

00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:27,680
movement

00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:30,960
and you can read a lot more about that

00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:34,319
at this url at the atlantic

00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:37,359
and then the safe face pledge

00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:41,119
which was started by the researchers

00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:44,240
on various aspects of

00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:46,079
facial recognition data and

00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:47,520
people of color and you can see it's a

00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:50,400
pretty long pledge

00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:51,839
but it's really um i think the details

00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:53,920
of itself regardless of whether you

00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:56,079
personally sign on to these pledges

00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:57,200
they give a framework for thinking about

00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:59,839
third wave

00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:02,040
and what actions really can be taken and

00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:04,160
making decisions about what one will

00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:05,599
take

00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:09,920
and then we come to the final and

00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:12,400
biggest one existential on security

00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:14,559
applied biometrics is being built on top

00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:17,839
of a foundation of junk science

00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:20,480
prejudices abuse technical debt

00:52:17,839 --> 00:52:22,480
and ultimately that ethical debt and the

00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:24,319
price that we're paying for taking all

00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:28,400
that power over bodies

00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:31,440
and endowing unsecurity onto them

00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:33,599
are climate change we're in a year of

00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,800
record fires record heat record

00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:38,240
hurricanes

00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:42,559
multiple fire tornadoes at once siberia

00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:44,559
is melting the arctic shelf is crumbling

00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:46,079
and yet the baseline minimum carbon

00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:50,880
impact of training a research

00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:54,800
quality natural language processor is

00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:59,760
equivalent to taking 300 flights

00:52:54,800 --> 00:53:02,880
round trip to from porto to delhi

00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:03,920
that's what we're making we can't wait

00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:05,839
for regulations

00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:07,680
around the world legislators and courts

00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:09,599
are still dithering over whether even

00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:11,599
those first wave basics like fairness

00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:13,920
accountability and transparency are

00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:16,240
necessary let alone whether and how

00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:17,040
biometrics violate civil rights or human

00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:18,800
rights

00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:20,640
when they do consider biometrics they're

00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:21,680
preoccupied foremost with just facial

00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:23,599
recognition as

00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:25,359
if it's the only one or the only one

00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:27,280
posing threats anyway

00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:29,440
their concern focuses on threats posed

00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:32,400
by privacy and by inaccuracy

00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:35,200
in policing but they show little regard

00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:37,440
for threats imposed by precision

00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:38,880
and they disregard the role of consumers

00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:42,720
including individuals and

00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:44,800
non-governmental organizations like un

00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:46,400
they neglect to invite tech workers to

00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:48,400
the table in any of these crucial

00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:50,400
discussions they greet billionaires as

00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:51,280
spokespeople for every person in our

00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:53,280
industry

00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:56,160
they take for granted that c levels and

00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:58,480
academics understand applied technology

00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:59,200
better than the people who build and use

00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:01,040
it

00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:02,880
they don't ask us whether we want our

00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:03,680
industry to center the self-interest of

00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:05,760
bcs

00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:08,240
or whether we'd rather our labor be used

00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:10,800
to prioritize humanity

00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:11,920
we can't wait for them to draw lines in

00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:14,640
the sand

00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:15,040
they're too far behind and they always

00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:19,680
will

00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:22,880
be so it's up to us

00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:26,079
to make choices to take stands

00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:28,960
to take concrete actions and the

00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:33,520
question i have for you is what will you

00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:33,520
do next thank you

00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:38,799
i have resources for you as well i'll be

00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:40,400
posting the deck

00:54:38,799 --> 00:54:42,880
but i've got a lot of stuff for you

00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:45,119
including video lists twitter lists

00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:47,440
and recommendations for a variety of

00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:47,440
books

00:54:47,839 --> 00:55:06,799
that are very relevant and wonderful

00:54:53,200 --> 00:55:08,880
thank you

00:55:06,799 --> 00:55:08,880
