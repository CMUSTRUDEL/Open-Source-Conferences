"Ceci n'est pas un job" by Leila Verhaegen

More than once I have had the pleasure of being informed that my job (which by the way, is also the job of quite a few members of the DjangoCon audience) is not a “real” job. In this talk I will try to discover what a “real job” is. I will also find out more about what is “real”, and what is a “job”. As a person who allegedly does not have a real job, and who comes from a country (Belgium) whose reality some people also doubt, I am ideally placed to make these discoveries. I will enlist the assistance of some famous Belgians, including the famous philosopher-actor Jean-Claude Van Damme (not a real actor, according to some; not a real philosopher, according to others) and the artist René Magritte. I plan to show that being a web developer is not really a job - it’s much more important than that.
