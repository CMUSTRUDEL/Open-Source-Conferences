"Ceci n'est pas un job" by Leila Verhaegen

More than once I have had the pleasure of being informed that my job (which by the way, is also the job of quite a few members of the DjangoCon audience) is not a “real” job. In this talk I will try to discover what a “real job” is. I will also find out more about what is “real”, and what is a “job”. As a person who allegedly does not have a real job, and who comes from a country (Belgium) whose reality some people also doubt, I am ideally placed to make these discoveries. I will enlist the assistance of some famous Belgians, including the famous philosopher-actor Jean-Claude Van Damme (not a real actor, according to some; not a real philosopher, according to others) and the artist René Magritte. I plan to show that being a web developer is not really a job - it’s much more important than that.

00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:26,080
treissande's image

00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:30,000
which was a painting representing a pip

00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,000
on this painting it was written

00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,079

prosciutto burger

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,840

00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,800

00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,000

van damme

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,439
and web development i'll use some codes

00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,080
well

00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:09,840
a lot of codes of junkrat vandam and

00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,960
apply them to the web dev

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:16,159
web world sorry let's begin

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:19,200
with a little story i often heard

00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:21,600
that my job was not a real job

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,119
that the fact i work at home was too

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,479
easy

00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:30,159
and that's that it was not working

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,720
those remarks hurt me i remember that

00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,520
thing

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,320
my mom did few years ago we were in

00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,799
winter

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,159
what were blocked by snow and my mom

00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,720
called me

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,119
to see if i could go to our city to pick

00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:46,159
up my little brother

00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:49,759
and well i accepted because

00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:52,640
it was my brother the city was a 45

00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:56,000
minutes drive from my home

00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,079
in her and when

00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,280
and when i arrived the father of my

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,280
brother was original

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:08,080
i had busted almost of the day

00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,720
and risked my life for nothing because i

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,760
nothing

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:14,959
better have to do anyway

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:18,800
also sometimes

00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:21,599
people call us to see if we are freed

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,000
or if they can come over because they

00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,599
know that

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,680
we are home and they are on holidays

00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:30,239
and they are looking for an afternoon or

00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,959
stuff or stuff like that

00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,360
in this talk i'll use some codes to show

00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,480
you

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,840
why our job is more than that

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,840
and why we have a lot of

00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:45,280
responsibilities

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:48,560
but before that if those remarks can't

00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:51,360
can hurt me can they also mourners yes

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,800
i think so is there something that we

00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,480
can do about that

00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,480
the answer is also yes

00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,080
a small disclaimer to be able to

00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,879
continue um

00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,440
i imagined and wrote this talk before

00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:07,680
the start of the pandemic

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,560
since the start of it some things have

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,000
changed

00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,760
homeworkers are better seen as well

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,400
workers

00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,519
but there are still a lot of people who

00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,879
don't know consider

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:23,920
working at home to be actually working

00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,200
a friend of mine regularly used the well

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,440
i work at home

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,920
joke to say that she was no longer

00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,920
working

00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,000
but why jungle than them let's see

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,720
what's

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,239
wikipedia tell us about him in the

00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,599
french speaking world

00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:44,159
vandam is well known and often mocked

00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,799
for the picturesque aphorism that he

00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,080
delivers

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:49,120
on a wide range of topics personal

00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,720
well-being

00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:55,599
spirituality environment woman

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,000
dogs this ability to hack walnuts with

00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,959
it

00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,239
with these buttocks its realization that

00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,200
christianism

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,159
is flowed based on the fact that snakes

00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,000
are nice

00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:08,560
and uppers contain pectin which is

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,959
anti-cholesterol etc

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,760
it's not considered as a real

00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,840
philosopher

00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,840
nor bilateral

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,040
web development is not just a job it's

00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,840
also

00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:26,800
responsibilities creativity power

00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:30,639
and creation but we will see more

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,639
details about that during the torque

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,400
um yes there is first force ideas i want

00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,360
to change

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,479
i'm pretty sure there is more than that

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,320
but i have

00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:48,000
two force ideas in mind the first one is

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:51,440
homeworker i'm not well real worker

00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:55,120
and the second one is we can't

00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:56,479
live from old job i know sometimes i

00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,479
repeat myself

00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:03,520
but i think this is very important to do

00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:07,280
yes there is some first ideas about

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:09,680
workshop because yes homeworker have

00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,440
real job would you work out sorry

00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,560
exactly like others

00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,160
like sellers like plumber nurses or

00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,280
doctors

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:24,479
we all have a real job we all

00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:27,680
are we we are we are a real worker

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:30,960
there is also this question that i often

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:34,000
hurt but can you really live

00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:37,520
from your job but um yes

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
i think so well as often as we as long

00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,039
as we have

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,039
work we can't live

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:48,880
jungle fandom state the cycle

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:50,160
the cycle of the cosmos in life it is a

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:54,479
big wheel

00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:57,759
which is made of things moments feelings

00:05:54,479 --> 00:06:00,560
and the truth is that there is no truth

00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,680
the truth is you have to find your own

00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,319
truth

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,960
my own truth how do you want me to talk

00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,080
to you

00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:10,880
this way you would have spoken to me

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,600
five years ago or three years ago or six

00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,800
months ago

00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,639
or yesterday or tomorrow you would have

00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,440
spoken to me that way

00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:21,840
i couldn't have answered you that way

00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,000
and thanks my own truth

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,919
of which i don't have to unfortunately

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,680
of the truth yet

00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,520
i can't speak to you in a more

00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,720
sophisticated way

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,199
however ago i would love i i would have

00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,319
told

00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:38,800
you about my musculars by

00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,440
how much i hate in the morning how

00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,440
beautiful

00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:46,000
and how how strong i am i'm the best

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,000
last year

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:54,880
no sorry but in truth there is no better

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:58,240
interest there is each himself

00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,840
we all change growing up our minds

00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,880
evolve

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:06,479
last year we did not have the same truth

00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:09,120
or the same desires as today last year

00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:11,919
i will never do this talk this year i

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,840
want to send messages

00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:16,240
today i want to talk more about

00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:20,479
injustice

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:23,280
sexism homophobia racism and more

00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,639
i'm not utopian but i would like to try

00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,720
to change the world

00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,160
if i can't do it with my job it's a good

00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,479
point

00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,440
but i think that i will really invest

00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,840
myself

00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,160
more in the causes that seem important

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,160
to me

00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:42,800
trust yourself you have to believe

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:45,039
even more what you believe and when you

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,960
start to believe what you believe

00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,479
there is no one in the world who can

00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,520
move you

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:54,400
chocolate and them trust

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:57,039
yourself trust your job and what you do

00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:00,080
because no one will do it for you

00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:02,080
during a few during few years i had the

00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:05,039
impostor syndrome

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,319
i absolutely didn't believe in myself in

00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:10,560
my abilities

00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:13,680
fortunately i was very surrounded

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:16,879
i thought i had things to prove

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:19,919
and today i'm more strong

00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,560
i believe in myself in what i do in my

00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,759
work

00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:26,720
under my under i'm a champion

00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:28,560
if i tell you that today it's because

00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,639
the fact that i received critics from

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,680
people about my job

00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:35,200
about my capacities about the fact i

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:39,120
learned everything by myself

00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:42,800
touch me it's because of that remarks

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,800
that i didn't believe in myself

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:50,000
when you get in an elevator you think

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,800
as a lot of things to creations to

00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,240
people

00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,800
to memories so we are never we are never

00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,160
alone

00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:02,000
spiritually but

00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:06,000
physically in the envelope if i'm alone

00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:09,120
well here i am and i stay there

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,839
until the doors open and then i start to

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,800
work

00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,880
i move my envelope towards my everyday

00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,200
mission

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,240
in the envelope and daily job your hard

00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,120
work

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,279
working from home in an open space with

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,320
your headphones on

00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:28,560
but when left alone with your trust

00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,760
you realize that you don't live alone in

00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,880
this world

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:35,120
you create things might your creations

00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:38,800
have an impact on the world

00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,800
let's take a look at an example

00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:47,040
creation of the web by tim berners-lee

00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:50,080
it was intended to help people share

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:53,200
work related information

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,000
the web is in fact used for watching

00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,200
learn cuts

00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,839
was no attendee but generally good

00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:02,480
searching stack overflow on google was

00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,480
intended

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,720
porn was not it was not attended but no

00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,519
judgement

00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,880
bullying not undead but bad

00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:14,399
radicalization

00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,399
knowing from that but very bad

00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:19,279
good days unintended uses have been

00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:22,720
foreseen

00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:25,760
locals probably not radicalization

00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:28,880
yes improving communication also

00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,079
improves the means of spreading

00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,279
propaganda

00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:35,920
and propaganda leads to radicalization

00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:36,320
should we have thought about it at the

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,720
time

00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:42,800
probably not but now today in 2020

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,440
we should know better we have to think

00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,920
about this kind of things

00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,120
a lot of web developers are her own in

00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,440
their job

00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,640
they work from home and there there is

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,880
others

00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:58,880
who work in an office with other people

00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,000
when you work from home a lot of people

00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:04,160
don't really consider you

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:07,760
as actually working compared to people

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,760
who go to the office every day

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,800
the human being in general in life

00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:18,160
reacts

00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:20,959
we react that is to say we do what we

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:24,160
are to do we are supposed to do

00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:26,399
work eat i apologize for the expression

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:29,279
but cheat

00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,000
but i found that a human being has to

00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:33,120
create

00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,399
that's true in our job

00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:40,480
we react we react to critique from

00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:43,760
employers from customers

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,480
we react to customers demand that we

00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,800
accept

00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,360
because that's how we can afford food at

00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:53,760
the end of the month

00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:56,720
but do not just react create

00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:59,279
the second coat on the slide is my motto

00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,200
is always recreate on self

00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,600
you have to recreate yourself to

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,800
recreate a better you

00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:10,000
and that is very hard and and

00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,680
and it's very hazy at the same time and

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,480
the last one is

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,000
you have to fight to try not to repeat

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,880
or mistakes

00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,000
they are easy to remember but always

00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:25,680
repeat we always repeat them

00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,839
humans make mistakes and it's okay

00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,600
but only if we use it to improve

00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:33,279
ourselves

00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:36,079
i really think in our job we can't

00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:37,600
just react to something sometimes we

00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:40,480
have to think about

00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,079
what we are doing is this a good project

00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,279
for me

00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:46,639
does it match with my values we also

00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:49,760
have to create

00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:52,720
yes we have to transfer to the desires

00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:54,639
of the customer that's a fact but we

00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:58,800
also need to show ourselves

00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,800
show what we can do create new things

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,839
i will read two codes one

00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:07,120
from jean-claude van vandam and the

00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:10,399
others from

00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:13,760
kant so junkrat and them said

00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:16,880
i'm fascinated by the earth if we remove

00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,800
the air from the sky all the birds will

00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,920
fall to the ground

00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:25,360
and the plans too at the same time

00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:28,720
there you can't touch it it said

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:32,399
it exists and it does not exist

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:36,480
it fits man without being being hungry

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:39,279
it's magic deer is beautiful

00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,720
at the same time at the same time you

00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:44,079
can't see it

00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:48,160
it's soft and you can't touch it there

00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:51,199
is a bit like my brain and can't say

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,639
the light though delighted of when in

00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:55,920
its free flight

00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:59,440
its split tier was resistant it feels

00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,920
made to wizard it that way wood to even

00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,680
better

00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:05,920
in emptier space

00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,839
van damme and can't express the same

00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,720
concept here

00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,760
what is also applicable to ie closer

00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,040
limitations

00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:17,360
because no browser not there

00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,639
we have to protect web because web is

00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,360
like our brain

00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,720
and we want to protect our brain we want

00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:26,000
to protect it from

00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,800
bad things that could happen so we have

00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,160
to do the same

00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:32,079
with the web if you make good choice in

00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:36,720
your research on the web

00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:36,720
in your work you will protect your web

00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:45,839
yeah we read all our quotes

00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:45,839
well done everyone

00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,839
there's a point i really wanted to abort

00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:53,199
on this talk

00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:55,839
it's sexism the web world

00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:57,279
is one of the more sexist words woman

00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,680
and minority

00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,880
has a lot of difficulty to be integrated

00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,880
on

00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,320
jean-claude van damme said some sexist

00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,720
code as well

00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:09,120
i didn't show them to you but i wanted

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,040
to talk about that

00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,320
some people think that women in

00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,360
particular

00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,399
can't work in the web board but what i

00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,279
wanted to

00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,560
wanted to tell you is that everyone can

00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:23,519
do this job

00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:25,440
as a woman a man a john the free or

00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,760
whatever

00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,800
we all can have the same performance

00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,920
because

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,519
what is important is not our envelope is

00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,000
what we are inside

00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:38,000
the way we have to create things to show

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,160
to the world what we can do

00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:45,600
and that is more important than anything

00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:48,079
but what job really mean

00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,279
the word the word trade from latin

00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:51,759
triparium

00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:52,560
is a virtual instrument if one of your

00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,040
here think

00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,600
that his job is a total instrument

00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,399
please

00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,399
think about this talk think that you

00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,480
have the power to change that

00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,000
you can change this structure intro it

00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:08,399
will into a wonderful

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:11,040
and wonderful and passionate job

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:15,120
i finished with the talk but i would

00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:15,120
like to show you my own conclusions

00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:24,079
for me you dream and for everyone

00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:27,519
even if people don't know it and

00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:31,519
even if they don't do it if they

00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:33,920
don't know it they know it the dream

00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,639
it's a feeling it's a sensation a

00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,920
sensation

00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:40,079
will that happen if we want

00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,680
for me since the day i wrote my first

00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:44,480
line of code

00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,040
i wanted to be a real developer and

00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,800
today

00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:51,040
my dream is realized i worked hard

00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,240
for that and i still have a lot of work

00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,440
to do

00:16:52,240 --> 00:17:00,639
but i'm on the good way so please

00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:00,639
always to choose trust in your dreams

00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:09,280
another quote of jean-claude van damme

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,079
the big fight is against yourself

00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,799
the victory is to have understood what

00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:16,400
you want

00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:19,039
and belief and to believe in it

00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,760
for me today it's done i believe in

00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:22,720
myself

00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,280
and i hope that if for you it's not it's

00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,199
not

00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,919
i could have helped you a little bit

00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,919
with my talk

00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:38,720
my work model is myself i am my best

00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:43,520
role model because i know my mistakes

00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:46,960
my qualities my victories and my defeats

00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,679
if i spend my take as if if i spend my

00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,880
time taking

00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:53,919
another model as a model how do you

00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:56,000
expect this model to be able to model in

00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:59,120
the correct line

00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,480
to me that's not really true i have

00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,520
another model

00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,000
who is my partner she teach me a lot of

00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,120
things

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:10,320
about life about web development

00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:13,440
but in the fact i think this course

00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,799
is quite true you are you are your

00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:19,360
better model because

00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:22,720
you know yourself last one

00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:24,640
the world is made of of our is made up

00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:28,080
of ours and molecules

00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,039
and electricity like the big bang you

00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,320
see

00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:37,039
and you see and

00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:40,640
all of that together makes the universe

00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:43,840
i think this is quite the same from

00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,799
web world because the web world is made

00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:59,520
consider gcd uh

00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:01,919
more a philosopher than a memories

00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,760
oh okay the question is do you consider

00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:06,799
gcd to be more

00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:13,120
of a philosopher or an amorist

00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:17,919
and i consider him more

00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:17,919
i i don't think it's funny

00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:41,840

sometimes what you talked because

00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:23,280
i guess because the mic was too close

00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:24,159
to your mouth or something but accept

00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:28,640
