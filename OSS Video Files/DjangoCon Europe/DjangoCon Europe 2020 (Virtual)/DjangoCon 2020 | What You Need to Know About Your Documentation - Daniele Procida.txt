"What You Need to Know About Your Documentation" by Daniele Procida

Over the past few years, the documentation system I developed has gained a great deal of traction (that article alone is consistently read well over 5000 times a month). It’s being used by companies for public and private documentation sets and in open-source software projects, and has helped improved the lives and work of numerous documentation creators and users. Whatever your documentation, and whatever state it’s in, one hour after you walk into this session you will be in possession of a basic plan to improve it, and enough understanding to begin carrying out that plan. Your document will be better as a result.

hello

00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,000
everybody it's very nice to be part of

00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:10,800
this first

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,480
remote djangocon europe a huge amount of

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,480
work has gone into this event so

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,920
many thanks to the organizers for

00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,920
putting it all together

00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,080
in case you don't already know me i'm

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,680
daniele chief

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:29,039
collaboration officer at dvo

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,080
and at dvo we have a web application

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,480
deployment and cloud

00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,520
management platform we have hosting

00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,440
clients including

00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,280
for example companies like fidelity

00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,520
international and ubs

00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,040
ubs i can mention but sadly i'm not

00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:45,280
permitted to use their logo

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,800
here and if your business is creating

00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,600
web applications but you find that

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,399
things like provisioning new s3 storage

00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,079
instances or migrating a complex

00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,000
application to a different

00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,120
cloud region can cost you a lot in

00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,199
effort or money

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,640
or maybe just too much time spent crying

00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:03,440
in front of your computer

00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,799
then maybe dvo can help you you don't

00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,119
have to be the size of

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,760
fidelity or ubs and you don't even have

00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:12,000
to be at the tearful stage and in fact

00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,880
it's always better to get help before

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,200
you reach that

00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,200
point

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,119
i'd be very happy to talk to you about

00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:21,840
that but

00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:22,640
what i'm here to talk to you about is

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,200
technical

00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,680
documentation and the key thing to

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:31,680
understanding documentation is this

00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:34,880
that documentation isn't just one thing

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,520
it's four different things

00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:40,159
and we speak of it as if it were one

00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,640
thing monolithic or even homogeneous

00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,520
but that has the effect of concealing

00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,000
its nature

00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,000
from us

00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:53,439
here are those four things

00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:56,640
these four tutorials how-to guides

00:01:53,439 --> 00:02:00,240
reference and explanation are the four

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:03,200
types or forms or components

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,439
of technical documentation and they

00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,560
represent four different

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:10,640
objectives or functions

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,080
a complete set of documentation for a

00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,319
product or project

00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,280
needs to contain each of them and it

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,840
needs to be

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,800
structured explicitly structured

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,680
according to

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,160
this scheme each of them requires its

00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,840
own

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,120
distinct style of writing each has its

00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,599
own

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,319
purpose each answers to a specific need

00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:35,040
each has its own particular task

00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,519
each is separate and distinct from the

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,720
others

00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,440
and needs to be kept so and that's the

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,480
key

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:46,959
to making documentation easier

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:49,440
to maintain and to use

00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,319
what i want to do now is go through each

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,480
of the four

00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,599
in audio in order tutorials how to

00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,599
guides reference and

00:02:53,599 --> 00:03:00,959
explanation we'll start with tutorials

00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:03,040
now a tutorial is a lesson

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,280
a lesson that takes the reader by the

00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,319
hand through a series of

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,319
practical steps to realize a

00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,159
project or complete a meaningful

00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:15,360
exercise

00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:19,200
a lesson is an experience a pedagogical

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:21,280
experience think about the experience of

00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,879
teaching a child to cook perhaps this is

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,440
an experience you're already familiar

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,959
with

00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:30,159
what works when you're doing that what

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:32,080
doesn't work and the question that needs

00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:37,680
to be understood is

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,680
how is it that one learns a new skill

00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,519
and the answer to that is the only way

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:45,040
one learns a new skill

00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:47,760
is by doing and

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,159
a successful tutorial therefore has to

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:53,519
find a way to put that principle

00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,519
into practice

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,120
tutorials are learning oriented

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,599
your task in creating a tutorial is to

00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,360
create a learning

00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:06,480
experience one in which the pupil

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:09,840
learns by doing things under your

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:12,319
direction and to

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,400
provide or constitute a learning

00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:17,680
experience your tutorial must

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,680
be repeatable must instill confidence

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,880
must result in success every time for

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:26,080
every learner

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:28,320
it must be concrete and particular

00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,440
on the other hand things like

00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:34,400
abstraction

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,400
and generalization or

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:40,960
explanation information and choices

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,759
they don't belong here in a tutorial

00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,240
these are

00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,560
kinds of pollution they damage the

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,759
learning experience their temptations

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:53,280
um anti-pedagogical temptations

00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:55,759
that are very easy to fall into

00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,440
so the only preoccupation of your

00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:02,000
tutorial should be

00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:06,000
what will your pupil do in order

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,560
that they shall learn and i can tell you

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,320
quite safely that tutorials are the

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,800
least well understood part of

00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,600
documentation the most difficult part to

00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,320
create

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,280
to maintain to write and without doubt

00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,400
you'll find that the most

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:22,639
they are the most badly executed part

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,199
of the tutorial of the documentation

00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:28,720
that you encounter

00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:33,440
so it really should be pretty clear um

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:36,400
a documentation sorry a tutorial

00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,080
that functions as a lesson is always

00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,520
going to be

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:43,360
sub-optimal you're responsible for the

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,800
pupils success you're responsible for

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,680
their learning you're responsible for

00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,000
providing

00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,440
an experience that instills confidence

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,039
and at the same time

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:55,039
you're condemned to be absent and

00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,639
if that sounds a little bit unfair then

00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:59,600
i think actually you're

00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:01,440
right for my own part writing and

00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,680
maintaining tutorials occupies

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,120
alone just by itself something like 80

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,160
percent of my

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,479
time when i'm working on documentation

00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,639
and probably accounts for something like

00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:15,600
99 percent of the difficulties

00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,600
that i face

00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:23,840
next how-to guides a how-to guide takes

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:27,120
the reader through the steps required to

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:29,120
complete a specific task or solve a

00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,720
specific problem which amounts to the

00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,759
same thing

00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:36,560
how-to guides are

00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,120
um think about the recipe for preparing

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,280
a dish

00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,960
what's the function of a recipe what

00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,639
form does a recipe take

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,880
what would you expect to find in a

00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:49,120
recipe and what would you consider

00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:51,800
out of place in documentation

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,440
how-to guides are task-oriented or

00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:56,080
problem-oriented

00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,599
so a kitchen recipe is a very good model

00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,720
for a how-to guide because

00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:03,199
it has a practical utility it

00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,960
moves towards a clear objective it

00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:08,240
serves not the beginner

00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:10,160
but the already competent user it

00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,560
unlike a tutorial it has no obligation

00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:16,560
to the needs of the learner

00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:18,880
and it shouldn't be confused

00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,680
with a tutorial because its purpose its

00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,960
audience

00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:26,000
um its its needs and its style

00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:28,479
are quite different in a tutorial

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,680
the language is imperative if you want

00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,800
to do this

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,039
if you're sorry if you want to achieve

00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,360
this do that

00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:37,680
it responds to a question how do i do

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,000
such and such with a series of actions

00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,599
and only actions without digressions or

00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,840
explanations

00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,840
or attempts to teach

00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,560
next we have reference guides reference

00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,120
guides are

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,560
technical descriptions of the machinery

00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,360
and

00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,840
its functioning they've got just one

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,080
purpose to describe

00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,120
in the most correct and complete manner

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,160
possible

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:09,120
so think about the form of an

00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,560
article in an encyclopedia a reference

00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,599
work

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:17,120
what does such an article do what

00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:21,599
does it present what kind of style

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,599
does reference material adopt

00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:31,199
reference material is information

00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:34,719
oriented it's

00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,120
technical description has to be complete

00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:39,200
and

00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,320
correct and whereas tutorials and how-to

00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,440
guides

00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,680
need to answer to the

00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,720
uh have to answer to the needs of the

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,240
reader

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,000
technical reference has other

00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,880
obligations obligations only to the

00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
facts

00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:57,440
to the machinery not to the person

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,600
who's using that documentation so

00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,680
reference material should be free of

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,040
distractions from its purpose it should

00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,959
be austere

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,480
and uncompromising it's governed by

00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:10,240
principles like neutrality

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,760
and objectivity and factuality and

00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,800
it should be structured it should be

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,480
written according to the structure and

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,040
the architecture

00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,519
of the machinery itself they should

00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:25,120
share

00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:25,120
a common architecture

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,440
finally we have explanation explanation

00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,839
is discussion that

00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,279
illuminates and clarifies some

00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:36,800
particular

00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:38,880
topic explanation opens up a subject

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,720
adopting a wider view of it

00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,880
and think about a book that's concerned

00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,959
with the art the science the history and

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,360
the cultural significance of food and

00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:49,680
cooking and eating

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,279
it's not a book of recipes or of

00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,560
technical information

00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:57,920
or one that teaches skills it's

00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:01,360
discussion at another level altogether

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:04,640
explanation even the word explanation

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,920
is a clue it's concerned with unfolding

00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:09,360
with spreading out

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,160
explanation un covers things that may

00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,200
have been

00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:18,240
obscured in the folds of the matter and

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:21,760
makes them plain so

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:25,040
explanation is understanding

00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:27,120
oriented it's a discussion that

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,279
opens a subject in multiple directions

00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,000
outwards deeper towards the past and the

00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,480
future

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,760
it offers context and establishes

00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,040
connections

00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:39,680
it answers to the needs of the person

00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,640
who wants to um who wants to know more

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,839
it deepens

00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,959
the theoretical understanding of a

00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,640
practical

00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:50,399
craft its style is discursive

00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,000
and it can go where the other parts

00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,440
tutorials how to guides and reference

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,560
are forbidden to trade it can go into

00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,800
the bigger picture

00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,160
into history it can go to things like

00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,600
choices and alternatives and

00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,880
possibilities

00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:05,920
and it can ask why and seek reasons

00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:09,040
and justifications for things and

00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:11,519
why they are the way they are

00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,240
so here they are all four of them

00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,880
learning

00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,440
oriented tutorials task oriented how-to

00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,680
guides

00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,560
information oriented reference and

00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,920
understanding

00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:24,399
oriented explanation

00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,200
this is clear and and and beautiful it's

00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,959
a structure that

00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,959
technical documentation should have

00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,959
explicitly

00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,680
and sadly this is what documentation

00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:38,079
usually looks like

00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:40,399
it's terribly difficult to keep these

00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:43,120
four different things

00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,880
apart from each other because there's an

00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,600
internal gravity a kind of

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,040
fatal attraction that's always pulling

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,800
them together

00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,120
and the disorder and confusion the

00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:55,600
result is hardly the fault of the

00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,240
authors of documentation it's very

00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,040
difficult

00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,920
to resist the tension inherent in the

00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,240
structure

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,120
a tension that's caused by the way in

00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,040
which the

00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,360
characteristics of the four different

00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:10,399
kinds of documentation

00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,279
overlap with each other and i'll show

00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:15,200
you what i mean

00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:17,200
um here we are with each component

00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,440
neatly in its own quadrant where it

00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:22,000
belongs

00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,120
and if we look more closely we see

00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,920
tutorials and

00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,200
guides are similar because they're both

00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:31,440
concerned with

00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,440
describing practical steps

00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:37,360
and how two guides and reference share

00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,560
with each other

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:44,320
that they both serve our work they are

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,320
what we need when we're actually working

00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:51,760
and reference and explanation

00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,000
are similar because they're both

00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:57,920
concerned with theoretical

00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,160
knowledge while explanations and

00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:04,160
tutorials have an affinity

00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:08,000
because both serve our study

00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:09,200
of the subject so you can see the

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,959
overlaps

00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:14,880
or the um characteristics

00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,639
that they share with each other and how

00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,160
they do that and you can see how that

00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,880
pulls them inwards

00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,000
so naturally we have this total collapse

00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,440
this implosion

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,800
of the structure but no this

00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,279
is what we want this is what it should

00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,880
look like when it does look like this

00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,639
you will have documentation that works

00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,560
better that's easier

00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,839
to write and maintain that's easier to

00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,000
use and to find

00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,959
your way around in as a reader and it

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,199
will do at least

00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:42,959
a part of the work of documentation for

00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,639
you it won't write itself

00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,000
but you'll have a much clearer idea of

00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,480
what to write

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
how to write it and where to write it

00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,279
and it will serve your users better

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,199
because for all the different

00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:55,040
phases and the cycle of their

00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,399
interaction with your product

00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,399
they're going to find the right kind of

00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:01,279
documentation that serves the needs

00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,839
of that moment let me give you one more

00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:05,920
example

00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:08,000
from aviation uh in brief we have

00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,279
the tutorial the lesson the pedagogical

00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,760
experience

00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:13,120
safely in the hands of the instructor

00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,240
who's going to direct you

00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:18,720
what to do then we have

00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,360
the how-to guides the recipes for the

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,079
skilled

00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,600
practitioner here in the case of here in

00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:27,839
this case in the form of

00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:30,079
a checklist for flight operations

00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,760
then we have reference the information

00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:33,760
that's required

00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,600
in order for us to be able to do our

00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:39,360
work here it's cartographic

00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:43,120
information landing charts

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:46,800
and we have finally

00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:50,320
explanation discussions that deepen

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:53,360
the understanding in this case

00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:56,480
it's an explanation of what lies

00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:59,680
behind the behavior of

00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:01,199
an aerodynamic system and in each of

00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,000
these cases what's present and what's

00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:05,440
absent

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,079
conforms with the model of documentation

00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,760
that i've been

00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:09,360
speaking about and you'll find this

00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,480
model makes sense in all kinds of

00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,000
documentation

00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,199
context and you'll see the elements

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,600
there and how they perform their

00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,600
functions

00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,839
this isn't the only model of

00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:24,000
documentation but

00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:26,959
i do think it's the the best one so

00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,680
that's the theory what about the

00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,320
practice

00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:32,720
of documentation well first thing this

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,079
system is used a lot in a wide range of

00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,639
different products including both

00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:38,480
open and proprietary software here it is

00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,279
in devio's own developer handbook and

00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,720
you'll notice that

00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:42,320
some of the names are different but that

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,279
doesn't matter we have get started our

00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,320
tutorials

00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:47,279
background our explanation but otherwise

00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,079
we have the four

00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:51,360
sections just the same way here's one of

00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:54,079
our tutorials for building

00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,959
a django project on devio the tutorial

00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,880
makes a promise

00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:58,000
if you follow this tutorial you will

00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,160
have created

00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,839
and deployed a production ready django

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,120
web application using docker complete

00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:06,399
with postgres database

00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:08,000
s3 media storage and so on it doesn't

00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,399
tell you what you'll learn

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,680
it's not so presumptuous it just tells

00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,240
you what you're going to do

00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:16,320
and the learning comes out of that doing

00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,480
the tutorial determines what you will do

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,519
the order that you do it in and it just

00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,600
decides

00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,560
what you don't need to know about right

00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,000
now and so on

00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:29,759
it takes full responsibility for all

00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,680
of that next we have um

00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,440
one of uh here's a list of some of our

00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,560
how-to guides each one is an answer to

00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,800
the question

00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,480
or or an answer to a question or a

00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,560
problem how do i do

00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,920
such and such and each title as you can

00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,160
see can be

00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,440
preceded by the words how to how to

00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:49,120
manage a project's

00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:52,639
base image how to run the local server

00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:54,320
in life configuration practical tasks

00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,320
and if you look at one in more detail

00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,839
you'll see it takes you through a series

00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:01,199
of series of steps

00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:02,800
to complete a practical task

00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,400
here's an example of one of our

00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,000
reference guides it's technical

00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,600
description and nothing else

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,919
this is the machine these are its

00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:13,120
functions this is how it's

00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:15,199
operated this is what it will do

00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:17,039
and finally some of the explanation

00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,400
articles

00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:19,280
they don't teach you anything they don't

00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,079
tell you what to do they're not

00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,120
reference guides

00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:24,959
they just discuss a topic in uh

00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,319
at another at another level you don't

00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,799
need to know about say

00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:30,320
caching and cdn or how we manage

00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:32,640
environment variables

00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,679
in order to achieve any particular task

00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,600
but the time

00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,440
is likely to come when your use of the

00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,120
platform will be improved by having a

00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,760
clearer better and deeper

00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,840
understanding of those topics it's the

00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,760
bigger picture the context

00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,919
and you're a human being so maybe you

00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,440
don't strictly need to know

00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,440
why we do a certain thing in a certain

00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,960
way but knowing it might well provide

00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,000
you with a kind of satisfaction and

00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,360
comfort

00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:01,039
that makes you a happier uh more at ease

00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:04,320
user of the product which is what we

00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:05,280
want here it is in django again some of

00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,559
the names

00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,960
can be a little different but the

00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:11,200
structure is same tutorials

00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,160
explanation here called topic guides

00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,200
reference guides

00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:17,280
and how to

00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,559
and in one of my hobby projects the

00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,200
brachiograph a

00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:23,200
python driven pen plotter it's probably

00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,520
the cheapest simplest

00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,280
pen plotter in the world get started for

00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:31,440
the tutorials

00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:33,200
uh how to reference and explanation

00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,200
so you'll find this structure in many

00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,120
places and uh

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,280
especially in the python world of course

00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:41,520
but elsewhere as well

00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,880
i'm aware of the adoption the system in

00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,559
numerous projects

00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,240
uh in which it's applied sometimes in a

00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,760
more complete way and sometimes in a

00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,320
less complete way but

00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,120
um it's it's there and often it's

00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,960
explicitly

00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,200
mentioned here are just a few of them

00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:58,000
you'll recognize some of these from

00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,960
uh our world of python and django like

00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,280
beware and

00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,160
numpy but there's also loot back from

00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,640
ibm and

00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,280
uh and others and also some private

00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,360
examples

00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,600
i don't know so much about those i'd

00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,280
love to know what bosch or ericsson

00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,799
are doing with it all i know is that

00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,799
somebody there is

00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:16,400
using the system for their technical

00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:18,480
documentation

00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,440
and i receive almost daily feedback and

00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,679
messages from

00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,520
authors and people involved in projects

00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:27,120
who use or study the system

00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,919
in one way or another and we know it

00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,799
works

00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,760
it's tried and trusted across multiple

00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:33,600
projects

00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:36,080
and it works really well as a tool in

00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,760
the hands of the writer of documentation

00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,679
often an author will know that there's a

00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,600
problem without their documentation

00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,200
but knowing exactly the nature of that

00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,200
problem is a different matter

00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,320
so they'll wrestle with questions like

00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,000
how is it possible that our

00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,679
documentation appears to be harder to

00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,240
maintain than our actual code

00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,799
or where is this new material supposed

00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,480
to go

00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:57,360
or what am i doing here what am i trying

00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,400
to say

00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,679
and here it works as an analytical or

00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,640
diagnostic tool

00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:06,000
shining a clear light on the problem

00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,760
allowing you to see what's wrong which

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,400
might be that

00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:12,400
this section i see of the tutorial

00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:16,320
detracts from the learning experience

00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:17,120
or this reference material is clearly in

00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:20,400
the wrong place

00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:22,080
or this how-to guide has become bloated

00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,000
with explanation

00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,799
and it's also a synthetic which is to

00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,600
say a productive instrument it can guide

00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,600
you

00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,640
while you're at work creating your

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,200
documentation

00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,159
what style should i be using here where

00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,600
should this material

00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:38,240
go what's missing here what is the

00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,520
purpose

00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,520
of this page

00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,919
so for the very last time here's the

00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:49,360
synoptic picture

00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:52,000
of the system here's your map for your

00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,640
documentation and what you should be

00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
doing

00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,000
while you're working on it

00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,720
i'll leave you with a link to some more

00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:04,720
information about the system

00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:06,240
at documentation.dvo.com

00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,080
and if you'd like to know more about

00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,000
documentation or want to talk about it

00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,200
or even would like some advice on how to

00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,039
improve your own

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,280
please do talk to me i'd love to talk to

00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:17,200
you about it

00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,799
i'm happy to help people work with their

00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,200
documentation

00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:22,320
and um at the same time if you'd like to

00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,480
know more about

00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,600
devio or how dvo can help you put

00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,360
complex web

00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,600
applications into production without

00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:31,840
having to shed tears over

00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:34,320
cloud management or devops you also know

00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:36,240
where to find me

00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,840
thank you very much and i look forward

00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,520
to seeing everybody again at another

00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:45,840
conference sometime

00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:45,840
when it's safe to meet again

00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,240
