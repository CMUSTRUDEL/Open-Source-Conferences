00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:12,000

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,200
to be here today

00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,279
uh djangocon talks in the past have

00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,640
always been one of my go-to sources of

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,240
django learning so it's

00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,400
really humbling to be here on the other

00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,039
side so thank you for having me

00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,560
and i also wanted to thank my partner

00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,320
who is looking after our child right now

00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,039
i couldn't do this without her as well

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,760
so

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,480
thank you deborah um today i'm here to

00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,559
talk about

00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:37,200
accessibility and specifically

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,440
accessibility wins for django projects

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,840
so not just generally what accessibility

00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:44,559
is but specifically for jungle work

00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,200
what do you have to worry about and i'm

00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:46,719
here

00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,399
in particular to tell the story of how

00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,920
we've approached this for wacktail i'm

00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,640
not sure who has heard of like that

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,719
before but

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,840
i'm a co-developer of the whitetail cms

00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,079
so i'll also

00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,760
talk to you about this briefly the

00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,079
slides are available online should you

00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,920
want

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,079
to look at them at your own pace and the

00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,879
links at the bottom here

00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,720
all right let's get going so first of

00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,760
all this this whitetail story

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,920
um wagtail is a cms

00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,680
um essentially you use it when the

00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,439
django admin probably provides doesn't

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,920
provide you enough to manage

00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:20,159
a site that is quite content heavy so

00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,119
for example the blog with lots of pages

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,320
lots of fields on each page and maybe

00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,040
lots of different people

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,880
wanting to edit those pages concurrently

00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,799
translating those pages and so on so

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,320
that's where kind of whitetail comes in

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:35,119
it's based on django

00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:37,119
but uh the admin is much more geared

00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:40,079
towards those use cases

00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:41,200
um so of course we do want this admin ui

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,200
to be accessible

00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,240
uh to be usable by as many people as

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,640
possible

00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,680
and we also do want the sites built with

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,680
whitetail to be

00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,200
as accessible as possible so i guess

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,560
that's kind of what

00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,719
brings me here right now we we learned

00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,240
along our journey of vital journey that

00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:00,159
accessibility matters

00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,680
and that unfortunately you can't just

00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,880
rely on

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:07,280
best practices and semantic html

00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,280
you also have to learn practically how

00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,640
do people make use of a website with

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,560
active technology

00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,920
uh what things you have to watch out for

00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,680
and so on um

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,959
so yeah quite briefly why do we care

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,640
about making white accessible in

00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,800
particular is because we want to provide

00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,120
an experience that's inclusive

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,800
that includes as many people as possible

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,800
regardless of their skill level

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,319
background of how they end up using the

00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,239
cms

00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,519
and in particular people who do rely on

00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:35,040
assistive technology

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:36,000
well we want them to be able to succeed

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,360
in in the workplace

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,280
at their jobs if they have to use

00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,120
whitetail there so we don't want someone

00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,599
to be left out just because they happen

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,879
to use our cms one way or another

00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,640
and something else i want to mention

00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,160
earlier on as well is that these

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,160
accessibility improvements that we tend

00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,120
to think of just for people who have low

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,400
vision

00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,920
or who are deep or yeah any

00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,760
and all of these they do lead to

00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,239
usability improvements for everyone

00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,200
um this is something called the curb cut

00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:05,120
effect

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,879
but i recommend you have a look at this

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,400
and uh yeah unfortunately there are

00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,120
there are other reasons that are not as

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,000
positive

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,920
um so currently uh we're working on it

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,680
but the admin interface still is quite

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,800
difficult to use if you're using a

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,040
screener

00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,480
and uh well practically if you're one of

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,159
our clients at touchbox and you're

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,200
choosing a cms well this might be

00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,840
problematic for you

00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,120
might be quite a bad option uh if you do

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,920
have people who rely on acidic

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,120
technology

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,319
or if you do have um compliance targets

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,799
that are quite strict

00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,560
so those compliance targets uh actually

00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,720
exist all around the world um

00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,319
in the us that's called section 508 for

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,959
public sector websites

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,920
and ada for literally all websites

00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,560
depending on

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,280
which lawyer you ask and in the eu we

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,159
also have

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,840
similar allows that are enforced so yeah

00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,280
this isn't something that's optional

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,319
this isn't something you do just to be

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,319
nice you you do have to do this

00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,599
oh and yeah it's not just whitetail by

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,959
the way so

00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,879
um whatever thing you're building

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,680
whether it's an internet or some kind of

00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,879
dashboard

00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,280
a django admin based website uh you do

00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,760
need

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,920
these to be accessible and uh you can't

00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,000
just compromise on that just because the

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,120
audience of the site is smaller you

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,680
wouldn't compromise

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,479
on a website's security just because

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,280
it's used by

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:24,160
10 people rather than 100 it still needs

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:27,120
to be 12 factor and so on

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,520
um yeah i i want to also give you a

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,240
brief

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,400
legislation overview here in eu so um

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,560
public sector websites complying

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,080
with the directives i mentioned above

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,040
that's coming up

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,320
a week from now whether the site is new

00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,400
or existing

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,440
for mobile apps still have about a year

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,759
to go

00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,120
and um there was a new law coming coming

00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,639
um that's that got

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,880
uh um drafted in uh december 2019

00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,240
that now is going to make this mandatory

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,720
for e-commerce

00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,600
banking and transport services as well

00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,919
not just

00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,720
public sector things so yeah this is

00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:04,160
coming

00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:06,080
um time time to do this and uh yes

00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,680
also worth mentioning that even though

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,840
all of these things are different laws

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,759
they are all based on the same standard

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,520
called weak hack2.1

00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,039
i won't go that deep into the standards

00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,080
that much today but i think this is

00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,000
worth knowing that

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,440
uh the things i discussed today they

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,600
aren't arbitrary

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,520
things subjective things they are

00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,080
defined by very clear standards that's

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,960
what some people walk on at w3c

00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,479
and uh yeah these this is just you look

00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,440
at it online all the information is

00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,639
there

00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:37,520
from first party sources all right

00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,639
yes uh so i don't i don't want this to

00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,880
be all negative

00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,639
i think i really want to point out that

00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,120
to me there is a bit of

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,759
a cultural shift in progress and that

00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,600
hopefully

00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,840
a few years from now it will just be

00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,440
like uh having bathrooms that are large

00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,560
enough for wheelchairs it would just be

00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,199
part of the landscape

00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,680
of how we build things on the web and we

00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,759
won't have to think about it too much

00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,360
and things like whitetail will just have

00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,800
this taken care of for you to some

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:07,680
extent things like django as well

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,880
for now for now though we'll look at

00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,160
some common issues

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,160
that you have to be aware of

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,600
yeah worth pointing out as well that

00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,360
this is live so i'll make the most of it

00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,720
and i also have the slack chat open

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,639
should you want to make comments along

00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,199
the way i might or might not

00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,479
find the chance to look at them so yes

00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,560
those common issues

00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,759
uh they are very common and again i'll

00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,520
try and focus on the ones that are

00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,120
specific to django

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,960
and in particular that the ones that

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,199
django developers can have a part in

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:38,240
fixing

00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:41,120
all right let's dive in alt text

00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,960
for images i feel like this one is feels

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,080
quite basic potentially a lot of people

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,080
know what alt text

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,360
is how you meant to provide describe

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,160
describing text for

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,199
images on your sites so uh what the

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,280
problem might be well

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,639
let's let's look at this bit of ui here

00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,880
uh whitetail

00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,720
is trusted by people you know list of

00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,800
logos underneath

00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,000
i'm going to now use my screen reader

00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,440
super superpowers to

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,759
show you how someone with a screen

00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,080
reader would perceive this ui

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,280
so i'll switch to what they experience

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,800
one two three

00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:15,599
and ah well

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,599
that's a bit problematic all of the all

00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:19,759
of the content is gone

00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,720
like it's used by people you know which

00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,039
is no one

00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,560
uh so what the problem is quite simply

00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,560
is that all of these are images

00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,800
and none of them actually have alt text

00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,120
defined they just have alt equals

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,240
empty string which means that well there

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,840
is no alternative

00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,440
if you can't see the visuals of the

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,560
images which

00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:41,039
uh yeah it's quite bad so why is that

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,120
essentially this is a this is a models

00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,879
problem not a template problem

00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,560
when you use an image like this on the

00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,800
page on your site

00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,400
well you need a field for the image file

00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,720
and you also need a field

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:55,199
for the alt text so in this case the

00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,800
images theory aren't decorative they

00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,720
are the whole content that's being

00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,720
displayed in section so they do need

00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,280
this one field in the cms

00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,639
so that's why uh orange angle sorry so

00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,080
that's why it's important for django

00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,720
developers to be aware of things like

00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,800
this

00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,560
these aren't things you can fix just in

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,800
the templates although of course you do

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,840
have to use the fields in the templates

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,120
as well so yeah solution for this is

00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,639
quite straightforward

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,879
if an image on your site isn't

00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,560
decorative there should be an alt text

00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,160
field alongside it

00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,000
and you should make it possible for user

00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,240
to leave this blank if the

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,080
image is described otherwise or have

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,910
this mandatory if there is nothing else

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,200
on the page describing the image

00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:35,680
[Music]

00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,279
yeah and again why does it matter for

00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,200
django developers to be aware of this

00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:41,200
so i'm sure you've seen this type of

00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,640
charts many times in the past if you've

00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,680
been to conferences this is a chart

00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,040
showing the cost

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:49,200
of fixing or changing code depending on

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,120
where the change is detected whether you

00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,399
find a bug close to launch

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,000
or as part of gathering your

00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,760
requirements for your site so

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,720
essentially the closer to requirements

00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,560
the cheaper

00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,920
the closer to launch the more expensive

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,760
to fix those things

00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,399
well the fundamental problem here is

00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:07,120
that someone like me auditing a site

00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,880
i usually tend to come look at the site

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,279
only towards launch which is a

00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,519
bad thing in its own right but it still

00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:15,200
does work like that most of the times

00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,120
whereas if you're working on your models

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,080
in django well this is much closer to

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,240
the actual

00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,680
design and architecture of the site so

00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,160
it's worth being aware of things like

00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,320
this

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,080
as soon as possible so you don't just

00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,640
carry the issue all the way towards

00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,480
launch

00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,920
and then you have migrations to do you

00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,720
have to figure out where to add the

00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,320
field

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,920
how to do that and you have to ask

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,240
people working on your site to go and

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,680
add the content afterwards it's much

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,120
easier for all of this to just

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:43,440
be something you're aware of up front

00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,600
and yeah so this isn't just images so

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,080
videos are another example of this so

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,839
here we have a blog post that has two

00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:53,680
video embeds on it

00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:57,279
again three super powers ah

00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,000
nothing is on there and well that simply

00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,600
is because

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,680
those two embeds from youtube they don't

00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,959
have a title attribute

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,720
again something that you have to be

00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,800
aware of quite soon

00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,160
in order to have this field there in the

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,519
cms if possible

00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,600
or just make sure your embeds

00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,360
integration is aware that it has to pull

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,079
this data from youtube

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,440
and i also want to point out here i use

00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,959
the example of youtube

00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,399
but you might also be tempted to say

00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,360
well i don't want to rely on a third

00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,760
party service

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,560
i just want my videos to be managed

00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,920
directly

00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,200
in uh in django and um well

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,560
that's all fine but then you have to be

00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,000
aware that you also have to provide

00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:35,040
captions for the videos

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,640
potentially transcripts as well and

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,320
i can't count how many times i've seen

00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,399
people go down that route of having

00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,160
videos managed directly on their side

00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,839
and i have to tell them quite late in

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,279
their process that they actually need

00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,360
those fields as well

00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,480
you can imagine how you probably would

00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,240
rather know about this

00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,160
upfront so you could make an informed

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,880
decision on whether to roll this out

00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,360
yourself

00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:58,000
or use a third-party dependency for this

00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,000
like youtube

00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,920
um yeah so again yeah the sooner the

00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,399
better

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,200
if this is me uh doing an update and

00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:07,519
putting this out

00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,279
after launch this is going to be a a

00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:11,120
very long fix for you to roll all that

00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:13,279
content whereas if you're aware of it

00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,120
up front you can access at the rational

00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,000
level do you have the capacity to

00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,200
produce those

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,200
transcripts or not and if so how one

00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,440
more

00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,800
that i'd like to point out is heading

00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,720
levels

00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:31,279
so h12345 in html

00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,800
um stranger users rely on this to follow

00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:34,640
a logical sequence

00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,160
for them to navigate the page without to

00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,040
having to go through it all top to

00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,440
bottom

00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,160
so briefly what you need to be aware of

00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,360
is

00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,880
one h1 per page don't skip any levels

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,640
only use headings for the structure of

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,959
the page not just because the designs

00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,920
have larger text here and there

00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:53,440
and um it's it's very easy for me to be

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,480
critical of whitetail having worked on

00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,920
it so much

00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,920
for once this is something we do quite

00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,360
well well where if you define a rich

00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,279
text field in your models

00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,360
you can restrict which heading levels

00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:06,079
are available in that given field

00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,079
which actually re restricts the controls

00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:11,040
that are in the text editor in the cms

00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:12,880
admin which means that your cms users

00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,880
then can only use the heading levels

00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,000
that make sense semantically in this

00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,600
given field

00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,200
so yeah worth looking out for things

00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,360
like this when you shop for reflex

00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,240
editor

00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,399
um yeah so just to hammer the points

00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:29,360
home this is an example of uh this

00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,720
thing gone wrong so this is a django

00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,760
project.com website

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,800
and this is a bookmarklet called h123 so

00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,760
here i have the result of that

00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,160
bookmarklet

00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,800
i can see the document outline on the

00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,360
page

00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,399
i can see there is one two three four h

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,600
ones

00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,399
here's gibson h2 for some reason i don't

00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,880
know why but

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,760
latest news is underneath support django

00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,519
so yeah

00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,120
this is this is not what you want this

00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,920
is the type of thing that you need to be

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,920
watching out for

00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:02,720
one last one for the road so forms uh

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,680
yeah i kept this one short so django has

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,120
convenience

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:09,600
as stable and as ul uh methods to render

00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,720
all of the forms at once as tables or

00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,880
lists

00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,639
uh please please avoid them as much as

00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,720
possible uh

00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,880
yeah tables layout that's the thing we

00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,800
did like 10 to 20 years ago

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,079
it doesn't have anything to do on modern

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,560
websites anymore

00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:25,760
and tables are very hard for screener

00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,760
users to navigate

00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,680
this is somewhat okay but tables in

00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,000
particular is really problematic

00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,959
so avoid this and yeah also worth

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,720
pointing out that

00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:36,480
even the vanilla market from django

00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,199
without these helpers uh

00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,800
really doesn't doesn't give you much so

00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,399
basic things like showing which of the

00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,680
fields are required

00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,440
that's not something that django

00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,600
provides as a default like sure the

00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,880
field has a required attribute in html

00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,880
but it doesn't have any visual

00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,680
indication of which is required which is

00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,560
optional

00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,600
so be wary of those defaults like this

00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,720
that only give you

00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:02,160
uh the broken half of

00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:05,920
our usable forms

00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:07,839
all right lots of negative stuff

00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,839
but we've got it out of the way and now

00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,120
we can look at more positive things that

00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,279
will help you get there

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,160
um so next section is called developer

00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,000
wins

00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,440
i want to point out early again i'll

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,600
focus on things that are specific to

00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:22,240
django as much as possible

00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,480
i wrote a blog post recently about uh

00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,480
audits generally not just for django

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,000
um from the perspective of developers in

00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,519
particular so do check it out if you

00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,320
want to learn more about what i'm

00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:34,079
describing here so developer wins again

00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,880
we want to focus on things that help

00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,040
developers

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:39,120
making more accessible django projects

00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,480
and again the idea is to

00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,199
not just have things that you run

00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,519
towards launch here the idea is to shift

00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,320
to shift left as they say towards the

00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:50,000
requirements

00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,800
and coding stage so if you compare this

00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,680
to

00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:55,120
security or performance you wouldn't

00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,120
only start to worry about your site's

00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,279
security or performance after launch

00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,880
you'd presumably worry about having a

00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,959
sound foundation whether that's a

00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,440
framework or something else

00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:06,399
having best practices like factor again

00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,279
and then having

00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:11,279
um potentially static analysis of your

00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,800
code to check for those concerns

00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,480
essentially run time analysis so

00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:17,600
monitoring as well and

00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,720
tests so again like spreading the uh how

00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,560
concerned am i

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,399
about those things throughout the whole

00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:26,560
project not just there

00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:28,639
accessibility is the exact same

00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,839
so yeah first thing first that i won't

00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,800
cover but i wanted to give you a few

00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,199
links on the

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,560
training obviously the best way for

00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,839
people to be aware of those things as

00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,079
early as possible

00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,600
is for them to know about the issues and

00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:42,880
the only way for that to happen

00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,839
is education learning resources and so

00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,839
on

00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,759
those two links if you have the time to

00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:50,480
check them out otherwise and move on to

00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:51,199
again django specific things but before

00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,440
i get there

00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:55,040
i wanted to show you my three favorite

00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:58,160
tools

00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:01,040
axe it's a free and open source

00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,800
expedited testing engine has all the

00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,880
rules you could wish for for weak again

00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,720
section 508 compliance

00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,279
accessibility insights it's a browser

00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,600
extension that bundles axe and much more

00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:13,040
and pali essentially it's acts on the

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,720
command line

00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,800
try these out they will help you

00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,639
tremendously

00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:21,040
and yeah i also wanted to mention static

00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,720
analysis so people might not be aware of

00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,600
this unless they spend lots of time in

00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,440
the

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,680
client-side front-end framework

00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,519
landscape but these days

00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,839
things like react and vue they have

00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:34,079
quite well established eslint

00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,920
linting plugins specific to

00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:38,790
accessibility issues

00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:40,240
so yeah worth being aware of these

00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:42,079
[Music]

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,600
so now back onto things that are django

00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:45,440
specific

00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,000
there's a package called django html

00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,399
validator i'm not too sure how people

00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,160
feel about html validation these days

00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:54,639
but it definitely covers

00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,399
quite a lot of basic things about 15

00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,440
percent of issues according to numbers i

00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,160
could find

00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,680
so this one package uses the official

00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,759
venue validator

00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,039
and essentially bundles that in django

00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,839
so that each invalidation

00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:09,280
happens whenever you render pages so

00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,079
either because you're loading the page

00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,120
in your browser

00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:14,160
or as part of your unit tests and yeah

00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:17,039
you'd be surprised

00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,439
how many html validation issues you can

00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,799
find

00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:23,600
on a on a major website built with a

00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:26,880
major cms on top of a major framework

00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:28,640
in 2020 so yeah these actually cause

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,160
real issues for people who rely on the

00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:33,360
semantics of the page

00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:36,400
and um yeah just worth knowing about

00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,360
um and yeah something else i'm quite

00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,400
excited about

00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,120
is this uh linter i've been building

00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,240
over

00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:46,720
coronavirus um so this is curly lint

00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:49,200
it's an experimental linter for django

00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:51,200
templates and jinja templates

00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,799
uh the idea being again to bring this

00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,400
type of static analysis

00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,799
that gives you feedback as much as as

00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,919
soon as possible uh to bring that to the

00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:01,360
jungle world

00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:04,559
so curly lint is again very experimental

00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:06,640
but still available as a pipe i package

00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:08,080
it's a command line tool you can install

00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:11,120
it run it on your templates

00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,640
and it finds issues um it has

00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,240
it has tools that are quite basic but

00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,000
still useful nonetheless like checking

00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,720
that your page is to have a laying

00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,559
attribute

00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,039
so that the screen reader will actually

00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:24,559
read the page in the correct language

00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:27,600
um yeah other basic rules like avoiding

00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:30,080
autofocus on form fields

00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,120
other basic rules like avoiding django's

00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:34,000
as stable and

00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,960
as you will see essentially as good as

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,039
it gets to

00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,760
me on your team without paying me i can

00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:41,039
just complain via current please don't

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,200
do this

00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:44,720
and um yeah i'm not sure how you

00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,080
perceive this from your side but from my

00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,480
side i wanted to point out that

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,480
you actually do find issues with this so

00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,320
yesterday just for fun i tried to run it

00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,799
on my personal websites

00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,000
and well i found i was missing on

00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:59,200
language reviews on one of my

00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,080
templates and i found that one of my

00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,679
very old talks didn't have any alt text

00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,960
on the images

00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:09,120
so yes the issues are real and

00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,000
i also ran it on the django code base

00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,039
and found

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,640
an issue with django as well so yeah

00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:17,360
there is a template in django that

00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,880
also doesn't have the lang attributes on

00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,480
the html template

00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,039
which means that the page will be read

00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:25,679
out with the wrong language

00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:26,400
yeah i also found a parser bug with

00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:30,000
collins

00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:31,120
because yes it's uh try it out but don't

00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:36,240
necessarily like

00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:36,240
rely on it in production um

00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:41,039
yeah so that was static analysis which i

00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,320
think is uh amazing you should try and

00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:44,000
have as much of it as possible

00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,559
regardless of what you're looking at

00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,919
in your project qa wise now i want to

00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,080
show something that's on the opposite

00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:52,480
side of the spectrum so this

00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:55,360
project called django pattern library

00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:57,679
that is from touchbox my employer

00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,799
this is what we use to manage ui

00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:02,159
component libraries

00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:05,600
for django projects so the basic idea

00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:08,320
is to have a way to work and test

00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:10,559
your ui components in isolation from

00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,159
where they are used in your project

00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:14,799
and the reason this is relevant here is

00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:17,440
that well um this is kind of unit tests

00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:18,320
for ui stuff so the whole idea is that

00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,440
well you have this

00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,159
this data then uh in in in dispatch

00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,400
library

00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:26,000
and you can try all of the variations of

00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,440
your components based on what data

00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,440
requirements they have

00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,200
and of course you can run xpt tests

00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,080
quite easily on those components

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,760
regardless of

00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,200
where they happen to be displayed in

00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,520
your site so

00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,360
yeah if you are studying partners i

00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,039
definitely recommend checking it out

00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,200
but yeah this is quite a fundamental

00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,559
change of approach

00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,320
one other thing i want to mention is to

00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:48,000
learn how to use a screen reader so i'll

00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:51,360
give you a quick demo of that

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,480
i will switch over to safari

00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:56,000
and open voiceover on there voiceover

00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,799
and so far

00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,600
there are only three keyboard shortcuts

00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,760
you need

00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,679
to make use of a screen like voiceover

00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:06,000
and most other screen readers

00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:08,240
the first one is how to open it that's

00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,280
command f4 voiceover off on the map on

00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,080
mac

00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,559
the second one is voiceover how to close

00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,520
it

00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:16,080
that's also command f5 and then

00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,840
voiceover

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,280
has this thing called the rotor which

00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:22,320
i'll open with control

00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:23,200
alt u headings menu that allows you to

00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,440
navigate

00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,120
through your page view heading level one

00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,640
django administration

00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,480
so here i can see all the headings on

00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,919
the page i can use the arrows

00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,600
in tables menu and look at all the

00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:35,280
tables on the page i'm not quite sure

00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,120
why there are tables here but windows

00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,159
spot links menu i can look at all the

00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,799
links on the page

00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,200
and right away what issues just based on

00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,679
this

00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,559
and this is exactly how people who use

00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,799
screen readers

00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:48,159
uh use them so this is worth knowing

00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,200
about just because in the end of the day

00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:52,159
that's how they actually

00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,960
experience your sites um yeah i'll leave

00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,080
it there but

00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,159
yeah this is really inside a minute

00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,760
voiceover off and again i just showed

00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,520
voiceover because it was fast for me on

00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,600
the mic but there are other options

00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,600
i can also show you voiceover on ios if

00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,240
you can look at my camera for a moment

00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,360
i also have it next to the microphone i

00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:11,120
just need to triple tap

00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:14,960
the home button voiceover to start

00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:18,159
safari address and then to navigate

00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,159
it's just swipe rights

00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:28,400
all right we'll leave it there and yeah

00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:29,919
it's that simple to get this uh going

00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:33,679
and use them for testing

00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:36,880
so worth knowing about um i want to end

00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:38,720
on on community wins um and again call

00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,159
for that cultural shift i mentioned

00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,159
earlier on

00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:44,000
um to me django it's quite clearly

00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:45,440
jungle developers have a role to play in

00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,240
this because again this matters for all

00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,159
projects

00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,760
and the standards are well defined and

00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:52,880
there are lots of tools you can use

00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:54,640
for those types of checks so yeah do

00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,320
take some some time to be aware of those

00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,240
standouts even though you might only

00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,919
spend most of your time in the back end

00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,919
you do need to be aware of those

00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:03,760
constraints on images

00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:05,280
heading levels and so on when you when

00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,480
you model your websites

00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,480
and the tools that you can use to

00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,320
actually run tests

00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,960
before someone like me steps in and does

00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,480
an audit these are already available

00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,559
there's lots of free and open source

00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,640
options as well

00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:21,120
and i think that django as a framework

00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:23,120
as well has a clear role to play in this

00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,240
there is this study by webinam called

00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,080
the web i million

00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,840
which tracks how accessible the the

00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:31,120
web's one million

00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:33,039
most popular websites are and the

00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,640
numbers are horrendous honestly there's

00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,720
no other way to put it um

00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,559
so yeah i feel like frameworks like

00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,799
jingle have to step in

00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:42,400
and provide better defaults whether

00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,279
that's the actual framework or whether

00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,360
that's just their

00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:46,400
documentation of how to implement those

00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,240
things

00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,600
and um yeah this is actually happening

00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,799
for django so

00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:54,480
quite recently tom carrick started the

00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,200
discussion on the django developers

00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,120
mailing list

00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,240
and out of the discussion came this

00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,799
process depth

00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:03,440
from django for django sorry to have a

00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:05,039
dedicated accessibility team

00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,559
i really think this is this is worth

00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:09,360
considering and uh

00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:09,919
worth your time and feedback so things

00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,440
that could

00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:12,960
this could evolve well obviously making

00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,600
the django admin wiki

00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:17,520
compliant making the django docs and

00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:20,000
websites without compliance

00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:21,039
having django features that you use to

00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
build your sites

00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:25,520
uh be compliant by default as well

00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,240
better documentation

00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,919
and and so on there really is uh lots of

00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,679
room for improvements if i'm honest

00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,600
so yeah worth being involved with those

00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:35,120
conversations uh

00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,120
and yeah providing your feedback on

00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,960
these and again um

00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,640
coming back to my whitetail story well i

00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,559
guess this is where we were at with

00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,360
whitetail about a year ago we initially

00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:46,320
we

00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,919
in discussions about our cms the admin

00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,120
websites the docs

00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:51,279
and the conclusion of this of this

00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:53,360
discussion well we're still very much in

00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:54,720
progress on actually fixing the issues

00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,120
but at least it feels like as a

00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,559
community we do have quite a consensus

00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,080
that those things matter and we want

00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:02,960
them addressed as much as possible

00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:04,480
as soon as possible so yeah that's where

00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,480
i'll leave you

00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:15,840
and thank you i hope this was good and

00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:15,840
there'll be time for questions hopefully

00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,760
yeah i forgot there was a recording for

00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,080
this as well

00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,520
all right recording is on

00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:26,799
[Laughter]

00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:28,159
um yeah please fire away all the

00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:31,600
questions you want in the chat

00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:32,640
or on vocal if you prefer on slack i'll

00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,279
be around for

00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,400
quite a bit more time after this as well

00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:39,679
first question was

00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,400
uh where you can find the depth that i

00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:42,080
just mentioned

00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,679
so i'll probably try and share my screen

00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:46,480
and show it to you at the same time

00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:47,760
as um answer the question this is

00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,159
essentially on a

00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:52,480
repository that django has just for

00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,480
depths

00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,320
all right you should see my screen now

00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:59,600
so django slash

00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,320
depths and this number 69 this is where

00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,880
they

00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:04,640
have all of the in-progress ones um and

00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,919
this is yeah still just a full request

00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,880
for now so i think the

00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:10,159
feedback process is as simple as uh

00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,720
reviewing a pull request

00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:12,720
essentially

00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:25,840
okay thank you tweet

00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,279
does anyone have questions

00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:37,039
i know your talk focused on screen

00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,919
readers but is there

00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:40,799
any other kinds of accessibility that we

00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:44,559
should be

00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:44,559
aware of nobody

00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,080
yes

00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:49,679
[Laughter]

00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,520
that that's a very tough one because

00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,760
there are so many things i could mention

00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,720
but i guess i'll try and uh keep it

00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,400
brief while

00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,159
other people think of other questions so

00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,400
i'll quickly share my screen again

00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:02,559
and show you a few things just as a kind

00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:06,799
of demoing what those things might be

00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:08,720
that you have to consider um

00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:11,200
i'll show you the extension i talked

00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:13,120
about during the presentation

00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,400
so this has automated checks that

00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,880
essentially cover

00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,320
any and all types of issues if i run

00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,720
this on the django website

00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,600
all of the ones that are there are uh

00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,799
most of them actually

00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:27,840
at least are related to contrast issues

00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:29,039
so this idea that um the text needs to

00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,120
be readable enough

00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:32,399
regardless of how good the vision of

00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,760
people are

00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:35,120
so it's not just whether you're

00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,200
completely blind and using constrainer

00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:39,679
or not but just how good your vision is

00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,279
and of course as you grow older well

00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:43,760
your vision declines quite a lot

00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:44,960
so this is pretty much for everyone who

00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,679
wears glasses

00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,880
uh to just happens to be older than the

00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:52,320
average

00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:55,760
um yeah another example i like to

00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:58,399
mention is um keyboard accessibility so

00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,279
again uh if you're using screener you

00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:01,039
like to use it

00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:02,480
with the keyboard but even if you're not

00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:04,159
using one well

00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,440
you might be navigating the web with the

00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:06,159
keyboard and you might expect that to

00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,159
work

00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:09,200
so this extension also has a check for

00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:11,440
you to see

00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,360
the order in which your page is

00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:16,000
navigable with the keyboard

00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:17,440
the idea being that well this should

00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,640
make sense and you should be able to

00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,240
follow along the page

00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,480
and interact with all of the parts of

00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:25,279
the page with the keyboard alone

00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,000
that's a common example as well um and i

00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:28,960
guess the last

00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,600
practical one i would mention is that if

00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:33,279
you're using a website on a small screen

00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,880
well there are lots of other concerns

00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:37,600
here so um

00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:39,279
for example on on the small ui uh you

00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,360
might be tempted to make

00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:43,200
very small buttons you don't want that

00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:46,000
to happen because if someone has to use

00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,960
your ui with a big firm they want to be

00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,799
able to press

00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,000
any and all buttons without accidentally

00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:52,880
doing something else

00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,600
so yeah just kind of uh the practicality

00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,360
of

00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,960
working on small screens having the

00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:00,320
right input input

00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,919
targets sizes um

00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,360
yeah i think that's that's uh that's a

00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:05,360
good few ones but

00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,640
uh it doesn't stop there the list is

00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,919
quite long uh

00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,320
if you want to learn more about this

00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:13,279
there is a thing called the do's

00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,679
and don'ts posters that have been made

00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:18,900
by

00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:24,320
on the bds in the uk can i find them

00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:26,159
[Music]

00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:28,320
so these do's and don't posters they

00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:29,440
kind of cover all of the things you have

00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:32,480
to worry about

00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:34,240
so again three meters just one of them

00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,799
i might share this link after the after

00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,799
the questions

00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,360
thank you that's wonderful for me yeah

00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:43,120
my my pleasure

00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:44,720
uh guys i know you asked what's the name

00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,520
of the tool i'm using right now to see

00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:49,039
the links

00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:50,640
um that would likely be uh accessibility

00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:53,360
insights which is the

00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,640
browser extension i was showing in my in

00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:57,600
my talk

00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:59,039
um so this is well i'll be honest there

00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,960
are many extensions like this

00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:02,399
out there why i like this one in

00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,559
particular is that

00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:06,240
uh it contains all of the different

00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:07,200
tests you could wish for in a single

00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,840
package

00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:12,240
so both the automated ones with axe but

00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:14,720
also the kind of semi-automated ones

00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,240
and even more interestingly it also has

00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,000
fully manual tests

00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:20,159
like i go through the page the whole

00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,919
page myself as a tester

00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:23,520
and i take notes of what i've gone

00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:25,600
through don't gone through

00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:28,000
so yeah it does pretty much everything

00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,000
and more

00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,360
i hope my talk made some sense i would

00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,039
be keen to hear what people think of

00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,240
curly lint as well in particular because

00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,960
i've been working on this for a while

00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:46,240
and

00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,799
yeah not quite sure what to make of it

00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:51,840
but yeah

00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:51,840
any questions fire away

00:30:53,360 --> 00:31:00,000
um you said about the

00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,200
the pictures that you can't see the alt

00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,720
text

00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:07,919
at the start i didn't understand why you

00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:10,640
have can't uh see the alter because

00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:11,360
at least as far as i can tell most of

00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:16,080
the times you

00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:20,000
use the template to do this not

00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:24,640
just take a picture from the

00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:27,120
from the model um

00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,679
so i think i understand what you're

00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,480
saying

00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:32,960
and essentially that only applies if

00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:35,039
someone took the time to

00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:38,080
um well it has to be defined in the

00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:39,840
models but it also has to be entered

00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,360
in the admin you know like if there's

00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:44,559
the field someone needs to

00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:47,279
uh fill that field and that's why

00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:47,760
those types of fields when the images

00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,760
aren't

00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:52,399
just decorative they do need to be

00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:56,320
mandatory and someone needs to be there

00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:58,380
adding the alt text does that make sense

00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,600
how are you supposed to

00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:02,640
[Music]

00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:03,600
show the image if you because as far as

00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,320
i remember

00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,200
you do it's not a jungle templating

00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:10,799
system

00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:14,000
that builds the the html tag for image

00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:15,600
how am i wrong here uh so you would

00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,519
you know you would use the django

00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:20,640
templating system to

00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:22,080
create i guess you you would use html to

00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:24,480
create the image tag

00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,679
and in jangle templates you just uh map

00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,000
the images

00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:30,240
src and alt attributes to the correct

00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,240
field

00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:34,080
but you need to be aware that the alt

00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,519
one

00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,600
needs to be there as well and not just

00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:40,640
src if that makes sense ah

00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:42,720
okay i understand you mean that you will

00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:46,000
need to put something in that

00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:48,799
because uh in

00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,760
other situations it would be something

00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:52,399
uh

00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:54,320
generic at least if not there and then

00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:56,399
yeah it's not empty spring

00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:58,080
yeah so if you if you don't put you

00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:01,039
don't put anything in the ads

00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,760
um if if you still have the alt equals

00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:04,960
attribute

00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:07,039
in your templates then uh screeners

00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,720
won't read the image at all they'll just

00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:10,640
pretend that nothing is there

00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,159
but if you don't have the attributes at

00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:15,279
all then it will actually

00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:18,399
read the url to the image file

00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:21,840
which as you can imagine is quite bad

00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:22,640
um so the alt attribute always needs to

00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,880
be there

00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,840
in the templates then the question that

00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,000
you have to answer

00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,880
in the cma in cms sorry in the in your

00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,919
models

00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:34,480
is whether the alt attributes

00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:35,840
need to be defined or whether it's okay

00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,440
for it to not be there

00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:39,919
so essentially it might be better if i

00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:42,480
showed you an example actually

00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:43,919
um how can i show you an example screen

00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:47,039
share

00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:47,039
application window

00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,360
all right should be back on my screen

00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,720
share so this is a this is a website we

00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,320
built with whitetail but again that

00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:57,360
applies regardless of

00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:58,720
which flavor or django you use so these

00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:01,840
images right there that i

00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:03,679
was showing in my talk well

00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:06,080
this is the whole content of this

00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:08,960
section so here the images clearly

00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:10,879
aren't just decorative uh you do want to

00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:13,280
know what each of these are

00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:15,040
so if you can't see the images well in

00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:18,480
this case here you want this to say

00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:19,359
google nasa mit mozilla and so on you

00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,159
just want to

00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:23,280
have the textual equivalent to all those

00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:26,000
logos

00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:27,839
um whereas if i go further down the page

00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,879
so for example here i have this

00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:33,040
list of websites built with blacktail so

00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:34,240
the images are are still interesting i

00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:37,040
assume but

00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:38,240
if you didn't have the images on there

00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,919
if you couldn't see them

00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:41,679
you could still see the text underneath

00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:44,320
it will still stay which

00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:46,320
website this is so in this case the

00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,399
images are mostly decorative

00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,760
there isn't that much value in you

00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:51,440
describing uh

00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,280
what exactly the ice medical per our

00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,679
website looks like

00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,960
all you care about as a user trying to

00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:59,040
go through this page

00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,480
is the fact that those websites are

00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,960
built with whitetail you don't really

00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,040
care

00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:05,520
what they look like precisely if that

00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,520
makes sense

00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:16,000
um i'll have a quick look on slack see

00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,440
whether there are any questions there i

00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,200
was trying to commit to

00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,560
reading slack as i went through but of

00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:24,480
course this was

00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:27,599
ah that knife out um

00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:31,920
uh i've got a question oh yeah

00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:34,480
uh here from the netherlands yes

00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:37,839
can you elaborate a bit on the

00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:40,640
accessibility tools in tests

00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:41,760
like do you use curly lint in a test

00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:45,280
suite or

00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:48,800
what what how do you integrate

00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:50,640
accessibility checks in tests yeah so

00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:54,160
i probably need to

00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:56,320
[Music]

00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,359
get a couple of links up before i can

00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:00,530
answer this

00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:05,130
just so it's a bit more visual

00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:05,130
[Music]

00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:09,599
all right and the link i need in

00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:12,240
particular is somewhere on there

00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:12,880
so there is a great uh well very

00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:16,640
interesting

00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:20,079
audit again from the gds in the uk

00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:21,280
they went through how many accessibility

00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:23,040
issues

00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:25,520
each of the common accessibility

00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:27,760
checking tools find

00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,560
and um when you see a number like this

00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:31,440
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:33,440
of issues were found i'm not sure what

00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,960
what you would say but personally i i

00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,640
feel like that's quite low like i would

00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,880
i would expect a tool that

00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:40,480
you have to pay for to find as many

00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:43,200
things as possible

00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:45,920
so what what this means is that no

00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:48,400
matter which combination of tools

00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:50,480
you're going to use ideally there should

00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,200
still be someone who manually audits the

00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,440
websites

00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,560
whether that's as part of code review

00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,480
per feature

00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:58,160
or whether whether that's towards launch

00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,320
you can do it however you want to some

00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:03,680
extent but there needs to be some manual

00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:04,480
auditing but of course manual auditing

00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,000
takes a lot

00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,520
of time it's the same as doing

00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,359
penetration testing for security you

00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:11,599
can't do this just all the time

00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:12,560
so that's why you need to have automated

00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:15,520
tools to help you

00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:16,960
with the testing with the qa and well

00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,599
the problem with those tools is that

00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,400
even though

00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:22,640
they found quite a big chunk of issues

00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,880
generally you can only run those tools

00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,320
on the rendered page like literally once

00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,040
the site is built and you see it in the

00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,320
browser

00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,800
that's where you can run the tools that

00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:32,880
find the most things but

00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,960
ideally you wouldn't want to have to

00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,560
wait that long like have to wait for the

00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,920
page to be displayed in the browser for

00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:40,160
you to run those tests

00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,920
if you did this in ci well you need to

00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:44,640
have a continuous integration

00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:46,800
capability that displays your whole site

00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:49,520
in ci which can be quite romantic

00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:51,760
so that's why it's important to approach

00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:54,800
this in some kind of layered way

00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:59,040
where you have different checks

00:37:54,800 --> 00:38:01,839
that happen from you typing the code

00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:03,119
to the site being live that hopefully

00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:05,200
means that

00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:07,920
when the site goes live you can focus on

00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,920
only the things you could find this way

00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:12,079
um so i guess that that's what my my

00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,280
blog post that i mentioned is about to

00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:17,520
some extent

00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:18,800
um essentially you you want to spend

00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,720
all of your time with the tools that

00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,000
find the things as close as possible to

00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,839
the actual code

00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,520
so that's where curly lint is useful

00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:28,480
color lint works

00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:29,760
on the django templates not just html

00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,079
which means that you can run it

00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:34,240
as part of actually typing your code

00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:36,640
whereas things like axe

00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:38,480
or the html validation well these don't

00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,119
support django templates you only can

00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:42,560
run them

00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:46,160
as part of your unit test essentially or

00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:48,240
integration tests um so yeah what i

00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:50,640
would suggest practically these days

00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:53,599
is you could try using collagen as part

00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:55,119
of a pre-commit hook for example

00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:57,920
and then you could use django html

00:38:55,119 --> 00:39:00,079
validator as part of your unit tests

00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,440
and then in ci where you have more time

00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:02,960
for the test to run

00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,960
you could use something fancier like

00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:09,119
pali that uh

00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:10,960
includes axe and uh headless browser

00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:13,200
that was a there was a very long answer

00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:16,079
so i hope it kind of makes sense

00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,079
yeah it does thank you

00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:21,040
i think we probably run out of time for

00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,400
questions but we probably

00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,000
someone probably let us know but if

00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,839
anyone has any other questions again

00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:30,560
i'll be around on stack

00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:30,560
um yeah any any parting questions

00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:43,839
all right i'll be around

00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:45,920
see you all

00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:45,920
