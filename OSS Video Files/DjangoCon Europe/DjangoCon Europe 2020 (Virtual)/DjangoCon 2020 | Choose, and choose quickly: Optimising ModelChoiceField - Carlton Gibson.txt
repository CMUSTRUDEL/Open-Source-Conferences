"Choose, and choose quickly: Optimising ModelChoiceField" by Carlton Gibson

Ever had a ModelForm, a DRF Serializer, a FilterSet grind to a halt rendering a choice field? Of course you have. Ever given up on it and resorted to raw ids? -- No don't answer that. We're going to look at how you can get a grip on ModelChoiceField when you're dealing with lots of related objects, and when you need to offer that choice again and again and again, without needing to put the kettle on.
