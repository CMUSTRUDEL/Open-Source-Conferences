“Digitisation and Education — How the AlekSIS project fosters co-creation of school software by young people” by Dominik George, Tom Teichler 

Free software is all about participation, and projects can empower young people to participate by designing their software in a way that opens it up for learning and teaching in education. This talk reports from the AlekSIS project that develops real-world educational software that is intended to be extended by the students that actually work with it.

hello everyone and welcome to our talk

00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,280
about

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,200
digitization and education uh how the

00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:17,920
alexis project fosters co-creation of

00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:17,920
school software by young people

00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,359
my name is tom i am a 16 years old

00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:26,400
apprentice systems engineer from germany

00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,840
in my free time i am a systems engineer

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,039
and software maintainer at the tickets

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,279
fall and

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,000
i like coding and devops or travelling

00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:36,800
to foster conferences

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,120
hi my name is dominic and i am

00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:42,160
chairperson of tickets if all

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,879
i'm accompanying tom today and yeah well

00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,399
my

00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:49,039
my goal with tickets is to to really get

00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:51,120
young people into into free software and

00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:54,079
getting them to contribute

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,239
um i'm a systems engineer at creative

00:00:54,079 --> 00:01:01,120
gamihar which is a german company

00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:04,720
who has committed to really high quality

00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:07,840
open source support for business

00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,920
and yeah one of my hobbies is traveling

00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,360
open source conferences

00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,600
helping helping people present

00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,799
running booths for free software and

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,159
education

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:24,080
and also giving talks about

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:26,479
what to expect and what to care about

00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:29,600
when trying to help young people

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,600
contribute to projects

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,840
dominic and i are both members of the

00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,240
tickets if our the probably only free

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,240
software youth organization in germany

00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,399
our headquarters is in germany but we

00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,479
are working internationally for example

00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:47,759
at the first time in belgium or at the

00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:49,439
linux days in austria the goal is to set

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,280
up a free software community for

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,880
children and youth

00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,479
to reach this goal we provide

00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,479
educational organizations

00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,079
organizations with ready readily

00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:59,759
available free software both as

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,479
community driven software as a service

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,600
platform and

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,520
individual hosted the core principle is

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,399
children and youth are involved in all

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,879
parts of our work both in technical and

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,360
organizational areas to make being a

00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:15,040
contributor second nature to them

00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,120
we are also contributing to free

00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,480
educational software such as alexis or

00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,720
debian edu

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,400
we have another project called frog labs

00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,400
where we directly attract

00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,080
children to coding and making workshops

00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,800
to get them in touch with free software

00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,800
and creative aspects of technology

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,640
one of the free public projects of

00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,640
jackets is called shuffle which is an

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,480
idiomatic pun of school and free

00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,680
translating as off-school in proper

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,599
english

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,440
the surface selection currently includes

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,239
free educational software like moodle

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,519
next cloud big

00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,440
button alexis and debian edu

00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,280
schufer's goal is it to create a bridge

00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,040
between teachers developers students and

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,959
companies shoe fry provides

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,959
many opportunities for adoption and

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:59,040
participation participation

00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,040
so please feel free to participate

00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,519
fast projects should include everyone

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,080
everyone means every person who wants to

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,080
contribute

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,959
to open source software so children and

00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,120
youth are also included in everyone

00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,360
typical barriers are for example terms

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,200
of use if they limit the user's rights

00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,319
because they are not legally acceptable

00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,640
by children

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,239
so please keep barriers to your minimum

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,159
choose a free and non-discriminating

00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:25,840
license and make sure that your terms of

00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,840
use are illegally acceptable for

00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,760
children

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,760
it is important to unders

00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:41,120
it is important to understand that young

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,120
users are also contributors

00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,840
most of them are passive contributors

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,840
that means that they

00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,840
are

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,440
most of them are passive contributors

00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,560
that means that they are used the

00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,959
software give feedback

00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,040
they are making and sharing experiences

00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,159
so young users are an important target

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,840
group

00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,840
some young users

00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,599
some young persons are also active

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,439
contributors they are developing their

00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:09,360
own software or contributing through to

00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,120
the software they are using

00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,120
one example for very young active

00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,200
contributors during the tickets

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,959
workshops children as young as 10 years

00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,759
are patching tools they are using in

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,759
their workshops

00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,880
non-free and in the worst case

00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,320
discriminatory platforms are very

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,120
widespreadly used

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,960
in free software development

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,720
unfortunately many projects do not

00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,479
pay so much attention to the terms of

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,400
service of the tools they use

00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,520
but this is a critical starting point to

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,000
really get

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,800
everyone included in development and in

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,320
contributing

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,600
to the project for example github is the

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,280
most widespread

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:52,560
platform for source code hosting and

00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:55,040
collaborative development also there is

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,840
gitlab.com as an alternative and

00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:01,759
bitbucket and some other platforms

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:04,960
all of them share the property that

00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:06,960
they discriminate against young people

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,720
they have some legal reasons to do that

00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,600
because for example

00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,560
under u.s legislation there is the

00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,039
copper law

00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:18,320
which which forces which forces them to

00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:22,160
restrict access to under 13 year olds

00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:23,900
under some under some circumstances and

00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,199
these circumstances are

00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:27,680
[Music]

00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,560
some somewhat based on other on other

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,840
terms these

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,320
these services um these services have in

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,320
their

00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,320
um in their legal texts

00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,479
so what can happen here is that there

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:43,199
are some people not only young people

00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,000
who cannot use these services and they

00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,400
are basically

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,080
excluded or even if they aren't excluded

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:51,199
they are turned into certain

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,520
interesting class citizens this is they

00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,400
may

00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:56,400
maybe can can contribute by by using a

00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,680
proxy by getting another person to

00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:02,639
to post an issue in their name um

00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,120
or they can use another channel they can

00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,960
find

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,479
find some private email address of of

00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,039
one of the developers and

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,960
and send them their opinion or question

00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:14,000
or contribution

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:16,160
but they are not on the same level as

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,360
other contributors

00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,280
so at the very least every project be it

00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,000
for development for discussion

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,520
or as a technology conference need to

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,479
find ways how to

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:31,280
get everyone included for example a

00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:34,639
technology conference

00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:36,400
will do almost everything for for a

00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,560
for a venue where people get for

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,120
in-person events they will do everything

00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,160
to not

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,400
lock out like wheelchair users

00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,280
and even for people who have certain

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,759
views like

00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,479
vegetarians they will have alternatives

00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,919
for

00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:53,599
for lunch maybe and it's very important

00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,919
to also carry this idea

00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:57,199
into the virtual into the virtual world

00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,639
into virtual venues

00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,400
into software development into

00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,240
discussion

00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,840
but the groups of people that are

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,800
excluded in this area

00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:09,280
are different for example children and

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:13,440
young people

00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:16,479
so for development for discussion use

00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,319
if you can use use at least one channel

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,240
that is accessible to everyone

00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,919
if you can make it the only channel this

00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,039
is ideal if you can

00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:26,560
cannot make it the only channel it

00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:30,400
there should be an alternative that can

00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:32,319
really really be used by everyone

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,440
if accessibility for every group of

00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,160
people

00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,800
is ensured then the next step is how we

00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,680
can design

00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,639
projects that are easy to contribute to

00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,479
and that are

00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:46,400
easy to contribute to for people that

00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,400
are under that are still under education

00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,800
to allow everyone who wants to

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,800
contribute to free software there are

00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,160
some free alternatives which everyone

00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,000
can use

00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,000
for source code hosting everyone can use

00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,759
free gitlab instances like edugate or

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,599
pharmac to community

00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,520
communicate with others matrix or

00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:05,440
metamorph can be used

00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,039
some github instances have an integrated

00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,720
metamost instance connected to the

00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,479
gitlab instance

00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,560
for video conferences or webinars

00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,840
platforms like jitsi or bigbluebutton

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,919
can be used

00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,599
also while using free software

00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,520
alternatives you have to pay attention

00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,960
to the terms of use of the instances you

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,039
are using

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,360
for example the official gitlab instance

00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:28,800
gitlab.com cannot be used by children

00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,800
due to their terms of use

00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,880
this is the dashboard of the alexis

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,719
instance at our pilot school the

00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,880
caterinium at lubeck

00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,479
alexis is high customizable so you can

00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,159
style your alexis in your school's ci

00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,959
colors at your school's logo and much

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,640
more

00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,320
everyone who has an account is able to

00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,399
customize this dashboard with widgets

00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,040
for example the today's timetable rss

00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,320
widgets

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:52,080
or notifications

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,080
in the timetable provided by alexis

00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,399
appcorners you can see your timetable by

00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,160
week you also can see timetables for

00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,080
groups or rooms

00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,600
alexis app corners shows if there is a

00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,560
substitution or if the lesson was

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,080
cancelled

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,760
in this screenshot you can see two

00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,360
cancelled lessons and these lessons were

00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,279
cancelled due to an alexis death sprint

00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,040
this week

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,640
the class registered feature allows you

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,720
to mark students as absent late or

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,240
excused if they are not present

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,760
you can make notes in every lesson and

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,839
save the homework you gave

00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,080
additionally you can add notes per

00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:23,760
student

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,440
on this slide you can see some of the

00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,240
alexis core features

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,440
and some of the additional official apps

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,160
the core features

00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,279
are features such as the management of

00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,800
persons and groups

00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:38,959
or the two-factor authentication and

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,279
the general app platform so that you can

00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:44,160
install additional apps

00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,720
the whole alexis ecosystem works with

00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,160
the

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:51,920
materialized css framework

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:55,360
so that everything looks clean and

00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:58,480
the same alexis automatically back

00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,440
up his database and static and media

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:05,360
files

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:09,120
so that you don't miss any data if

00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:11,120
your alexis instance breaks

00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:14,240
alexis currently provides the official

00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:16,640
apps lcd chronos xlibris ngap

00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,000
because we already explained lcg and

00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,440
chronos we are going to only

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,519
describe x labels on shape on this slide

00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,600
with xlibris you can manage your

00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,320
school's library you can create books

00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,079
generate

00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,160
barcodes with your school's logo and

00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:32,320
scan these barcodes to open the book

00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,279
book copies page or to borrow it to a

00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,360
student

00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:36,800
you also can manage the condition of the

00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,959
book copies

00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,959
cape is the feedback and support request

00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,560
tool you can create feedback categories

00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,160
in here so that everyone can give

00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,519
feedback to your instance

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,200
the feedback will be emailed to a

00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,959
configured email address

00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,959
the feedback is important because if

00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,279
there are any bugs the user can report

00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:54,959
them

00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,959
and you can open a bug report

00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,120
alexis provides some integrations with

00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,320
other educational software you can

00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,480
import timetables of

00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,480
it

00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,240
alexis provides some integrations with

00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,240
other educational software

00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,320
you can import timetable data from untis

00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,760
a german timetabling software or users

00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,399
groups classes and

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,880
keep them in sync with your adapt server

00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,560
with

00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,720
the additional dashboard feeds app you

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,200
can add rss and calendar feeds to your

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,200
dashboard

00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,000
in alexis we are trying to use best

00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,880
practices everywhere we can

00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,880
because we want to

00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,760
in alexis we are trying to use best

00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:40,399
practices everywhere we can because we

00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,399
want to elect

00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,040
at alexis we are trying to use best

00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:47,120
practices everywhere we can because we

00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,800
want alexis to be in textbook example in

00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,120
school so that computer classes can

00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,720
learn with alex's source code

00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,880
we are using very complex and

00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,040
complicated things like query sets or

00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,639
managers to manage alex's data but

00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,320
these functions are mostly well

00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:03,839
documented and generally

00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:05,839
generally reusable with these functions

00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:11,839
it is very easy to develop own apps and

00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:11,839
manage alexis data in these apps

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:19,040
as we already explained alexis uses an

00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:21,040
app-like modularity system provided by

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:23,279
the alexa score and

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,639
features of features of the school

00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:27,279
information system

00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,639
can be added by by installing apps apps

00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,959
are

00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,720
yeah basically what they are they are

00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,959
they are jungle applications

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,920
with a bit of glue around them that

00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,760
makes them

00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:40,560
that makes them compatible with the with

00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:43,040
the alexis ecosystem

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,880
the idea is that real world processes

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:48,480
are encapsulated into

00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:51,839
into separate apps so when

00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:54,399
a school has the one process they want

00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:57,440
to they want to digitize like

00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:59,120
landing sending school books to um to

00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,639
students at the beginning of the school

00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,279
term

00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,880
then we call this a process and this

00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:07,040
process can be turned into

00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,000
into an app and this can either be done

00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,000
by

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,920
by the alexis development team by some

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,800
professional software developer

00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,839
or even by by a computer or coding class

00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,440
inside the school

00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,279
this is actually what we want to see

00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:23,120
happen we want

00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:23,839
coding classes to to create something

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,000
that is

00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:28,320
that is used in their real environment

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,760
that provides benefit for their for

00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,519
their real world that

00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,600
provides value they can see in their

00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,760
day-to-day day-to-day life

00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,040
so they do not only learn for throwaway

00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,360
projects in

00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,279
in their computer science classes but

00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,279
they they really can

00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,399
can turn the learning efforts into

00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,000
something that

00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,639
that they know what it is what it is

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,680
good for

00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:54,800
the licensing of alexis is another

00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,639
topic that needs a bit of thought to

00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,440
to make it easy for young for young

00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:02,480
people in the broad mass of people

00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:04,000
to contribute all these legal issues

00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,320
around software licensing

00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,519
about contribution contribution

00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,720
agreements

00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:12,959
and the like are somewhat difficult in

00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,839
parts maybe even more difficult than the

00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:16,880
technical aspects of contributing to

00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:18,720
software

00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:21,680
some some licenses are really short they

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,120
can be read easily like the mit license

00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:26,160
or the bsd license

00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:28,720
licenses and there are other licenses

00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,800
that are that are quite longish and

00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,160
contain a lot of corner cases and

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,199
explanations

00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,199
like the gpl

00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,959
this is one aspect so the natural choice

00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:44,560
here would be a short license that

00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:47,040
can be read and explained in a um

00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,240
in in a short period of time to to new

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,639
contributors and

00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,760
especially young contributors but these

00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:55,839
short licenses

00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:59,920
normally don't provide much protection

00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:01,600
now as a as a person who

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,680
who really likes openness who really

00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,639
wants to foster open software

00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,680
i tend to use the mit license because i

00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,959
want to give

00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,320
the most freedom i can sometimes i

00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:14,639
play with the thought of using a

00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,440
copyleft license to to ensure that

00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,399
software

00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:21,440
will stay open and i can understand that

00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:24,240
people find this important too

00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,399
and when i work with young people when

00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:29,440
we work with young people at tickets

00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,560
we also tend to use copyleft licenses

00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,519
because

00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:35,279
we think that is this easier for the for

00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,360
the young people to understand what the

00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:40,000
consequences of opening the software

00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,720
are if they know that others will have

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,880
to

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,399
will have to keep the soft the software

00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,279
open and cannot just

00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,880
cannot just take the the work they do

00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:51,519
into a commercial product

00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,880
without without caring about keeping the

00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,959
software open

00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,519
or providing changes back to the

00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,519
community

00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,560
the choice we made at some point was use

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,399
the eupl which is the european union

00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,240
public license

00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:07,600
it's a bit special because it's not that

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:12,000
widely adapted but it is

00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:14,160
um but it is an osi osi approved license

00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,440
the free software foundation has has

00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,959
approved it

00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:22,399
um it resembles the gpl a bit with

00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:25,839
aspects of both the lgpl and the agpl

00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:27,040
so it has terms about running software

00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,680
as a service

00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,639
and it also has terms about linking with

00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,759
with product and

00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,759
under other licenses

00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,320
so it offers both good protection for

00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,880
users and contributors

00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,880
especially within the eu because it is

00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:46,160
somewhat

00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:49,120
somewhat bundled with eu copyright law

00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,320
um but it is also but it is also

00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:54,000
workable for

00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:56,320
for legislations outside outside the eu

00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,320
one special thing about the eupl is that

00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,720
it has official translations into all

00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,399
you

00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:04,319
all eu languages so

00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,559
there is an official license text in

00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:08,959
every language we encounter in the

00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:11,039
in the eu including english of course

00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,480
which makes it understandable in more

00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:15,600
areas of the world

00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:18,480
but um for let's say

00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:21,199
a spanish group of student students who

00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,880
are already

00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:26,400
who have already enough to do

00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:29,520
understanding the content of the license

00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,840
we can remove the need to to understand

00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,000
the

00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,400
the legal the legal english tax and we

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,799
can provide them with a spanish tax

00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,960
because this license is actually made

00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:43,039
for for citizens not

00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,039
not only for for lawyers

00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,679
the the sas protection is a bit easier

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,480
to implement in practice than with the

00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,960
agpl

00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,640
i do not want to discuss this in in

00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,679
detail here

00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,799
but uh in general we get a good level of

00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:00,400
protection for

00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:03,120
for web applications while also keeping

00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,799
keeping the software quite open and

00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,840
above all

00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:10,960
the legal stuff understandable by a wide

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,960
range of contributors

00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:15,360
also it clearly has the place of

00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:18,080
jurisdiction in the license

00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,600
which is important because we want do

00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:23,440
not want to

00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:26,960
impose the imposed the danger of having

00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:30,320
any um any legal stuff to do

00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:32,000
in in very remote places if

00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,480
everything should ever anything should

00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,480
ever happen

00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,720
because the alexis team is

00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,720
geographically a bit pulled apart our

00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:49,039
development process is based on a mix of

00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,960
scrum and feature driven development

00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:53,039
that means that we have two week sprints

00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,880
with a review and planning meeting with

00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:57,280
a team at the catalinium every second

00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,520
friday we are working with milestones

00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:01,039
for every release and also for alpha or

00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:05,200
beta releases

00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:06,559
everything everything is committed to a

00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,880
separate branches per

00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:10,320
issue if the work on an issue is done a

00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,080
merger quest will be created

00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,840
and the changes will be reviewed by one

00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,400
of our maintainers and the death meeting

00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,400
and if

00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,679
everything is ok it will be merged into

00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,640
the master branch

00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:22,480
alexis is represented by the deputy

00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:26,320
headmaster of the catarenium

00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,320
and the chairperson of tickets

00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,799
if you are developing software we would

00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,880
ask you to use free platforms that can

00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:34,640
be used by everyone regardless of their

00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,240
age or anything else

00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,799
for example you can use our own

00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,640
self-hosted gitlab instance edu git to

00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:42,799
develop your software and the connected

00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,720
bigbluebutton instance and metamouse to

00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,720
communicate with others

00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,900
you also can use our played instance to

00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,400
translate your software

00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,840
[Music]

00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,160
now that we describe the general

00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,280
development process of alexis the school

00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,200
information system

00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:00,320
let's look at the most important school

00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:02,960
in this process the catalinium in lubeck

00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,320
alexis is mainly developed by a group of

00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,200
students and

00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,080
one teacher at the catholium together

00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,640
with

00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,000
some with one other student and a

00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:15,440
professional software developer

00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,679
developer from tickets and

00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:20,080
they have established the development of

00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:22,430
this application somewhat in there

00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,760
in the general all day school life

00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:25,840
[Music]

00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,960
there is regular feedback from teachers

00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,919
and students

00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,520
normally very positive feedback and they

00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:33,440
say that the application is fast and

00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,760
clean that they like their responsive

00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,039
and

00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:39,440
mobile friendly design that they can

00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:40,480
send direct support requests through the

00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:44,240
yelp app

00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,559
and um at the the digital class register

00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,480
called

00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:51,520
ulcer which is a rabbit arabic for

00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:54,640
for the class register has

00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:56,559
features they really like and they

00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,200
couldn't have gotten that that that

00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:01,919
easily in commercial applications

00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:04,400
like automatic summation of absent hours

00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:04,400
and

00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:10,320
such things they also think that

00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,840
they really benefit from the development

00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,200
team being

00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,280
being part of their school as well

00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,760
because they get prompt response to bugs

00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,919
and

00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:20,320
feature requests they can have a chat

00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:23,760
with with the young developers they

00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:25,200
they can exchange exchange discussion

00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:28,480
directly

00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:31,840
and um yeah they they know that

00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:33,919
the that both the teacher who

00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,039
who helps developing alexis and the

00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:37,280
students

00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:38,720
uh use it from day to day and they

00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,320
really know what's going on and they

00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,840
really understand what the

00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:44,000
what the use cases and the user stories

00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:46,480
are

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,360
and there are also some patches from

00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,159
from students

00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,840
outside the core team sometimes there

00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:54,000
are minor bugs

00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,840
be it as simple as typos that are that

00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,240
are fixed by by some student who does

00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:00,720
not

00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:02,960
regularly contribute to alexis they have

00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,960
some some students that contribute

00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,200
translations they have a

00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:10,400
team that that cares about a latin

00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:12,559
translation even which is

00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,760
maybe maybe not that important in

00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:16,320
practice but

00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:19,360
is another good example of how how

00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:22,480
developing such an application can

00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:24,240
can be a benefit for for learners and

00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,480
for the more practical languages they

00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:29,919
they also have a group that attacks

00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,919
translate alexis into french

00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:34,240
if you plan to contribute to free

00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:36,960
software in education the most important

00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,960
thing is to adapt an open miner friendly

00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,120
development process and to use open

00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,640
platforms which everyone can use

00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,720
please make sure your software can be

00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,360
used by computer classes to learn with

00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,760
it and

00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:49,520
contribute to it don't be afraid of

00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,280
young users or contributors in open

00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,200
source communities

00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,039
if possible it would be very helpful if

00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,559
you donate to the tickets if our to

00:22:55,039 --> 00:23:00,880
foster educational

00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:00,880
force projects and children as users and

00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,159
contributors

00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,760
so thank you for listening our talk if

00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:13,440

please ask them in the q and a section

00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,919
which is directly after the talk

00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,360
you are invited to visit the project's

00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,159
today's uh prison so uh if you have any

00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,440
questions uh

please uh feel free

00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
second speakers here as well hi

00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:18,320
uh hi uh i wanted to ask you if you have

00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:21,440
any recommendations on uh

00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:24,080
tactics uh approach to like

00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:26,480
teaching code like if have any reference

00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,480
to that

00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:36,480
so like a more

00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:40,400
uh directed way of teaching

00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,400
codes to young people or something

00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,840
this might be a question for me

00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,799
well uh i i can only say only say it

00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:56,960
depends we uh

00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:59,600
we more or less found found out that

00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,080
all yeah all classes or recording

00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,279
classes

00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:06,400
are are somewhat different um

00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:07,120
the the most interesting aspect maybe is

00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,440
that

00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:11,520
it actually works to to have children

00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:14,559
write write actual code

00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:16,000
um there are there are ways

00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:18,000
in like graphical programming using

00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,640
using scratch or

00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,400
comparable tools and they they are a

00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:25,520
really good starting point

00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:29,840
but the assumption that one cannot

00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:31,919
take a class of 10 or 11 year olds

00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,360
and have them have them start actually

00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:36,720
writing real code

00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:41,039
um mostly turns out to be um

00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:41,039
because it turns out to be wrong and

00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,200
i think it's i think it is it is a good

00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,320
way

00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,120
um to to really have children see real

00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,760
code and

00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:53,039
um when we do real real world world

00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:56,159
patching like

00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:57,440
like described in the talk it actually

00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:00,559
happens

00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,440
happens sometimes that when we do one of

00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:04,559
the workshops we

00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:08,240
normally do workshops using py game when

00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:11,600
we uh when we start coding with children

00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:13,840
and when we find bugs or missing small

00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:16,880
features in in tools we use like the

00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:20,559
the um the tony ide

00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:21,919
this has happened to um then we really

00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:23,919
walk

00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:25,039
one or two of the participants who who

00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:27,600
found this issue

00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:28,400
through uh through fixing the code and

00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,559
uh

00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,480
it is not important at this point that

00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:34,799
they that they really understand

00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,640
100 what they are doing but that they

00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:39,120
see the effect of what they do and

00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,000
that it actually has an effect not only

00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,640
not only for

00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,039
uh for them but but for everyone else

00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,240
and

00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:48,880
um this drives interest forward and

00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,159
once once it was managed to drive

00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:53,520
interest forward

00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:54,640
um the learning happens uh happens by

00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:59,120
itself if you give

00:26:54,640 --> 00:27:02,480
if you provide the material like um

00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:05,919
more tutorials on on py game uh

00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,720
ideas on how to continue using py game

00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:09,760
and then

00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,240
uh if you find a project that's that can

00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,720
be

00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,760
that that can be extended in in a coding

00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,799
class like we do without

00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:19,679
like we do with alexis um

00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:20,240
um the real world value even provides

00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,760
more

00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,760
more ways to drive interest forward

00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:30,080
and what about language barriers i don't

00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:34,559
know if your students speak english

00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:38,399
but it's normally hard to find

00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:41,120
code codes tutorials and and stuff and

00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:41,760
the language itself is in english right

00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:49,679
uh

00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:54,399
is that like any tips on that

00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:54,399
tom do you want to answer um i

00:27:54,880 --> 00:28:02,080
am sure if i get the question um

00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:05,200
we we also provide

00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:09,600
um materials that

00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,600
we um we

00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:16,720
i don't know okay um

00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,919
i i think we cannot really answer this

00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,159
question because the

00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:21,039
uh the issue you described is not that

00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:23,200
imminent in

00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:25,440
in germany because there are really

00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,039
really good python tutorials and and

00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:31,360
online courses in german

00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:34,080
um provided by bw in the

00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:36,000
national informatics competition

00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,840
organization

00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,679
they they provide a really really good

00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,919
online course there's

00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:44,159
the book hello world by carter sander

00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:46,000
who was himself 11 years old when he

00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:49,440
wrote it together with his father

00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:52,640
um is translated into german um

00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:54,559
i actually cannot say how this is in in

00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,240
in other areas we do not see this

00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:58,720
program in germany actually

00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,240
yeah well i guess we just have to like

00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:03,760
create more material

00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:06,559
in portuguese uh so it's available for

00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,559
more students

00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:13,840
but yeah thanks

00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,840
hello

00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:42,960
any more questions feedback ideas are

00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:42,960
also welcome how to improve things

00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:48,480
[Music]

00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:52,559
uh i was uh generally curious um

00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:56,159
how uh what's the the earliest

00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:59,200
age you'd consider uh is a

00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:00,960
a good time to start coding like

00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,559
i'd be guessing two years old is

00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:06,080
probably too

00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:08,240
too soon but then i i'm not sure i have

00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:10,480
a good idea what would be an appropriate

00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,480
day

00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:18,559
i think the youngest youngest child

00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:23,120
was six years old or seven

00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:27,760
okay um in our workshops

00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:30,559
and everything worked well

00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,559
so yeah

00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:36,000
i'd even say there is um the

00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:40,320
first of all it depends on on what you

00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:43,440
what you see as coding if you re

00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:46,159
me really focus on on writing

00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,600
writing code in in text then of course

00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:49,520
uh

00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,440
it depends on when when the child can

00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:54,880
can read and write properly

00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:56,960
but it appears that

00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,559
really young children who who just

00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,399
started reading and writing

00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:03,440
have less difficulties learning the

00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:06,240
properties of a programming language

00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,600
then at the time when they get really

00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,320
really really good at writing

00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:12,399
uh english or german or whatever there

00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:15,519
are the native languages

00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:16,880
um we have seen children as young as six

00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:20,559
or seven years who

00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:22,080
who just just started started learning

00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:23,919
read reading and writing properly at

00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:27,120
school learn

00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:28,880
learn nx c like a c like programming

00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,159
language tailored to lego mindstorm

00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:33,360
robotars

00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:36,480
without any issues

00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:39,679
that's impressive but for a

00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,679
few and of them

00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,960
and also i wanted to uh thank you for

00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,880
like a great talk that was really

00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,679
interesting and like learning a ton of

00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,880
things and

00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:50,880
seeing great initiatives

00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:57,519
and uh well also i wanted to uh

00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,840
share to you that there's a little world

00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:00,320
of

00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,120
people uploading you so it's on slack so

00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,120
i'm sorry

00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,159
you can see it better there's a little

00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:07,120
wall of

00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:09,600
people sending upload demos so uh thank

00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,600
you very much

00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:15,840
that was really really nice thank you

00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,840
anything else

00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:57,919
yeah also another curiosity are you

00:32:53,919 --> 00:33:01,279
familiar with the coding dojo method

00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:05,530
like have you tried that with students

00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:07,159
i i heard of it in a talk at the i think

00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:11,840
[Music]

00:33:07,159 --> 00:33:11,840
c3 two years ago

00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:19,120
but i didn't try it myself

00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:21,600
oh it's really really awesome uh

00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:22,559
i really recommend try it that's how i

00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:26,480
learned

00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:26,960
programming so i must like huge advocate

00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:30,480
for

00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:32,080
for that yeah yeah and they they

00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,840
these quarter dojo seem to be a really

00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:37,039
good starting point um

00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:40,159
we at tickets we actually strive to

00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:43,120
to cooperate with with those initiatives

00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:45,519
unfortunately um those initiatives from

00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:49,120
the coder dojo

00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:51,600
ecosystem or whatever um

00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:53,760
you might call it have have vanished in

00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:55,760
the in the local area here

00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,799
we have have not found the resources to

00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:00,159
start one and

00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:01,760
the deciders they decided to um to find

00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:04,000
other initiatives who

00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,960
who do these really really beginner

00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,919
things

00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:09,440
and because we are focused on getting uh

00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:11,359
intermediate level

00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,720
adolescents and children who are on a

00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:16,240
more intermediate level

00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:20,159
um to get involved in the long in

00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:23,440
the long term cool well if you have

00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:26,000
an interesting in like at at least uh

00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,200
taking part in in a session to see how

00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,399
it looks like

00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:32,960
uh there's a coding dojo session

00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:34,639
in in brazil that's been going on for

00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:37,919
like 10 years or something

00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:40,000
uh it's every

00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:41,599
wednesday of course it's in portuguese

00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,240
but now uh

00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:45,839
people started doing a session in

00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:49,119
english on saturdays

00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:52,079
afternoon uh so it's uh

00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:52,960
and also everyone else is welcome to to

00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:55,359
join

00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,320
so like it's a pandemic so we're doing

00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:59,520
that uh

00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:00,000
online anyway so it might be interesting

00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,400
for

00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,240
anyone who's curious to know how the

00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:07,520
dynamics work

00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,520
yeah um

00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,400
this very weekend we will kick off the

00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:15,839
next

00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:17,920
business here in in our organization and

00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:18,560
we are planning to reorganize projects a

00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,720
bit

00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,599
and cooperation with korea dodgers will

00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:26,800
definitely be on

00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:26,800
beyond on the list there cool

00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,460
yeah i think the next talk is about to

00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,599
start

00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:36,960
[Music]

00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:40,400
