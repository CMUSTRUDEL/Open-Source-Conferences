“Digitisation and Education — How the AlekSIS project fosters co-creation of school software by young people” by Dominik George, Tom Teichler 

Free software is all about participation, and projects can empower young people to participate by designing their software in a way that opens it up for learning and teaching in education. This talk reports from the AlekSIS project that develops real-world educational software that is intended to be extended by the students that actually work with it.
