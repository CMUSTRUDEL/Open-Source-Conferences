we know continue on with lightning talks

00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:22,390
and I wanna introduce Rafa look Keith

00:00:11,889 --> 00:00:24,279
McGee who's going to run them we have

00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:26,650
our first speaker come back up on stage

00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:28,419
oh hello everyone my name is Russell

00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:30,189
Keith McGee if you have been to Django

00:00:28,419 --> 00:00:34,600
Khan before you've probably seen me if

00:00:30,189 --> 00:00:35,770
you haven't I'm sorry my job here is to

00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,270
introduce the lightning talks

00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:38,800
however it occurs to me from seeing this

00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:40,840
morning how many hands up and say this

00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,030
is your first django con that you may

00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:45,820
not know what a lightning talk is a

00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:47,950
lightning talk is a short talk on any

00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:49,570
topic you want if you've never spoken at

00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:51,790
a conference before and maybe it like

00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:53,380
you know maybe dips to dip your toe into

00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:55,380
the water and find out where the

00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:57,730
conference speaking might be for you a

00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:59,980
lightning talk is a great place to start

00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:01,600
it can be about Django it can be about

00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:03,370
Python it can be about software

00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,989
development or it can be about anything

00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:07,540
else that happens to tickle your fancy

00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:09,310
the Django con stage has historically

00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:12,370
had some very entertaining talks about

00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:13,960
Zeppelin's for example the only thing it

00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:16,030
can't be is an advertisement or a

00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:17,290
commercial for a company or a job

00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:18,280
advertisement or something like that if

00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:18,790
you want to do a commercial

00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,200
advertisement

00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:22,330
may I suggest possibly next year

00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:25,390
sponsoring this fine conference you get

00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:27,880
your logo on stage the whole time it's a

00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:30,450
short talk it is five minutes and we do

00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:32,860
mean five minutes an absolute maximum

00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:34,570
with one minute on the state one minute

00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:36,490
left on the clock I will sort of slowly

00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:38,650
come back onto the stage with about ten

00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:41,560
seconds to go our fine organizer

00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:43,570
Tobias over here will start while

00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:46,540
warming up the gong and when time runs

00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:48,580
out there will be a gong hit to stop all

00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:50,260
Gong hits at which point we will then

00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:53,170
find some way of dragging you off stage

00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:54,970
forcibly I say it emits a maximum of

00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:57,220
five minutes it can be less than five

00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:59,080
minutes if you so choose there's no

00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:00,430
minimum length of time other than you

00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,650
know please don't waste our time just

00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:05,290
setting up your laptop for saying

00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:06,970
goodbye and walking off stage again with

00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:08,560
that that is a lightning talk this has

00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:11,080
effectively been a lightning talk about

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,150
lightning talks and I would now like to

00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,590
introduce Justin Mayer who will talk to

00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:16,810
us about how to add multi-factor

00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:17,980
authentication to your Django project in

00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:20,910
less than five minutes

00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,910
take it away Justin

00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:28,800
thanks very much Russell my name is

00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,060
Justin Mayer originally from Los Angeles

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,880
California

00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:34,560
but just last week moved to a mountain

00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,750
village in the Italian Alps in our

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,760
region called Trantino I've used to I go

00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:40,680
for a long time most recently to create

00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,410
for Trece which allows you to create

00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,240
your own private self-contained VPN

00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:47,340
server and today I'm excited to talk to

00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,780
you about multi-factor authentication my

00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,730
goal is to show you how to add multiple

00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,870
occasions to your applications in the

00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:52,710
time that I have we're just obviously

00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,870
not very much

00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:56,760
last summer I gave a full-length talk on

00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:58,350
this topic at Euro Python you can find a

00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,200
link to the video on Justin mera kaam

00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:03,210
here is a very fast lightning summary

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,390
passwords are ubiquitous they are

00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:08,640
terrible most most time people get

00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:10,350
around them by using SMS to send you a

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,820
code you've probably seen this it's very

00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:14,310
common unfortunately it's not very

00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:16,710
secure the better method is totp or

00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:18,090
time-based one-time passwords you may

00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:19,530
have seen it you get a 6 digit number

00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:21,540
generated usually on an app on your

00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:23,880
phone another method that I really like

00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:25,590
is called second is universal second

00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,540
factor it's a small USB key I have a

00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:29,340
tiny one in my machine right now it's a

00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,780
hardware key the next generation of

00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,850
which is web standard called web

00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:36,330
authentication there's a project called

00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:39,780
Django UT u2f that you can use to add

00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:41,130
this it does both TOTP and u2f and I

00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,900
want to show you how easy it is to

00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:45,090
implement it and add multi-factor

00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:48,030
authentication to your applications so

00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:53,910
let's do it live and what could possibly

00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:55,290
possibly go wrong so over here what do

00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:58,200
you know it's actually there that's good

00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:59,550
so first thing we're going to do is we

00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,160
are going to activate a virtual

00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:07,590
environment and we're going to pip

00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:10,620
install Django and the Django u2f

00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:12,480
package luckily I've cashed all these

00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:15,720
wheels so I have to deal with Wi-Fi um

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,549
or at least uh yeah there we go so and

00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,200
then we're going to clone the project

00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:21,299
and the reason we're doing that is that

00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:24,240
we're gonna use a sample project that's

00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:27,600
inside it switch to that directory we're

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:30,840
going to install the requirements also

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,300
from cache wheels thankfully we're going

00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:35,709
to run migrations

00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:38,139
so know this is fast everyone but just

00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:40,569
try your best to keep up we're now

00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:43,719
generating a TLS key for the local host

00:04:40,569 --> 00:04:48,369
domain so that gets you to F requires

00:04:43,719 --> 00:04:52,989
TLS then we are going to now run our

00:04:48,369 --> 00:04:55,989
server and switch over to a browser and

00:04:52,989 --> 00:04:58,149
we're gonna go ahead and load once we

00:04:55,989 --> 00:05:02,860
bypass the yes we know it's not a sign

00:04:58,149 --> 00:05:05,469
certificate I'm gonna log in and I

00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:06,729
probably forgot to create super user as

00:05:05,469 --> 00:05:10,659
you know this is what happens when

00:05:06,729 --> 00:05:11,459
you're doing it live okay do that really

00:05:10,659 --> 00:05:20,289
quickly

00:05:11,459 --> 00:05:25,719
hyatt phu kham okay go back to the

00:05:20,289 --> 00:05:29,229
browser hopefully and now we can try

00:05:25,719 --> 00:05:31,839
this again and now we have a screen

00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:33,879
where we can manage you are all our

00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:37,119
multi-factor authentication first thing

00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:38,619
i'm going to do is i'm going to add a u2

00:05:37,119 --> 00:05:39,159
F key which I just did by putting my

00:05:38,619 --> 00:05:41,439
finger on it

00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:43,079
it's now been added I'm gonna go back to

00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:46,809
the settings and now I'm going to add a

00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:48,039
totp device and I'm going to do that I'm

00:05:46,809 --> 00:05:49,959
using an app on my phone there's a

00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:51,249
variety of different ones I use one

00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:55,599
password because I already use that to

00:05:51,249 --> 00:05:57,279
manage my other passwords I tap it to

00:05:55,599 --> 00:05:59,679
add a new password I'm gonna scan the

00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:03,849
scan the QR code it's been added I'm

00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:10,749
then given a number to enter into this

00:06:03,849 --> 00:06:12,129
token field once I do that they then

00:06:10,749 --> 00:06:15,789
registers the token and says device

00:06:12,129 --> 00:06:17,499
added and then last we're gonna create

00:06:15,789 --> 00:06:19,239
some emergency backup codes I may not

00:06:17,499 --> 00:06:21,939
have my device I may not have my phone

00:06:19,239 --> 00:06:25,329
this allows me to get and even even in

00:06:21,939 --> 00:06:26,889
those cases so we've proven that we can

00:06:25,329 --> 00:06:35,379
add those things now what happens when

00:06:26,889 --> 00:06:40,239
we log back in so we log in as usual

00:06:35,379 --> 00:06:42,399
when I don't work the password and we

00:06:40,239 --> 00:06:43,659
can log in we can we can go ahead and

00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:44,920
log in via either of the three methods

00:06:43,659 --> 00:06:46,510
that I just added I'm going to

00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:50,510
put my finger on the security key and

00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:55,620
I'm in it is really that easy to do

00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:55,620
[Applause]

00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:01,570
and now I'm gonna quickly just show you

00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:04,990
what the only difference between a

00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:07,780
standard Django start project command

00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:10,060
and what the and the test project that I

00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:11,919
just added is what you see here a couple

00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:13,900
of lions added two installed apps to add

00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,100
some needed packages they're a couple of

00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:18,449
lines out at the end of your settings

00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:23,630
file to do log in URL and redirection

00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:29,480
this is a URL spy it's just

00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:29,480
[Applause]

00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:35,050
thank you very much Justin next up on

00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:37,000
stage we have johannes hopper while he's

00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:40,180
getting set up with the with the

00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,520
microphone and the and the laptop I've

00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:44,740
just returned from Pike on us when I was

00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:46,150
ed Pike on us I I bumped into an

00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:48,160
interesting person sort of wandering

00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:49,750
around it was actually a just returned

00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,930
from a different conference all about

00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:55,990
wasps and at that at that conference

00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:58,300
they were talking about whatnot and

00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:59,560
about that wasps as you do and they just

00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:03,850
started to go for a bit of a walk around

00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:05,980
the town and came across a vinyl shop is

00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:07,419
selling old old LP records and in the

00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:10,270
store in store front they had an advert

00:08:07,419 --> 00:08:12,460
up an advertisement up that said that

00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:15,910
they had just I just released wasp

00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:17,620
noises as the as the an album that had

00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:19,810
just been made available and so world

00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:21,460
renowned expert in wasps sees an album

00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:23,169
for wasp noises thinks I've got a kick

00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:24,460
I've got to find out about this decides

00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:27,460
he's going to go into the store more

00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:29,919
details later our next speaker is

00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:31,990
johannes hopper talking about instant

00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:34,030
feedback making reviews great again on

00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:36,390
the new github checks everyone making

00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:36,390
welcome

hey thanks I'm not going to show any

00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:47,330
slides actually today because I didn't

00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:48,620
have much time to prepare I try to keep

00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:52,070
this very short probably shorter than

00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:53,750
five minutes maintaining open source

00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:55,690
projects is really hard I think a lot of

00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:57,700
people here can empathize with that

00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:59,930
because there are maintained ears and

00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:01,520
other people's can probably emphasize

00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:06,530
because they have a pull request hanging

00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:07,730
somewhere and with no response and we

00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:09,650
were also discussing that yesterday

00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:11,960
evening already on what kind things are

00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:14,960
hard and something that's very tedious

00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:16,250
as a maintainer is that comment like hey

00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:19,130
can you please remove a trailing

00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:21,740
whitespace or can you also wrap the dog

00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:24,230
strings at 80 characters stuff like that

00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:25,850
just comes repeatedly up and it's

00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:28,070
tedious for a maintained area and it's

00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:28,730
also bad to hear for a first-time

00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:30,410
contributor

00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:31,940
it's just the negative feedback that you

00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:35,510
don't want to give to someone that

00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:36,980
otherwise did a really good job luckily

00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:38,930
something we heard earlier this morning

00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:41,180
as the first talk the machines are

00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:43,300
taking over and over time we built a lot

00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:46,550
of great lentes that help us do that job

00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:48,140
um but they're still even though those

00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:49,490
do a really good job of giving you kind

00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:51,320
of machine feedback which is a bit

00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:53,390
softer to their users to the first-time

00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:55,280
contributors or frequent contributors to

00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:56,270
tell them hey there it's maybe trading

00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,590
rights but it's that you want to get rid

00:09:56,270 --> 00:10:01,640
of or please I didn't you are into the

00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:03,770
end of the file and this is all great

00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:06,130
but they're still kind of hidden usually

00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:08,870
within our continuous integration Suites

00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:10,790
there's this one link to the Chavez

00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:11,960
suite or use maybe circle CI and there

00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:14,990
are a bunch of different services out

00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:16,490
there and not everyone is familiar with

00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:18,020
all of those and then you have to find

00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:19,310
the section that actually failed and you

00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:20,660
have to figure out what that means maybe

00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:22,040
you're not particularly familiar with

00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:23,660
that linter

00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,800
could be something like Pilon and there

00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:28,490
are a bunch of checks we maybe don't

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:31,970
know them all luckily there has been a

00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:33,380
recent change on how github works there

00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:36,110
has been a new feature called checks

00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:39,560
it's currently still in beta and the API

00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:42,020
is now also available in beta which

00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:44,710
allows you to kind of take all that onto

00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:48,260
a single platform it allows machines to

00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:49,970
also add review comments and it

00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,570
introduces the new concept of a check

00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:52,730
which is

00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:54,500
really really made for for machine

00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:58,610
feedback for for for what we know is

00:10:54,500 --> 00:11:01,640
Linda's currently so since that was

00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:02,990
released colleague of mine and me we we

00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,820
sat back and thought hey that's a cool

00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:06,530
thing let's try to bring those two

00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,800
together because they're made for each

00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:10,460
other

00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:12,470
so we put a lot of linters on AWS

00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:15,470
service built a small service around it

00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:18,290
and combined all that in order to run

00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:21,860
checks automatically without any tedious

00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:25,010
set up on repositories and give this

00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:26,990
feedback directly back onto onto github

00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:29,540
without storing any data in between it's

00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:31,700
just we process the data from the

00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:33,770
commits and we push our linting results

00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:36,680
back and the user can see them right

00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:39,050
where they where they push their code if

00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:40,790
you interested in that and using that or

00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:42,730
in contributing to making that better

00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:45,950
because obviously it's just started

00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:48,170
approach me I'm Johannes hopper coding

00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:51,260
Joe on github I don't know my Twitter

00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:53,240
handle really and talk to me about it

00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:57,050
I'm excited to to share it's all open

00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:58,760
source obviously yeah so just find me

00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:00,560
later if you interests in those four

00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:03,590
things and I hope that we can yeah make

00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:12,470
make contributing and maintaining a bit

00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:13,490
easier thanks Thank You Hamish and thank

00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:15,770
you your highness for pointing out that

00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:17,990
it can be less than five minutes while I

00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:19,640
next speaker get set up our friend here

00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:22,220
he's gone into the into the store of the

00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:24,020
the LP store and he says I'd like to

00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:25,220
like well can I listen to this record if

00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:26,660
you got you've got an example I can I

00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,950
can listen to and the guy the person

00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,400
behind the counter says yeah no it's not

00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:30,110
a problem

00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,580
reaches behind that reaches down gets up

00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:33,050
a copy of the record says just go over

00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:35,570
the listening booth there and and get

00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:36,650
set up there and once you're in the

00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:37,760
listening booth I'll start the record

00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:40,310
and you can listen to it and see what

00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,810
you think and so he goes into the

00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:43,790
listening booth and the the storekeeper

00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:45,620
goes behind the the record player and

00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:47,540
puts put it on and starts playing and

00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:49,490
little more detail by what he hears in a

00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:53,530
moment next up we have Katie McLaughlin

00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:53,530
serialization formats are not toys

00:12:55,510 --> 00:13:00,250
[Music]

00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:01,360
hi by the way you don't actually have to

00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,829
give your own lightning talk you can

00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,269
give somebody else's lightning talk this

00:13:02,829 --> 00:13:05,829
lightning talk was given as a full

00:13:04,269 --> 00:13:07,480
thirty-minute talk by a guy called Tom

00:13:05,829 --> 00:13:09,610
Eastman I'm gonna give it in four

00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:11,649
minutes 45 seconds loading data into

00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:13,260
your application is the most boring part

00:13:11,649 --> 00:13:15,399
of your day you want to get your data

00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:18,699
migrated into your app and then you want

00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:20,649
to keep on coding the thing is 90% of

00:13:18,699 --> 00:13:22,899
magic merely exists on knowing one extra

00:13:20,649 --> 00:13:25,449
fact if I know one thing that your app

00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:27,850
doesn't prevent security wise I can take

00:13:25,449 --> 00:13:29,560
all your data for myself everything I'm

00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:33,970
going to be talking about today is not a

00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:36,130
bug it is a feature so this is my

00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:37,480
example an application it's just a

00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:39,490
simple bottle app all I'm going to be

00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:41,019
doing today is posting data to those

00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:43,389
endpoints and then returning back the

00:13:41,019 --> 00:13:46,570
content so let's talk about yeah mall

00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:48,519
any animal if I was to post my first

00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:50,320
name is Tom my last name is Eastman and

00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:54,010
I have an email address I get back a

00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:56,800
JSON result with my email address first

00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:59,170
name and last name what I can also do in

00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,630
Yama is I can post Python objects so

00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:04,510
what I can do here is I can post back a

00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:07,779
Python object to date/time date with my

00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:09,910
birthday and I get back a J a Python

00:14:07,779 --> 00:14:10,800
date/time object who can see where this

00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:15,459
is going

00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:17,800
what I can also do is I could I tell it

00:14:15,459 --> 00:14:20,199
to our Corp sub-process and tell me the

00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:24,940
entire contents of my directory that I'm

00:14:20,199 --> 00:14:26,230
in so I wonder if I can actually get my

00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:28,420
speaking rights to work that would be

00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:32,170
useful there we go

00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:35,740
sorry hey I wonder if I can also get my

00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:38,949
explains to bicker yeah ok so what I

00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:42,190
could also do instead of running LS what

00:14:38,949 --> 00:14:45,399
I can also do is not have my sneaker

00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:47,680
speaker slides work at all come on there

00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:49,750
we go all right what I could also do is

00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,430
I can run RM star and then run an LS and

00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:53,709
I could delete my entire presentation

00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:55,149
while I was working on it which is

00:14:53,709 --> 00:14:58,149
allegedly what happened to this speaker

00:14:55,149 --> 00:14:58,660
so surely this doesn't happen in real

00:14:58,149 --> 00:15:00,699
life

00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:02,829
right it happens all the time it

00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:06,590
happened with piston and tasty pie back

00:15:02,829 --> 00:15:08,300
in 2011 it happened with rails twice

00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:10,279
it happened in puppet and everyone was

00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:12,470
really upset and then it happened for no

00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:14,510
- no one cared so how do you protect

00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:16,460
yourself you make the pars of stupid up

00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:18,650
what you should be doing instead of

00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:20,690
using the ml dot load is using ya mille

00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:22,340
dot safe load which is really easy to

00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:24,650
find when all you're doing in your telly

00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:26,600
sense thing is going yeah mauled okay

00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:29,510
load okay I want the first one what you

00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:31,220
need to be using is safe load so let's

00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:34,400
talk about XML a slide that's scary

00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:36,440
enough just in itself in XML we have

00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:39,620
entities in an entity I can define an

00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:41,240
entity as a ampersand hash and then a

00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:44,029
number and then I get back a smiley face

00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:46,339
what I can also do is I can put an alias

00:15:44,029 --> 00:15:49,640
to that entity so instead of using the

00:15:46,339 --> 00:15:50,480
percentage number I can have a smiley so

00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,460
then I can have

00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,070
yeah he's smiley smiley it's like emoji

00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:57,290
except not so what I could also do is I

00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:59,000
could define an entity that's a bunch of

00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:00,350
other entities and another entity that's

00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,060
a bunch of those entities and I can have

00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:04,040
smiles going all the way down my page

00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:05,660
this is also known as the billion laughs

00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:09,920
attack and it can turn your laptop into

00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:11,900
a smoking ruin including if you try to

00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:15,130
load your presentation slides in Emacs

00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:17,089
and it tries to render your XML for you

00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:19,580
so what else can we do

00:16:17,089 --> 00:16:22,940
what we can also do is we could ask it

00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:25,339
to return back the contents of our et

00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:27,260
Cie release information or our password

00:16:25,339 --> 00:16:28,700
files or anything else because if you're

00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:30,800
running XML you're probably running in

00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,760
running in an enterprise environment and

00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,230
neutral running in an enterprise

00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:37,120
environment you're probably running his

00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:39,230
route which means you can do everything

00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,330
surely this doesn't happen dinner in

00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:43,940
real life right it happens all the time

00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:45,560
you don't even want to know so how do

00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:47,300
you protect yourself just a simple list

00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,770
of things that you can do for your XML

00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:50,750
to make sure that it's not going to do

00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:52,880
anything what you need to do is you need

00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:54,770
to make the parser stupider what you can

00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,150
do is you can use diffuse XML and a few

00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:57,980
other things I am one minute left let's

00:16:56,150 --> 00:17:00,530
keep going Jason finally is stupid

00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:03,260
enough parser only if you use it in a

00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:05,720
stupid way eval is not a stupid enough

00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:07,640
positing on ever use eval to try to

00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:10,189
render Jason because on the

00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,970
documentation page what it says is it

00:17:10,189 --> 00:17:12,949
says up there

00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:14,660
here you should use eval and then right

00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:15,949
down the bottom like somewhere where the

00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:18,949
orchestra pit would be it says do not

00:17:15,949 --> 00:17:19,779
actually use this it also says it right

00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:22,179
there it says

00:17:19,779 --> 00:17:23,499
hey you can use eval but but don't but

00:17:22,179 --> 00:17:24,789
no one's actually gonna keep on reading

00:17:23,499 --> 00:17:27,039
the documentation after they get their

00:17:24,789 --> 00:17:28,830
answer right so the lesson

00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:31,929
beware of flexibility in your

00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:33,969
applications and in your serialization

00:17:31,929 --> 00:17:35,499
tokenizer z' because it will try to be

00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:36,969
smart and sometimes you don't want it to

00:17:35,499 --> 00:17:38,169
be smart you want it to be dumb and you

00:17:36,969 --> 00:17:39,909
want it to play nice and you want to

00:17:38,169 --> 00:17:42,369
have your application still work at the

00:17:39,909 --> 00:17:44,200
end of the day disable everything you

00:17:42,369 --> 00:17:46,830
don't need and keep it simple thank you

00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,830
so much for your time

00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:59,450
thank you very much Katie or Tom or

00:17:55,250 --> 00:18:01,100
Katie not sure okay so our friends in

00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:04,400
the listening booth now and he's put the

00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:05,840
headphones on and he's sitting there he

00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,010
listens to the the record starts playing

00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,570
he starts listening and he's like this

00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:09,980
something's not right here I mean it's

00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:14,330
an insect I can tell it's definitely an

00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:15,650
insect and it there something's just not

00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:18,080
right here so he can't steps out of the

00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:19,940
out of the the listening booth and he

00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,250
goes to speak to the store guy there's

00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:23,690
still for the store manager and says

00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:26,179
Isaiah look are you sure you're playing

00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:27,650
the right record there because I'm like

00:18:26,179 --> 00:18:29,870
a wasp expert I'm pretty sure they're

00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:31,280
not wasp noises and so then the the

00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:32,390
manager says hang on I'll just I'll get

00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,860
a different pair of headphones for you

00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:35,240
or get you some good headphones we'll

00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:36,650
try it again so he goes and gets the

00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:39,620
good headphones gets him set up with the

00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:41,900
good headphones and he steps back

00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:45,409
however moves back into the booth starts

00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:46,610
the record playing again and he sits

00:18:45,409 --> 00:18:50,200
there and he listens a little bit to the

00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:54,740
to the sounds again coming through and

00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:57,049
knowing all right and so he listens and

00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:58,010
listens again and now this something's

00:18:57,049 --> 00:18:59,450
definitely not right here there's

00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:00,890
something that's just not quite right in

00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:02,929
the sound that I'm hearing and I'm a

00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:04,460
wasp expert I know my wasps that is

00:19:02,929 --> 00:19:06,289
definitely not a wasp but this album

00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:08,720
says it's wasp noises it's wrong it's

00:19:06,289 --> 00:19:09,770
not wast noises so he sits back out of

00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,480
the booth goes back over the store

00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:13,070
manager says look okay I don't know what

00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,270
to say yet it's definitely not wasp

00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:16,510
noises just something wrong with your

00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:18,470
record here they manage this well I

00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:20,210
don't know it was like it says here on

00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:22,510
the T night how I got only go by what it

00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:24,409
says here on the on the record guy says

00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:26,990
I'll tell you what he says - right after

00:19:24,409 --> 00:19:30,880
this break when Johannes will tell us

00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:30,880
why he hates CSV everyone

00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:38,000
all right I don't seem to be the only

00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:40,010
one in there but I need to know

00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,570
precisely so hands up if you have ever

00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:46,340
used CSV in a project hands up and keep

00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:49,130
your hands up everyone excellent so for

00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:52,850
those with the hands up who liked the

00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:56,360
experience all right who had it work on

00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:58,010
the first try okay

00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:02,510
for those of you with the hands up this

00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:04,400
talk is not for you all right so what do

00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:05,900
you do as a developer when you have to

00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,850
work with Siri I mean you have tabular

00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:09,590
data so you think okay everyone uses CSV

00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:14,780
so I'm gonna use CSV so what we do we do

00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:17,180
it first we go to stack overflow and of

00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:19,460
course you read through this thing and

00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:23,150
it's it's really simple and and all you

00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:25,100
have to do is like what and then you

00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:27,620
look at the documentation and it and it

00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:30,470
says things like okay I have a reader

00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:36,220
and it's really simple and yeah I

00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:42,470
couldn't register that what I can what

00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:45,770
why and the problem is in CSV files we

00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:48,740
use commas to separate records and we

00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:50,900
use new lines to separate lines right

00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:52,790
but sometimes you want to use commas

00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:53,990
inside of the strings that we want to

00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:55,640
serialize and sometimes we want to use

00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:59,390
new lines and then we have to find some

00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:03,920
kind of like escaping and we have to do

00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:05,300
magic to make it work and that means we

00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:07,250
have to mess around and we have several

00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:11,030
choices we could use semicolons Excel

00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:12,350
uses semicolons so all of this comes

00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:15,560
from the fact that we don't have

00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:18,530
dedicated symbols for separating records

00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:23,150
and separating lines now let's go back

00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:25,490
in time to the 1960s and let's have a

00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:28,070
look at ASCII I mean imagine being the

00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:31,820
person having this problem for the first

00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:34,220
time and looking through their ASCII

00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:38,380
code and seeing oh come on I could use a

00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:42,170
comma and what if we had dedicated

00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:45,830
characters for

00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:49,260
separating units and records and

00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:53,550
possibly even groups or files so we

00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:56,700
could have more than one table in in in

00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:59,310
a file these have been in the standard

00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:02,610
since before many of us have been born

00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:04,590
right but nobody knows them nobody uses

00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:06,630
these so we have CSV and we have this

00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:09,540
mess I'm gonna show you the code that we

00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:11,400
would need to use to use these ASCII

00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:15,930
separation things and this is gonna work

00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:18,300
every time and as you can see it's

00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:21,660
almost as complicated as the one that we

00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:23,250
had for the CS B's so what to do use

00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:25,770
ASCII separators as possible and that's

00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:28,140
never possible so so the same thing to

00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:31,380
do is actually use it use SQLite if you

00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:32,610
have tabular data use SQLite but there's

00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:34,590
a more important lesson and the

00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:38,610
important lesson is this hack that

00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:40,200
somebody put in 20 30 40 years ago is

00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:42,120
still with us and is still plaguing us

00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:45,600
so don't put hacks into production and

00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:47,730
even more so if you put a hack into

00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,200
production please think before you copy

00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:51,800
someone else's hack and this is my

00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,800
message to you

00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:55,170
[Applause]

00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:01,750
thank you very much Johannes and again

00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:03,910
another johannes under time you do not

00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:05,440
need to be fun I can stay here and just

00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:06,640
now we're applaud it now that's the end

00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:10,090
you're done you're done we need to get

00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:11,890
back to the wasps so hang on hello

00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:13,180
what's more people just to move here we

00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:15,910
got more people coming yes there we go

00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:20,650
all right oh I thought you did you

00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:22,360
finished oh you'd fit right so anyway

00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:23,920
what's the experts in the booth he's had

00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:26,050
a second listen since I know what I can

00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:29,080
do I've just come back from wasp con I

00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:30,940
can go and find the world expert on wasp

00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:32,650
is a convener of his conference I can

00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:33,970
bring him into the store we can get him

00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:35,680
to listen to the album and we can

00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:37,210
technique we can get definitive we can

00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:39,820
get clarification about whether this is

00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:41,200
a wasp or not the store owner says yeah

00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:42,940
absolutely great we'll do that

00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,980
may come back the next day our next

00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:47,050
speaker is burner tubulin of talking

00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:53,410
about Django for managers thank you very

00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:55,360
much thank you very much so actually I'm

00:23:53,410 --> 00:24:00,490
a manager but this is not the commercial

00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:04,600
talk so I hope you will use it for the

00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:06,580
commercially successful so my my name is

00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:09,010
Werner Perlman I'm co-founder and a

00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:10,930
long-term CEO for teamwork and Bern

00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:13,870
Switzerland and I have a background of

00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:16,780
15 years of clones so I know Python

00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:20,770
quite a bit but now I became a sales

00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:24,850
manager and you can contact me on github

00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:26,770
for example now my problem was a few

00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:29,710
weeks ago I had a deadline for sales

00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:31,240
pitch and on Monday morning I came to my

00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:34,420
company and said I need to have a

00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:39,160
working prototype I Tuesday afternoon

00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:42,250
and it has to look nice so my developer

00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:46,660
team says no that's that's not possible

00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:50,830
it will take us at least two weeks so I

00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:53,070
go back to my office and I start to

00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:56,220
learn Django from scratch

00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:59,160
so I go to the website simple discolor

00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:02,850
and complex and the two three hours I

00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:05,370
did the tutorial and it didn't look nice

00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:08,070
the front end so I did some research and

00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:10,230
I found Django material so I started my

00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:13,920
project on github

00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:17,760
I added requirements dot txt two lines

00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:23,190
of code I added a model with on some

00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:26,520
fields I added a view and that's it so I

00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:30,060
had a running prototype which looks like

00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:32,760
this it's for creating user stories I

00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:37,820
can add applications I can have user

00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:37,820
stories roles I can add closer II

00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:51,030
subjects I can add a new subject

00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:56,870
front-end for example and when I add a

00:25:51,030 --> 00:26:00,570
new user story I can choose this new

00:25:56,870 --> 00:26:03,360
subject again and if I want to change

00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:08,690
the application it's very simple I go to

00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:11,790
the code to my model and I add a

00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:20,660
description field to my application

00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:20,660
level I am not so fast like the others

00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:33,360
I do to make migration the migrate and

00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:40,050
be run again and I go back to my

00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:47,730
application listing and I have the

00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:51,030
description already and it's really fast

00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:53,600
to to make this development and I can

00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:58,790
can also add a new column to this

00:26:53,600 --> 00:27:02,690
listing just by adding the description

00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:02,690
to the view set

00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:13,390
I hope this works

00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:21,350
so after description here in the view

00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:27,380
and it's really very easy to develop and

00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:29,540
it's also nice looking so the whole

00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:31,730
thing is on github and it's less than

00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:34,100
five hundred lines of code which is

00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:37,280
fantastic and the developers they asked

00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:39,530
me where are the tests and I said well

00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:45,290
it's not so many lines of code so we

00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:47,900
don't need tests so my goal is to to

00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:50,480
reduce it even more under four hundred

00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:53,210
lines of code and you can try it

00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:55,190
yourself we have one minute left

00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:58,910
so if you're very fast you can have it

00:27:55,190 --> 00:28:01,790
running on its on our repository for

00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:03,290
teamwork user stories material and the

00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:05,540
readme it's the description and you

00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:07,340
should have it running in a few seconds

00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:10,370
or minutes and if you have problems you

00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:14,060
can come and ask me and I hope that it

00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:16,880
will help you to get success to be

00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:20,600
successful in acquiring new projects by

00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:23,320
creating prototypes really fast

00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,320
thank you very much

00:28:26,899 --> 00:28:31,769
Thank You Bernhard's and while a next

00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:33,929
speaker gets set up so they convene the

00:28:31,769 --> 00:28:35,100
next day the world expert in wasps

00:28:33,929 --> 00:28:36,359
walking and walking along with this guy

00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:38,639
who'd originally found the record store

00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:40,710
and they walk in the guy behind the

00:28:38,639 --> 00:28:42,059
canisters Oh yep no I remember you so

00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:44,159
they get the record setup again they get

00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:46,679
the expert into the booth and they

00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:48,059
connects up the the record and the good

00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:50,549
pair of headphones the really good pair

00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:53,129
of headphones and starts the record

00:28:50,549 --> 00:28:54,659
playing and the the the expert sits

00:28:53,129 --> 00:28:55,710
there and he listens really

00:28:54,659 --> 00:28:58,259
concentrating you can tell he's

00:28:55,710 --> 00:29:02,340
concentrating and he's listening really

00:28:58,259 --> 00:29:04,080
really hard and if steps out of the

00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:07,200
booth is not know sorry I can tell you

00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:09,299
it's absolutely not wasps there's no no

00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,590
chance whatsoever that's a wasp store

00:29:09,299 --> 00:29:12,480
owner goes back looks at the record says

00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:13,649
look it says here that it hears the

00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,480
species it definitely says as this

00:29:13,649 --> 00:29:16,710
species now I'll go back and have

00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:20,009
another listen he goes back in and he

00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:22,529
listens again he listens he's thinking

00:29:20,009 --> 00:29:23,789
about it he steps out of the booth again

00:29:22,529 --> 00:29:25,200
it says look I can I can tell you

00:29:23,789 --> 00:29:27,210
there's absolutely no chance that's a

00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,590
wasp it's there's no no wasps on that

00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:30,779
recording at all that you're playing to

00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:33,059
me well maybe maybe we should find the

00:29:30,779 --> 00:29:34,019
publisher we find the publisher and they

00:29:33,059 --> 00:29:35,669
talked the publisher says no no

00:29:34,019 --> 00:29:37,909
absolutely guaranteed that that that

00:29:35,669 --> 00:29:43,679
record it's playing it's got wasps on it

00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:47,369
and the the record store eNOS is oh no

00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:48,149
I've just worked out what's happening to

00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:50,370
find out what's happening we have to

00:29:48,149 --> 00:29:52,480
wait until after Curtis

00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:55,320
Curtis you talking about understandings

00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,320
Django static files

00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:05,620
hi I'm Curtis Maloney also known as

00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:11,500
funky Bob online I've been working with

00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:13,750
Django for 1213 years now and one of the

00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:15,880
biggest problems we have to help people

00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:17,830
online is dealing with static files for

00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:19,570
the first time hands up anyone who got

00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:23,429
static files to work the first time they

00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:23,429
used it liars

00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:30,940
because nobody gets it the first time

00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:32,590
and part of the problem is the

00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:33,940
documentation must not be good enough I

00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:35,800
don't know why I'd have to read it again

00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:37,360
and again and again to see why but I

00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,860
keep asking the new people why didn't

00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:42,250
you understand it and they say I don't

00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:43,840
know so maybe we should scrap it and

00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:45,550
write again anyone who's got something

00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:48,580
on the sprint's that they want to do who

00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:52,270
maybe so what happens is with static

00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:54,429
files all of your apps can provide their

00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:56,950
own static files this is a source of

00:30:54,429 --> 00:30:58,600
static files for your project you can

00:30:56,950 --> 00:31:01,480
also give a list of static files

00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:04,330
directories for where to find static

00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:07,950
files to collect and then eventually

00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:10,240
you'll run the manager I collect static

00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:13,480
command which takes all of these files

00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,950
and copies them into the static root he

00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:17,170
is problem number one that people run

00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:20,559
into is they think static root is where

00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:22,270
they put their static files whilst

00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:24,400
they're developing no that's where they

00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:27,460
get copied into then you configure your

00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:30,460
web server so that when somebody asks

00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:32,670
for something under the static URL it

00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:36,490
goes and looks inside the static root

00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:38,200
now it's only taken me what a minute to

00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:41,380
explain this and it's about as long as

00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:44,679
it takes online to explain this but it

00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:47,410
was necessary to save us all this times

00:31:44,679 --> 00:31:48,880
500 to get this video so that we can

00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:51,130
actually tell people go and watch this

00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,809
and hopefully you'll understand static

00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:55,020
files after this is done thank you very

00:31:52,809 --> 00:31:55,020
much

00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:03,120
there we go and Kurtis providing

00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:04,380
evidence in addition to myself that if

00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:08,370
you want something done quickly give it

00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:09,420
to an Australian so that concludes our

00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:11,610
lightning talks for today there's

00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:13,080
nothing else to go on nothing else for

00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:14,190
me to say but of course you all want to

00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:17,190
find out what happened to the wasps

00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:18,660
don't you so yeah okay so we're back in

00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:20,370
the scene we're in the in the record

00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:22,830
store we've got my friend the wasp

00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:24,660
expert his friend the world-renowned

00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:25,860
wasp expert and the store owner from the

00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:30,300
record store and the store owners is

00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:31,950
heads in hand I'm so embarrassed you are

00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:35,400
world experts in wasps I'm a world

00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:37,590
expert in vinyl and record players and I

00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:38,670
can't believe this has happened I'm

00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:40,440
sitting here I've put you in the booth

00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:41,580
I've bought two of you in I've brought

00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:45,140
in specialist headphones for the

00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:49,440
experience I've played your record

00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:51,480
telling you that it's wasp sounds I'm

00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:54,140
sorry I'm so embarrassed I played you

00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:54,140
the b-side

00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:03,500
thank you very much Lonnie talks to me

00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:05,570
back tomorrow if you care to have a

00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:06,470
lightning talk please sign up and put

00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:08,390
your lightning talk in the list for

00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:10,160
tomorrow and you may have the the

00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:12,290
benefit of having a shaggy dog story in
