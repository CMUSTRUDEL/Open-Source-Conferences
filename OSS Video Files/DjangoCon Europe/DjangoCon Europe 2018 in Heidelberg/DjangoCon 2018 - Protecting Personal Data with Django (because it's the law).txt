Title: DjangoCon 2018 - Protecting Personal Data with Django (because it's the law)
Publication date: 2018-05-24
Playlist: DjangoCon Europe 2018 in Heidelberg
Description: 
	A new EU regulation comes into effect in the middle of this conference. Here is an overview of what is required and how you can use Django to comply.

From 25 May 2018, anyone collecting personal data on European Union residents will have to follow a number of new rules, some of which are pretty far-reaching. The new rules are however simple enough to understand, and as professionals, getting on top of things like this is what we're being paid for.

The regulation is called "Regulation (EU) 2016/679" and is commonly known as the "General Data Protection Regulation" or "GDPR". It has been around for a couple of years and comes into effect now. The previous regime (95/46/EC) was only an EU Directive, so the exact rules were implemented in the native laws of each EU Member State. The new regulation applies everywhere automatically, so it is a single set of rules for all of Europe, which is a good thing. Not everyone will be responsible for managing compliance, but I think every professional software developer should get to know this regulation.

In the first half, I'll provide an overview of the parts of the regulation that are relevant for developers. In the second half, I'll look at the ways of complying using Django: what Django already does for you, how to make Django do more, and also (quickly) what sort of data protecting batteries might be useful Django to include going forward.

I'll be around for the sprints if anyone is interested in working on this at a framework level.

ok everyone I hope you enjoyed lunch I'm

00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:15,330
will be back we are now back with our

00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:17,099
next series of talks and we will start

00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,710
it off with will Hardy talking about

00:00:17,099 --> 00:00:33,629
protecting personal data because it's

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:36,540
the law hello everybody my name is Wil

00:00:33,629 --> 00:00:39,540
Hardy I'm a software engineer with a law

00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:43,260
degree and while I liked the legal world

00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:45,210
I preferred to build things so I never

00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:48,960
really knew what I wanted to do with

00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:52,949
that degree but now I have something to

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,720
do I'm here to talk about the GED PR if

00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:57,479
you haven't heard anything about that

00:00:54,720 --> 00:01:01,280
well done but for those of you who have

00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:03,330
absolutely no idea what the gdpr is

00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,820
while you're getting thousands of

00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:08,460
frantic emails talking about this gdpr

00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:12,780
thing allow me to be the one to fill you

00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:16,140
all in 2016 gdpr is a 40 kilometer wide

00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:20,640
asteroid on its way to impact mainland

00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:22,799
Europe on the 25th of May 2018 by an

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,749
astonishing coincidence the EU

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,240
parliament in 2016

00:01:24,749 --> 00:01:29,100
announced a regulation called the GD P R

00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:33,469
and it will take effect and I'm not

00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:35,999
making this up on the 25th of May 2018

00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:38,009
for my own sake I'm going to ignore the

00:01:35,999 --> 00:01:39,929
asteroid completely and focus on the

00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:41,999
hypothetical peaceful life in the

00:01:39,929 --> 00:01:45,060
European Union after the regulation

00:01:41,999 --> 00:01:46,649
takes effect by the way I'd like to warn

00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,899
the transcribers that I am another

00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:50,369
Australian but I've been living here

00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:53,819
long enough to learn to speak a little

00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:56,299
more slowly I'll also say data not data

00:01:53,819 --> 00:02:02,369
and there's not much I can do about that

00:01:56,299 --> 00:02:07,490
so what is the GD P R it regulates the

00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:07,490
processing of personal data you probably

00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:18,910
you probably already have similar laws

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:21,070
there was an EU directive in 1995 but so

00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:23,320
a lot of this isn't new but the scope

00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:26,410
and the enforcement of the laws has

00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:29,110
changed dramatically it is a regulation

00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:32,080
and not a directive so the directive in

00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:34,030
1995 was just sort of asking the Member

00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,950
States please could you maybe do

00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:37,630
something like this but now the

00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:39,910
regulation is a law that applies

00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:45,820
everywhere in the EU simultaneously and

00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:48,670
has the same laws as a user it's much

00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:50,530
needed I think and wonderful regulation

00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:52,150
you may have already noticed a lot of

00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:54,490
wonderful emails telling you all about

00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:58,540
your rights in recent days and recent

00:02:54,490 --> 00:03:00,130
hours and asking for your consent you

00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:02,320
may already have a warm feeling of trust

00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:03,940
in these companies that are now asking

00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:06,880
telling you that they will handle your

00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:08,470
personal information more safely and you

00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,880
still have this feeling of control over

00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:12,250
your personal data you can delete

00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:14,350
anything or you have this feeling you

00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:16,510
know things will be handled properly and

00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:19,270
safely I'm not sure if this feeling is

00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:21,610
valid the timing over the recent

00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:23,740
concerns public concerns over Facebook's

00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:26,530
algorithms as may be made this a bit

00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:28,990
more interesting and it's nice to see

00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:32,680
such attention coming to this in the

00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:34,750
last few days the regulation itself

00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:37,810
isn't that big I had a copy around here

00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:39,310
somewhere it's it's everfeel

00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:42,040
feel free to read through it it's not

00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:44,980
too difficult the first 30 pages or so

00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:47,020
are just recitals telling you about what

00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:49,900
it should be doing and they're not

00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:51,640
really binding the after that you have

00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,860
the articles which are the sort of the

00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:55,780
binding bits and they're all nice little

00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:58,989
chunks of information it's easy to get

00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:01,570
through the first 34 of these are

00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:03,370
relevant for us after that it goes on

00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:06,160
about setting up all sorts of things

00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:07,300
that we don't really care about we'll go

00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:10,930
through some of these articles in a

00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:12,850
minute and the there are a couple of

00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:16,270
interesting ones towards the end but

00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:18,220
have a nice read and you'll be fine the

00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:21,820
most important thing is of course just

00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:24,510
don't panic you still have plenty of

00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,510
time left

00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:30,760
to to organize your sites and get

00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:34,210
everything organized I'm here to talk

00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:37,240
mainly not like a lot of other talks and

00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:39,160
articles and and and things that people

00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,930
have been saying I'm here to talk more

00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,180
to the people who build the technology

00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:44,980
and not the managers and and anyone else

00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:47,380
who is trying to figure out what the law

00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:49,570
means so there's a lot of information

00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:52,120
for those people and enjoy that there's

00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:55,690
a whole internet full of that but for us

00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:58,540
we we're more about we're building the

00:04:55,690 --> 00:05:01,030
system so we'll probably maybe get told

00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:02,770
what to do maybe someone will say this

00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:04,810
is what I need implemented or the lawyer

00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:09,300
says this is okay so maybe do it this

00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:11,890
way but I think it's important even

00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:16,390
though as an employee you're not

00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:17,860
personally responsible for compliance no

00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:20,580
one's going to attack you personally

00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:23,410
it's the company I still think that

00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:26,850
there's a professional duty for anyone

00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:31,060
who calls themselves a fancy name like a

00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:33,120
software engineer or an evangelist or a

00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:35,830
data scientist or anything like that

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,870
when you advertise yourself in this sort

00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:40,360
of a professional role I think there's a

00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:42,670
professional duty to be on top of these

00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:45,250
things and this regulation is really

00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:47,650
central to what to what we do is in

00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:50,590
industry and if you don't know it you're

00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:54,250
you're not really trained in what your

00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:55,960
profession is expecting of you also if

00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:57,580
you care about your employer and not all

00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,440
of you do but if you care about your

00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:02,620
employer then you'll be helping them

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,420
comply in a really effective way you're

00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:07,510
at the front lines you know that details

00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:10,660
of the data you know how everything fits

00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:12,280
together and the people who are making

00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:15,190
these decisions the lawyers especially

00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:18,190
have no idea all the sort of details

00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:20,380
about what's going on a good company

00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:22,900
might set up a way of communicating

00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:24,820
between you and and the people who make

00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:27,010
the decisions but it's not always the

00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:28,660
case so if you have a good eye for how

00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:30,550
things work and what might be private

00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:32,560
data or personal data and might might be

00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:34,780
this you're going to be extremely

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,040
valuable for your employer in helping

00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:37,660
them comply and

00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:39,790
you're valuable then maybe you might

00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:40,780
that turn into column concession or

00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:44,320
something like that you'll have to

00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:45,820
negotiate that with your bosses so what

00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,920
I'm going to do here is I'll just go

00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:49,930
through maybe three three things roughly

00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:52,750
some key concepts some terms so that you

00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:55,660
understand what it's all about

00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:58,480
exactly and then some of the rights that

00:06:55,660 --> 00:07:02,500
we as users and your users as users

00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:04,150
enjoy or should be enjoying and third

00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:06,790
our system sort of jobs and tasks that

00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:14,350
we as people who build software have to

00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:16,540
do so first of all just as a diving

00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:19,270
across from the the the development

00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:22,030
world into the legal world terms in the

00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:24,220
legal world aren't fixed as they are in

00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:26,230
software there there are no there don't

00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:28,420
types that you can define and there's no

00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:30,610
categories that very cleanly say this is

00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:32,380
personal data and this is this it looks

00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:36,160
like it might be that way but it's not

00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:39,280
really like that for example the term

00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:41,230
personal data this is the definition

00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,510
from the from the regulation it's

00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:46,740
deliberately broad and it really

00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:49,450
encapsulates a whole lot of things but

00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:52,260
for example like your your name and your

00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:55,090
IP address and cookies the device IDs

00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:58,060
all sorts of online identifiers are

00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:59,560
included in indirect information but it

00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:01,600
doesn't always mean that it is the case

00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,860
if you have a a collective IP address

00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,380
that's probably not personally

00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:08,080
identifying if you have a name that's

00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:10,630
John a first name that's probably not in

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,280
itself personally identifying but if

00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:15,160
it's collected with other things or if

00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:17,380
you have a very very unique name then

00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:23,500
then it is suddenly are uniquely

00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:24,910
identifying or identifying basically get

00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,830
a feeling for anything that relates to a

00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:28,690
person is personal data so and that

00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:32,740
person that it's relating to is the data

00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:36,010
subject lovingly named processing is

00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:37,780
also something very broad it means any

00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:39,220
operation I mean the text is here but I

00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:42,310
print it off and stick it above your

00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:44,020
workplace it's anything that involves

00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:46,020
the collection recording structuring the

00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:48,610
it's anything basically you do with data

00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:51,990
storage included if you're not

00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:54,519
looking at it it's still processing it

00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:56,500
data controller so here's a now some

00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:58,649
more interesting terms a data controller

00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:01,420
is a special

00:08:58,649 --> 00:09:04,390
it's an organization or a person in a

00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:06,760
professional context that basically

00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:08,829
collects the data and controls how it's

00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:12,100
used and for what purpose or controls

00:09:08,829 --> 00:09:14,019
the purposes that it's used for if it's

00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:16,959
purely personal if it's just between

00:09:14,019 --> 00:09:18,730
friends not included you'll be fine but

00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:21,370
as soon as someone else is involved it's

00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:24,279
maybe in a commercial context then they

00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:27,100
are a controller there are lots of

00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:32,019
exempt exemptions don't worry too much

00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:33,790
about those but the data controller also

00:09:32,019 --> 00:09:35,820
doesn't have to be in the EU so

00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:39,550
Americans with the smirks on your faces

00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:42,040
if you have EU citizens or data subjects

00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:48,760
in the EU you should also be complying

00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:51,279
with this it's it's broad but it's

00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:53,740
what's important is that there are two

00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:56,050
different types of entities there's the

00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:59,170
controller and there's also a data

00:09:56,050 --> 00:10:01,089
processor and the data processor is the

00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:03,310
person may be the controller gave the

00:10:01,089 --> 00:10:06,339
data to so they've collected the data

00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:07,870
from you for a specific purpose but

00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:09,339
they've given it on to somebody else to

00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:12,490
do some work because they couldn't be

00:10:09,339 --> 00:10:14,500
bothered doing themselves freelancers

00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:17,260
you are a data processor potentially

00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:19,300
because you're not an employee and he

00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:21,730
may be processing personal data that's

00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:24,040
your role in the system a processor has

00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:26,740
less duties you probably won't be asked

00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:29,230
specifically for consent or you won't be

00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:31,690
asked to delete things that all goes to

00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:34,240
the controller but you still have some

00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:37,029
responsibilities and we might get to

00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:39,519
that finally there's also or almost

00:10:37,029 --> 00:10:43,839
finally special categories of data which

00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:46,570
are anything revealing racial ethnic

00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:50,910
origin political opinions religious and

00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:54,010
so on you can read it all there this is

00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:56,890
notice that gender and sex is not there

00:10:54,010 --> 00:11:00,029
it's an interesting omission which will

00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:01,720
come later in discrimination but these

00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:02,650
anything that comes under these

00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,360
categories

00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:06,130
then has to be treated with a bit more

00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:08,680
care and has some other rules that has

00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:10,390
to go with get to know these and

00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:12,610
understand because if you recognize that

00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:14,320
flowing through your systems

00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:16,450
you really should maybe be doing

00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,220
something about that

00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:22,150
finally there's also the idea of

00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:24,430
profiling it's called out by name and it

00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:27,360
has a special definition and it has some

00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:30,430
extra rules that also pertain to it the

00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,200
it is very very broad as well as the

00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:34,120
others if you look at the categories

00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:36,540
they seem specific but you can probably

00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:39,790
fit a lot of stuff into those categories

00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:42,820
this will come into effect when for

00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:45,850
discrimination and so on but that's all

00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:47,170
the terms there I only listed a few of

00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:49,540
them but they're the main ones I think

00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:51,370
sort of us writing the software should

00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:53,590
know about because if you recognize any

00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:56,140
of them and you're probably in the best

00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:57,970
position to recognize them it's

00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:59,950
something you should maybe alert the

00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:04,810
company or the organization to what's

00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:07,300
happening so as a user we get some nice

00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:10,360
nifty rights and this is the exciting

00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:11,650
bit about the legislation transparency

00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,600
is the first one we finally get to find

00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:15,400
out what they're doing with the data and

00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:19,450
who's actually using it and who's not

00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:20,920
really using it because if they are

00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:22,750
going to use it for a specific purpose

00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,860
that's outside of your contract of

00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:25,570
outside of what they're going to be

00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:27,340
doing with it they need to tell you

00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:28,660
about that and it's been interesting in

00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:30,370
the last few days getting the emails

00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:31,570
telling me all these services that you

00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:32,950
didn't realize we're doing something

00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:36,910
with your data or doing something with

00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:38,140
your data what does it mean what you

00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:39,940
have to do here it's not really your

00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:41,950
concern that's in people in charge of

00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:43,930
the company should be doing that sort of

00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:48,040
thing but that's basically some a right

00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:50,470
that we as users get to enjoy right to

00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:52,270
access the data so as a user you get to

00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:54,880
see what they have about you and this

00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:57,250
will be in a day's time we'll be able to

00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,870
see what all these companies have they

00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:01,390
should be providing it electronically

00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:03,030
you can either submit a request or if

00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:05,080
they don't want to deal with that and

00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:05,560
automatics something built into their

00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,170
system

00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:11,440
have you somewhere but can you answer

00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:13,960
these questions what data do you have

00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,670
about me how did you get this data why

00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,950
are you saving the data

00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:19,450
who you giving the data to if you can't

00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:23,830
answer these questions you have about a

00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:25,750
month to answer if anyone asks you the

00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:28,240
right to rectification is interesting

00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:30,400
but for us it means can we correct the

00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,190
data I like does your system allow the

00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:34,300
data to be corrected have you fed some

00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:36,940
things into the machine learning

00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:40,630
algorithms and you can't change that

00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:42,580
anymore if you just have a field and

00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:44,380
data base with a Django admin interface

00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:45,850
then you're fine you can just tell an

00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:48,430
admin to go and change it Thank You

00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:50,380
Django but you might want to add a

00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:53,050
simple view to let the users do it

00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:54,570
themselves Thank You Django for enabling

00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:58,030
that as well

00:13:54,570 --> 00:14:01,770
the next ride is erasure so anyone can

00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:03,940
say please get me out of your system you

00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:05,560
probably also don't have to decide when

00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:07,420
and what to erase that's hopefully

00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:09,490
coming from the people who make the

00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:12,790
decisions but you have to know that it's

00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:15,450
technically possible can you erase you

00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:19,390
users from your system from your backups

00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:21,850
and if you do have backups and you

00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:23,800
restore a backup to users who had erased

00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:26,710
themselves suddenly reappear in your

00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:30,640
system this can happen for a number of

00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:32,350
reasons it's not just if they don't

00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:34,990
consent or withdraw consent they may

00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:37,090
object to processing or the data may no

00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:41,830
longer be necessary for the reasons why

00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:44,590
they were taken the next write is data

00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:47,200
portability then it really effects us if

00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:49,000
we're building systems then we have to

00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,920
build systems that provides their data

00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,460
in a structured commonly used and

00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:56,260
machine readable format which isn't too

00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:58,240
difficult to do maybe we're already have

00:14:56,260 --> 00:15:01,840
Django serialization thank you Django

00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:03,310
but maybe it's just something that's a

00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:05,650
bit awkward in your system or maybe it's

00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:07,090
something you have to build you have 30

00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:13,060
days to do it but you might want to

00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:14,230
automate that the user can and this is

00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:16,510
something that's not talked about too

00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:18,820
much the user can ask for themselves to

00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:21,670
be flagged in your system to say please

00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:24,520
stop processing me but don't delete me

00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:25,600
it's a sort of like a funny bit of the

00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,850
law that's sitting there somewhere but

00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,200
you have to be able to do it I doubt

00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:31,660
you'll get a

00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:33,550
request for this maybe you will but you

00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:36,700
have 30 days to comply so maybe you can

00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:38,260
wait for that and wing it but is someone

00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:41,260
going to surprise you with this request

00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:45,160
a week before it's due could you please

00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:46,750
make that happen the next one is also a

00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:49,360
right to object to automated

00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:50,890
decision-making and this may only affect

00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,020
some of you if you have systems that do

00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:56,490
completely automated decision-making is

00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:59,950
anyone here from chauffeured no good

00:15:56,490 --> 00:16:01,780
there is already this law in Germany and

00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:04,750
Germany was one of the countries that

00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:06,370
already has these things but true for

00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:08,500
managed to get around that chauffeurs a

00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:11,560
credit agency in Germany that's loved by

00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:13,540
everybody and they managed to get around

00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:16,330
that by having a token person in their

00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:18,070
process click a button and that meant it

00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:20,500
wasn't a completely automated process

00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:22,120
and they managed to sidestep that I

00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:26,260
don't know if that will work with the

00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:30,790
new regulation we'll find out the right

00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:32,830
to object is is similar to the removing

00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:34,390
consent but it's also for the times

00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:35,830
where you didn't collect consent so

00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:37,900
maybe you have a system saying like

00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:40,390
these people consented and so on but

00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:43,480
they can still object if even if they if

00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:45,460
you didn't get their consent so what

00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:47,320
things do we have to do there are lots

00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:48,910
but I'm going to listen things that

00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:51,460
maybe aren't completely talked about

00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:55,540
everywhere and some things that maybe

00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:59,820
address us specifically a core aspect is

00:16:55,540 --> 00:17:02,920
this idea of by design and default so it

00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:05,949
it's it's it does it's not entirely

00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:09,579
clear and specific but and and that

00:17:05,949 --> 00:17:11,530
makes it hard to comply exactly but it's

00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:14,140
it's sort of important and it means you

00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:16,660
trying and if you give it a good go

00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:18,280
you'll be fine I guess so taking into

00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:20,470
account the state of the art the custom

00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:23,020
information lalala Django already helps

00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:26,530
you with this because it the framework

00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:28,780
itself encourages best practices the

00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:30,910
documentation pushes even further in

00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:33,040
that direction and helps you learn about

00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:36,160
best practices and the community even

00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:37,750
more so the community offers third-party

00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,790
frameworks that allow more techniques

00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:42,160
for best practices and conferences like

00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:43,619
this where you learn about how to do it

00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,769
properly

00:17:43,619 --> 00:17:48,659
so in that sense a lot of us probably

00:17:46,769 --> 00:17:50,639
don't need to care as much about this we

00:17:48,659 --> 00:17:52,679
probably all know somebody who does need

00:17:50,639 --> 00:17:54,990
to care about this who storing passwords

00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:58,639
and interesting ways who has own secure

00:17:54,990 --> 00:18:03,820
system as who send datasets by email to

00:17:58,639 --> 00:18:05,509
400 recipients in the CC field and so on

00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:08,279
[Music]

00:18:05,509 --> 00:18:10,200
there's a lot of detail in this

00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:19,369
I think they mentioned things like

00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:21,570
pseudonymous Asian yeah okay and that is

00:18:19,369 --> 00:18:25,350
basically what we already have already

00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:27,509
if you use the Django auth app then you

00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:29,159
will probably have a model that has all

00:18:27,509 --> 00:18:31,139
the user information in it or some of it

00:18:29,159 --> 00:18:33,889
and that will be linked with an

00:18:31,139 --> 00:18:36,269
identifier that pseudonymous asian

00:18:33,889 --> 00:18:38,249
everywhere else in the system or if you

00:18:36,269 --> 00:18:40,230
pass it on to other things don't pass

00:18:38,249 --> 00:18:44,070
the personal information don't pass the

00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:45,360
the don't pass the email address don't

00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:48,090
pass names and that passed the the

00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,799
number an ID or generate a UUID if

00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:53,539
you're using different systems outside

00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:55,679
of your Django system data minimization

00:18:53,539 --> 00:18:57,600
isn't really built into anything you

00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,759
have to do that yourself just don't

00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,259
collect everything you see under the Sun

00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:03,629
with the hope that maybe I'll one day

00:19:01,259 --> 00:19:05,460
use it sit down and have a think about

00:19:03,629 --> 00:19:07,049
what you might actually be using the

00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:12,419
data for and if you don't need it then

00:19:07,049 --> 00:19:13,980
don't store it build try and try and

00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:16,139
automate and build a lot of these things

00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:17,879
into your into your systems so that it

00:19:16,139 --> 00:19:20,190
doesn't you're not relying on someone to

00:19:17,879 --> 00:19:22,080
remember it or think about this and it

00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:24,600
won't cost you any extra time later if

00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:27,360
it's automated if you're encrypting a

00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:31,080
field by field I'll talk about that a

00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:32,639
bit later if we have time integrate

00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:34,919
maybe the purpose for which the data

00:19:32,639 --> 00:19:37,350
could be used processed into your system

00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:40,950
so that it's clear at every stage what

00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:42,809
you can do and can't do and maybe

00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:45,210
provide API as if you're providing data

00:19:42,809 --> 00:19:47,519
to other people with in like

00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:50,990
automatically restricting or anonymizing

00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:54,030
data before it gets used

00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:56,700
we could take a small technical detour I

00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:58,710
think we might have time basically let's

00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:00,750
let's try to encrypt sensitive data by

00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:04,290
field I thought we can do something with

00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:05,640
Jenga if you do encrypt data and fields

00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:07,200
you're not going to be indexing it or

00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,690
sorting it anymore I hope you can live

00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,040
with that make a decision if you're just

00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:13,920
going to do them individually or by

00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:17,420
groups and what libraries you might use

00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:19,740
and you trust to do this properly I

00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:21,570
would hope that maybe in the future

00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:25,320
Jango might offer something like this

00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:26,940
that that does it in a safe way and that

00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:30,330
allows things to happen so if we have a

00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:32,730
little model maybe that we have our

00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:35,160
names by the way an interesting fact he

00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:39,510
was the first email address that we know

00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:42,690
about the real name maybe maybe we don't

00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:44,100
want to keep that public maybe maybe we

00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:45,900
want to hide this from server admins

00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:48,660
from data analysts or the support staff

00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:50,850
that are looking through the admin and

00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:53,040
one way to do that might be if it's

00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:56,790
extremely sensitive like a medical data

00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:58,290
might be to encrypt that so we start

00:20:56,790 --> 00:21:01,860
with an unencrypted version and when

00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:04,590
maybe we install the encrypted version

00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:06,770
and then have a function to get the

00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:09,360
decrypted version with a password

00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:10,590
problem of course is that this only

00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,110
happens when you log in because you

00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:15,420
don't have the password anymore so we'll

00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:18,600
encrypt it with like a Content key that

00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:22,820
you can get once you supply the password

00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:25,980
at login and store it somewhere but that

00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:30,150
is then only for one user you could set

00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:32,640
up another model to to encrypt the same

00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:36,930
content key for each user that needs it

00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:38,910
with their password but that's also

00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:41,340
something a problem because then you

00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:42,990
have to store the content key for the

00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:46,860
whole session and where are you going to

00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:48,540
store that so you would then probably

00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:51,930
maybe have another key I use the key

00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:53,850
that you can store somewhere you can

00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:56,070
either store it half of it in the in

00:21:53,850 --> 00:22:00,210
memory or a session and the other half

00:21:56,070 --> 00:22:01,920
in the browser and use secret sharing to

00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:03,350
to bring them together and provide

00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:06,840
access

00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:10,950
something like this would then be able

00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:12,750
to encrypt data within a model per user

00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:14,780
so it's no longer a system-wide

00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:22,679
encryption it's a per user encryption

00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:28,409
and what you've done is you've you've

00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:30,750
managed to - for your backups if you

00:22:28,409 --> 00:22:32,850
delete the key then you don't have to

00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:35,490
touch your backups deleting an encrypted

00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:38,340
file or deleting encrypted data just

00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:40,049
means throwing away the key so if you

00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:44,159
want to use encryption it's a good way

00:22:40,049 --> 00:22:49,110
of deleting things of sort of shredding

00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:50,700
them by by just throwing away a key

00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:52,110
that's not part of your backups it's not

00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,640
part of your systems and if you keep

00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:57,240
everything separate that might be a lot

00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:59,610
easier to do a couple of notes on this

00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:04,950
make sure you use maybe like an is

00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:07,049
initialization vector so that the the

00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:08,730
same key like data won't be revealed

00:23:07,049 --> 00:23:10,110
because you have none none none none and

00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:13,500
we can work out that this hash means

00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:15,330
none or and make sure that you don't

00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:17,250
write something like this ever yourself

00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:20,370
so this would also be something that's

00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:23,640
part of a framework using if you store

00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:26,039
the way you do it in the key like the

00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:28,350
user passwords - in Django then that

00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:31,730
will help migrating data later if you

00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:34,080
change your algorithm or your method

00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:36,240
erasing personal data might be

00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,620
straightforward but you'll probably have

00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,179
problems with your link data or your

00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:45,750
backups you've got one month to work

00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:48,480
that out by separating maybe your

00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:50,400
backups if you have a one backup for

00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,909
your account data and one backup for

00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:56,309
your non personal data then you can

00:23:53,909 --> 00:23:58,950
maybe keep the non personal data a bit

00:23:56,309 --> 00:24:00,840
longer or you can Riaan crypt the other

00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:02,549
one in another way but you can just

00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:05,190
maybe manage it a little bit better if

00:24:02,549 --> 00:24:07,350
you do that the idea of crypto shredding

00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:10,110
before with the throwing away the key is

00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:13,169
the same idea if you've encrypted the

00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:16,010
the account data on a per user basis

00:24:13,169 --> 00:24:18,840
then you can just throw away the key

00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:21,840
one other thing that the regulation

00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:23,250
brings that's new is or in some

00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,920
jurisdictions is preventing

00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:28,830
discrimination based on special

00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:31,220
categories and this this is basically

00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:34,890
when you're having algorithms for like

00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:38,430
pricing your shoelaces or something if

00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:40,620
you you can't include any of this

00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:44,990
information in your algorithm to decide

00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:47,220
who pays more or who has a legal effect

00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:51,390
another important word here is the word

00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:55,140
revealing because if I have maybe a date

00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:57,140
of birth and a postcode I might be able

00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:59,340
to identify a lot of people that way

00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:01,590
combining different forms of data can

00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:03,360
identify people in ways you might not

00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:06,000
have so if you use that data especially

00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:08,070
postcode data if you use that you may

00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,130
well end up being discriminating against

00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:12,750
people it's a very difficult thing to do

00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:13,920
properly and we should be doing it

00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:16,230
properly and we're learning about this

00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:18,360
at the conference and there are lots of

00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:20,790
people lots of research happening you

00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:22,320
will hear about bias in algorithms learn

00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:25,410
about it if you're writing algorithms

00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:27,060
that make decisions for people and how

00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:29,400
much they pay or whether they get a loan

00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:31,950
or anything like that learn about this

00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:33,810
stuff and try to prevent it it will make

00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:37,800
your algorithms better in any case

00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:40,020
because you're you're looking at that

00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:44,280
what's actually important instead of

00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:46,230
some other things also note that gender

00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:48,270
and age is not included in the special

00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:51,810
categories as we saw before so you're

00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:55,860
free to offer shoelaces more expensively

00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:57,960
to one sex than the other you will maybe

00:25:55,860 --> 00:26:00,240
run against other discrimination law in

00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:03,360
other aspects of the EU legislation but

00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:05,790
in the GD P R you'll be fine don't in

00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:07,740
don't forget intersectional so if you

00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:09,480
have you may be sort of controlling

00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:11,610
around the rhythms you're testing them

00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:14,190
you're auditing them but if you're doing

00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:17,130
it for just each category specifically

00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:19,470
you may miss that some people who live

00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:21,420
in two categories at once will then get

00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:23,580
discriminated against you have to check

00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:27,110
these as well and it's not easy to do

00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:27,110
because there are lots of combinations

00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:35,230
ways to attack this there are is there's

00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,760
a lot of work on this sort of thing and

00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:38,230
I'd encourage you to go and do about

00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:40,690
that it's probably outside of the scope

00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:45,250
of this talk but you can remove data

00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:47,650
points you can anonymize the data and

00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:53,830
there are ways of addressing that that

00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:56,620
might be worth doing it may slightly not

00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:58,600
improve your algorithm but I think it's

00:26:56,620 --> 00:27:00,850
there is a bit of research showing that

00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:02,260
the the fairness when you increase the

00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:07,510
fairness you can get a lot of gains and

00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:10,179
fairness for a little price in in in how

00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:12,400
good your algorithm works it's it's a

00:27:10,179 --> 00:27:13,630
it's a problem of multiple optimization

00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,220
you could maybe include it if you

00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:17,380
ordered it it's a probably the best way

00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:19,330
to do this because you're not allowed to

00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:22,720
collect special data categories without

00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:24,730
a very good reason it may not be

00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:27,250
possible to be fair it's it's a question

00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:29,710
you might have to ask and I think we'll

00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:33,100
find out in the next few years how far

00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:34,750
we come with that what's another thing

00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:36,730
that I won't go into too much detail

00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:40,150
about is the idea of explaining machine

00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:42,429
learning this can be very difficult

00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:44,950
because there might be a right to

00:27:42,429 --> 00:27:46,870
explanation of an algorithm so if some a

00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:49,419
user comes to you and says tell me why

00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:50,799
you made this automated decision you may

00:27:49,419 --> 00:27:52,150
have to be able to explain how that

00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,980
happened if you're using machine

00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:56,610
learning if you've got a deep neural

00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:59,140
network you have no idea what's going on

00:27:56,610 --> 00:28:02,380
it's not going to be easy there is

00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:06,460
research in this area look into it it's

00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:08,020
explainable machine learning it's it's

00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:10,660
hard to say whether this right even

00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:12,610
exists to an explanation it's early days

00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:14,380
it hasn't even started yet but it'll

00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:16,660
it'll clear up in the next few years I

00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:19,370
think and we'll we'll know what we need

00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:20,730
to do and whether it's part of it or not

00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:24,370
[Music]

00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:26,169
if there are reasons I won't go into the

00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:31,630
details that it might not actually exist

00:28:26,169 --> 00:28:34,419
because because it was removed

00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:36,970
explicitly from article 22 and so on and

00:28:34,419 --> 00:28:39,190
so on in Germany there's is an also

00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:40,340
translation of the law that says it has

00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:43,760
to be about the invasion

00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:45,140
effects and so on and so on look into

00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:47,510
this we can have a chat about it later

00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:49,100
if you are interested in that what is

00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:53,570
interesting is maybe the idea of

00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:55,370
anonymization doing this is really hard

00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:58,400
and if you don't have any experience and

00:28:55,370 --> 00:29:01,000
anonymization don't try it alone without

00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:03,710
maybe getting into the research of this

00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:06,710
basically it's asking a question is

00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:09,590
really difficult and the only person who

00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:12,289
can answer that is maybe you because the

00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:14,570
lawyers have no idea whether this data

00:29:12,289 --> 00:29:20,899
can be combined in a way that might

00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:22,730
allow re-identification one I mean one

00:29:20,899 --> 00:29:24,409
this can also be very helpful if you're

00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:26,510
working on anonymous data you're

00:29:24,409 --> 00:29:28,120
avoiding model overfit if you if you're

00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:32,659
building models for machine learning

00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:36,169
which means instead of having one or two

00:29:32,659 --> 00:29:37,760
people in yours in your database tell

00:29:36,169 --> 00:29:40,640
your models something that's wrong about

00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:42,320
about the world you'll anonymize it and

00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:46,490
it will be the information will be be

00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:48,799
generalized it it's if you don't know

00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:51,710
things like the cane on an amenity and

00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:53,630
El diversity tea closeness find out

00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:54,679
about them or ask someone who does I'm

00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:57,380
sure there are lots of people in this

00:29:54,679 --> 00:30:02,330
room who know how to do an anima zation

00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:04,100
it's hard it's I just I'll just leave it

00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:05,630
there because it's it's something you

00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:10,460
really shouldn't attempt yourself if you

00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:12,169
don't know about it finally there is the

00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:13,250
final thing of breach notification and

00:30:12,169 --> 00:30:16,730
this is something you have to know

00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:18,919
because if you don't tell anyone about

00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:20,990
the email that you accidentally sent all

00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:24,409
you users with the personal data or

00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:26,600
something then your organization will be

00:30:24,409 --> 00:30:29,779
liable you have to tell somebody because

00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:34,309
within 72 hours it has to be registered

00:30:29,779 --> 00:30:36,260
at the local authority you may have to

00:30:34,309 --> 00:30:38,360
also inform the relevant data subjects

00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:41,049
and this can be very easily easy to

00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:44,480
trigger it also means loss of data or

00:30:41,049 --> 00:30:49,610
anything that sort of makes the Dadar

00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:52,190
poor if you send an email to the wrong

00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:54,110
person in CC or something like that they

00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:55,730
can also be a data breach a lot of

00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:59,510
oculus things can actually turn out to

00:30:55,730 --> 00:31:01,610
be a data breach finally what I guess

00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:03,260
for for Django if I could think of any

00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:04,580
sort of random tips that I could stick

00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:07,250
at the end of the presentation these

00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:09,290
will be it maybe set up a proxy for

00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:11,030
external services to protect your users

00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:13,610
if they're connecting directly to Google

00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:15,290
Fonts then Google is suddenly getting

00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:17,600
their IP address and the user didn't

00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:20,120
know about that so you can either get

00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:22,490
their consent before you do that or you

00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:27,890
can set up a proxy so that the user is

00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:33,020
just connecting to you I have more on

00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:35,510
that but we'll continue what can Django

00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:38,770
do I guess we'll find out in the next

00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:42,490
few years but maybe allow enable

00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:45,710
facilitate safe per user encryption

00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:48,140
maybe include a lot of documentation

00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:51,290
that's specific to gdpr to help people

00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:53,630
comply using Django and maybe even to

00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:56,480
tag personal data from the from the

00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:58,520
model onwards where you can say in the

00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,380
model that these fields are storing

00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:02,750
personal data or in combination with

00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:03,950
these other fields this might be and so

00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:06,020
that we can track it through the system

00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:08,120
so that we can handle it in a view in

00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:11,000
the net min and say that these users

00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:12,830
can't see personal data or that this

00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:18,169
purpose has been attached to this data

00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:20,030
and if you can then check am I allowed

00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:23,059
to use this data because I want to use

00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:24,740
it for this purpose maybe it's something

00:32:23,059 --> 00:32:27,559
for the sprints if people are keen and

00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:32,000
eager to get into this sort of stuff but

00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:33,950
I think in the end it's going to be

00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,350
interesting to see what happens in the

00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:38,690
next few years what we're experiencing

00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:41,270
now is more probably the more painful

00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:42,710
part of it is the the transition but I I

00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:44,090
think in a few years everyone will

00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:46,549
really know what we have to do everyone

00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:48,770
will know how we're supposed to work

00:32:46,549 --> 00:32:49,190
everyone will know what we can and can't

00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:51,320
do

00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:54,679
it'll be get easier it'll get more fun

00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:57,140
and we'll all have access to our data so

00:32:54,679 --> 00:32:59,299
thank you for for your time if you have

00:32:57,140 --> 00:33:00,890
any questions I'm happy to take them but

00:32:59,299 --> 00:33:03,020
I'm not going to answer the questions

00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:03,700
and compliance specifically for you if

00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:05,650
you

00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:06,820
have things like that but our general

00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:09,930
philosophical questions or

00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:09,930
clarifications they're good

00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:21,000
thank you very much Ian we have a first

00:33:19,139 --> 00:33:24,360
question here the microphone one yeah

00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,799
thank you and I say this with American

00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:27,929
legal training so things are a little

00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:29,850
different it seems that one of the

00:33:27,929 --> 00:33:31,590
hardest pieces to implement just

00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:33,779
thinking off the top of my head is this

00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:35,429
sort of decline for processing where a

00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:36,840
user wants to remain in your system but

00:33:35,429 --> 00:33:40,500
it just seems like there's so many code

00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:42,929
paths that that can go down can you

00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:44,279
decline to implement that right and just

00:33:42,929 --> 00:33:46,320
say you know what we're not giving you

00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:48,840
that ability and you can choose to erase

00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:50,580
or not but we're not gonna allow you to

00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:54,299
decline processing yeah it's a good

00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:56,820
question to maybe like I think you can

00:33:54,299 --> 00:33:58,500
to say well if you erase them you know

00:33:56,820 --> 00:34:02,639
along the processing personal data so

00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:03,990
you no longer attached to the gdpr it

00:34:02,639 --> 00:34:06,779
doesn't apply to you anymore

00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:10,859
right I guess a deeper question is does

00:34:06,779 --> 00:34:13,079
that maybe impact poorly with other

00:34:10,859 --> 00:34:14,940
rights of you sir or something like that

00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:17,429
or you know contractual rights that they

00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:18,419
had to use your system probably yeah and

00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:20,339
it means you have to look at your

00:34:18,419 --> 00:34:22,889
contracts to make sure that these

00:34:20,339 --> 00:34:26,940
scenarios are covered but not you

00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:28,440
personally the lawyers yeah okay thank

00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:31,800
you the other questions from the back

00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:35,700
microphone yes at some point you

00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:38,579
mentioned taking personal data there are

00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:40,500
some data which are borderline for

00:34:38,579 --> 00:34:43,440
example if I do business with you

00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:45,990
assuming you're freelancer I will have

00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:48,510
your name as a business partner

00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:51,089
I cannot delete that because I need it

00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:53,730
for legal reasons for my contents yep I

00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:56,669
also have your phone number but you

00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:58,410
didn't give me your business from your

00:34:56,669 --> 00:35:02,520
number because you don't have one you

00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:05,880
gave me your personal phone number so do

00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:09,060
you have any insight on how to endure

00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:11,430
this kind of things not entirely but

00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:13,319
there are a lots of exemptions or for

00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:15,480
business contracts and and things like

00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:19,740
that when you do get into the borderline

00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:21,869
data then it's a case-by-case basis and

00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:23,790
I think a lot of lawyers will often give

00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:25,650
you answers that there's no yes or no

00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:27,780
for a lot of things sometimes there is

00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:29,440
but sometimes it's just weed I don't

00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:31,930
know me

00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,790
and if you then get into the corner

00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:36,040
cases that you can argue for this or you

00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:37,810
could argue for that but there are

00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:40,540
exemptions that help you continue to do

00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:41,770
business with your freelancers and if

00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:43,630
you look through those you'll probably

00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:48,310
be covered by most of them and you'll be

00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:50,110
fine but off often you can do this on a

00:35:48,310 --> 00:36:27,280
case by case basis anyway if someone

00:35:50,110 --> 00:36:30,760
asks a human I guess is a natural person

00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:33,100
a corporate body is an is could be a

00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:35,470
legal person but it's it's not a human

00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:37,650
so it's not so if I have personal data

00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:40,930
on a company it's not personal data it's

00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:43,840
yeah okay there's another question of

00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:44,920
the microphone on the back yes ah thank

00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:47,380
you

00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:49,480
I have a question where did you know all

00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:51,610
this stuff from in the Internet there's

00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:53,890
a lot of stuff and everybody says

00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:56,530
something different and how to know

00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:59,680
which parts are correct and which ones

00:36:56,530 --> 00:37:01,570
to follow and yeah yeah I guess the

00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:03,670
first you could read the legislation

00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:06,780
it's not too difficult I have a copy

00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:10,950
back here if you want to look at it and

00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:14,170
secondly there there are a few lawyer

00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:16,120
legal companies that provide guidance to

00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:19,840
it and you can trust them if you trust

00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:21,730
them and there are a few opinions and in

00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:23,920
reality a lot of you don't really know

00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:26,560
there are some legal articles from

00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:28,660
scholars that argue in both directions

00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:31,300
for an ideas like the the right to

00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:33,010
explanation and they're good arguments

00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:35,500
both of them like I sort of agree with

00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:37,360
both of them and we won't know we'll

00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:40,780
find out in the next couple of years if

00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:42,240
people bring in cases two to two judges

00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:46,210
and we'll find out two courts

00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:48,670
but other than that you never really

00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:52,509
know a definitive answer to a lot of

00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:54,730
things most of the time it's reasonably

00:37:52,509 --> 00:37:57,519
clear-cut and it's a risk analysis

00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:59,109
situation is that worth doing that or

00:37:57,519 --> 00:38:00,609
what are the consequences of doing this

00:37:59,109 --> 00:38:01,900
and I imagine at the beginning the

00:38:00,609 --> 00:38:03,880
authorities probably aren't going to

00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:05,680
come down too hard on smaller companies

00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:07,509
and that probably won't come down hard

00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:10,660
on the larger companies with good

00:38:07,509 --> 00:38:14,289
lobbyists either but there is also right

00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:15,490
to sue so a user can say I don't like

00:38:14,289 --> 00:38:18,099
what you're doing with my daughter and

00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:19,990
take you to court and who knows what

00:38:18,099 --> 00:38:21,730
will happen there I don't like no idea

00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:26,049
we'll find out it's it'll be interesting

00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:28,869
times I guess okay another question in

00:38:26,049 --> 00:38:32,200
the front is there any provision in the

00:38:28,869 --> 00:38:35,170
law to prevent end users from harassing

00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:37,750
a company like asking every other month

00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:41,410
for the new data they collected or so I

00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:44,849
mean in some extent the recovery of the

00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:48,069
data or especially cleaning backups is

00:38:44,849 --> 00:38:50,049
actual work eating implementation or

00:38:48,069 --> 00:38:53,619
even if it's a manual task for smaller

00:38:50,049 --> 00:38:56,589
companies which costs money which is not

00:38:53,619 --> 00:38:58,990
something I can easily argue there was

00:38:56,589 --> 00:39:00,990
previously and a lot of implementations

00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:03,519
of the law so other countries had that

00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:06,160
and I would allow maybe the first couple

00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:08,079
but if you have too many then that would

00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:11,200
be you could charge a fee for it or

00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:13,809
something but it's now free and should

00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:16,269
be automated and I think the emphasis is

00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:17,890
on that you build systems that do this

00:39:16,269 --> 00:39:21,180
for the user automatically and you don't

00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:23,440
have to do it for every individual user

00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:27,220
I'm not sure there probably definitely

00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:29,529
ways you can harass if you look for very

00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:33,549
specific things that companies might not

00:39:29,529 --> 00:39:35,230
do I don't know if that's I haven't seen

00:39:33,549 --> 00:39:39,039
anything that their points to that in

00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:41,019
the legislation okay if we don't have

00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:42,940
any other questions thank you very much

00:39:41,019 --> 00:39:44,740
will for this amazing talk and for

00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:45,670
taking so many questions thank you very

00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:47,730
much

00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:47,730
