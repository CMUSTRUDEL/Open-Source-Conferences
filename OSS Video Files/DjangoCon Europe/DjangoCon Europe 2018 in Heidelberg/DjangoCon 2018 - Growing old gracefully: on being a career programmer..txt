Software development is often seen as a young person's game. But what if, as you get older, you want to keep at the keyboard? Thoughts from a (now) veteran developer on building your career in software development for the long-haul.

This is a community talk. My favourite topics from DjangoConEU 2017 were the non-technical talks. The most interesting (on-topic) conversations I had were about the non-programming aspects of working in software. I wanted to give a talk on that line. 

_Prima facie_ I'm not the best place person to talk about diversity (white, male, etc), but, having been freelance since 2006, with four young children, and now slightly greying hair, I am in a position to talk about how to build a career in software development for the long-haul. Hiring in tech is massively ageist. I want to discuss strategies to handle that. 

My target audience is individual programmers (whether freelance or employed) as well as software managers, looking to build **and retain** a team. (The message for managers is simply that they need to facilitate their employees' careers. This seems obvious but it **is** worth bringing out.) 

The core point of my talk is around the idea that a career is very much a marathon rather than a sprint, and that it needs to be approached in that spirit. (Again, this may seem obvious but it **is** worth bringing out.)

There are two aspects of this. The one is **pace**. That to work on software day-in, day-out for 10, 20, 30, 40 years (or more) we need to pace ourselves, to manage our reserves, and to have fun. 

The other is that there is noting to be scared of. That expertise which now may seem intimidating is, yes, available to us too. That with 5, 10, 15 years of continued effort we too (yes, us) can be as experienced as whomever, in the speciality we choose. 

I bring this out with three points. That we need to: 

* **Be disciplined**: The key point is to keep going. We each need to find patterns that work for us and develop them into habits that we build into a routine. The great thing is it doesn't have to be 100 hour weeks. As long as we keep doing it, whatever we do builds up over time. Despite the impression to the contrary, time is on our side. Which leads to...

* **Be prolific**: Do lots, and put it out there. This one seems scary. "I'll never do as much as ..." — but it's an illusion. Do one thing. Put that out there. Do something else. Repeat. Again, the work builds up over time, and (seemingly) all of a sudden, you're in a position of being the expert. Finally...

* **Be social**: And I don't necessarily mean Facebook (unless Facebook is your thing). In whatever environment or medium suits you get out there meet people. (Stretch your comfort zones a bit here.) Share what you've done. Relish in what others have done. Be part of the community. Help build the community. 

All three of these are essential. As you get older — all the more as you get older — they allow you to build a sustainable career writing software.

This tale is brought out with stories on finding work, and on choosing clients, and employers, financial planning and job security, on family and free-time, and on the importance self-care. It's part inspiration, part battle-plan.

technical talk um okay growing old

00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:20,000
gracefully on being a career programmer

00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:23,890
I'm going to talk about building a

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,900
career in programming for the long haul

00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:29,210
we'll see to bootstrap the app and to

00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:31,460
boot strap that I'm going to talk a

00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:33,520
little bit about my career so far

00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:36,200
and tell you a little story about that

00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:45,280
make some points um it says here isn't

00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:45,280
big letters talk slowly

00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:51,890

github on Stack Overflow on Twitter I'm

00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:06,590
not on Twitter very much Python packet

00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,970
injects read the docs or Carlton Gibson

00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:10,819
you can find me

00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:14,569
I have a microblog blog accounts which

00:02:10,819 --> 00:02:17,930
I'm just Carlton I post occasionally but

00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:20,209
who am i well I'm a long-term Jango user

00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:22,909
I was fortunate enough to

00:02:20,209 --> 00:02:26,540
go to university I studied economics I

00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:27,890
wanted to be a merchant banker in my

00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,629
second year I discovered philosophy I

00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:31,010
became addicted to philosophy I did a

00:02:29,629 --> 00:02:33,409
master's in the history and philosophy

00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:35,599
of science and in the end I did a PhD in

00:02:33,409 --> 00:02:37,909
the philosophy of science so I finished

00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:40,670
in the early 2000s and this was the time

00:02:37,909 --> 00:02:42,469
of around the YouTube buyout and all of

00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:43,549
these these things it was exciting time

00:02:42,469 --> 00:02:47,450
I thought yeah I'm gonna get into the

00:02:43,549 --> 00:02:48,829
web and for me this there's two ways

00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:50,689
into where bother you do computers that

00:02:48,829 --> 00:02:52,760
when those days are seen to be this you

00:02:50,689 --> 00:02:54,620
either do computer science and you gave

00:02:52,760 --> 00:03:00,409
me an ASP or Java or something or the

00:02:54,620 --> 00:03:03,439
other way was this PHP so I began with

00:03:00,409 --> 00:03:05,450
PHP and MySQL and had lots of fun there

00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:07,939
and then one day I went to a conference

00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:10,159
called for future of web apps

00:03:07,939 --> 00:03:12,950
it was amazing they were great great

00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:15,379
teams and there everyone was talking

00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:18,230
about this thing called django django

00:03:15,379 --> 00:03:20,780
django you must try django django django

00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:22,159
okay so I went home and I thought yeah

00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:23,689
well I'll look it up typed it into

00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,209
Google we locked on the web's

00:03:23,689 --> 00:03:29,919
website they said the web framework for

00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:32,120
perfectionist with deadlines that's me

00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:35,090
so I've been hooked ever since

00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:39,169
it wasn't just Django though it was

00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:40,909
Python PHP has come a long way but at

00:03:39,169 --> 00:03:43,699
that time it was very much the

00:03:40,909 --> 00:03:48,979
proverbial glass of iced water to

00:03:43,699 --> 00:03:50,840
someone in hell about the same time this

00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:52,569
guy got up and he pulled out that thing

00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:55,310
out of his pocket

00:03:52,569 --> 00:03:57,259
Apple reinvents the phone with iPhone it

00:03:55,310 --> 00:04:00,049
was the press release from 2007 and

00:03:57,259 --> 00:04:02,599
that's what they did and I jumped onto

00:04:00,049 --> 00:04:05,840
that and I thought wow brilliant iOS I

00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:08,060
spent a good couple of years building

00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,409
well I guess soulless apps for glamorous

00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:11,409
trains in London agencies

00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:19,489
and that was fun it wasn't just you I

00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:21,950
work what people wanted was a back-end

00:04:19,489 --> 00:04:27,850
to go with it and I knew Django

00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:27,850
so I basically built a small sub career

00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:36,640
building the UI side of it of an app but

00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:40,640
with a back-end that went with it with

00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:42,440
further Data Sync back-end solution and

00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:45,080
for that I needed something to to work

00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:46,430
with so I discovered Django rest

00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:52,490
framework a powerful and flexible

00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:54,950
toolkit for building web api's I got

00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:56,810
involved early there and one day Tom

00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:58,640
sent her email to the mailing list

00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:00,290
saying he needed help Tom Christi he

00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:02,240
said he needed help he needed help with

00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:03,740
Stack Overflow he needed help with the

00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,630
mailing list he needed help would get

00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:07,490
hub because he couldn't maintain it on

00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:09,920
his own anymore this was before the

00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:11,840
Kickstarter so I got involved I started

00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:14,600
on Stack Overflow and I started on the

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,790
mailing list and I got involved in

00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,560
github and so all of a sudden I became a

00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:24,380
core team member on Django rest

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:27,490
framework I was a second sort of guy and

00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:29,930
that was how I got into open source and

00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:31,580
worked on Django rest framework for a

00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:33,980
while and then I became the maintainer

00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:35,930
of Django filter and I became the

00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:38,930
maintainer of Django crispy forms and

00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:40,850
then from January I became the Django

00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:43,100
fellow the new Jiang fell along with Tim

00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:45,380
Graham Tim's been doing it for three

00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:48,200
years now and he wanted to step back a

00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:51,140
bit and so he's he stepped back a bit

00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:53,500
and I've stepped in I'll talk more about

00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:55,850
the develop program later in the talk

00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:58,570
but we're essentially contracted by the

00:05:55,850 --> 00:06:00,590
Django Software Foundation to work on

00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:04,970
Django itself and maintain on

00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:05,180
maintaining Django itself so so far so

00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:07,610
good

00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:10,370
like that it's a very short and potted

00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:12,410
history the point I want to make from it

00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:14,360
is that it's just a normal career I'm

00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:15,860
just a normal programming programmer I

00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,600
haven't done anything exciting there's

00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:21,350
no software billions there's no golden

00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:24,710
Lamborghinis I've just had a dozen or so

00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:26,600
years having fun building software I

00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:28,070
work about half time on

00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:30,370
open-source I'm very fortunate to do

00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:35,120
that and I spend the remaining time like

00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:37,280
many many many of you working with on

00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:41,690
with Django for various clients on a

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:46,570
freelance basis so what's the problem

00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:46,570
well it's simple I'm getting old

00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:53,210
apparently programmers before you turn

00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:55,640
40 you better have a plan B and this was

00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:58,460
some article and hacker news recently

00:06:55,640 --> 00:07:03,830
well I turned 14 November and I don't

00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:05,540
have a plan I think I'm in trouble it

00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:08,150
turns out that if you're old in program

00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:09,620
you you you can't get a job over 30 you

00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:11,210
were too old for a tech job in China

00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:13,250
well you can take China out there and

00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:16,130
you could put Silicon Valley or London

00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:18,560
or Berlin or anywhere you like you can't

00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:20,330
blame the hiring managers right they

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,430
advertised for a Django programmer and

00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:24,740
two people turn turn up

00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:26,540
one of them's me I'm old and I'm

00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:31,820
expensive and one of them's young and

00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:37,220
cheap and the programming on the the

00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:38,630
hiring manager has a problem for her the

00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:44,210
Django programmer is a bit of a

00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:46,730
commodity I explain my history I explain

00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:50,570
you know why I'm worth more she believes

00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:52,550
me but I'm so much more expensive so who

00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:53,900
does she hire she hires the young person

00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:56,480
and I don't blame her

00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:58,580
that's exactly right so you can't get a

00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:02,500
job if you got a job you can't keep it

00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:04,760
cutting old heads at IBM this was a

00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:06,710
these two article these were just things

00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:08,750
I saw whilst writing the talk these

00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:11,270
articles come up every week right you

00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:13,940
can find them so what did IBM do they

00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:15,800
had a load of expensive senior analysts

00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:18,500
who they constructively dismissed over

00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,760
the course of yes oh no you've got to go

00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,960
and work in your remote office but I've

00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:23,660
got a family I don't want to live in

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:26,690
work in a remote office you got it they

00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:28,730
get rid of you so if you've got a job

00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:31,520
you can't keep it and this is against a

00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:34,010
backdrop a social backdrop of the

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,419
so-called demographic crisis we have

00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:36,860
we're living longer and longer and

00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:39,560
longer so we have an aging population

00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:40,409
because of that in the West we combine

00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,959
that with a falling

00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:44,550
earth right and so the population is

00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:50,339
becoming more and more more skewed

00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:52,529
towards old age this is why be when I

00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:53,940
was studying economics they taught me

00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:56,190
that this is why we encourage

00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:58,439
immigration because we want people to

00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:00,839
come and help fill in the demographic

00:08:58,439 --> 00:09:02,639
hull but them aggression leads to

00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:05,189
political backlash you look at brexit

00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:08,000
look at voting you know across Europe

00:09:05,189 --> 00:09:12,269
now there's there's problems but

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:15,000
pensions become unaffordable so we have

00:09:12,269 --> 00:09:16,560
eroded pension rights there strikes in

00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,360
France whose journey here was delayed

00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,100
because of strikes in France have a

00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:22,649
pension rights in the UK there's an

00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:24,689
extended strike now in academia over

00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:28,740
pension rights these these stories

00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:31,500
aren't unfamiliar I hope so who wants to

00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:33,660
stay in program management anyone cuz

00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,339
that's the that's the stereotype right

00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:38,310
is you stop programming you become a

00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:43,860
manager but I'm an OK programmer I know

00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:45,360
nothing so the question I guess is when

00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:47,970
are you gonna hang up your bar gaming

00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,670
boots I've got a simple answer for me

00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:52,949
it's never never never

00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:56,160
I look at Donald Knuth he's 80 he's

00:09:52,949 --> 00:09:58,410
still involved by hip right that's what

00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:01,050
I want to do now I very much doubt I'll

00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:04,350
be working full time when I'm 80 but as

00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:06,420
long as my mind hold out I still want to

00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:11,370
be there I still want to be crafting I

00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:13,110
still want to be creating ok the flip

00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:15,329
side of the demographic crisis is that

00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:18,660
we have so much more time now than we

00:10:15,329 --> 00:10:21,389
ever had before you know we live longer

00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:22,980
but 70 is like the new 50 it's not just

00:10:21,389 --> 00:10:26,370
that you live longer but quality of life

00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:29,550
is extended into old age there's no

00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:31,589
reason why you have to stop at 55 or 60

00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:34,920
or 65 or you can keep going

00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:37,439
always always always with luck regarding

00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:39,149
to health just because you're old it

00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:43,860
doesn't mean you're out out of the game

00:10:39,149 --> 00:10:46,550
so what if you just want to keep

00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,550
programming

00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:58,540
hang on so I'll give a couple of general

00:10:55,210 --> 00:11:01,390
strategies and then some more detail

00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:03,700
points first general strategies look

00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:04,930
outside the tech bubble right many how

00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,160
many people here it seem to have already

00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:08,530
done this I've talked to people that we

00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,270
work in medicine we work in we work in

00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:16,270
whatever industry right if there isn't

00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:19,360
tech software is software is EMA talked

00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:20,710
yesterday about AI and automating jobs

00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,060
away but it's not just that with that

00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:24,160
water may I

00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:27,910
software is eating the world i software

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:29,800
elite the world is famous si um who's

00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:33,460
gonna program that wall you are I am we

00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:36,120
are um there's massive demand outside of

00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:38,530
the tech bubble so just because you know

00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:40,660
software startups in Silicon Valley or

00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:42,430
China or London or Berlin don't want you

00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:44,170
when you're over 30 doesn't mean that

00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:48,400
there aren't plenty of companies out

00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:51,100
there in the real economy that do I kind

00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:54,040
of think Emma had put up a slide about

00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:57,190
the the level of about the Industrial

00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:59,260
Revolution I kind of think we that's

00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:02,589
where we're at now we're in a kind of

00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:04,030
another Industrial Revolution people who

00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:05,710
don't program now are kind of like

00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:08,320
characters in a Dickens novel who can't

00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:10,030
read right they need they need to hire a

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,640
scribe who does the reading and writing

00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:16,810
for them well that's us now I hope in a

00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:20,650
generation computer literacy will be as

00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:23,110
universal as literacy but right now we

00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:25,330
have a we have an economic niche and

00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:26,920
there's there's a massive demand for

00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:30,370
that so look outside the tech bubble

00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:33,010
that's the first step and then always us

00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:35,950
be asking what's next what's next what's

00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:38,290
next a freelancers live and die by this

00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:40,270
it's called your pipeline and it is the

00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:42,190
most important part of your business if

00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:44,410
you are a freelancer you can have a bad

00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:46,390
project you'll be okay as long as you've

00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:48,370
got a good pipeline but if you've got a

00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:50,830
good project you're still in trouble if

00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:53,200
you've got a bad pipeline there's a

00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:54,490
there was a Bill Gates line that I

00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,350
wanted to find my couldn't I couldn't

00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:58,360
find the exact reference but the idea

00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:58,570
was that Bill Gates ran Microsoft one

00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,610
thing

00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:02,620
have enough money in the bank such that

00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:06,370
Microsoft could go a year without making

00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:08,170
a single sale now that might be asking a

00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:10,600
bit much but it's a nice into exercise

00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:10,930
could you gobble you it well okay it's a

00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,730
lot

00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:16,150
could you go six months could you go

00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:18,400
three months could you go a month I'd

00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:18,910
try to have a bit of reserve is a good

00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:24,660
idea

00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:24,660
but whether you're a freelancer or not

00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:30,700
thinking what's next is vital if you're

00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:36,610
an employee your great question is how

00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:38,800
do you get more money right you can

00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:41,980
maybe get a small raise that adjust your

00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:44,080
annual review to do a good job turn up

00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:45,610
on time do a good job well you know

00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,950
you'll get a percentage raise but if you

00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:49,330
want a big raise you need a promotion

00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:51,070
what's the best way of getting promotion

00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:53,620
will make yourself attractive to other

00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:56,230
employers make your employer think

00:13:53,620 --> 00:14:00,670
you're going to leave if they think that

00:13:56,230 --> 00:14:03,790
they'll give you a promotion if you're

00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:05,440
an employer if you run a company you

00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:08,680
should be asking well how do I develop

00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:11,560
my employees they need more money

00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:13,120
they're going to need more money so your

00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:15,430
core you should be thinking as an

00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:18,640
employer how do I build the structures

00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:24,100
that will support that if you're not

00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:25,360
doing that you won't keep your staff if

00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:27,310
you're kind of you're an employee in

00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,170
your company isn't doing that well you

00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:33,790
know you'll be off you'll get a new

00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:36,010
company anybody wants to talk to me

00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:38,260
about pipelines and things like that do

00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:40,840
afterwards it's it's one of my favorite

00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:43,000
topics I talk forever so look outside

00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:45,450
the tech bubble always be asking what's

00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,450
next

00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:53,490
and there the general strategies

00:14:50,730 --> 00:15:01,740
I want to then highlight three more

00:14:53,490 --> 00:15:05,670
specific ones so the first one is be

00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:07,589
diligent now what does that mean the

00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:09,390
software industry have this entirely it

00:15:07,589 --> 00:15:11,250
has this entirely wrong and this is why

00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:13,380
we look outside of tech because for the

00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:15,360
software come in distri it's all 100

00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:17,130
hour weeks and constant schedule

00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,260
pressures and deadlines this week and

00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:22,290
another deadline next week the culture

00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:23,730
of shipping you have to ship real

00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:27,750
artists ship well there's something in

00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:29,790
that real artists ship yes ok but it we

00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:31,560
it becomes a rod this mantra that you

00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:36,089
mash it becomes something we can beat

00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:37,950
ourselves with we have a phrase death

00:15:36,089 --> 00:15:39,079
marches yeah we ship the product it was

00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:43,440
a real Death March

00:15:39,079 --> 00:15:45,779
what is that let's blow that that's blow

00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,930
software it's not 100 hour weeks it's

00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:50,910
not unlimited unlimited vacation so you

00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:55,500
don't take anyway the number one

00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:57,990
priority is self-care this is what you

00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:59,790
must be diligent about this is about the

00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:04,649
pace in which you do it the key phrase

00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:06,360
is day in day out day in day out if

00:16:04,649 --> 00:16:11,930
you're gonna do the same thing day in

00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:19,290
day out for 5 years or 10 years or 20 or

00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:21,240
you can't be doing 100 hour weeks you

00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:22,950
can go to a networking event and you can

00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:26,640
work the long hours at the networking

00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:28,950
event you can work hard to meet a

00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:31,050
deadline you can push to meet that

00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:32,399
deadline you can ship the product

00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:35,940
whatever it is you've got to do but that

00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:38,160
has a direct cost to you and so you have

00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:40,829
to ask where is the time that recruit

00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:44,630
recoups that where do I get that back

00:16:40,829 --> 00:16:47,970
and if you that time isn't there well

00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:49,680
you will suffer again if you're if

00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:51,620
you're if your company doesn't provide

00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,910
them if your company puts deadlines and

00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:55,260
then puts another deadline and you work

00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:58,589
hard to meet that deadline but then

00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:59,990
there's no rest afterwards well that's a

00:16:58,589 --> 00:17:02,580
direct cost to you

00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:04,670
you can't maintain that it is a marathon

00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:08,130
not a sprint

00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:09,480
self-care self-care the sidon family if

00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:13,079
you have a family if you have a young

00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:15,390
family take the time out to be with that

00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:16,860
family while they're young because

00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:18,209
they'll grow up they'll leave home and

00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:23,190
you'll still have loads of career left

00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:25,320
in which to catch up or you won't catch

00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:27,390
up in which to carry on my subjective

00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:29,160
career I've four chilled my surrett

00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:30,720
subjective career pro six went like sort

00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,280
of like this and then it flatlined and

00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,600
it's still flatlined and it's still

00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,850
flatline it's still votans eventually

00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:38,610
it'll they'll go and I can go get on

00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:40,410
back to work um family isn't for

00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:42,900
everybody but if you have a family make

00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:50,070
sure make sure you take that because

00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:51,870
it's precious self care self care the

00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:59,490
part of being diligent is to eliminate

00:17:51,870 --> 00:18:01,380
distractions I refuse to work to death

00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:08,480
so I better be efficient when I am

00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:13,910
working um it's an a notification

00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:17,880
culture that we live in um email

00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:20,040
Facebook slack constant news stories

00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:23,780
that phones are always on always

00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:29,730
connected there's two sides to this I

00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:33,300
think one is addiction CP we see a lot

00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:36,240
of articles now about addiction to

00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:37,860
mobile phones and I tried to look up

00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,730
some decent research on this and the

00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:43,590
best version of the story I could find

00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:45,120
was it if you put rats in a cage and you

00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:47,250
give them a button that dispenses food

00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,990
they'll press it when they're hungry and

00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:50,100
they'll go away and do other things and

00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:51,090
they'll come back and they'll press the

00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:53,340
button when they're hungry and they'll

00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:55,110
get some more food but if you make it so

00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:59,550
that that button very rarely gives out

00:18:55,110 --> 00:19:01,710
food but sometimes does then that

00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:03,120
actually learn that it sometimes gives

00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:07,470
out food and they'll just sit there

00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:09,510
tapping the butter constantly and as far

00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:11,760
as this variable reinforcement it's

00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:16,080
called you can look it up on Wikipedia

00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:19,080
um emails like this and Facebook is like

00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,340
this and stack is like this the

00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,180
notifications are like this sometimes

00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:23,370
they're great

00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:26,040
sometimes they're gold dust but most of

00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:27,930
the time it's just noise but we find

00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:30,120
ourselves constantly reaching into our

00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:36,270
pockets constantly checking the

00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:39,450
notifications constantly well absorbed

00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:42,590
in that there's no way of doing work the

00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:45,300
other aspect is procrastination okay

00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:46,950
it's a bit oversimplification but

00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:49,200
procrastination is often caused by

00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:51,060
anxiety and I don't know vans deities

00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,100
the right word but the anxiety is caused

00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:54,870
by you've got this block of

00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:57,900
underspecified work that needs to be

00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:59,970
done now the real work is to do the

00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:01,290
specifying so that you can get on with

00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:04,230
it but what do we do our reach for that

00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:06,990
I'll just go check happy news so we

00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:09,660
reach for the distraction so part of

00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:12,930
being diligent is to eliminate those

00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:15,030
distractions um now I'm a software

00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:16,530
developer how do I do ru software so I

00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:18,990
did tell you some of the software I use

00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:22,260
and you know you

00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:24,930
I recommend these apps and you can use

00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:28,380
similar or or not the first one I use is

00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:31,590
it's called time out this could be part

00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:33,060
of self-care but I going to tell you

00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:35,220
about a few pieces of software so I put

00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:40,860
them all together what time out does is

00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:42,390
it it puts up a you define breaks and it

00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:44,730
puts up a barrier over your screen so

00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:46,590
you can't use your computer so I have a

00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:48,720
short break every 15 minutes which is

00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:55,140
just 10-15 seconds which is enough to do

00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:57,810
this thank you and then I have a longer

00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:59,520
break every hour every 15 minutes 10

00:20:57,810 --> 00:21:01,200
minutes so I have and it locks my

00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,880
computer I'm not I can't do anything so

00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,470
I have to stand up I have to walk away I

00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,020
mean coffee or hang out the way whatever

00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:09,690
I do but it's step away from your

00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:13,940
computer yeah I very much recommend

00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:15,060
timeout um you can only work

00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:19,280
concentratedly

00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:21,960
for 50 minutes at a time your brain just

00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:23,580
drops off the cliff after that so you

00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,170
have to have these breaks you can only

00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,560
do that for two or three hours of time

00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:27,270
with

00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:29,760
or for hours at a time and then you have

00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:34,440
to have a decent break this is still

00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:37,950
self-care I take those breaks look after

00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:42,330
yourself time out the next thing I use

00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:45,990
is called focus and what focus does is

00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:48,000
it blocks apps and websites and so I'll

00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:49,980
just look at we pot Oh note we bought is

00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,490
a distracting app I'm gonna close it for

00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:55,770
you that's a quite annoying but it it's

00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:58,260
effective and you can set schedules so

00:21:55,770 --> 00:22:00,480
for me my morning time is just my apps

00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:04,040
my morning time is when I I make my

00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:06,390
living if my morning time is ruined

00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:09,390
I'm well that's my business down the

00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:12,600
drain so I have a shape I have focus set

00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:14,910
set in the morning I then have a bit of

00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:16,260
a break at lunch time so that you know

00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:17,970
we want to check the news sites I can

00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:20,010
and then I have it again for a session

00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:23,640
in the afternoon so have these two focus

00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:25,650
sessions focus very good and then I

00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:28,860
follow that up with another app called

00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:30,690
rescue time and what rescue time does is

00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:32,640
monitors what you do wait there's a

00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:34,500
couple of things but it monitors what

00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,120
you're doing primarily it's just a

00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:39,270
background activity matter I think and

00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:43,740
get that on even on Android phones I

00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:44,730
don't know quite how that works but and

00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:46,380
so it monitors what you're doing and

00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:49,020
then once a week it'll send you an email

00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:49,860
tell you exactly what did and this is

00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:52,410
fantastic

00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:55,620
oh wow I spent four hours reading news

00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:59,520
on Catalan independence I better add

00:22:55,620 --> 00:23:01,650
that to focus because I can't be I can't

00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,300
be spending that much time as much as I

00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:07,680
you know care about the political

00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:10,110
situation in Spain and then rescue time

00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:11,700
also had that email is super useful is

00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:13,470
super user you think I'm efficient time

00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:17,400
efficient hang on but I spent my RSS

00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:19,680
reader is my second most used app you

00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:22,740
can't hide and it's private it's not

00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:24,150
your bossing it's you seeing and the

00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:27,480
second thing it does rescue time has a

00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:31,170
second layer of blocking it acts like

00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:33,270
focus again and so I have goals I say

00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:35,010
look I like the news I'd I'm happy to

00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:38,000
read it but I don't want to be on it for

00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:39,450
ever so after 20 minutes of news

00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,210
consumption in the day

00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:44,039
outside of my focus time sessions but in

00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:46,559
those extra times if I'm on the news for

00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:48,419
more than 20 minutes rescue time kicks

00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:50,970
in and it blocks everything then I can't

00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:53,070
go to Amazon I kind of you know you can

00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:54,990
work around it but it acts is that that

00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:56,940
that barrier if I spend more on that on

00:23:54,990 --> 00:24:01,590
more than X amount of time on news

00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:04,380
blocked brilliant so combined these

00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:06,149
three tools they stop me clicking on

00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:08,970
distractions just because I'm addicted

00:24:06,149 --> 00:24:11,159
to them and they stop me reaching for

00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:14,880
this as the distractions just because

00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:18,630
there's work to be done right addiction

00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:20,970
and procrastination what about a phone

00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:23,159
well that's a good question I have a

00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:26,130
simple policy for the phone delete

00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:28,049
everything I don't have facebook I

00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:29,639
delete my facebook account but that's a

00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:33,389
different story I don't have Twitter on

00:24:29,639 --> 00:24:35,010
the phone um I don't have slack on the

00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:36,659
phone I've been installed slack for this

00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:39,289
conference and when I leave I will

00:24:36,659 --> 00:24:43,669
delete it again because I can't have

00:24:39,289 --> 00:24:46,350
that thing synchronous notification

00:24:43,669 --> 00:24:48,419
source in my pocket because if I have

00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:54,539
that I will look at it

00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:56,450
so I delete it I use um I use a blocker

00:24:54,539 --> 00:24:59,100
called blocker X it's just one of these

00:24:56,450 --> 00:25:03,870
ad blockers but it also enables you to

00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:05,580
block URLs and so if I find myself on my

00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:07,649
phone loading up the news site because

00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:09,330
I'd like the news oh it's great isn't it

00:25:07,649 --> 00:25:11,039
if I can find myself looking at the same

00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:13,139
news website again again again I just

00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:14,880
block it and then it's annoying you you

00:25:13,139 --> 00:25:18,389
try and load it yeah the Safari cannot

00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:23,789
notice it but it stops me getting into

00:25:18,389 --> 00:25:25,350
this cycle remember I refused to work

00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:27,630
hundred hour week so I have to be

00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:30,139
efficient so I can't be looking at these

00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:33,870
things all the time okay

00:25:30,139 --> 00:25:36,480
so eliminate the distractions take care

00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:39,720
of yourself eliminate the distractions

00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:41,399
and then develop good habits

00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,580
what does develop good habits mean what

00:25:41,399 --> 00:25:45,809
depends on you what do you want to do

00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:48,210
and now I caught I would quite like to

00:25:45,809 --> 00:25:51,419
blog a bit more so okay I've put the

00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:52,769
microdot blog app on my phone and then I

00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:52,980
can always open that because it's

00:25:52,769 --> 00:25:54,990
nothing

00:25:52,980 --> 00:26:00,960
else on my phone I can play with so I

00:25:54,990 --> 00:26:02,580
can hope I can open that and maybe like

00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,240
being there and it's the only thing

00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:05,280
accessible

00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:06,809
maybe then I'll develop a good habit of

00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:12,210
blogging a bit more that his history

00:26:06,809 --> 00:26:14,250
suggest I want but yeah I've been trying

00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:16,140
to vlog since 2006 and never managed it

00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:20,070
more than about twice um yeah

00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:23,760
never mind him that's fine it's not for

00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:24,679
an issue so where am i oh yeah totally

00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,059
forgot

00:26:24,679 --> 00:26:30,480
okay so develop it I don't know what

00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:32,100
good habits mean to you but if you take

00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,980
care of yourself and you eliminate the

00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:37,640
distractions you build a space in which

00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:40,110
you have freedom to develop good habits

00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:42,000
so what like what good habits do you

00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:45,960
want to develop create that space for

00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,549
yourself and then fill it and that

00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:49,590
there's an opportunity for self

00:26:47,549 --> 00:26:56,270
fulfillment that right if maybe who

00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:56,270
knows so be diligent oh don't touch that

00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:03,029
be prolific

00:27:00,019 --> 00:27:05,639
do one thing and then do another thing

00:27:03,029 --> 00:27:09,450
and then do another thing and then do

00:27:05,639 --> 00:27:12,179
another thing and each individual thing

00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:14,399
you do may not be very much but if you

00:27:12,179 --> 00:27:15,000
do it for five years will you do it for

00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:19,070
ten years

00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:24,590
will you do it for 15 years it adds up I

00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:24,590
remember when I started with Django and

00:27:25,309 --> 00:27:29,070
there was some people here and some

00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:30,779
other people not here who were the big

00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:33,000
names are Wow I'd like to be like them

00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:35,760
now I'm the Django fellow maintaining

00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:39,149
it's amazing not because I've done very

00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:41,610
much but just over the years it's added

00:27:39,149 --> 00:27:44,309
up to something no I'm not a superstar

00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:46,230
developer but it's I hope how if I

00:27:44,309 --> 00:27:49,500
looked back to then and thought that I

00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:52,380
would be here now maintaining Django did

00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:54,539
Django fella I'd be like wow isn't that

00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:56,940
cool and it's not that I'm super

00:27:54,539 --> 00:28:01,070
prolific but I've been doing a little

00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:03,630
bit all the time the use you can do that

00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:06,059
now I don't know again just as I can't

00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:09,120
tell you what good habits to develop I

00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:13,470
can't tell you what things to do is

00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:15,200
that's your that's your decision that's

00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:17,850
your life that's your project you're

00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:19,620
yourself right the thing I'm going to

00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:21,120
give you an example I'm going to give

00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:24,919
you an example of contributing to open

00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:30,419
source because it's what I know about

00:28:24,919 --> 00:28:33,350
and it may be relevant to some of you so

00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:36,690
contributing your open source right

00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:39,029
advantages it's a good thing it has a

00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:41,760
low barrier to entry in theory most

00:28:39,029 --> 00:28:46,289
maintains most maintain is are super

00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:49,139
friendly and so if you can make a patch

00:28:46,289 --> 00:28:51,059
you can open a discussion and most

00:28:49,139 --> 00:28:52,860
maintainer x' will be very open to you

00:28:51,059 --> 00:28:54,630
if a maintainer isn't open you just

00:28:52,860 --> 00:29:00,680
choose a different project different

00:28:54,630 --> 00:29:03,150
millions don't don't gain too well

00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:05,610
don't prolong an engagement which isn't

00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:09,420
positive on the internet just walk away

00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:14,760
from there but it's got a low barrier to

00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:18,110
entry and it's visible and stuff you can

00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:21,300
talk about if you work for a company and

00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:23,160
it may be that your work is under NDA it

00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:26,040
may be the its proprietary and you can't

00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:27,510
show it but everything you stick on

00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:30,300
github you can just point to him go hey

00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:32,310
look this is what I've done you go

00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:33,750
people always used to when I was a

00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:36,840
younger developer people ask the code

00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:39,120
samples I can't you know I can't send

00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:40,890
you a code sample but as soon as I

00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,750
started contributing to open source I

00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:43,280
was never asked for a code sample ever

00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:45,360
again

00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:47,070
because I just went right oh I

00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,720
contribute to open source and you know

00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:51,180
point up rank of Django rest framework

00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:53,580
no I didn't write it but I wrote some of

00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:56,310
it and you know you can see the issues

00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:59,040
that I've triaged and the things that

00:29:56,310 --> 00:30:01,860
I've done and that's enough so it's

00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:04,440
visible get up they say get up - not

00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:07,140
your profile but it can act as a large

00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:12,960
part of your profile you can you know it

00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:15,140
carries weight um it's in there a

00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,610
structural problem with open source

00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:20,550
what's the structure upon big companies

00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:24,540
taking advantage of free labor people

00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:26,520
building billion dollar startups all

00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:30,060
open source technologies and

00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:33,210
contributing zero or effectively zero

00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:35,880
back yes there is that problem um people

00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:37,500
have talked about this a lot I don't

00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:40,590
know that I have anything to add

00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:42,630
particularly here - that yes there's a

00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:44,670
structure pond open source how do we

00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:46,730
solve that I don't know what I'm going

00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:50,520
to talk about is the dangers of

00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:53,480
contributing to open source to you as an

00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:53,480
individual contributor

00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:03,039
the faith it's not really a burner but

00:31:00,249 --> 00:31:05,080
it's worth one it's a slow burner it's

00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:06,730
not you are not going to start

00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:08,830
contributing to open source and suddenly

00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:10,200
just because of that end up with the

00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:14,759
dream job at Google

00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:17,230
it takes time if you need something now

00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:19,419
if you need if you need to get a new job

00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:23,289
now and you need something to show off

00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:24,700
now your best bet is a side project and

00:31:23,289 --> 00:31:27,009
glamorous side project that you can put

00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:29,470
onto the hacker news and you know

00:31:27,009 --> 00:31:31,029
something that you can do quickly and

00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:33,399
it's a complete thing that would be

00:31:31,029 --> 00:31:37,679
better for a short thing so open-source

00:31:33,399 --> 00:31:40,179
doesn't work like that it takes time but

00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:43,499
that's kind of my point about being

00:31:40,179 --> 00:31:48,999
prolific about tape doing it bit by bit

00:31:43,499 --> 00:31:53,320
and if you contribute for a month a few

00:31:48,999 --> 00:31:56,409
months a year oh wow a few years they

00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:58,149
all of a sudden something which was

00:31:56,409 --> 00:32:04,240
small and which was insignificant

00:31:58,149 --> 00:32:05,830
becomes yeah okay yeah that's worthy it

00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,980
becomes something to show something to

00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:11,909
talk about so it's a slow burner but but

00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:15,879
the big issue isn't that it's burnout

00:32:11,909 --> 00:32:17,950
it's the biggie you think that open

00:32:15,879 --> 00:32:20,379
source is all about writing code well I

00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:23,470
like writing code I'll do open source no

00:32:20,379 --> 00:32:26,460
it's not most of open source is about

00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:28,960
triage it's about responding to users

00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:32,470
it's about answering the same question

00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:37,409
politely again and again and again and

00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:39,490
again and it never ever ever ents ever

00:32:37,409 --> 00:32:43,259
ever ever ever ends

00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:43,259
no matter how much time you put it

00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:55,810
you want to help so you get sucked in

00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:58,840
you do help but you get burnt out what

00:32:55,810 --> 00:33:01,950
do people say contributing to open

00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:03,970
source is interfering my work

00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:07,240
contributing to open source is stopping

00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:09,310
me from sleeping contributing to open

00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:11,850
source is stopping me from spending time

00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:11,850
with my family

00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:21,640
tributing to open source is ruining my

00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:25,420
health contributing to open source is

00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:32,680
making me depressed these are all real

00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:37,530
and present dangers Sascha put a blog

00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:40,390
post up last week on a blog about

00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:43,630
volunteering to organize community

00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:46,060
events like this one and how draining

00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:48,070
and difficult that is and she used a

00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:51,040
phrase which I hadn't heard about the of

00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:52,690
Django called the meat grinder so old

00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:55,420
hands on Django would describe it as the

00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:57,760
meat grinder but we need fresh meat for

00:33:55,420 --> 00:34:00,700
the grinder because a contributor would

00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:03,820
come in do a year due to years

00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:08,889
matters all the rest of it and and then

00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:10,659
they they get burnt out and this is the

00:34:08,889 --> 00:34:14,800
point of the Django fellowship program

00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:18,010
that we've talked about the hope is that

00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:19,419
we can let contributors that you focus

00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:23,649
on doing the fun bit the patch is the

00:34:19,419 --> 00:34:25,240
coding and we handle the triage flow we

00:34:23,649 --> 00:34:29,950
have speed up the review the patch

00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:31,960
review cycle we do the security and we

00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:34,360
help with security we do release the

00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:38,320
release flow we do the boring bits in

00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:42,879
paid time so that contributors to Django

00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:45,610
don't don't have to well get burnt out

00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:49,030
doing that so what's my advice what to

00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:51,879
do if you're going to contribute to open

00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:55,560
source first thing is to limit your

00:34:51,879 --> 00:34:55,560
commitment in advance

00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:02,000
how much time will you give it decide

00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:04,700
that in advance will you give it an hour

00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,560
a week then give it an hour a week but

00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:08,680
stop will you give it an hour a date

00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:11,180
that's quite a lot

00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:14,540
okay whatever you do people would ask me

00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:17,240
how do you have time how do you have

00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:20,810
time to contribute to open source well

00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:22,820
one answer I gave when it was when it

00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:26,600
was trending was that some people play

00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:29,660
pokemon God I play get up right that was

00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:32,110
hopes that like do don't play pokemon go

00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:34,220
or any of the other things I play get up

00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:35,780
so you know if I want something to do

00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:37,580
for 10 minutes I'll quickly look at the

00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:41,060
issue list and I can browse through and

00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:48,770
I can respond and that's my game that's

00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:52,240
me developing a good habit right and if

00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:55,970
you treat it like this as a game right

00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:58,850
then it gives you a simple metric it

00:35:55,970 --> 00:36:01,400
gives you something to measure is this

00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:03,890
am i doing too much here imagine instead

00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:05,930
of contributing to open source in all

00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:11,510
those sentences you had playing pokemon

00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:13,520
go oh if playing pokemon goes in in here

00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:14,750
interfering with your work then you know

00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,850
you've got a problem right you get the

00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:18,950
idea now this isn't to say that people

00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:20,540
don't have exactly that kind of problem

00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:23,600
with pokemon Garhwal video games more

00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:24,920
generally they do but the difference

00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:27,020
here is that there's no social

00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:27,880
expectation that we should be ok with

00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:31,480
that

00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:33,830
right that it's the norm that you did

00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:35,120
there's somehow we're failing if we say

00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:37,610
oh I need to pull back a bit because

00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:39,650
it's too much but it would suck with

00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:42,500
open source as it's precisely what the

00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:46,750
expectation is that you're letting the

00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:50,690
community down if you don't contribute

00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:53,140
that's a myth ok it's important that you

00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:53,140
recognize that

00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:56,930
because well because it's a dangerous so

00:36:55,910 --> 00:37:00,350
limit your sign

00:36:56,930 --> 00:37:03,770
that's just self-care again right look

00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:08,260
after yourself limit your time look at

00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:08,260
them it's in advance limit it in advance

00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:22,170
then the next thing is to get your

00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:24,150
employer to help stop touching that your

00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:26,340
employers should be using open-source

00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:27,750
you're all using open-source but they

00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:30,090
should be encouraging you to contribute

00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:31,380
back well they say it's a much better

00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:32,820
alternative than building your own

00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:34,260
almost certainly there's some Django

00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:37,290
package out there that does what you

00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:39,540
need give it a quick audit make sure

00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:43,560
it's not totally insane then use it and

00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:44,880
if there's a bug in it fix it it doesn't

00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:48,740
have to be twenty percent time although

00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:51,090
you know let's find this soft benefits

00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:53,970
it's a learning opportunity it's a

00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:58,380
growth opportunity for you and for your

00:37:53,970 --> 00:38:01,080
employer it's a training opportunity for

00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:02,940
you to encourage your staff doing to

00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:08,520
contribute to open source it makes them

00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:10,110
better developers it helps with hiring I

00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:12,990
think I think it helps with retaining

00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:14,550
talent because all the sudden you are we

00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:16,020
can't upgrade Django because we're using

00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:17,370
this third-party package which isn't

00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:19,910
compatible with the new version of

00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:22,230
Django we'll fix the third-party package

00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:23,660
they're not great Django and all of a

00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:26,400
sudden you're not using the end the the

00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:28,410
LTS that's one week sort of end of life

00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,120
and going on though we've got do new

00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:32,220
features it's gonna be end of life when

00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:34,620
we call the Sun you're on the latest

00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:37,200
Django and it's exciting you've got all

00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:40,470
the new features because you contribute

00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:42,840
it back explain this to your boss and

00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:45,090
again they should be funding Django or

00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:48,540
drf or whatever it is you're using it's

00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:50,280
much much much much much cheaper to fund

00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:51,840
these projects to get your bugs fixed

00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:55,830
than it is to hire a developer to fix

00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:58,650
them so if your company uses Django fun

00:38:55,830 --> 00:39:00,150
Django if your company uses drf fun drf

00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:03,270
if you use wagtail I think they want

00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:05,610
funding they fund it it's nothing it's

00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:08,010
pennies it's loose change for you you've

00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:10,380
got payroll write contribute a few

00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:14,220
hundred dollars every so often to an

00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:17,600
open source project so let me just talk

00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:17,600
about landing a patch in Django

00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:24,880
it can feel difficult you find a ticket

00:39:22,359 --> 00:39:28,210
you make your patch you open your pull

00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:31,710
request yeah exciting then you get lots

00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:31,710
of comments Oh

00:39:31,829 --> 00:39:36,640
remove this white space this is an

00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:39,220
irrelevant change change the indentation

00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:40,980
fix the line wrapping needs test needs

00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:45,369
documentation on goal

00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:49,500
don't despair it's okay the comments

00:39:45,369 --> 00:39:51,670
aren't meant personally right so you you

00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:53,710
just have to smile and go okay I'll make

00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:55,690
the little changes though people are

00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:57,880
busy reviewers are used to just going

00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:59,230
through it they just go to deliver then

00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:02,530
they just mark off all the things that

00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:04,839
they see a wrong so first of all don't

00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:07,300
despair it's it's not a personal attack

00:40:04,839 --> 00:40:09,460
on your effort it's just something you

00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,790
have to go through we want you remember

00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:11,890
that

00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:13,599
Django lives and dies by its country

00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:18,400
contribution so please don't despair we

00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:22,390
want you okay and to that end I am here

00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:24,460

00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:27,310
of my job is to support you getting that

00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:29,349
patch in so if there's lots of comments

00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:31,480

comments address all the comments and I

will eventually go back to track and I

00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:51,099
will mark it ready for checking at which

00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:54,180
point Tim Graham will have a look and

00:40:51,099 --> 00:40:54,180
there will be more conference

00:40:54,600 --> 00:41:03,850
and I'll be like I thought it was ready

00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:06,850
and you'll be like ah again

00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:09,010
I'm here to help I'm happy I will help

00:41:06,850 --> 00:41:10,900
you get through Tim's comments you'll

00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:13,270
ask yourself is this necessary do we

00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:20,530
really have to have this massive process

00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:23,710
well he's Jango any good okay I'm here

00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:31,030
to help and Colin Gibson I mean that

00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:33,280
it's so that's contributing to open

00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:38,740
source is an example of one where you

00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:42,250
can choose to be prolific it's a slow

00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:47,170
burner it builds up over time but it can

00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:50,620
help really help you but be careful

00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:53,200
remember your self care and so the final

00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:56,050
thing I'm the the final tip is to be

00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:58,120
social I don't necessarily mean Facebook

00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:59,410
if you like Facebook then that's fine

00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:02,260
that's up you know that's your thing

00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:03,730
that's great what I mean is to get out

00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:05,740
there and meet people and we're all

00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:09,130
rubbish at this but get out of your

00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:11,500
comfort zones and try share what you've

00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:14,860
done relishing what other people have

00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:17,880
done be a part of the community help

00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:17,880
build the community

00:42:19,099 --> 00:42:26,839
be social this is a secret weapon thing

00:42:22,789 --> 00:42:29,059
if you're an employee this is how you

00:42:26,839 --> 00:42:33,079
find the companies that will give you a

00:42:29,059 --> 00:42:36,619
decent job so there are many startups

00:42:33,079 --> 00:42:38,930
out there who just want to kill you they

00:42:36,619 --> 00:42:42,140
want to work like a Roman galleon like

00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:44,569
with the slaves of the the the ores they

00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:46,430
want you to fill that role but there are

00:42:44,569 --> 00:42:51,640
lots of companies out there which aren't

00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:55,369
like that how do you find them like this

00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:58,519
if you're an employer your biggest

00:42:55,369 --> 00:42:59,989
problem is hiring talent despite the

00:42:58,519 --> 00:43:01,819
fact there's so many programs out they

00:42:59,989 --> 00:43:04,670
can't find a decent job your biggest

00:43:01,819 --> 00:43:07,400
problem is hiring talent and retaining

00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:09,140
that talent well how do you get out how

00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:12,069
do you find the people that you are

00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:13,759
gonna really push your business forward

00:43:12,069 --> 00:43:17,150
be social

00:43:13,759 --> 00:43:21,950
if you are a freelancer well how do you

00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:23,359
find your ideal clients Rachel this

00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:25,729
morning talked about defining your

00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:26,989
client who do you want to work for well

00:43:25,729 --> 00:43:29,229
I want to work for somebody who's gonna

00:43:26,989 --> 00:43:31,460
pay me lots of money to do not very much

00:43:29,229 --> 00:43:34,759
well how do you find those people

00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:36,349
I'm not sitting at your computer be

00:43:34,759 --> 00:43:42,319
social get out there it's the secret

00:43:36,349 --> 00:43:48,200
sauce be social but just finally I think

00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:50,059
it also adds texture back to life the

00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:51,229
aggregators and the algorithms they saw

00:43:50,059 --> 00:43:53,450
that they kind of suck everything out

00:43:51,229 --> 00:43:55,910
how can use is the same every single day

00:43:53,450 --> 00:43:57,890
still read it but still click on it but

00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:59,719
it's it's it's dull it's like Spotify

00:43:57,890 --> 00:44:01,099
you know you first load up Spotify it's

00:43:59,719 --> 00:44:03,440
suggesting all these different things

00:44:01,099 --> 00:44:05,059
and but you listen to it for a while and

00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,979
the algorithm kind of flattens and all

00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:07,640
of a sudden it's the same

00:44:05,979 --> 00:44:13,400
recommendations every single time you

00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:16,130
look at it well being social getting out

00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:18,920
there genuine interaction is how you get

00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:20,329
a bit of richness back in it's one of

00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:22,210
the things that's so good and so

00:44:20,329 --> 00:44:24,650
refreshing about the Django community

00:44:22,210 --> 00:44:28,609
the Django community is different it

00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:30,969
revels in it cultivates it personally I

00:44:28,609 --> 00:44:30,969
love it

00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:35,930
so you want a program forever

00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:45,680
look widely there's lots of people out

00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:45,680
out there that need your services I

00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:57,810
remember the other point be diligent be

00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:58,710
prolific be social anyway that's it

00:44:57,810 --> 00:45:07,309
thank you

00:44:58,710 --> 00:45:07,309
