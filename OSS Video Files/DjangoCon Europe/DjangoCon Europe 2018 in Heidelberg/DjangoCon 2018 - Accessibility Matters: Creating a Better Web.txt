Title: DjangoCon 2018 - Accessibility Matters: Creating a Better Web
Publication date: 2018-05-23
Playlist: DjangoCon Europe 2018 in Heidelberg

Accessibility is an afterthought to many, but to those with issues navigating the web it's very important. We will go over examples of accessibility on the web, short and long term solutions, and talk about why accessibility matters to a variety of users. The audience should leave with the ability to spot some accessibility issues and the knowledge of how to fix them.

Accessibility is a huge topic that is often acknowledged as important...by the people who already care about it. This talk is meant to help the entire audience start thinking about accessibility and realize how easy it is to at least put some accessibility into a site (or avoid adding blatantly inaccessible content).

Ten to fifteen percent of the EU has a disability, according to the EU Labour Force Survey, which is a large potential audience for any site. There are various laws that factor into the amount of web accessibility a country must have, and the consequences a business can face because of that. Accessible web development also tends to lead to better UX and a happier user base. And, another plus: It will save devs time and frustration when theyâ€™re working with the code, since good HTML is enforced.

This talk will start with a broad introduction to accessibility, how to break different concerns down into categories for consideration, and touch on some laws around web accessibility. The second part will go through examples of good and bad accessibility and what to look out for, as well as ways to improve accessibility (including "easy wins" that they could implement quickly to drastically improve their sites). The final section will include resources for finding accessibility standards and also browser extensions and the like for people to check on their own.

The audience will be expected to have working knowledge of the internet, webpages, and using webpages.

okay so next on stage here is Lindsey

00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:16,290
dragon she's going to talk to us about

00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:19,740
exit accessibility and why that matters

00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:22,170
and why we should care about making

00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:24,480
websites and things look not just

00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:27,980
beautiful but also in a way that people

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:31,829
that may not be like many others are

00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:43,079
able to use our websites thank you give

00:00:31,829 --> 00:00:45,410
her a round of applause hi welcome as he

00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,910
said I will be giving accessibility talk

00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:52,440
accessibility matters creating a better

00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:55,320
web to give like a brief rundown of what

00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:59,179
this talk will include I'll do an intro

00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:01,620
to myself and the topic I'll do a brief

00:00:59,179 --> 00:01:03,870
accessibility explainer and give some

00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:06,900
examples of good and bad accessibility

00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:11,100
and I'll do a conclusion with ways that

00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:13,890
you can improve accessibility what this

00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:16,619
talk won't have is a reliance on slides

00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:19,380
so if you can't see them very well you

00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:22,320
won't miss too much I also won't have

00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:26,270
any animation and it won't have any cat

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:33,210
pictures I'm a dog person

00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:36,930
Remis he's a cutie after the talk my

00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:40,560
slides will be up at Dragon Tech slash

00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:44,700
Jango Connie you so that's DRA gon like

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:48,210
my last name could not manage to push

00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:50,850
them earlier so after this I'll be

00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:53,399
trying to I will also be taking

00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:55,079
questions like in the hallway or

00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:58,469
somewhere afterwards I don't like

00:01:55,079 --> 00:02:00,180
getting up and talking in front of a

00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:02,009
bunch of people when I'm not sure about

00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:06,079
my questions so I don't want to like

00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:08,640
make anyone feel uncomfortable here a

00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:11,460
little about me I'm currently a

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,200
technology evangelist but I'm a former

00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:15,940
web developer and I did a lot of work

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,940
with accessibility while I was working

00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:23,260
on a lot of front-end projects I'm also

00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:27,040
a bootcamp graduate so I started off in

00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:30,190
like another field and I run disabled in

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,380
tech slack so if you're disabled and

00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:36,460
work in tech or want to work in TAC

00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:41,410
it's a slack community for you so what I

00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:44,320
was doing beforehand was I was working

00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:46,810
in peace and Conflict and I have an MA

00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:51,250
in peace and the international peace and

00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:53,590
conflict resolution and why this really

00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:55,900
helped me with accessibility is that one

00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:57,790
of the main focuses of that is

00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:01,720
understanding what causes people

00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:03,760
distress even if it's a culture or

00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:07,300
something else that doesn't resemble one

00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:10,870
I'm familiar with so when I came in and

00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:13,630
started doing web development it was

00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:16,390
easy to transition that into doing

00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:18,250
something with accessibility but you

00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:20,080
don't really need a background to

00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:24,310
understand why accessibility is

00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:27,520
important what is web accessibility I've

00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:29,560
mentioned it a few times now web

00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:32,260
accessibility means that people with

00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:35,170
disabilities can perceive understand

00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:37,810
navigate and interact with the web and

00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:40,960
they can contribute to the web that's

00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:46,570
the official World Wide Web Consortium

00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:48,520
or w3c z-- definition of what web

00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:50,590
accessibility is they have a group

00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:53,140
called the web accessibility initiative

00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:56,380
and those are the people behind what you

00:03:53,140 --> 00:04:02,260
will hear come up a bit the web content

00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:05,170
accessibility guidelines or wicked they

00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:07,870
also make this easier to remember by

00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:11,170
putting in an acronym and that acronym

00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:14,050
is poor and this is for the guiding

00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:15,459
principles behind WIC hag 2.0 and it's

00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:20,799
just that's perceivable operable

00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:22,660
understandable and robust pretty easy to

00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:26,500
when you think about like how you want

00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:27,960
someone to be using your website mechag

00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:31,530
2.0

00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:35,300
is the standard in many ways in multiple

00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:39,599
countries for example European Union's

00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:42,030
sites are supposed to all use wicked 2.0

00:04:39,599 --> 00:04:45,479
for their official government sites and

00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:48,900
in 2016 they put in a directive that

00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:51,330
public sector sites should also adhere

00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:55,380
to it with only a few exceptions for

00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:57,660
things like live-streaming and that sort

00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:59,819
of thing and member states are actually

00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:02,039
supposed to add it in to their own

00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:05,880
legislation by later this year

00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:09,479
so for the EU it's a pretty big deal

00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:12,630
right now who is the target for web

00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:15,960
accessibility people with disabilities

00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:20,389
make up around 10 to 20 percent of the

00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:23,220
population according to most studies so

00:05:20,389 --> 00:05:26,310
this depends of course on like how the

00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:28,860
government defines disability or things

00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:31,740
like that and it's a broad scope but

00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:34,860
that's potentially a really huge amount

00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:39,110
of people even at 10 percent that's

00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:42,300
still a large portion of a population

00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:45,570
these disabilities are generally broken

00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:48,960
down into five main categories by wicked

00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:51,710
and other resources like that so there's

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:54,949
visual and that's like blindness

00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:57,599
glaucoma but it can also be things like

00:05:54,949 --> 00:06:00,810
floaters which are these little like

00:05:57,599 --> 00:06:02,849
dots that float in people's vision that

00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:04,729
can make it hard for them to see little

00:06:02,849 --> 00:06:07,440
details on a website

00:06:04,729 --> 00:06:10,500
there's auditory and that can be

00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:12,419
deafness and hard-of-hearing folks and

00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,800
it can also be things like tinnitus

00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:16,020
where people have a ringing in their

00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,900
ears that can interfere with them

00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:21,360
hearing things on a website

00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:24,599
here's motor and physical so cerebral

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:28,199
palsy Parkinson's anything that could

00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:31,400
cause someone's like hands to shake or

00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:34,259
make it difficult to use the device or

00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:37,229
like touch something on a touchscreen

00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:39,719
with like great accuracy and there's

00:06:37,229 --> 00:06:41,169
cognitive and neurological so that's

00:06:39,719 --> 00:06:44,800
like autism

00:06:41,169 --> 00:06:48,389
Lexia a lot of people when they talk

00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:52,389
about web accessibility they think about

00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:56,969
like people that can get seizures from

00:06:52,389 --> 00:06:59,319
flashing things and that's all in here

00:06:56,969 --> 00:07:01,509
but also there's language and speech

00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:03,430
which a lot of people don't think of but

00:07:01,509 --> 00:07:06,279
is getting more and more important as

00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:09,069
more devices or relying on you to use

00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:11,889
your voice to interact with them so

00:07:09,069 --> 00:07:15,009
people who don't speak or don't speak

00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:19,810
often or stutter a lot can have issues

00:07:15,009 --> 00:07:25,569
using those but there's also like more

00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:29,050
than that because disabled people can be

00:07:25,569 --> 00:07:31,080
limited to just those categories or they

00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:34,740
might only you might only think about

00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:37,000
what your country considers disability

00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:40,150
but there's a lot of people with

00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,330
accessibility needs that don't

00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:45,879
necessarily fall under those categories

00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:48,879
and there's lots of ways to break that

00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:50,919
down but one of my favorite ways to do

00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:53,589
it I originally heard from a Canadian

00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:56,159
expert named David Berman and he does

00:07:53,589 --> 00:07:58,960
four different categories he does

00:07:56,159 --> 00:08:01,089
permanent and that's like being born

00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,659
blind it's something you have it's

00:08:01,089 --> 00:08:07,060
something you'll probably always have

00:08:03,659 --> 00:08:09,879
there's temporary and that's like being

00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:12,689
sick sometimes you get so sick you can't

00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:15,699
do the same things you're used to doing

00:08:12,689 --> 00:08:18,909
there's acquired the most obvious one

00:08:15,699 --> 00:08:21,330
for this is aging as you age it gets

00:08:18,909 --> 00:08:25,080
harder to use certain devices and

00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:27,819
there's societal and that's things like

00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:30,339
left-handedness you might hear jokes

00:08:27,819 --> 00:08:32,289
sometimes about like people getting hurt

00:08:30,339 --> 00:08:34,810
using right-handed scissors when they're

00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:37,990
left-handed and the point of that is

00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:41,169
that like our society has made it that

00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:43,449
way we've designed things to be used by

00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:47,529
right-handed people because right-handed

00:08:43,449 --> 00:08:50,230
people are making them people with

00:08:47,529 --> 00:08:52,510
accessibility needs regardless of what

00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:55,000
they are may also be using less common

00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:57,840
tools because of the difficult

00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,400
they have and using the common ones

00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:03,430
these are generally called alternative

00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:05,530
input or output tools and there's basic

00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:07,810
ones that are like foot pedals instead

00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:10,720
of mice with your hands

00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:13,870
there's also touchscreens that you can

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,370
fit over other screens or obviously just

00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:19,240
get a computer with a touchscreen now

00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:21,640
there's eye tracking so people can have

00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:25,510
like a little device that follows how

00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:28,570
their eyes move and Braille displays

00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:31,030
that just print out Braille that people

00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:34,390
can touch in all different ways that

00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:38,710
people translate the web into a way that

00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:42,580
they can digest the information but also

00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:45,430
all of the categories for this can be

00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:48,250
deceptively simple because when you're

00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:50,710
thinking of users it's not just that

00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:53,680
they fall into one area or that they

00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:54,730
maybe are only using one special input

00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,730
or output

00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:59,710
it's that normally people have a few

00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:02,410
different issues when they have one and

00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:06,550
also they can fall into multiple

00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:09,730
categories someone who has a mental

00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:11,770
illness is still going to get sick like

00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:15,850
everyone else and everyone's going to

00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:19,120
age and a lot of these issues also tend

00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:21,100
to come together like someone will have

00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,380
one issue that leads to another or is

00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:25,900
connected to another so you have to

00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:31,630
think about more than just one thing

00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:34,600
every time you're designing also one way

00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:38,290
to like keep up with that is that

00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:40,180
they're not edge cases when you're doing

00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:43,000
them right you're not thinking about

00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:45,700
them as like oh this might happen and a

00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,310
very rare occasion maybe I'll test for

00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:51,580
it maybe I'll look into it but if you

00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:53,740
think of them as stress cases or like

00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:56,700
the moments that put our design and

00:10:53,740 --> 00:11:00,310
content choices to the test of real life

00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:04,030
a quote from the book design for real

00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:07,120
life which is very good you end up

00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:08,140
thinking about them as like these are

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,500
ways

00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:14,110
you test my code and test my site to

00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:17,170
make sure they'll stand up to nearly

00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:19,420
anything like they're not going to have

00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:25,290
an issue because I've tested everything

00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:28,600
and it's good so some examples of

00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:33,460
accessibility issues there's color in

00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:36,370
the size so if the text is very small or

00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:39,400
say light on a light background it's

00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:42,550
harder for anyone to see but if the text

00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:44,880
is big or has a lot of contrast between

00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:48,430
the background it's a lot easier to see

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:50,920
I go to the eye doctor a lot and there's

00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:53,530
an like visual chart you have to read

00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:56,080
off and they always are like read the

00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:58,540
smallest line that you can actually see

00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:01,390
and that's a lot like what the web is

00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:05,110
for some people it's that you're trying

00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:08,860
to read like a really tiny bit of text

00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:13,660
that's like really hard to see there's

00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:17,020
also the issue of like tax not being

00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:20,500
very different this is a major problem

00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:23,770
for say people with dyslexia who often

00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:27,010
will see letters but maybe not in the

00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:30,040
way that we are one of the major ways I

00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:33,610
test for this when choosing a font for

00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:36,730
something is just I type out one like

00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:40,120
the number one a small a lowercase L and

00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:43,140
then a capital I and in a lot of fonts

00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:46,300
they look very similar or the same and

00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:48,820
that's not a good font to use if you

00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:52,840
can't tell the difference between those

00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:56,290
letters and numbers you can also use alt

00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:59,530
text on photos this gives people that

00:12:56,290 --> 00:13:04,120
can't see them a lot of information

00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:06,250
about a photo it's also what you see

00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:09,820
when the photo breaks so it can be very

00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:12,370
useful in multiple ways and don't use

00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:14,710
words like image like people will be

00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:16,870
like image of a dog and it's like they

00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:19,030
know it's an image they've probably been

00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:23,410
told it's an image they've just heard

00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:26,350
image image of a dog on their screen

00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:29,840
you can also make changes noticeable

00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:32,180
like if you ever fill out a form with

00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:34,040
like your screen name and password and

00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:36,320
you get down and you click it and

00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:39,740
nothing happens and you're like was it

00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:43,070
wrong is it broken what happens it's

00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:45,110
it's hard for anyone to like understand

00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:48,920
what they should do then but if it gives

00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:52,730
you some sort of feedback on it so maybe

00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:55,040
it makes the word password red and then

00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:56,840
you're like oh it's the wrong password

00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:59,990
but like that's not very noticeable

00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:03,890
either so some people put something else

00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:05,930
like an X in a red password and you can

00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:08,870
even go one further and put like an

00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:11,210
actual message be like hey your password

00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:13,520
is wrong and that way people will

00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:15,260
actually be able to understand what

00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:17,270
happened without having to like search

00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:19,340
it out or just put in their password

00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:24,560
over and over again hoping that's what

00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:26,990
the issue is there's also ways you can

00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:29,090
make these changes more noticeable so

00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:31,130
there's like this thing called Aria

00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:34,700
alerts and it's code you put in your

00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:37,700
HTML and it will alert someone if

00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:39,620
there's a change on the page so when you

00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:41,810
do that message that their password is

00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:44,240
wrong it will actually tell people that

00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:46,940
can't see it at all that that's happened

00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:50,570
it's a way to communicate with screen

00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:52,850
readers which are what read out what's

00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:58,120
on a page to people that can't

00:14:52,850 --> 00:15:00,740
necessarily see it or see it well and

00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:02,750
I'm like kind of just going over this

00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:05,810
very quickly and talking about like a

00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:09,740
few examples but it's not necessarily

00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:11,480
like an easy fix I like to think of it

00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:13,430
in a few different ways but the way I've

00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:15,440
been using it recently is there were

00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:19,220
these books when I was a kid that were

00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:22,010
really popular called um the wayside

00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:23,870
school gets a little stranger was one of

00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:25,940
the books it was like wayside school

00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:31,490
it's a really weird school with really

00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:33,350
weird kids yay but one of the stories is

00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:35,240
about the school getting elevators and

00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:37,070
it's so exciting because like it's

00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:39,320
really tall school and finally they have

00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:41,240
elevators and they get wanna they get

00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:45,620
two elevators and one goes up and one

00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:48,440
goes down but that's all they do because

00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:51,950
they haven't thought about like hey wait

00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:56,240
these have to reset so people can use

00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:58,820
them again so only the first people to

00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:04,040
ride the elevators actually ever got to

00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:06,470
use the elevators at my last job this

00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,880
came up a lot this serve like thing came

00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:11,300
up a lot when we were going through web

00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:13,430
video like videos on our websites was a

00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:16,250
major part of what we did and we had a

00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:18,709
lot of tests that we ran through some of

00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:23,149
the manuals some of them not but one of

00:16:18,709 --> 00:16:25,279
the most showing I think of the manual

00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:28,070
ones we did was just like this really

00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:31,490
basic one that was like still really

00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:32,899
important we cover our eyes or close our

00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,940
eyes or whatever and we put on

00:16:32,899 --> 00:16:36,830
headphones and we turn on that screen

00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:39,860
reader that reads out the web page and

00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:42,589
we perform a simple task it was go from

00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:47,450
the web page to a video play the video

00:16:42,589 --> 00:16:49,459
and then pause the video so we do this

00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:51,589
to our own site but then we'd also go to

00:16:49,459 --> 00:16:54,529
competitors websites and we'd do it

00:16:51,589 --> 00:16:57,020
there some of them we couldn't get to a

00:16:54,529 --> 00:16:59,740
video at all which you know whatever but

00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:04,550
some of them we could get to a video

00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:06,829
play it but we could not pause it like

00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:09,980
one site for a long time had the video

00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:13,089
pop-up as a modal but you are still

00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:15,890
behind that modal like you could not

00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:17,689
interact with the modal if you were

00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:20,569
using a screen reader if you didn't have

00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:23,179
a mouse you were out of luck you had to

00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:28,240
refresh the page or navigate away from

00:17:23,179 --> 00:17:31,220
the page in order to stop the video and

00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:34,580
this is kind of like that elevator right

00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:37,280
like people are like oh we're going to

00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:39,200
install something that goes up and they

00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,850
didn't think past that for the video

00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:44,240
thing people are like okay we have to

00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:46,309
make sure people can play a video but no

00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,830
one thought like people do more than

00:17:46,309 --> 00:17:54,559
just play videos people interact

00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:58,070
with the controls of a video so when

00:17:54,559 --> 00:18:00,860
you're thinking about like how do I move

00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:03,830
past that how do I make better

00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:08,000
accessibility happen and not just do the

00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:11,720
basic steps it's it's hard but it's

00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:15,340
something that like nearly anyone can do

00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:18,429
to improve it regardless of their role

00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:21,409
you can do stuff like avoid gimmicks

00:18:18,429 --> 00:18:25,240
normally what's really popular on a

00:18:21,409 --> 00:18:29,389
website isn't necessarily good for

00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:31,100
accessibility reasons so like there's

00:18:29,389 --> 00:18:33,260
infinite scrolling that was really

00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:34,789
popular for a while but people do

00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:38,539
infinite scrolling but then have a

00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:41,389
sidebar on the right that you had to get

00:18:38,539 --> 00:18:44,000
to so people navigating through without

00:18:41,389 --> 00:18:46,429
a mouse would hit the infinite scroll

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,100
section and then they'd just go through

00:18:46,429 --> 00:18:50,899
it and go through it and go through it

00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:54,980
and they'd never be able to hit that

00:18:50,899 --> 00:18:58,220
sidebar if little things like that can

00:18:54,980 --> 00:19:02,059
cause a ton of frustration and just make

00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:04,100
people leave the website you can also

00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:06,710
just think about how your users use your

00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:09,799
products things like wicking and other

00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:12,590
standards are just that their standards

00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:15,320
their general they're considering like

00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:18,440
an average use case it's not necessarily

00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:22,580
what your users are dealing with or what

00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:25,789
they're doing on your site you can avoid

00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:28,730
user hostile decisions so if you've

00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:32,000
heard of like user friendly this is the

00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:35,330
opposite of that it's something like

00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:38,779
having five different auto plays on your

00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:41,600
website or having loud noises that

00:19:38,779 --> 00:19:44,269
suddenly occur unexpectedly these are

00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:47,720
really bad for people with anxiety and

00:19:44,269 --> 00:19:50,299
PTSD it's really extracting for people

00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:53,090
with attention disorders it can trigger

00:19:50,299 --> 00:19:56,210
seizures or migraines to have a lot of

00:19:53,090 --> 00:20:01,029
autoplay and the list goes on and on and

00:19:56,210 --> 00:20:01,029
a lot of browsers are disabling

00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:06,140
Chrome for example had a huge issue with

00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:10,220
it because they were disabling autoplay

00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:13,130
and it broke a lot of video games so if

00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:16,450
people hadn't need the huge issue the

00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:18,920
web games would have had this problem

00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:22,160
you can also just push back on

00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:25,160
inaccessible decisions maybe the people

00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:28,220
creating them hadn't even realized that

00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:29,690
was inaccessible you can explain why

00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:32,600
something might interfere with how

00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:35,570
people use the site and that you could

00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:38,270
miss out on other users and also if you

00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:40,310
offer alternatives people are generally

00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:42,920
likely to take them because if they

00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:44,360
hadn't thought of it they're wanting

00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,760
some easy fix

00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:50,090
now that's been mentioned you can do

00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:51,740
opposition research this is really big I

00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:54,230
think as a way to get people at your

00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:57,080
company to understand how important this

00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:59,150
could be if your competitors are more

00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:01,190
accessible then that means they might be

00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:04,220
getting people that you're not getting

00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:06,500
coming to them that 10 to 20 percent of

00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:08,710
disabled people and the people on top of

00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:12,350
that that have other accessibility needs

00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:14,450
could be lost users for yourself if

00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:16,640
there are less accessible than you or

00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:20,060
you can make yourself more accessible

00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,800
that's a niche that you can have that

00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:24,440
they're probably not even considering

00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:26,930
and if you embrace that you can get way

00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:29,180
ahead of others and the disabled

00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:31,610
community tends to talk to each other

00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:35,450
they'll be like hey this one website

00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:37,580
it's really great you use and suddenly

00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:40,730
you might get more and more users coming

00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:43,940
to you you can also reach out to your

00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:46,460
designers a lot of them think about

00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:48,410
accessibility but maybe aren't putting

00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:50,960
it into the product because no one's

00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:55,250
talking about it there's a type of

00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:57,560
design called Universal Design which is

00:21:55,250 --> 00:22:00,830
basically a way of designing the world

00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:01,370
around us to work for everyone from the

00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:04,130
start

00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:06,140
whereas generally accessible design

00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:09,890
especially in the real world is kind of

00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:11,330
just like put on like a wheelchair of

00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:12,920
ramp on the side of the building that's

00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:15,800
really hard to get to and knowing

00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:18,230
can see in that sort of thing whereas

00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:20,690
Universal Design you're supposed to be

00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:23,150
planning it from the start

00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:26,390
for example outside the green there's

00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:28,550
like steps surrounding the area but

00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:31,970
there's also RAM so long with the stops

00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:36,110
and it makes it so everyone can get in

00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:40,060
and out of that area like grassy play

00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:42,110
area I guess and this is an example of

00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:44,180
universal design when they were putting

00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:46,850
in the steps they thought hey people

00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:49,340
with ran like people who need ramps also

00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:52,460
need to access this space and then they

00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:56,420
design them together and it looks decent

00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:58,550
and it works well and this is the goal

00:22:56,420 --> 00:23:00,920
of accessibility for websites as well

00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:03,740
you don't just want like a button

00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:06,140
somewhere weird on your sidebar that

00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:09,110
says like click this to get high

00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:11,630
contrast color you want the color to

00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:15,020
already have contrast you want it to

00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:20,870
already be easy to see so everyone can

00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:24,530
enjoy it and even if you can't get any

00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:29,030
major changes happen you could at least

00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:32,000
get the bare minimum so a lot of places

00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:34,520
will just remove stuff not thinking

00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:38,060
about why it's important things like

00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:40,640
focus they link decoration form labels

00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:42,730
these are all helpful to many many

00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,730
people

00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:50,300
for example focus date is this little

00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:52,610
box around a whole border around

00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:54,830
whatever you're usually interacting with

00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:56,750
on the web it might be like a button and

00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:59,330
if you click that button you'll see that

00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:01,880
an outline appears and if for people

00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:03,500
that aren't using mice this helps them

00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:06,320
know what they're interacting with on

00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:08,930
the page link decorations are

00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:12,140
classically like an underline on the

00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:15,440
link and that helps people know hey this

00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:17,930
is a link so even if you can't get them

00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:21,910
to put more accessibility in you could

00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:24,710
try not to let them remove accessibility

00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:25,740
you can also remember that words are

00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:28,200
important

00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:32,610
your written content matters just as

00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:36,030
much as your visual content for example

00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:38,610
like I was going to a keyboard website

00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:40,860
to buy like an ergonomic keyboard which

00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:43,710
you think like people with accessibility

00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:45,570
needs might need an ergonomic keyboard

00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:49,500
and I was reading through the

00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:50,460
descriptions at one point they used a

00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:53,480
word

00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:57,420
well they use the phrase no sane

00:24:53,480 --> 00:25:00,510
application would do this thing we all

00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:03,809
know what they meant you know they they

00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:06,690
meant well-made they meant logical but

00:25:03,809 --> 00:25:11,150
what they used was a medical term that

00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:16,700
is used to refer to human beings and

00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:22,760
basically they're saying like no logical

00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:25,559
sane person and it gets really really

00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:27,480
annoying I think to a lot of people if

00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:30,480
you've heard the term microaggression

00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:35,220
people here here and read these things

00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:40,590
all the time they see words they're used

00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:42,540
to describe themselves or not and it's a

00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:46,230
reflection of how the world might

00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:50,040
associate that word with other meanings

00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:54,059
and it can hurt people and it can lose

00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:55,590
you customers as well because the people

00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:57,900
who don't care about those words won't

00:25:55,590 --> 00:26:03,120
even notice them but the people who do

00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:05,670
will notice uh you can also just try

00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:08,330
like really basic tasks like try

00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:11,280
keyboard navigating your site just like

00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:13,920
find out how to turn that on in your

00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:15,929
browser learn a few very basic commands

00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:20,700
for your keyboard and go through it and

00:26:15,929 --> 00:26:24,720
see how hard that is you can also get

00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:28,410
real input from users for example like

00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:31,710
UX researchers tend to go out and sit in

00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:34,800
cafes and give people gift cards for

00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:38,970
going through their designs you can do

00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:41,190
that for accessibility as well

00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:44,220
and if things are slow or if it's hard

00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:46,140
to prioritize accessibility you can have

00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:49,170
an accessible way for people to report

00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:52,920
issues with your site that way you're

00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:55,950
having a lot of people possibly giving

00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:58,730
feedback on what seems like bugs but

00:26:55,950 --> 00:27:01,320
maybe that's how you designed it and

00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:03,120
people might actually listen like the

00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:06,120
product owners might actually pay

00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:08,520
attention there are also benefits to

00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:11,220
having accessibility beyond just the

00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:14,310
happier user base good accessibility is

00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:17,160
good code with AG handles both standards

00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:20,850
so you know that hTML you're using and

00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:22,580
the CSS you're using is good it's less

00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:25,560
work for future devs

00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:28,020
because it's good code because the

00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:30,930
headers are all in order so it's not

00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:33,480
like in h1 on one page followed by each

00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:36,810
three each one again because you're

00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:40,680
using those for sizing crawling and

00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:42,720
indexing tend to interact with a site

00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:46,500
the way a screen reader does they're

00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:49,380
just seeing your HTML in it and so

00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:51,150
you're putting all these SEO tags on

00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:54,780
your site but you also might be missing

00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:57,000
out on other means it could of course be

00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:59,280
the law we talked about that a little

00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,830
bit there's certain legal obligations

00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:03,870
and especially if your site is if your

00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:06,360
company is international this can come

00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:08,880
up so there's lots of reasons for

00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:12,840
accessibility will make your users happy

00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:14,940
it will make your company customers that

00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:17,550
will make your lawyers happy and it also

00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:21,090
just makes for a better easier product

00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:24,510
to work with so finishing up once again

00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:29,100
you can find my slides after this that

00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:31,380
dragon tech slash Jango Connie you you

00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:33,810
can also I'll have a link on there to

download free trial of jaws which is

00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:39,330
like the major major screen reader that

00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:41,280
people use right now there's also lots

00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:44,730
of browser extensions a link to that

00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:47,100
