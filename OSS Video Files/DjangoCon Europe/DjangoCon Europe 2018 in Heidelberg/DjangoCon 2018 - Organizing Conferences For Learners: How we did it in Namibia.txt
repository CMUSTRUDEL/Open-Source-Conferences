Title: DjangoCon 2018 - Organizing Conferences For Learners: How we did it in Namibia
Publication date: 2018-05-24
Playlist: DjangoCon Europe 2018 in Heidelberg
Description: 
	https://media.ccc.de/v/hd-106-organizing-conferences-for-learners-how-we-did-it-in-namibia



In this talk you will hear about the importance of organizing conferences for school learners, how you can go about organizing one, what you need to do and what you need to avoid as you prepare the conference, how to engage with school teachers as a software developer, what the results of such conferences could bring out in our children and many more.

The poor quality of the software developers in our community is increasing. On top of other factors, most of our learners are introduced or exposed to computing only in university. This has caused the quality of our software developers to drop. We wanted to change that by introducing programming clubs in high schools and then we decided that why not run a conference for them. That's how this idea came up.

good morning everyone so my name is

00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:17,350
Jessica and today I would like to talk

00:00:14,949 --> 00:00:19,330
to you about organizing conferences for

00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:22,449
lenez and share my experience with you

00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:24,099
on how we did it back in amoeba so first

00:00:22,449 --> 00:00:25,720
of all thank you very much for your

00:00:24,099 --> 00:00:28,210
presence here and for joining me for

00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:29,919
this talk I would also like to take this

00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:31,659
opportunity to thank the sponsors

00:00:29,919 --> 00:00:33,489
because they made it possible for me to

00:00:31,659 --> 00:00:35,980
come here and share some African

00:00:33,489 --> 00:00:37,790
awesomeness with you guys so let's thank

00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:44,170
them with a round of applause please

00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:47,210
[Applause]

00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:50,180
okay so I'm from the south western part

00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:54,500
of Africa from Namibia from a small town

00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:56,390
village called oka Carrere my first

00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:59,809
encounter with Python was at Python and

00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:01,519
maybe a 2015 now as you can see in this

00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:03,920
picture I am one of the people in the

00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:05,900
front line holding the banner or

00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,540
supporting the banner but I had no

00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:09,920
business whatsoever being day because my

00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:11,630
reasons for going for that conference

00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,250
was not to learn Python oh I wasn't

00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:15,920
curious about Python or anything like

00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:17,390
that I went with a conference because it

00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,100
was at the beginning of the year and I

00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:21,410
was coming from holiday I was bored and

00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:23,360
I had the time and also because the

00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:25,070
conference was free so I thought there

00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,910
will be free food anyway so let me just

00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:31,550
go but at the end of the conference the

00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:33,560
experience that I got after attending

00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:35,539
the conference and meeting the community

00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:38,810
was one that I had never experienced

00:01:35,539 --> 00:01:42,140
before so I would like to take this

00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:44,899
opportunity again to thank my dear

00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:47,390
friend Daniel a procedure for putting

00:01:44,899 --> 00:01:49,490
aside his fears and bringing a

00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:52,039
conference to Africa to a land he had

00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:54,259
never been and as you may know this a

00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:57,380
lot of stories about how one can die in

00:01:54,259 --> 00:01:59,360
Africa so thank you very much to you and

00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:01,069
to the Khedive team into the Phoenix

00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:04,250
project from being for bringing this

00:02:01,069 --> 00:02:06,619
conference back in Africa it brought a

00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:09,800
lot of opportunities for Africans it

00:02:06,619 --> 00:02:11,810
opened a lot of our eyes as well this

00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,400
talk that I'm going to talk about about

00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:15,530
the the conference for Lina's it

00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:20,170
couldn't have been because if it wasn't

00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:20,170
for you so thanks a lot for your efforts

00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:31,139
now over the past three years the Python

00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:34,230
community in Ameobi I agree from this

00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:38,249
group of people to this group of people

00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:41,939
in 2018 so again thank you very much for

00:02:38,249 --> 00:02:45,030
your efforts now let's talk about

00:02:41,939 --> 00:02:47,519
computer day 2017 now computer day 2017

00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:50,879
was the conference and that we go nice

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,469
for just one day now my idea was I don't

00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,389
know what I'm getting myself into I

00:02:52,469 --> 00:02:55,590
don't know what I'm doing so let me just

00:02:54,389 --> 00:02:57,329
make this conference a one-day

00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:58,739
conference if it's going to be the worst

00:02:57,329 --> 00:03:01,409
day of my life then let it just be that

00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:03,569
one day and no more so I made it a one

00:03:01,409 --> 00:03:05,819
day conference where we had a lineup of

00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:09,859
talks and throughout the whole day and

00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:12,000
then we also had a break for software

00:03:09,859 --> 00:03:16,199
application presentation and poster

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,510
presentations during that day now our

00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:20,669
main focus for computer day is having

00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:22,530
talks and panel discussions so at

00:03:20,669 --> 00:03:25,530
computer day 2017 here two panel

00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:29,129
discussions one with the Dean of Faculty

00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:32,099
of computer science a true of our most

00:03:29,129 --> 00:03:35,250
highly recognized universities in

00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:37,979
Namibia and also another talk okay they

00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:40,109
shed for example the career

00:03:37,979 --> 00:03:42,379
opportunities that are there and how the

00:03:40,109 --> 00:03:44,519
learners could prepare for the

00:03:42,379 --> 00:03:47,180
university and things like that like how

00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:50,040
how many points they needed to have what

00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:53,099
courses they could take and the way

00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:55,919
forward so we also had another panel

00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:57,989
discussion and this one was with former

00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:59,819
students who are now in the industry and

00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:01,709
also with university students who are

00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:04,590
still in a university so here we wanted

00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:07,349
to give the children an opportunity to

00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:08,729
learn for example what what attitude

00:04:07,349 --> 00:04:10,530
they needed to have in order for them to

00:04:08,729 --> 00:04:12,659
be successful in the industry and things

00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:16,709
like that so the students were sharing

00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:18,479
their mistakes and some tips on how the

00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:20,639
children could be better students when

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:22,159
they get to university we also had

00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,830
poster presentations

00:04:22,159 --> 00:04:28,979
now this one's we're just posters on

00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:31,349
theoretical concepts in computer science

00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:32,699
so children made poster posters about

00:04:31,349 --> 00:04:34,740
that did research and then they

00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:37,080
presented on their day we also

00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:40,259
had software project presentations now

00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:41,940
kids created small software applications

00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:43,949
and then they showed to the others also

00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:46,319
at the conference now for computer day

00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:49,530
2017 we only had the first three the

00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:52,560
talks the posters and presentations and

00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:55,620
not the workshops now workshops came at

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:58,050
computer day 2018 and they came about

00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:00,300
because of the key because of what the

00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:05,849
kids requested in it after the first

00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:07,680
conference okay so this picture is one

00:05:05,849 --> 00:05:10,050
of the pictures of one of the

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,509
presentations during computer day 2017

00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:14,280
where the kids were now showing their

00:05:12,509 --> 00:05:17,340
softy applications to the others and

00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:19,470
then that is a poster presentation for

00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:21,509
one of my grade four three of my grade 8

00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:23,669
learners as you can see they are very

00:05:21,509 --> 00:05:25,440
very shy they know what they are talking

00:05:23,669 --> 00:05:27,389
about but they are very very shy and I

00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,159
was grateful for their courage to show

00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:34,949
up on a day and share the experience

00:05:29,159 --> 00:05:36,780
with the others okay so those are the

00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:39,449
two deals that we had for the day that

00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:41,880
shared their experience with us and then

00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:43,590
at computer day 2018 we had a panel

00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,940
discussion one of my most interesting

00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:47,389
panel discussions with elena's

00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:50,639
themselves so here we are talking about

00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:52,409
how we as teachers or how we as software

00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,349
developers can assist them in building

00:05:52,409 --> 00:05:57,330
great computer scientists so here they

00:05:55,349 --> 00:05:59,490
shared some of the mistakes I was making

00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:03,210
as a teacher I didn't mention that I was

00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:06,620
a school teacher did I so I learned a

00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:10,199
lot as well on this day and then

00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:13,500
computer day 2018 now computer day 2018

00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:14,789
as I mentioned it had workshops so now

00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,469
instead of making it a one-day

00:06:14,789 --> 00:06:21,830
conference I made it two-day conference

00:06:16,469 --> 00:06:21,830
the first day was called workshops and

00:06:22,699 --> 00:06:29,069
we had two all day workshops so one was

00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:30,870
introduction to Python that rain for the

00:06:29,069 --> 00:06:32,699
entire day and the other one was a

00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:34,740
general girls workshop that also rain

00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:36,449
for the entire day now the interesting

00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:40,199
thing about the younger girls workshop

00:06:36,449 --> 00:06:42,810
is that we had our I had I didn't have

00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:45,479
to do much I just needed to direct them

00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:47,639
so they organized themselves they they

00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:48,870
organized the workshop themselves the

00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:50,970
scholars

00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:52,949
and they also coached the workshop

00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:54,690
themselves so what we did was I took

00:06:52,949 --> 00:06:56,400
some of the limits were comfortable with

00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:57,690
programming so a few weeks before the

00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,850
conference I took them and we went

00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:01,350
through the gamma Girls tutorial so we

00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:02,669
practiced it until they were confident

00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:04,169
enough to coach the others and then I

00:07:02,669 --> 00:07:07,520
didn't have to worry about finding

00:07:04,169 --> 00:07:12,300
courses for them during the conference

00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:15,830
so and then the following day was just a

00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:20,520
series of talks where we had the same

00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:22,740
the same scenario as we did in 2017 now

00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:25,260
I would like to share a couple of

00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:26,940
differences between organizing your

00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:29,040
conference for lenez and organizing a

00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:32,400
conference for adults because I've been

00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:33,750
in in both worlds and I would like to

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:37,200
share this experience with you in case

00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:40,110
you are looking into organizing this in

00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:42,600
your community okay now when you're

00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:45,389
organizing a conference for adults they

00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:47,340
have the money so all they do all you do

00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:48,419
is just open the tickets and take it

00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:51,270
ticket sales and then they buy the

00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:52,710
tickets isn't it now with kids they

00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:55,139
don't have money and they depend on the

00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:56,690
appearance and not all parents know

00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:58,979
their necessity of having events like

00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:01,050
conferences for the elena's so

00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:03,930
personally I have to write letters to

00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:05,729
each and every child's parent and tell

00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:07,500
them the importance of the conference

00:08:05,729 --> 00:08:10,620
while the kids should attend the

00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:12,060
conference and also somehow put in there

00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:13,560
that it's compulsory for the kids to buy

00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:17,099
the tickets because otherwise they won't

00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:18,750
buy it so and then you have to answer

00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:20,490
some calls to some parents if they call

00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:22,200
and say no why should we pay that much

00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:23,820
money or why should we pay anything at

00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:28,110
all for the conference and all of that

00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:29,880
and then there's also behavior now this

00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:31,410
point is very important because if you

00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,360
are thinking of organizing a conference

00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:35,520
for laners

00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:37,409
you need to be prepared for the behavior

00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:40,349
of the learners you see like for adults

00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:43,169
the environment is matured it's chilled

00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:45,779
and everyone is listening and focused in

00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:47,940
all of that right with kids they will

00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:49,650
get bored very fast they will start

00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:52,020
playing games they will start having

00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:54,480
chit chats in a while they are seated

00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:57,300
and they will move around and Tinka

00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,910
around anyway so if you organizing a

00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:01,770
conference for lenez you need to have a

00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:02,490
team of coaches to control every

00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:04,650
movement of the

00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:08,970
otherwise anything can go wrong anytime

00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:11,220
and you don't want that now the thing is

00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:14,310
what I've noticed is that as a teacher

00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:16,290
the way I treat the children in the way

00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:18,960
anyone else will treat the children who

00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:22,770
is not a teacher is different so with

00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:25,440
kids they do stuff and they will look

00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:27,600
for attention right so with anyone who's

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,060
not a teacher they would be polite with

00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,100
the kids but I'm telling you you have to

00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:33,660
be hard on them because they are just

00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:35,550
looking for attention and you need to be

00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:37,110
strong otherwise you can lose control

00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:39,590
during the whole conference and you

00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:43,320
don't want that

00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:45,560
okay different expectations so with the

00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:48,510
adult conference you see everyone

00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:50,940
basically most people know where they're

00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:52,740
at the conference they are most of you

00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:54,240
for example are software developers and

00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,800
you know why you are here you know the

00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,020
format of the conference and so forth

00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:00,030
with school kids there most of them have

00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:02,040
never been to a conference and for them

00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:04,290
they want to have fun and games and then

00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,580
for me for example the first time I

00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:08,430
organized the conference it was just a

00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:10,500
series of talks in no breaks not a lot

00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:12,330
like no I didn't have a lot of breaks

00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:15,210
and I didn't have a lot of fun things to

00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:17,010
do in between so the kids came in and

00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:18,000
they wanted to work with computers they

00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:19,410
thought they were going to work on

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,760
computers and they come they are sitting

00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:23,010
the whole day and listening to talks

00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:25,410
non-stop so they have different

00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:27,390
expectations perhaps maybe you can

00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:28,440
explain to them beforehand before the

00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:30,540
conference so that they know exactly

00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,100
what to expect instead of them coming

00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:34,310
and then getting bored because they had

00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:37,140
expected something different

00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:38,820
fun and games so if you are organizing a

00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:41,820
conference it would be nice to include

00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:43,620
one or two things that are fun I don't

00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:47,280
know what children would enjoy in your

00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:48,660
area maybe poets or maybe been thinking

00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:51,060
for maybe 5-10 minutes

00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:53,280
or dancing or whatever it is or maybe

00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:55,380
playing games outside of virtual reality

00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:57,750
some type of something just for them to

00:10:55,380 --> 00:11:00,060
have a break where they are distracted

00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:02,040
and they don't get bored during the

00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:06,960
course during the conference or during

00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:09,570
the day and also speakers now we speak

00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:11,970
us I had to choose the type of topics

00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:16,529
that I would or that I wanted the kids

00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:18,720
to to learn about and I also had to sell

00:11:16,529 --> 00:11:20,700
this because I had to headhunt the

00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,680
speakers because I wanted to have a

00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:26,730
conference where the the topics that

00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:28,920
were going to be discussed the way the

00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:30,540
kids could comprehend what the speakers

00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,670
were saying because you can have great

00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:34,560
talks but the kids are not familiar with

00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:35,880
most of the concepts that are used in

00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,430
computer science so they would not even

00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:40,320
comprehend what the speakers would be

00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:42,570
speaking about so I had to head on this

00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,880
because I had to also look at the talks

00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:46,560
beforehand to see that you know this is

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,630
easy enough for the kids to understand

00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:53,449
and so forth so if you're organizing a

00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:53,449
conference you cannot just open open

00:11:55,490 --> 00:12:04,440
what do you say open what proposal so

00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,269
you can just do that you have to hit

00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:08,670
hand they're the people let's say for

00:12:06,269 --> 00:12:10,740
example you want to run a talk on Kerry

00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:12,660
opportunities then you would find

00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:15,300
someone for that you wanna talk on

00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:18,180
networking you want to find someone for

00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:19,589
that and also sort of like go through

00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:21,360
their talk and make sure that it's not

00:12:19,589 --> 00:12:25,769
too technical for the kids to comprehend

00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:29,040
and things like that and then funding

00:12:25,769 --> 00:12:32,279
and when I organized computer day it was

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,899
something that no one knew about so no

00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:38,130
one was really interested in supporting

00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:41,940
the event and also the audience of the

00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:44,130
Alana's most companies don't find that

00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:46,620
is their customers so they are not

00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:49,290
interested in in investing in in an

00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:52,050
audience like that so fun finding for me

00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:55,800
was very very difficult I did not find

00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:57,449
any local sponsors until today but maybe

00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,040
in your community it will be a different

00:12:57,449 --> 00:13:01,230
scenario but funding is one thing that

00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:04,440
we struggled with with computer date and

00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:07,680
then decorations I cannot emphasize this

00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:10,290
enough because you see as beautiful as

00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:13,500
this venue is to us to the kids it's not

00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:15,420
that beautiful it needs to have collide

00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:17,190
which they have ballooned it needs to

00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:19,709
have all sorts of decorations so when

00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:21,779
you organizing yours don't be shy to put

00:13:19,709 --> 00:13:22,980
as many balloons and as many colorful

00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:26,829
stuff around your room as you can

00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:31,399
because these to them is boring

00:13:26,829 --> 00:13:33,320
okay now what is the importance of

00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:37,160
organizing a conference so how do the

00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:38,810
kids benefit from computer day now they

00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:41,300
get to apply the knowledge that they've

00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:44,630
learned into the classroom for example

00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:47,209
if you teach for example about robotics

00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:48,890
or something like that when kids do some

00:13:47,209 --> 00:13:50,930
research and they have some live

00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:52,640
presentations or whatever that they're

00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:54,920
presenting a computer day then the

00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:56,630
others get to actually say aha

00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:59,390
this is what miss openiy was saying in

00:13:56,630 --> 00:14:01,279
the classroom and so forth and then also

00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:03,529
they get to learn more than what they

00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:05,810
learned in a classroom if a great role

00:14:03,529 --> 00:14:08,390
for example is presenting on a concept

00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:11,420
that agreed it had never learned before

00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:13,430
then the great Atlanta is going to learn

00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:19,339
something even before they get to grade

00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:23,510
12 inspire computing career choices now

00:14:19,339 --> 00:14:25,220
for example if one Lena is special it up

00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:26,839
enough about computing or about

00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:28,700
programming and then they create a game

00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:30,620
and so forth and then they show this

00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:32,329
game at computer day then the other Lena

00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:34,339
is going to be like aha

00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:37,100
this is also doable by a lemma like me

00:14:34,339 --> 00:14:39,430
then maybe I can also take this patient

00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:42,500
or they take these paths and link up

00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:46,630
gaming and stuff so it does motivate or

00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:49,310
bring out like actual career

00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:50,930
opportunities that are existing in the

00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:58,370
community instead of just hearing about

00:14:50,930 --> 00:15:00,769
them passion and knowledge okay now if a

00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:03,199
lemma is for example preparing for a

00:15:00,769 --> 00:15:04,790
poster or for whatever it is that they

00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:06,649
want to present at the conference they

00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:08,480
have to do deep research they have to do

00:15:06,649 --> 00:15:10,160
research more than what they have learnt

00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,810
in a classroom or sometimes they are

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,160
researching on a new concept and they

00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:14,570
want to be confident enough to present

00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:17,240
to the others they have to do deep

00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:19,850
research and in in this sense they are

00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:23,000
going to learn or get deeper knowledge

00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:24,800
on that and then challenge themselves as

00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,019
well so like basically I have a

00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,550
programming team at their school now

00:15:27,019 --> 00:15:31,190
when you are learning programming just

00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:33,170
at a smaller scale it's different from

00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:34,940
when you are actually creating an

00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:37,520
application that will impress someone

00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:38,990
else for example right so for computer

00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,890
the computer day is an opportunity for

00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:41,930
learners to

00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:43,310
create applications that are going to be

00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:44,959
impressive to others because you can't

00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:46,730
just create anything floppy because you

00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,350
want to show off right so they were

00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:50,240
these forces them to create applications

00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:52,310
that are really running and that are

00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:55,220
lively and there are impressive to the

00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:58,790
others so in in that sense they get to

00:15:55,220 --> 00:16:01,220
challenge themselves okay now the big

00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:03,140
question is why why did we start

00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,649
organizing computer day in the first

00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:06,589
place

00:16:03,649 --> 00:16:10,010
now when I started teaching I started

00:16:06,589 --> 00:16:11,750
teaching Computer Studies in 2016 so I

00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:14,180
come to the school I'm supposed to teach

00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:16,550
kids about computer science I'm supposed

00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:19,940
to give them practical work and all of

00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:21,890
that but I'm teaching more than 250

00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:25,670
learners and there's no single computer

00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:28,000
at the school now why do I do

00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:31,130
how do I give these children practice

00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,200
how do I show them that this a world of

00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:35,810
computing of programming when they have

00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:39,079
nothing to see that order or to practice

00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:44,290
that on ok so this was a problem that I

00:16:39,079 --> 00:16:47,899
first faced when I started working now

00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:50,420
we I went through several solutions that

00:16:47,899 --> 00:16:53,360
were able to help me move forward during

00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:55,130
the time so what I would do is for

00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:58,880
example the first thing was that I knew

00:16:55,130 --> 00:17:00,709
about a programming competition that was

00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,110
coming up and I wanted the kids to

00:17:00,709 --> 00:17:04,760
participate I didn't expect them to win

00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:06,169
or anything like that I just wanted them

00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:09,740
to participate and get in that

00:17:06,169 --> 00:17:11,360
environment so but I needed computers

00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:13,760
again for them to practice for me to

00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:16,189
teach them on and so forth right now the

00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:19,400
fortunate thing is it

00:17:16,189 --> 00:17:20,929
picanha maybe a 2016 Pan Am Society

00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,540
which is the Python Namibia Society

00:17:20,929 --> 00:17:25,730
received a dress very price so I was

00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:28,400
able to get some screens and some

00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:32,799
keyboards and mouse and were able to

00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:35,030
practice on these little devices we also

00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,650
wrote letters to the universities

00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:38,360
locally and they were able to give us

00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:41,299
their lips during like weekends for

00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:43,190
example so we could go to the university

00:17:41,299 --> 00:17:47,059
and do some practice at the University

00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:48,800
or like it either during the weekend or

00:17:47,059 --> 00:17:52,820
sometimes also during the time when they

00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:56,159
are on holiday ok but

00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:58,140
you see this is this is not something

00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:58,500
that is going to solve a problem in a

00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:01,710
long

00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:03,720
Annelle in the long run right and not

00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:06,120
every teacher is willing to make these

00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:08,340
efforts to help the learners get access

00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:10,799
to computers or to even programming or

00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:13,799
anything like that what these kids need

00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:16,289
is more than what I can offer I can only

00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:18,539
offer this bit I can only keep them

00:18:16,289 --> 00:18:20,940
together I can only introduce them to

00:18:18,539 --> 00:18:22,380
computing at this smaller scale but if

00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:25,320
they can't practice on a continuous

00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:27,029
basis or if only the kids at my school

00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,230
are able to go to a university and start

00:18:27,029 --> 00:18:29,669
programming and no other teachers

00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:32,460
willing to do that then it's going to be

00:18:29,669 --> 00:18:34,770
a problem what the children need is a

00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:37,740
team of people who are going to make

00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:40,200
efforts to even at least sponsor a

00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:43,279
school or at least one school pay even

00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:45,600
with just fifteen to twenty computers

00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:48,090
because this is not a problem that I'm

00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,130
experiencing alone as a teacher at my

00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:52,200
school this is a problem that is being

00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:54,899
experienced within all government

00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:57,570
schools in my country and I don't have

00:18:54,899 --> 00:19:00,120
the resources to help them and of course

00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:02,820
what I'm doing now is not going to

00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:07,320
sustain a good or build a good computer

00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:09,870
science based in in my country or in my

00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:11,940
school or whatever so what we need is a

00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:14,220
team of people who are or partners who

00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:18,230
are willing to help at least one school

00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:21,270
per year with 15 to 20 computers

00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:25,620
sponsorship so that the kids or more

00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:27,750
than my kids have an opportunity to to

00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:29,730
have access to computers so the main

00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:31,470
reason why we organized computer day was

00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:34,289
because we wanted to do fundraising for

00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:36,120
the lack of computers at my school we

00:19:34,289 --> 00:19:38,760
are still doing fundraising after two

00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:41,909
years because we don't really have a lot

00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:43,740
of support and then after how many years

00:19:41,909 --> 00:19:45,690
is it going to be until we get to

00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:47,789
actually buy computers for this one

00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:49,169
school and then how are we going to

00:19:47,789 --> 00:19:51,679
solve this problem for all the other

00:19:49,169 --> 00:19:54,360
schools that are coming up because I

00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:57,480
cannot do anything I don't have the

00:19:54,360 --> 00:20:00,929
resources to do anything so I would I

00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:04,429
would I would wish for someone to to

00:20:00,929 --> 00:20:06,440
help me you know in coming up with

00:20:04,429 --> 00:20:09,409
Lucian's or talking to someone somewhere

00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:12,590
to assist even more than one school or

00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:14,269
at least one school pee with just 15

00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:16,580
computers or 20 computers or whatever

00:20:14,269 --> 00:20:20,049
the case may be a little bit of help

00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:27,399
will go a long way

00:20:20,049 --> 00:20:30,200
okay now this is all social media

00:20:27,399 --> 00:20:32,840
platform aims so when you go on Twitter

00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:35,960
you can find us a pen and skolas or

00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:38,179
python amoeba or Pike or Namibia they

00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:39,379
will you will see like what we do on a

00:20:38,179 --> 00:20:41,690
day to day basis

00:20:39,379 --> 00:20:45,139
see pictures of the things that we do on

00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:49,190
a day to day basis and I would like to

00:20:45,139 --> 00:20:53,389
thank the Python Software Foundation and

00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:57,320
jungle project for sponsoring computer

00:20:53,389 --> 00:20:59,090
day 2017 this way our only two sponsors

00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:01,820
and they were the only people who could

00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:03,529
make us have that day possibly anyway so

00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:05,149
I would like to thank them a lot for

00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:08,690
believing in us even though they know

00:21:05,149 --> 00:21:10,820
nothing about us and we had nothing to

00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:12,139
prove to them you know to say that this

00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:14,210
is really going to happen or this is

00:21:12,139 --> 00:21:15,919
really going to be beneficial but then

00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:17,720
again they trusted us and they give us

00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:21,320
some funding to make the whole thing

00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:24,740
possible in 2018 we got sponsorship

00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:27,200
again from PSF we got a sponsorship from

00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:29,840
Phaethon anyway an investor conversed

00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,999
agiza company in South Africa I don't

00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:34,820
know what got over their hearts to trust

00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:35,990
us with anything but then at least they

00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:38,509
give us something and I was very

00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:41,659
grateful for that sticker mule also

00:21:38,509 --> 00:21:44,809
sponsored us with matches and also wild

00:21:41,659 --> 00:21:48,019
fish I think not I think well fish is a

00:21:44,809 --> 00:21:50,649
uk-based company and again we are very

00:21:48,019 --> 00:21:55,629
grateful for the help that they gave us

00:21:50,649 --> 00:21:55,629
and then any questions

00:21:56,250 --> 00:22:05,940
[Applause]

00:22:06,229 --> 00:22:12,119
we have time for one or two questions I

00:22:09,629 --> 00:22:13,619
think so if you have some questions

00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:15,479
please step up we have two microphone

00:22:13,619 --> 00:22:24,059
three microphones and in the middle of

00:22:15,479 --> 00:22:27,389
the room look okay thanks so much for

00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:29,879
this wonderful talk and for sharing I

00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:33,960
feel that perhaps I'm a bit of a primary

00:22:29,879 --> 00:22:36,179
target for your experiences but I think

00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:38,669
there's also a lot of people who aren't

00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:41,249
here and today who could really benefit

00:22:38,669 --> 00:22:45,239
and I hope they're going to see the

00:22:41,249 --> 00:22:47,219
video and I hope maybe a guy called

00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:50,849
Ruben from a mezuzah University in

00:22:47,219 --> 00:22:53,369
Malawi is watching this right now I want

00:22:50,849 --> 00:22:55,320
to ask you what can someone do and for

00:22:53,369 --> 00:22:57,330
instance at a university in Africa to

00:22:55,320 --> 00:23:00,809
get started with a with a conference

00:22:57,330 --> 00:23:04,919
like this well where can they go who

00:23:00,809 --> 00:23:07,080
should they talk to okay so you're

00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:09,599
asking you what a university could do to

00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:12,440
organize a conference like this the best

00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:15,629
thing is to speak to school authorities

00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:18,629
speak to a school teacher who teaches

00:23:15,629 --> 00:23:20,629
Computer Studies so that they relate the

00:23:18,629 --> 00:23:23,129
message to the lenez in your absence

00:23:20,629 --> 00:23:24,719
you could also approach the schools

00:23:23,129 --> 00:23:26,009
directly because those are the people

00:23:24,719 --> 00:23:28,559
that you are targeting right you want

00:23:26,009 --> 00:23:30,539
the students so you want to go to them

00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:32,039
and talk to the principal talk to the

00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:32,580
computer studies teacher talk to the

00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:34,440
lenin's

00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:36,210
even for an hour or so and explain what

00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:38,429
your goal is and what you want to do and

00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:40,109
then you can start building a

00:23:38,429 --> 00:23:42,029
relationship and say okay fine

00:23:40,109 --> 00:23:43,769
when is your holiday when is the right

00:23:42,029 --> 00:23:45,809
time for us to organize something for

00:23:43,769 --> 00:23:48,029
the lenez or what do your learner's need

00:23:45,809 --> 00:23:50,669
then you can get them involved and say

00:23:48,029 --> 00:23:52,559
we want this we want that or we want

00:23:50,669 --> 00:23:55,440
workshops only we want talk so we want

00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:57,119
what then you can use that idea to build

00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,589
your conference I mean the format

00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:01,109
doesn't have to be like the one that we

00:23:58,589 --> 00:24:03,989
did it can be however you want to make

00:24:01,109 --> 00:24:06,089
it or however suitable for your area but

00:24:03,989 --> 00:24:08,389
I mean the best thing is to talk to the

00:24:06,089 --> 00:24:08,389
schools

00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:22,560
okay oh no one more Jessica thanks look

00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:25,110
what proportion of the school learners

00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:28,170
but also of the people who are helping

00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:30,660
you run these events actually have

00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:36,780
access to computers of their own at home

00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:41,820
for example I would say like uh trough

00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:45,180
let's say out of let's say maybe 20

00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:48,270
learners right you can have fallenness

00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:50,630
with computer either they borrowed from

00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:54,210
someone from their sister or brother or

00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:56,610
maybe their parent but for them but then

00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:59,670
again this is a situation even sometimes

00:24:56,610 --> 00:25:02,850
they can be six or so right but this is

00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:05,670
learner's that are in the city there are

00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:07,140
lots of learners who are not even able

00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:09,300
to have a computer at all

00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:12,180
so normally what we do in our in my

00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:13,650
instance is that whoever brings let's

00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:16,650
say we have we are twenty learners and

00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:18,180
we have four computers right we share so

00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:19,560
however many we are we are going to

00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:21,390
share those four computers within the

00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:23,490
groups and then we just switch for

00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:24,890
example program so we just switch who's

00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:27,900
going to be in search of the computer

00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:29,250
over time but then we make it work for

00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:33,210
those four computers that we have at the

00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:35,670
time when with what we did with computer

00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:37,050
day 2018 is that I asked the learners to

00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:39,180
bring computers those who could bring

00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:42,210
confidence and at the venue where we add

00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:44,370
a high art or I rented the computer lab

00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:46,560
so the jungle girls workshop moved to

00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:48,990
the lab and then I took computers from

00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:51,060
all the girls who had laptops and I took

00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:53,670
them to the team to the group that was

00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:56,040
doing a introduction to Python so they

00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:58,110
could share those computers there and

00:25:56,040 --> 00:26:02,240
then we would use the the lab computers

00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:02,240
at that time yeah

00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:08,150
thank you very much Jessica it was a

00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:17,389
really great talk we're going to take

00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:17,389
