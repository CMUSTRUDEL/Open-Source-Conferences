Title: DjangoCon 2018 - Keynote: Writing Code? Pfft... Evolve it Instead!
Publication date: 2018-05-23
Playlist: DjangoCon Europe 2018 in Heidelberg
Description: 
	https://media.ccc.de/v/hd-134-keynote-writing-code-pfft-evolve-it-instead-





We’re heading into a future of delivery drones, driverless cars and 3D-printed “hoverboards” …

With machines now able to perform many tasks better than humans, some people are going to be out of a job.

But not software developers, right?! Could a computer generate the code you currently write for a living?

In this talk, we’ll take a look at how technology is changing the work that people do, and think about the implications of that for our society. We'll then take a look at one of the many biologically inspired approaches to AI - Genetic Algorithms, and how they can be used to generate code given a description of the function that that code should perform, rather than having a software developer write it.

Spoiler - you’re probably not out of a job, yet…

so hi everyone thank you for coming

00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:16,150
I know it's first of the day I'm going

00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:18,730
to be talking about evolving code and

00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:20,349
more generally about how technology is

00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:22,119
changing the type of work we do and what

00:00:20,349 --> 00:00:26,110
their might mean for us both as

00:00:22,119 --> 00:00:28,060
individuals and as society at large so

00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:30,609
briefly then Who am I

00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:32,470
so known as Emma I am a senior software

00:00:30,609 --> 00:00:34,750
engineer and team lead company called

00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:37,840
CMR Surgical we're developing

00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:40,420
next-generation platform for surgical

00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:43,059
robotics trying to make keyhole surgery

00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:46,149
more universally accessible and

00:00:43,059 --> 00:00:47,200
available to all that's not actually to

00:00:46,149 --> 00:00:48,370
do with the talk although I'm going to

00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,420
talk about robots a lot and actually

00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:51,760
first gave this talk before I even

00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:55,360
started working here so where does this

00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:57,070
walk come from so there is a local

00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,600
developer group where I live called the

00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:00,640
Cambridge programmers study group when

00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,559
we meet up and we study topics in

00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,600
computer science together and a couple

00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,840
of years ago we were looking at machine

00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:10,270
learning and we saw a range of different

00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,800
techniques one of which was genetic

00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:14,410
algorithms which I'm going to talk about

00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:17,290
a little bit more in a bit but basically

00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:20,260
I ended up using these to involve some

00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:21,640
code so you provide a description of

00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:24,549
what you'd like your program to do and

00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:28,119
you go away and generate that code Robin

00:01:24,549 --> 00:01:30,040
have to have a human write it so that

00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:31,420
was really cool was most impressed to

00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:35,799
know how he achieved that it was awesome

00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:39,490
my second impression was ah what have I

00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:40,900
just done for my job security I like in

00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:43,180
living for writing software as I'm sure

00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:45,159
many of you do it allows me to do useful

00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,579
things like pay my rent or buy food to

00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:47,680
eat

00:01:45,579 --> 00:01:49,479
once again I mean for me if a computer

00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,869
can just go away and write that code and

00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:55,630
I'm not needed because if we think about

00:01:52,869 --> 00:01:57,700
it over the course of human history our

00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:59,170
lives have massively changed the type of

00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,939
work that we do has dressed to be

00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:04,000
changed through advancement technology

00:02:00,939 --> 00:02:05,950
so it used to be that most people worked

00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,380
in agriculture we were out in field

00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:10,149
sowing seeds harvesting crops it was a

00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:12,910
pretty full-time job to ensure that we

00:02:10,149 --> 00:02:16,560
all had enough food to eat but then we

00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:18,970
invented tools we increasingly automated

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,000
aspects of that work and eventually

00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:24,220
ended up with things like this now a

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,990
single human can go away and produce

00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:27,760
a vast amount of food not just for

00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:30,070
themselves and it frees the rest of us

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,300
up to specialize in other areas this is

00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:33,190
quite useful that means that some people

00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:37,090
can go and build bridges or be doctors

00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:38,650
and more recently though perhaps of the

00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:40,060
change in technology have been slightly

00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:43,630
more controversial in terms of

00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:46,960
displacing people from jobs so you used

00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:48,580
to say walk into a supermarket and there

00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,560
were people of checkouts or you went to

00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:53,320
an airport and the people check you in

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:57,910
now you're equally likely to walk in and

00:02:53,320 --> 00:03:00,160
see it see a line of these but you might

00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:02,260
think okay but that's quite sort of

00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,180
repetitive tasks so repeatedly scanning

00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:07,540
barcodes that sort of stuff I've sort of

00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:10,180
more in-depth involve skilled work that

00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,080
that won't be as easy to automate but

00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,760
actually what we're seeing is

00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:15,580
increasingly those sort of tasks for

00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:18,130
coming into the firing line as well so

00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:20,950
if we look back a few years then IBM

00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:23,560
created this this is Watson IBM

00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:25,690
supercomputer they originally created

00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,880
this to compete at a us quiz show called

00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:30,489
Jeopardy which if you haven't heard of

00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:33,190
it is sort of the inverse of a normal

00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:34,450
quiz so rather than asking people

00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:36,790
questions and it's bits in so the

00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:39,450
answers you tell them the answer and you

00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:42,220
ask them what was the question

00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:43,810
so to succeed at that you need to be

00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:45,820
able to do a few different things first

00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:47,709
of all you need to understand words I

00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,970
said to you you need to be able to

00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:51,340
understand they're not just individual

00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:52,780
words but they they go together to make

00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:55,360
a phrase or a sentence and be able to

00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:57,340
understand that put things in context

00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,040
you need to have some general knowledge

00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:02,410
to draw on to come up with what what the

00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:04,060
question might have been you need to be

00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:06,280
able to maybe make jumps between

00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:08,799
concepts or think laterally about things

00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,880
and it may be abstractly to you and

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,440
these are all the sorts of things that

00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,920
we might think that humans would be

00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:16,060
better at than a machine but sure enough

00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,100
IBM managed to get Watson to a level

00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:20,169
where it could not only successfully

00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:23,169
compete at jeopardy but it was beating

00:04:20,169 --> 00:04:25,450
not just humans but human champions and

00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:26,950
how they did that was a mixture of some

00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:28,750
natural language processing so that they

00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:32,800
it would understand the questions posed

00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:35,110
to it a huge database populated with a

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,760
vast amount of data parsed and

00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:38,950
collectively Internet

00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:40,510
some data mining so that they could

00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:43,720
efficiently get to the bits of

00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:45,010
information they wanted and answer

00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,900
machine learning it's sort of iterative

00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:48,450
lis training this which came up with

00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:51,480
better and better solutions until it was

00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:54,880
the finished product

00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:56,590
what makes Watson particularly

00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,570
interesting to me is not the fact that

00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:01,690
it was able to win a quiz show called

00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:03,520
jeopardy and because that sort of old

00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:05,680
news at this point we're used to seeing

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,650
a machine to speak humans at chess a

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,120
machine must be humans that go what

00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:11,440
makes this interesting to me is the

00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,630
applications that they've put it too

00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,450
since so there's lots of real-world

00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:17,890
problems where you've got a lot of data

00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:20,350
and you need to go and parse it to come

00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:23,440
up with some something that you're

00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:24,790
interested so one example of that and

00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,490
where Watson has been used its

00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:29,800
diagnostic medicine so there you have a

00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:31,900
huge volume of data you've got all of

00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,310
your existing medical knowledge so the

00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:35,050
kinds of things you might find in these

00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:38,560
massive medical textbooks that only

00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:40,030
cover the very basics and you've got new

00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,370
journal articles being published all the

00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:44,260
time or research papers new clinical

00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:47,170
start trials and studies being published

00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:48,790
all the time you have records for an

00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:50,530
individual patient their medical history

00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:53,500
perhaps the history of their immediate

00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:54,640
family or likely sort of statistical

00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,760
outcomes for people from a similar

00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:59,980
demographic group this is a huge amount

00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:02,350
of data that a human doctor can't

00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:04,720
possibly hope to keep up with at best

00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:06,580
maybe they read a journal paper or two a

00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,050
week alongside their job and they've

00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:11,080
certainly forgotten the one that they

00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:12,940
read ten years ago or is Watson and can

00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:15,850
keep up with this data and it does not

00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:18,040
forget things once it's learnt them and

00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:20,290
that means that it can potentially come

00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:22,300
up with a more accurate diagnosis

00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:24,490
particularly for a rare condition that a

00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:28,930
doctor may not let us in before in their

00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:30,580
career so doctors then highly secure

00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:32,290
professionals potentially at least some

00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:34,990
aspect of their work this now can do

00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:37,630
better and there are other areas as well

00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:41,440
so a legal work again huge volumes of

00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:44,430
data x in terms of law lots of documents

00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:48,280
relating to the individual or the case

00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:49,400
evidence from sort of previous previous

00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:52,030
cases and precedents to be

00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:54,440
set sort of loopholes to be analyzed

00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:55,970
preparing some case work for a trial or

00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,949
some legal advice to give to someone

00:06:55,970 --> 00:07:00,139
it's a very time-consuming process and

00:06:57,949 --> 00:07:02,389
that makes it quite expensive or is what

00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:04,639
IBM have been able to do with Watson is

00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:06,590
use it to provide a sort of legal advice

00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,780
as a service where Watson sitting there

00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:10,490
at the back end and you have an internet

00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:12,229
chat bot out front for the user to drap

00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:13,370
with and this has enabled people who

00:07:12,229 --> 00:07:16,160
otherwise wouldn't be able to afford

00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:19,220
legal advice to get some sort of quick

00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,720
advice on what they want and now that's

00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:22,370
probably not going to replace lawyers

00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,820
it's not gonna be that tailored to them

00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:29,449
but it's certainly doing some aspects of

00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:31,370
that job you might use it say in the

00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,900
classroom it with its natural language

00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:34,520
processing ability it can understand a

00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:36,260
question that a student ass and come

00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,400
back to the answer if you you're

00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:39,979
struggling to recruit enough teachers

00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:41,300
and this is a way of kind of improving

00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:43,160
that sort of teacher to student ratio

00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:48,050
and gave everyone more individual

00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:50,870
attention so doctors lawyers teachers

00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:54,199
and people we think of it's very highly

00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:56,180
skilled professionals then now with some

00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:58,250
at least some aspects of their job this

00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:03,729
could do as well if not better than them

00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:07,460
so what about software developers then

00:08:03,729 --> 00:08:09,979
what about what about our jobs so you

00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:11,330
might think well hopefully we're needed

00:08:09,979 --> 00:08:14,060
to write the code that this sort of

00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:15,320
technology eases so we're okay but as I

00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:18,380
was saying it's looking at ways in which

00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:23,330
you could generate that code rather than

00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:25,280
having to have a human right in so one

00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:29,060
approach you can take to that it's

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:31,460
genetic algorithms done so a genetic

00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:34,250
algorithm is a guided random search

00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:35,750
algorithm by which I mean as opposed to

00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:39,229
say a systematic search where you've got

00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:40,580
all your data in order and you not in a

00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:42,050
big line and you start at one end then

00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:43,789
you keep looking through until you find

00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:45,230
the thing you're looking for which will

00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:46,370
get there and it's simple to reason

00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:47,660
about but it might take an impossibly

00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:50,810
long time if you've got a large amount

00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:52,670
of data or a random search where you say

00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:55,970
I'm going to look over here is it there

00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:59,209
nope over here nope over there again

00:08:55,970 --> 00:09:01,400
still not there which which is what may

00:08:59,209 --> 00:09:02,380
have looking for a large data set but

00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:05,140
again

00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:07,480
I'm a guide and random search is you

00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:09,100
pick a random point to look at and then

00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:11,620
based on what you find there you decide

00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:13,420
way to look next so say I look over here

00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:15,190
and the thing I find looks nothing like

00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:17,140
what I'm looking for and I'm gonna go

00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:19,180
well let's try all the way over there

00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:21,190
instead or what's the thing I find here

00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:24,220
is quite close now I'll look I look in

00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:27,910
the vicinity and that only works with

00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:29,560
datasets that are in some way sorted so

00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:32,200
they're they're continuous at least

00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:34,960
around the points of interest so say

00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,820
you've got like a contour thing on a map

00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,710
where you've kind of got things that go

00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:40,600
like this and you can tell if you've got

00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:41,650
a point here that the points next to

00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,260
it'll be kind of similar you're not

00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:46,090
gonna have a sudden sudden jump and that

00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:49,510
allows you to infer things of what you

00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:51,720
found that what have been around it and

00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:53,740
in particular a genetic algorithm is a

00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,620
guided random search algorithm which

00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:58,390
takes inspiration from biology

00:09:55,620 --> 00:10:00,070
specifically from evolution where we

00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:02,590
have this idea of natural selection and

00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:05,770
survival of the fittest so if you've got

00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:07,960
some trait that makes you more likely to

00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:09,880
survive say you're quick at running away

00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:11,230
from Tigers or something like that then

00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,580
you're more likely to live long enough

00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:15,250
to pass on your genes to the next

00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:17,590
generation and therefore over time those

00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:19,240
sort of beneficial traits get selected

00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:22,840
for and become more prevalent in that

00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:28,360
population so how on earth does that

00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:31,300
relate to an algorithm then and so if we

00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:33,430
take an example of say evolving a string

00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:35,440
so not programs just yet just just a

00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:39,010
string say I want to get one that

00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,630
contains the title of this talk what I

00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:42,580
would do is I would first of all

00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:44,410
generate a whole population of random

00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:46,090
strings so all different lengths

00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:49,030
different characters just completely

00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:50,560
random strings then I'm gonna look

00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:52,000
through and evaluate those those

00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:55,660
individuals and assign them a fitness

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,190
score this point is where my analogy of

00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:59,230
evolution is somewhat completely gone

00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:00,880
out of the window because in nature

00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:03,490
there is no end goal in mind whereas

00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:06,100
here we are artificially constructing a

00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:07,660
fitness function to steer our algorithm

00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:11,350
to converge on the solution that we're

00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:13,210
looking for so say I might say well I'm

00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:14,650
gonna reward strings that are at the

00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:15,390
same length as well I'm looking for or

00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:18,060
similar

00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:21,450
that have the same characters to have

00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:23,550
those characters in the right places so

00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:25,140
we will we will score all of these

00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:27,000
individual strings with Fitness score

00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:29,910
and then we're going to select some to

00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,390
survive so naively simply something I

00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:32,190
can do

00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:33,360
and I put all of those strings in order

00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:34,650
of fitness and I'm just going to take

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,960
the top half I'm going to throw the

00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:38,850
other half away and say this top half is

00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:43,020
survive to reproduce the pass on their

00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:45,390
genes I then have a cross over step so

00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:46,530
this is analogous to getting half your

00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:49,110
chromosomes from each parent

00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:50,670
so again simplest thing we can do first

00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:52,620
off a one string second off the other

00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:55,380
second together

00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:57,090
we then have similarly to how you get

00:11:55,380 --> 00:12:00,030
new characteristics introduced into the

00:11:57,090 --> 00:12:02,190
gene pool by random mutations in genes

00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:04,410
we're going to have a sort of mutation

00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:06,150
step where for those child strings that

00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:08,130
we've created we're going to randomly

00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:12,240
pick a character and swap it out for a

00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:15,810
different one I'm then going to look at

00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:17,160
the population I've got and decide just

00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:20,160
this contain the string that I was

00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:21,660
looking for if so great I can stop if

00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,510
not I'm just gonna go back round I'm

00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:25,770
going to evaluate again continually to

00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:27,900
this kind of cross over step so

00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:30,650
generation after generation it evolved

00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:35,330
towards the thing that I'm looking for

00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:35,330
so let's give that go then

00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:46,760
so what we're gonna see when I run this

00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:48,860
is that for each generation we're going

00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:51,050
to print out some statistics about that

00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:53,540
generation so we're going to have the

00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:55,640
average fitness school the range of

00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:58,010
fitness schools that we've got I'm also

00:12:55,640 --> 00:13:01,040
going to print out the best ring that uh

00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:02,540
that I've got so far so to start with

00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,339
that's probably going to be a string of

00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:06,740
around about the right length because in

00:13:04,339 --> 00:13:08,270
a group of completely random strings

00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:12,650
something about the right length is

00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:14,870
probably our best bet so over time

00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:16,900
hopefully we'll get spaces in the right

00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:19,940
place see some features emerging

00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:23,950
characters lined up and we've got to our

00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:26,360
I'll talk title so that's well and good

00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:28,160
but to be honest involving strings isn't

00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,420
particularly interesting it would have

00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,610
been much quicker for me to just write

00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:33,020
that string down and indeed I had to do

00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:35,870
that in order to define the fitness

00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:45,950
function anyway so what about evolving

00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:48,490
programs and so code even more

00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:51,470
complicated than just strings

00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:53,000
particularly before I could just dump a

00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:54,920
load of random characters to make some

00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,480
random strings they might not have

00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,830
looked anything like the strings that I

00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,230
was trying to get to but they were still

00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:02,270
strings whereas if I just dumped a load

00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:03,830
of random characters into a file the

00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:06,529
odds that that's any kind of runnable

00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:08,120
code in Python or at C or any other

00:14:06,529 --> 00:14:10,900
language I want it's gonna be pretty

00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:13,490
slim there's all sorts of rules about

00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:16,100
structure and syntax and things that

00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:18,410
logically don't make any sense to do and

00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:22,279
so how am I gonna how am I gonna

00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:25,310
generate valid programs so you might say

00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:27,350
well okay let's do something with

00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:29,720
templates I'm gonna make a block that

00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:31,279
looks so like a for loop and it's gonna

00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,290
like fill in the blanks for the variable

00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:34,910
it's and I'll make another block that

00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:37,040
looks like an if statement

00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:38,839
similarly fill in the blanks and I'll

00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:42,080
let people randomly sort of mix these

00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:44,420
blocks that stick together and fair

00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:46,580
enough you will generate some valid

00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:48,200
start programs with that but when you

00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:50,300
start to the crossover steps the

00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,589
mutation steps you're very quickly going

00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:53,500
to get to something that's no longer

00:14:51,589 --> 00:14:55,820
valid and won't run

00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:59,120
so you okay

00:14:55,820 --> 00:15:00,920
let's I don't I'll make my own language

00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,210
it's gonna consist of really just some

00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:05,230
simple symbols and you'll be allowed to

00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:07,760
combine them in any order that you like

00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:10,370
what's probably gonna happen there is

00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:12,200
you're gonna unintentionally limit what

00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:14,180
it is that you can write in that

00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:16,430
language so we want to be able to evolve

00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:18,830
code that could do anything we could

00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:21,320
theoretically write some code ourselves

00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:23,630
to do so in order for that to be the

00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:25,640
case we need the language that we are

00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:29,030
evolving the code in to be something

00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:34,490
called sure incomplete so briefly what

00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:36,710
do I mean by that so Alan Turing very

00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:39,530
famous a physician a computer scientist

00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:41,930
he did a lot of work on the fear of

00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:44,690
computation and in particular on the

00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:46,010
idea of reprogramming machines so you

00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:48,050
don't just program it once and then it

00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:50,960
always does that thing you can reprogram

00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:53,210
it and have it doing something else and

00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:55,340
he have a mathematical model to help him

00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:58,070
reason about that and that model is

00:15:55,340 --> 00:16:00,800
called a Turing machine and here we have

00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:02,510
a sort of mechanical build one and what

00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,910
this is is that's an infinitely long

00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:07,910
piece of tape divided up into a series

00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:09,440
of cells and you have an arrow which

00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:12,860
points at the cell that you're currently

00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:15,170
looking at and in that cell you can put

00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:16,850
a symbol in you can read out the value

00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:19,370
of the symbol or you can change the

00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:21,380
symbol in that cell you can also move

00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:23,900
your arrow up and down the tape to point

00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:26,750
at a different cell valley that is it

00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:29,690
that's the entire machine and yet you

00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:32,000
can show mathematically that anything

00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:33,800
that is possible to compute and not

00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,510
everything is there are some problems in

00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:38,210
computer science like halting problem

00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:42,530
but if it's possible to compute you can

00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:44,600
do so on this machine and when we say a

00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:46,130
languages Turing complete it just means

00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,590
that it can be used to simulate one of

00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:50,870
these machines which means if it can use

00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:52,430
to simulate a machine which can compute

00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:54,140
anything that's computable then you can

00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:56,300
write code in that language to do

00:16:54,140 --> 00:17:00,050
anything you like if it's theoretically

00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:01,820
possible that it can be done so those

00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:02,680
are our requirements then we need an

00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:05,190
incredibly

00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:09,570
syntactically simple language

00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:18,630
yet which is story completely so what is

00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:21,210
that language so at this point I thought

00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:21,510
well that might already be a solved

00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:23,970
problem

00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:25,440
I'm software developer so therefore I'll

00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:29,490
google it rather than reinventing the

00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:31,800
wheel and I found this time this is

00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:33,630
Corey Becker site primary objects comm

00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,730
it contains a load of really interesting

00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:38,490
blog posts and articles on various

00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:39,780
machine learning topics highly recommend

00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:43,440
it if that's the sort of finger rich

00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:47,430
didn't and she had in fact looked at

00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:50,880
exactly this problem i evolving code to

00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:53,010
fulfill and some seven lead and she'd

00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,470
identified which is a great language to

00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:57,990
use for them and this language has only

00:17:55,470 --> 00:18:02,520
eight characters and it's pretty much

00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:04,470
just a model of a Turing machine now in

00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:08,070
the interests of not repeatedly swearing

00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:10,970
at you for the rest of the talk which

00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:13,140
may happen I'm sorry fax Talebi I have

00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:14,790
abbreviated the name or as matter

00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:18,120
textbooks like to say left it as an

00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:21,720
exercise for the reader so brain s then

00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:24,780
as well call it so this is just a Turing

00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:27,450
machine pretty much so we have the first

00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:30,030
six symbols I'm mainly involved with

00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:32,580
that so you've got moving the pointer

00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:35,370
left and right you've got the plus and

00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:38,010
minus to change the value it's in the

00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:40,230
current cell and then the dot on the

00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:43,590
comma to do with outputting and

00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:45,510
inputting symbols from that cell where

00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:47,340
it gets interesting and where the

00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:50,640
language gets its power and its control

00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:52,440
flow are these square brackets so this

00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,220
is what allows us to look in the value

00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:57,780
at a cell and decide what to do next

00:18:55,220 --> 00:19:00,750
so this allows us to go back and loop

00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:02,130
around again or to continue on these are

00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:04,560
also the only parts of the language of

00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:06,390
any kind of syntax requirement so in the

00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,860
normal way that brackets need to match

00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:10,800
up so you need to start with the opening

00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:13,260
one and then end with the closing one we

00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,940
have that requirement on syntax that's

00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:16,820
the only syntax requirement uh than that

00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:19,850
you can't just

00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:23,210
dump random characters so what does a

00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:24,770
program in brain F look like then so

00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:27,800
this is your standard introductory

00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:33,470
program in most languages output hello

00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:35,630
world to the screen yeah as you can see

00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:38,060
this is quite a nice enteric language um

00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:40,730
I don't know about you but I don't want

00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:44,570
to write code in this I certainly don't

00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:47,150
want to debug code written in this but

00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:50,180
to a computer this is just as

00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:52,550
intelligible as code in Python or or

00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:55,220
whatever language you like and to us

00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:57,020
this is just a string of characters and

00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:59,030
we've already looked at how we might go

00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:00,530
and generate random strings of

00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:02,420
characters how we might cross them over

00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:04,790
to the mutation so we already have

00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:09,830
technique so we can reuse so actually

00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:14,270
this is great so let's try then and

00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:16,160
evolve some code run in brain F to the

00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:17,420
wonder of random demos this is going to

00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:20,780
be slightly hair-raising but we'll give

00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:23,980
it yeah so what are we going to try and

00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:26,420
evolve so I was going to do hello world

00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:27,710
but I realized that making you will sit

00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:30,200
there and watch that converge was

00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:34,520
perhaps a little cruel so I've gone with

00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:37,250
slightly abbreviated hi and we're gonna

00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:38,450
have some new problems here and we

00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:41,810
didn't have when we did the string

00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:44,600
evolution so it's possible to have an

00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:46,040
invalid program so said very few syntax

00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,990
requirements for NF just the square

00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:50,750
brackets but it's still still possible

00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:52,490
to mess it up and we might have a

00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,960
perfectly valid program which just never

00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:56,150
terminates perhaps it contains an

00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:58,010
infinite loop so we're gonna have to

00:20:56,150 --> 00:21:00,380
define some cutoff period after which we

00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:02,180
go yep probably not gonna terminate

00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:05,240
let's call that a day and try that one

00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:06,650
out the other thing that might happen is

00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,630
that the real world isn't actually like

00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:10,130
perfect theoretical mathematical models

00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:11,780
we don't have an infinitely long piece

00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:13,490
of tape our computer that we're running

00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:15,500
the program on has a finite amount of

00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:17,600
memory and we might get off the end of

00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:19,460
it so again we're gonna need to spot

00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,740
that error and for all of those things

00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:23,480
what we're going to do is assign that

00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:25,070
individual a very low Fitness score so

00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:26,000
that we can try and as quickly as

00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:28,400
possible

00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,350
weed out things just don't run and get

00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,330
to if not the program we

00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:42,019
at least something that runs and we can

00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:44,929
start evolving so so what we're going to

00:21:42,019 --> 00:21:46,519
see this time when I run this is that

00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:49,279
for each generation we're again going to

00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:51,350
print out the average fitness school the

00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:53,870
range of fitness schools and I'm going

00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:56,090
to print out the brain earth code of the

00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:58,970
individual that's currently got the

00:21:56,090 --> 00:22:01,460
highest fitness additionally I'm going

00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:05,210
to print out the output of all the

00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:10,460
programs in that generation see what

00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:12,860
happens so quickly we get to things that

00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:14,000
are producing output and you see we're

00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:17,509
actually reasonably close

00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,399
most of these are character outputs and

00:22:17,509 --> 00:22:24,500
we're even starting to get some of the

00:22:19,399 --> 00:22:26,419
letters lined up it's probably going to

00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:28,429
take quite a lot longer to get to where

00:22:26,419 --> 00:22:31,009
we want and why is that given that we

00:22:28,429 --> 00:22:33,679
got so close so quickly and so the key

00:22:31,009 --> 00:22:35,299
thing here is that no longer as we have

00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,649
with a string evolution a thing that

00:22:35,299 --> 00:22:39,610
we're evolving and the thing that we're

00:22:36,649 --> 00:22:42,169
Fitness going are one and the same now

00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:44,059
we're evolving the brain F code but

00:22:42,169 --> 00:22:45,409
we're scoring the Fitness the output so

00:22:44,059 --> 00:22:47,690
you might have output there's only one

00:22:45,409 --> 00:22:49,129
character off but maybe your code is

00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:50,990
stuck in some really awkward loop that's

00:22:49,129 --> 00:22:52,429
really difficult to get out of and any

00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:54,950
mutation that gets it out of that

00:22:52,429 --> 00:22:57,409
initially produces worse output and so

00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:59,990
it's going to be selected out so to

00:22:57,409 --> 00:23:02,559
counter that we're going to need to

00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:05,929
change how we're how our own works a bit

00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:08,299
so for instance in the mutation step we

00:23:05,929 --> 00:23:10,309
need to have ability to make bigger

00:23:08,299 --> 00:23:12,259
jumps bigger mutations so instead of

00:23:10,309 --> 00:23:13,730
just replacing a single character we

00:23:12,259 --> 00:23:15,169
might say go over the whole string and

00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:18,230
have some probability of replacing each

00:23:15,169 --> 00:23:21,259
one we might add other mutation types so

00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:22,820
in certain characters deleting them for

00:23:21,259 --> 00:23:25,700
our selection if we just take the top

00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:27,559
half actually that's a bit too elitist

00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,669
we're going to really quickly dive

00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:31,669
towards something that looks promising

00:23:28,669 --> 00:23:33,769
to start ignoring something going off in

00:23:31,669 --> 00:23:35,179
that direction which looks worse now but

00:23:33,769 --> 00:23:37,820
actually is heading towards the actual

00:23:35,179 --> 00:23:38,720
solution so we're going to change to

00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:39,299
something called roulette wheel

00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,090
selection

00:23:39,299 --> 00:23:44,159
well basically how big a circle divided

00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:46,259
into a wedge for each of the individuals

00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,700
in population that wedge is going to be

00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:49,169
bigger if the individual has a higher

00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:51,239
fitness score and then we're going to

00:23:49,169 --> 00:23:53,639
spin a spinner on it and it's going to

00:23:51,239 --> 00:23:55,679
land probably more likely to land on a

00:23:53,639 --> 00:23:57,210
an individual - nurse and so they're

00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,980
more likely to make it through but

00:23:57,210 --> 00:24:03,539
there's still some chance of the others

00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:07,700
getting in as well nonetheless it's

00:24:03,539 --> 00:24:10,139
gonna take a while yep

00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:12,720
you're probably gonna notice some things

00:24:10,139 --> 00:24:14,700
as well like it just does things that

00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,840
you wouldn't human wouldn't like you've

00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:17,940
got situations where you've got a load

00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:20,179
of pluses followed by a load of minuses

00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:24,210
and they just cancel each other out so

00:24:20,179 --> 00:24:26,489
why would you bother doing that you

00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:28,470
might also be thinking that my goodness

00:24:26,489 --> 00:24:29,909
this is taking a long time and frankly I

00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:32,159
write more interesting code for a living

00:24:29,909 --> 00:24:38,149
them things that's just right hi I think

00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:38,149
my jobs probably quite safe maybe not

00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:44,060
but you can be more interesting things

00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,420
in this so I mean I was just sings for

00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:47,270
fun

00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:49,000
so I basically stopped here but Cory who

00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:51,080
I mentioned earlier she went on and

00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,730
revolved programs that have things like

00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:54,290
take user inputs and then add those

00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:56,120
numbers together or generate the

00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:58,100
Fibonacci numbers which I was pretty

00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:00,530
impressed by um you could also take over

00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:02,720
approaches so this is involving the the

00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:04,220
program code as a string you can take

00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,470
the app set syntax tree and involve that

00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:07,880
or you could say well actually Emma you

00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:09,290
only used in ethic algorithms because

00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:11,000
you happen to be studying out in time

00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:14,930
let's try a new your network instead

00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:17,480
things like that but you still wait to

00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:20,720
me anyway looks like right now at least

00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:22,960
the next few years I may be okay so what

00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:25,730
are the sort of projections then for

00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:29,080
likelihood software development of that

00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:32,300
sort of job will be replaced by machines

00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:36,110
so there are a few predictions being

00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:40,460
made one site which capture some of that

00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:43,820
data is will robots take my job calm so

00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:46,280
it's quite a fun site it's based off

00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:49,010
some paper that was published in 2013

00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:51,290
which made some predictions about for

00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:53,540
various different professions what the

00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:57,860
odds were that those would be automated

00:25:53,540 --> 00:26:00,110
and replaced by robots by 2024 so the

00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:01,550
first thing to know is that 2015 is five

00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:04,130
years ago which is quite a long time in

00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:07,300
tech terms and also other projections

00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:10,040
we've made since they have differing

00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:12,170
sort of predictions depending on what

00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:13,970
how they decide to break down the jobs

00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:15,950
how they define them what sort of if

00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:18,380
they can see the whole jobs or all the

00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:20,980
tasks that maker jumps up and on what

00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:23,990
kind of underlying assumptions they make

00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:25,970
in 2024 we can go and see which one was

00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:27,220
better for now and what we'll just use

00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:30,470
this one

00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:33,670
so what happens if I put some tech jobs

00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:35,900
into this computer programmer

00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:40,630
forty-eight percent chance of automation

00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:44,570
by 2024 start worrying now whereas

00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:46,280
software developer totally safe four

00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:48,260
point two percent and something about

00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:51,500
the phrase totally safe which alarms me

00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:53,330
far more than start worrying but sir and

00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:55,250
so what why is that

00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:57,560
why why are they come out with such

00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:59,930
different numbers and so we go back and

00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:00,500
look at what definitions they used for

00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:03,860
these jobs

00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:05,810
that might help us have to see why so

00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:08,120
computer programmers then according to

00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:10,910
this the definition they used they

00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:13,460
create modify and test code that allow

00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:15,650
computer applications to run they work

00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:17,630
from specifications drawn up by software

00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:20,060
developers and they may assist sort

00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:24,710
developers analyzing user needs and

00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:25,940
designing the software so basically that

00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:27,620
they're doing not something not too

00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:29,120
dissimilar form we just looked at so

00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:30,650
they're given a requirement

00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,360
specification by someone else and

00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:35,480
they're told I need the code to do this

00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:37,220
go away and generate it so you can see

00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:39,680
that might have a slightly higher chance

00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:43,670
of automation and say software

00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:46,430
developers which is defined as develop

00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:49,700
create and modify general computer

00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:52,070
applications and the lies user needs and

00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:55,550
develop software solutions design

00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:58,700
software for client use at with the aim

00:27:55,550 --> 00:28:00,620
of optimizing efficiency makes

00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:02,300
supervised computer programmers and they

00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:04,130
work individually or coordinating with

00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:06,380
others so we've got fastened there which

00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:08,960
we can see why maybe there's less risk

00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:10,550
of automation right now so working with

00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,590
the people and interacting with users

00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:15,260
defining those requirements Star web and

00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:17,300
the design so a bit of insight into why

00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:19,790
the numbers are different and so it

00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:22,040
really depends the odds this site gives

00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:26,300
for a job being automated sort of what

00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:29,750
tasks that job it's composed of and what

00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:35,030
makes a particular task say easy or hard

00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:39,950
to automate so things that are very

00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:42,140
repeatable easier to automate so clocks

00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:44,180
for instance have been sort of chiming

00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:45,530
on the hour and without someone going up

00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:47,240
and hitting about with a hammer for

00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:50,690
quite some time now that sort of thing

00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:52,910
is quite easy to automate um where is

00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:55,790
something more varied and unpredictable

00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:59,120
there's much harder so saying we were to

00:28:55,790 --> 00:29:00,950
look at self-driving cars and if we

00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:03,080
wanted to talk about potential for job

00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:04,880
loss then self-driving cars is probably

00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,680
what we should be talking about because

00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,060
if

00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:09,550
the number of people that involved in

00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:10,900
driving vehicles and various forms that

00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:13,860
could potentially be completely replaced

00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:16,180
like all aspects of their job by those

00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:18,340
but we're not quite there yet

00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:20,800
and the reason is it's very different to

00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:22,960
say have your self-driving car and your

00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:24,160
test site a small area which you've got

00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,800
perfectly mapped out

00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:28,950
you understand the rant over people

00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:30,940
using that area of other vehicles to

00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:32,890
make that work

00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:35,500
I'm and people have done that and we

00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:38,530
have the reports which are mainly

00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:40,480
automated now and have yourself driving

00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:42,550
cranes lifting things off ships and then

00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,990
put it onto a self-driving glory but

00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:45,460
it's because that port is closed to the

00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:47,800
outside world they know exactly the

00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:50,860
route map there's never any other people

00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:53,950
around or any other vehicles whereas the

00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:56,380
real world roads you might have an

00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:58,510
announced version that day some

00:29:56,380 --> 00:30:01,600
temporary roadworks you can have

00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:03,070
changing weather conditions you have you

00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,510
know the standard thing of a football

00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:06,910
goes into the road and the kid runs out

00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:10,540
after it you have other drivers doing

00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:12,160
potentially unpredictable things your

00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:13,810
routes may not actually bear any

00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:16,660
resemblance to what the Sat Nav says it

00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:19,720
is and this is all much harder to deal

00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:22,420
with other things that are hard sauce

00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:24,220
made involve things which say have an

00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:25,900
element of human interaction so job that

00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:29,500
require empathizing with someone and

00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:32,260
harder for a machine to do things that

00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:33,730
involve creativity so this is where at

00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:35,770
the moment we quite like to think of

00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:37,080
ourselves as quite separated from

00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:41,290
machines kind of people like to say well

00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:44,530
humans can compose sonnets or painted up

00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:45,700
masterpieces of art I hope that's not

00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:47,970
the only distinction we're making

00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:52,480
because I can't do any of those things

00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:55,710
but we have some advantage in that area

00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:58,090
for now computers are making inroads so

00:30:55,710 --> 00:31:00,910
they have started composing the first

00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:03,480
original pieces of music painting first

00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:05,860
bits of original artwork but for now

00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:09,730
creative tasks are somewhat harder to

00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:12,820
automate so what's key then to the

00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:13,300
whether a job will be replaced by

00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:15,700
machines

00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:17,140
is sort of what composition of tasks has

00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,990
how many of them are easy to automate

00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:20,790
versus

00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:22,290
if all of the tasks involved in that job

00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:24,750
easy to automate then it can be fully

00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:26,610
replaced by machine if only some of them

00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:28,320
are then you're in a sort of partial

00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:29,430
replacement scenario where you're more

00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,320
likely to end up working alongside

00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:36,150
machines so perhaps the nature of the

00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:37,470
work you do changes so looking back then

00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:39,930
historically how many jobs have we

00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:43,020
previously sinned completely replaced by

00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:45,770
machines so if you go and look at the

00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:48,960
1950 US census the data where people say

00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:50,100
reported what jobs they did you see

00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,010
there are a number of professions which

00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:54,240
don't exist

00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:56,610
most of these are due to things like

00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,110
technology becoming obsolete so we don't

00:31:56,610 --> 00:32:00,630
need telegraph operators anymore for

00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:03,390
example some of them are just demand

00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:05,760
just isn't there anymore so who needs a

00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:08,640
boardinghouse keeper these days but

00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:12,270
there was one job which had been

00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:13,320
replaced but because of automation so

00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:15,540
I'll give you a minute I'll have a drink

00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:17,780
see if you can think what you reckon it

00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:17,780
might be

00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:31,090
so graduations if you guess correctly it

00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:34,210
is elevator operators so you used to

00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:35,950
have a manual lever that you had to pull

00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:37,480
to put the brakes on and it's quite a

00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:39,550
skilled thing actually you need to make

00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:41,260
the lift stopped at the right floor and

00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:45,130
line up exactly otherwise you can only

00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:46,720
get half out we just don't have a need

00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:49,240
for this anymore we've just automated

00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:51,070
lifts that's not quite true this as a

00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:52,780
couple skyscrapers less than New York

00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:55,300
with these I think more as a tourist

00:32:52,780 --> 00:33:02,200
attraction but basically this job just

00:32:55,300 --> 00:33:05,770
doesn't exist anymore and it's not a new

00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:07,960
concern I guess thinking about jobs

00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:09,760
being replaced by technology and and we

00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:11,560
maybe want to look back through history

00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:13,780
and see previous examples to see if we

00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:16,300
can kind of extrapolate to see whether

00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:17,800
we think the rate at which jobs being

00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:20,890
replaced by machines completely might

00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:25,980
increase or stay the same what previous

00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:28,900
examples have we had so this is a

00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:30,520
machine for automating a production of

00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:32,650
cloth so a kind of weaving missing

00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:34,420
machine this is quite a modern example

00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:37,870
so you see this electric lighting in the

00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:40,840
picture but the very first one of these

00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:43,300
its predecessor was created nearly 500

00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:45,910
years ago now by a man named William Lee

00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:50,620
who went to Queen Elizabeth the first

00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:51,490
and Astro patent and she she had made

00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:53,080
the concerns that people are talking

00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:55,870
about these days so she said no to that

00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:58,660
pattern he said it will deprive people

00:33:55,870 --> 00:34:00,430
of work and replace them I want those

00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:03,820
people to have a job and be able to

00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:05,050
afford things like food um but not

00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:07,420
having a patent obviously doesn't stop

00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:09,520
you from deploying this technology only

00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:11,770
do they did and it was made its way into

00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,720
a number of factories and actually that

00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:15,790
concern about losing jobs it didn't

00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:17,790
quite play out that way at least to

00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:21,430
start with so what ended up happening

00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:23,920
was they increased drastically the

00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:25,330
amount of fabric that one individual

00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:27,280
worker could produce because now they

00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:30,040
were using this machine and because of

00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:31,960
that the cost of it decreased demand

00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:33,250
increased and it kind of balanced out

00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:34,550
with the fact that each person was

00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:35,600
producing more and

00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:38,750
the number of jobs was actually

00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:42,860
maintained that's not to say it wasn't

00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:46,429
controversial however it did have

00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:48,800
negative effects so you now could use

00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:50,090
these machines with less skill than was

00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:53,720
required to make these materials before

00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:56,570
and because of that wages were hit like

00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:59,120
wages decrease for people and without

00:34:56,570 --> 00:35:01,400
sort of unions back there before to to

00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:03,350
go to to kind of count this that there

00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:06,080
were riots you may have heard of the

00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:07,730
Luddites I think they've got a slightly

00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:11,030
unfair reputation in history as they've

00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:12,770
gone down as completely opposed to any

00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:15,590
new technology that's what they actually

00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:18,890
wanted with some regulations around its

00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:21,470
use they wanted requirements on unfair

00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:22,850
wages for the operators on on people

00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:24,200
having to an apprenticeship before they

00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:26,780
were deemed as skilled enough to operate

00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:33,230
it in order to counter the effects on

00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:35,840
the wages that they were seeing so it's

00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:38,240
not a new topic concern there this kind

00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:40,370
of one effect will technology have what

00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,900
might the outcome to that be and and

00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:43,100
there's a wide range of different

00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:44,810
predictions and projections at the

00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:46,940
moment which I'd like to talk about a

00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:49,160
bit but I should say at this point the

00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:51,800
talk stops being kind of mini factual

00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:53,000
and starts being mainly a mixture a

00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:55,220
different predictions projections

00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,310
opinions and that sort of thing so I'm

00:35:55,220 --> 00:36:00,230
important to draw the distinction I'm

00:35:58,310 --> 00:36:02,480
going to attempt to prevent a sort of

00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:03,770
balanced view overview of those and

00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,960
probably it's been like to ask you more

00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:06,920
questions than I answer because I think

00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:10,640
it's important that we all start

00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:12,770
thinking about this whole thing and so

00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:14,860
what are then some positive and negative

00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:19,190
outlooks that people have on automation

00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:21,290
so the top two here kind of echo what

00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:22,700
was just in the previous example with

00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:24,560
the low lights in these weaving machines

00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:26,210
some people argue well actually

00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:29,300
automation is good because it will

00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:30,770
increase productivity decrease costs

00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:31,940
increase demand and actually you won't

00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:33,950
lose any jobs because of how that

00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:36,140
balances out a lot of people will go

00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:37,930
we'll look we've seen that before and it

00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:41,810
depresses wages so it's still a problem

00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:43,730
and actually the the argument of how

00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:47,180
maintaining jobs due to this economic

00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:48,240
balance only holds if you partially

00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:50,850
replace

00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:53,040
some tasks for that job if you can work

00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:54,780
alongside machines to do your work more

00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:57,360
efficiently then that can be true if

00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:59,280
you're completely replaced then you're

00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:02,790
in your bottom scenario of just mass

00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:05,730
unemployment as might happen if we have

00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:07,340
completely autonomous vehicles and what

00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:11,450
some people say well you will lose jobs

00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:13,920
but new jobs will be created for example

00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:16,680
probably none of us have grandparents

00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:18,330
that were data scientists this one's

00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:21,360
quite hard to reason about because just

00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:22,800
trying to think about things which by

00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:24,900
their definition don't exist yet it's

00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:30,120
quite difficult but the new job types

00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:32,090
will certainly come about but what might

00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:34,440
happen is the people that lose their

00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:36,120
jobs aren't necessarily going to be the

00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:38,340
ones that can pick those jobs up so

00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:41,400
there's a bit of skills gap retraining

00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:42,720
needed how do you how do you deal with

00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:45,000
that

00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:48,360
and this may cause some growing

00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,980
inequality so if you've got some people

00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:51,270
being put out of jobs or are lower wages

00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:52,950
and you've got other people that have

00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:54,480
happens to be the lucky ones to have the

00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:56,370
skills for the new jobs appearing and

00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,020
can demand quite a high wage for their

00:37:56,370 --> 00:38:01,470
services you're gonna have a growing gap

00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:02,820
appearing in society another thing that

00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:04,080
you might think about it we'll hang on

00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:07,020
we've got we've got quite an aging

00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:10,140
population at the moment how are we

00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:11,460
going to help to provide the sort of

00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:12,900
continued level of health care that we

00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:13,260
enjoy at the moment how are we gonna pay

00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:15,450
for that

00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:17,670
maybe automation can help boost

00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:18,810
productivity and help increase the

00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:20,640
amount it can all make a contribution

00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:24,810
for me to work it may be that that'll

00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:27,770
help us so yeah a lot of potential

00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:29,760
different upsize downsides ranging from

00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:33,030
extremes of it's going to be an amazing

00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:34,670
utopia where no one needs to work and

00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:38,190
we'll all enjoy lots of free time to

00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:39,480
robot apocalypse most people sit

00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:40,830
somewhere in-between of there'll be a

00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:45,090
mix of these things all happening at

00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:47,970
once so how do we Astarte react to some

00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:51,870
of these challenges then we're going to

00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:53,370
need to do something there's some things

00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:54,600
we might want to consider so Universal

00:38:53,370 --> 00:38:57,080
income has been something that's been

00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:59,520
talked about for a while perhaps gaining

00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:01,650
more traction recently we've had a

00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:03,840
recent referendum in Switzerland that

00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:07,110
was rejected there was a trial in

00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:08,760
Finland of how this might work are we

00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:11,640
going to need to change our education

00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:13,590
model we've got kids starting school now

00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:15,120
who by the time they leave school the

00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:16,710
jobs we currently have might exist

00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:18,540
anymore they might need to know how to

00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:19,920
do new jobs which we don't even know

00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:22,950
what they are and what skills they

00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:25,200
require and how do we make education

00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:26,820
more lifelong do we need to provide more

00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,530
opportunities for retraining if people

00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:31,620
might have to change lots of jobs in

00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:33,120
their lifetime another suggestion that

00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:35,370
was put out there and I think by Bill

00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:37,050
Gates was well in the same way that you

00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:39,030
have income tax at the moment perhaps we

00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:41,160
could charge companies a tax on robot

00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:43,080
productivity to help pay for some of the

00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:44,970
sort of ideas higher up this list

00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:46,380
there's probably other things that we

00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:49,200
might consider that aren't on earth list

00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:51,810
and how how those would work is in the

00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:54,840
Newton question so I'm at the moment

00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:56,730
most people kind of we need to work so

00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:59,640
some people argue their fortune have

00:39:56,730 --> 00:40:00,810
Universal income yet but then in the in

00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:03,120
the future maybe we get to a point we

00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:04,560
definitely to happen what happens in the

00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:07,260
transition period between those two

00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:08,540
points how on earth will we make that

00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:10,470
work

00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:11,850
there are other questions as well this

00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:13,920
moral and legal issue so we've seen

00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:16,430
recently a lot in the news about privacy

00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:18,720
concerns as kind of increasing use of

00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:20,760
data collection artificial intelligence

00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:22,800
means companies download a lot more

00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:24,750
about us there are legal questions so

00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:28,500
who's responsible if a self-driving car

00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:31,050
is in an accident indeed who writes the

00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:33,030
algorithm they gets to decide you know

00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:34,680
just go in a straight line and hit two

00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:37,290
people or does it actively swerve out

00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:39,150
the way and choose to hit one who gets

00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:41,040
to pick that the developer ricing it is

00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:44,460
that the company I said government

00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:45,930
lawyers is it all of us we need to start

00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:47,820
thinking about these things and we need

00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:52,050
not just technical people to thinking

00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:55,440
but about everyone so on the subject of

00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:57,120
questions if you have any for me I'd be

00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:59,250
happy to take some if you're interested

00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:01,830
in the code for the demos or run earlier

00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:02,750
it's a long github at that link thank

00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:03,790
you

00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:08,660
[Applause]

00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:08,660
[Music]

00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:20,750
25 years ago in a theory of computation

00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:23,330
class I used genetic algorithms to

00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:25,609
evolve a finite state machine to solve a

00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:26,630
problem and got in trouble for using up

00:41:25,609 --> 00:41:29,410
most the department's computing

00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:33,050
resources you have just demonstrated

00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:37,099
again using a slightly more complicated

00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:38,109
Turing machine to write a program that's

00:41:37,099 --> 00:41:41,930
not quite right but you know what I mean

00:41:38,109 --> 00:41:45,260
are we going to get efficient enough at

00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:47,089
evolving programs to do something

00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:52,510
functional something useful to actually

00:41:47,089 --> 00:41:55,130
replace ourselves and programmers I

00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:56,960
think potentially I mean as you said

00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:59,150
that's kind of the increases in and

00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:01,460
computer power that we've sinned I've

00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:03,980
been I've been extraordinary so in terms

00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:05,480
of resources and being able to run

00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:07,670
something in a decent time I can see

00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:09,260
that being true I think there are other

00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:11,540
aspects of our work that are harlots

00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:14,150
replaced so the kind of design that

00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:15,530
they're talking to users so I'm I'm

00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:17,540
hopeful that even if computers are I

00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:19,940
some of the code that we will still be

00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:22,970
needed first sort of the architectural

00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:24,440
aspect if not kind of the low-level

00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:27,790
implementations once you kind of get

00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:27,790
through the function and class level

00:42:30,349 --> 00:42:39,439
well thank you for the talk when you

00:42:35,529 --> 00:42:41,390
write a program today a lot of times you

00:42:39,439 --> 00:42:44,059
have an IDE help you with a lot of

00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:45,709
things so part of the automation of

00:42:44,059 --> 00:42:49,849
writing programs is already happening

00:42:45,709 --> 00:42:52,249
but it doesn't use genetic algorithms

00:42:49,849 --> 00:42:54,979
these days mostly that are specific

00:42:52,249 --> 00:42:59,839
algorithms written for the analysis of

00:42:54,979 --> 00:43:05,589
programs etc do you have a prediction

00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:05,589
about how genetic algorithms will get

00:43:07,719 --> 00:43:16,339
involved in that will get more used for

00:43:13,249 --> 00:43:22,130
these things and how the balance will be

00:43:16,339 --> 00:43:27,949
between machine learning and other

00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:32,169
automatic evolution of code versus pre

00:43:27,949 --> 00:43:38,539
written designed elements yep

00:43:32,169 --> 00:43:42,019
so in terms of genetic elements getting

00:43:38,539 --> 00:43:44,809
more involved of things I think perhaps

00:43:42,019 --> 00:43:47,390
not this problem they are massively

00:43:44,809 --> 00:43:48,709
useful in optimization problems so it's

00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:51,140
a lots of situations in physics and

00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:55,489
chemistry where you've got lots of

00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:56,869
variables a space which it's the

00:43:55,489 --> 00:43:58,279
polynomials too complex to solve

00:43:56,869 --> 00:44:00,109
analytically

00:43:58,279 --> 00:44:03,739
and so you need to use this kind of

00:44:00,109 --> 00:44:06,259
optimization approximation techniques in

00:44:03,739 --> 00:44:07,819
terms of evolving code I don't know if

00:44:06,259 --> 00:44:10,699
it'll be genetic algorithms or some

00:44:07,819 --> 00:44:12,979
other aspects of machine learning and

00:44:10,699 --> 00:44:21,199
maybe maybe neural networks instead

00:44:12,979 --> 00:44:22,369
potentially but I think they will be it

00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:24,589
depends where we get to with

00:44:22,369 --> 00:44:26,239
intelligence and creativity I think in

00:44:24,589 --> 00:44:30,559
terms of artificial intelligence so if

00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:33,409
things can start designing aspects of

00:44:30,559 --> 00:44:35,900
work if we get levels of user

00:44:33,409 --> 00:44:38,150
interaction and being able to converse

00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:39,739
with machines where they can understand

00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:42,319
us and potentially they can start taking

00:44:39,739 --> 00:44:44,040
over some of those user requirements

00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:45,510
gathering bits as well

00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:49,190
but I still like to think there's some

00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:49,190
some role for us and I know all that

00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:56,600
cool all right Thank You Raj okay if

00:44:54,330 --> 00:44:56,600
there

00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:03,280
