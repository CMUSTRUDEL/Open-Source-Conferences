thank you very much and good morning

00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:19,290
everyone and as Raphael said

00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:21,960
seen too much of me already I'm Danielle

00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:27,210
approach EDA that's what I look like on

00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:28,770
television and just for sake of just

00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:32,099
resolve any questions right now as you

00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:37,290
can see it says that I am in fact Python

00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:45,239
software I will never get tired of that

00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:47,460
photograph or of saying that before I

00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:50,910
say anything else I'd like to start by

00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:54,990
thanking the organizers of course for

00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:57,860
the invitation to speak here but also

00:00:54,990 --> 00:01:01,050
for the conference that they have put on

00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:03,360
the team and in particular Tobias and

00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:08,220
Raphael have done an outstanding job

00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:11,700
with an unbelievable amount of care has

00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:13,140
gone into this conference and I think

00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,670
we're extremely lucky to have people in

00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,450
our community who can do that so thank

00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:18,829
you Tobias

00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,829
Raphael and all the team

00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:38,520
I work at DVO we are a swiss django

00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:40,680
software company we provide a cloud

00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,990
deployment platform for Python and

00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,820
Django the idea is that we do your

00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:47,040
DevOps and you do your programming

00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:48,300
because your Django programmers and you

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,170
can do that without worrying about the

00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:55,170
machines so we take care of that for you

00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:57,780
I'm here with my colleagues Katie our

00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:00,270
one of our site reliability site

00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:02,520
reliability engineers Paolo the Django

00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:04,020
CMS lead developer I know many of you

00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,830
will be using Django CMS

00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:11,640
and Dennis who's one of our platform

00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:16,410
engineers so um we'd love to talk to you

00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:18,840
Oh in fact we have a kind of workshop

00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:20,190
stroke clinic on Saturday afternoon to

00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,690
come and find us then we'll talk about

00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:24,600
anything that you like that's related to

00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:30,900
Django CMS or the platform or docker or

00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:33,600
all those things and I'm really glad to

00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,790
be working for Devia for one reason one

00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,900
particular reason is actually for many

00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:39,840
reasons in case they're watching this

00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:42,989
but one particular reason is the support

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:46,040
that DVO has given and continues to give

00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:48,600
to the Django and Python open source

00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:51,330
communities so for example we're

00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:56,160
sponsoring this event we're sponsoring

00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:58,140
the speech-to-text service which I think

00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,810
really adds something to the event and

00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:03,300
we're really proud to be able to be part

00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:06,989
of that we've been receiving quite a

00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:08,730
number of email messages because our

00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:11,820
sign is out there saying oh can you tell

00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:13,050
us a bit more about your um your product

00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:15,360
how you do this amazing amazing

00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:20,040
speech-to-text is this product available

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:22,320
well the software took several million

00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:25,230
years of evolution to develop and it's

00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:27,209
running up there with Andrew and Cheryl

00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:29,880
who are typing on their magic pianos and

00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:32,260
have been doing a fantastic job

00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:36,460
[Applause]

00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:36,460
[Music]

00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:48,209
ironic see that I am very heavily

00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:50,670
involved in in Django I'm on the core

00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:53,310
team of the Django project itself and I

00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:55,319
am the vice president of the Django

00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:56,580
Software Foundation it means just means

00:03:55,319 --> 00:04:01,290
that I'm a board member of the Django

00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:04,500
Software Foundation and that takes up a

00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:06,690
lot of my life and time in a very rich

00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:10,430
and rewarding way actually so being here

00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:12,690
is very valuable and important to me

00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:16,220
another thing that's particularly

00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:19,919
important to me is being involved in

00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:23,370
Python in Africa so here are Jessica

00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:26,310
Pawnee and and I'm Maharaja from Namibia

00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:29,400
and Zimbabwe respectively they're both

00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:31,110
participants in this conference

00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,290
they're both DSF members you heard

00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:36,840
Jessica speak yesterday about organizing

00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:39,539
a conference for young students in in

00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:41,520
Namibia ana has been one of the

00:04:39,539 --> 00:04:43,919
volunteers at this Django con she's also

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:49,260
a board member of the Django Software

00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:53,370
Foundation and this is not going on in

00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:57,840
PyCon in Africa all the pythons in

00:04:53,370 --> 00:05:00,479
Namibia Zimbabwe and Nigeria have exist

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:05,490
continue to run there's a new PyCon in

00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:10,340
Ghana starting this year and there are

00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:12,630
plans afoot for a pan-african PyCon so

00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:15,510
be aware of these things that are going

00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:18,600
on and maybe remind yourselves that if a

00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:21,690
Zimbabwean can help organize the Django

00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:23,340
girls at a European Django con then

00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:26,010
maybe Europeans could consider

00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:27,780
participating in an African PyCon even

00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:32,700
if you've never been because it's a

00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:36,150
wonderful thing to do some contact

00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:38,460
information but actually the best thing

00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:41,490
to do is just come and talk to me I like

00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:43,230
talking to people so I'd be very happy

00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:56,100
to talk to anybody

00:05:43,230 --> 00:06:01,020
I'm just find my water okay let's and

00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:04,110
let's get to business so I want to talk

00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:05,610
about the naive programmer and I also

00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:08,310
want to be clear that the naive

00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:11,070
programmer I'm not talking about the bad

00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:12,690
programmer or the incompetent programmer

00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:14,660
or the ineffective or the useless

00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:16,920
programmer

00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:18,030
nor about the programmer that you don't

00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,530
want to have on your team or the

00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:22,710
programmer who has nothing to contribute

00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:26,750
or to teach you the naive programmer is

00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:29,880
just an unsophisticated programmer and

00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:32,310
nobody's born sophisticated so even the

00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:35,880
most sophisticated of programmers was

00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:38,910
once nave and the naive programmer is

00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:41,790
absolutely everywhere and I'm one of

00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:45,240
them now in most respects I'm I'm a

00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:47,670
fairly sophisticated fellow so

00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,800
sophisticated that I know how to spell

00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:52,820
naive with a diaeresis and so on but as

00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:55,700
a as a programmer I'm a bit less

00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:59,010
sophisticated than that

00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:00,930
so here is the naive program I don't

00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:03,840
know how easily you can read that from

00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:06,180
over there but the programmer is saying

00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:09,740
keep in mind that I'm self-taught so my

00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:13,430
code might make might be a little messy

00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:15,930
and we'll explore this now everybody

00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:17,400
would like to be better at what they do

00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:19,440
I don't think this is a controversial

00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,540
idea I don't think there's a single

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:25,380
programmer here who doesn't wish that

00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:27,150
they could be a better programmer and in

00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:28,920
this audience we have some of the best

00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:31,560
programmers not just in our community

00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:33,750
but in our industry and I can assure you

00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:36,720
that they too want to be better

00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:38,670
programmers even the best most expert

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,790
programmers wish they could be better at

00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:46,200
their craft just as fervently as the

00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:50,760
most in expert and fumbling beginners do

00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:53,550
I take this one as an axiom but you'll

00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:56,250
have to accept this that programming is

00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:58,200
an art or craft or skill language use

00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:59,430
those terms interchangeably you just

00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,650
can't have to put up with that for the

00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:04,710
next 45 minutes even if you don't like

00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:06,270
it but that's how starting point now of

00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:10,800
course there are different kinds of arts

00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:12,540
or crafts some arts are aesthetic and

00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,330
they measured against human judgment so

00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:20,400
you might have well human critics who

00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:22,320
have opinions about your work and in for

00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,390
example fine art or poetry or music you

00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:26,580
can engage in a dialogue with your

00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:29,160
critics your critics might be wrong if

00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:31,980
they don't like your work but in other

00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:33,630
arts your practical arts your your craft

00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:36,060
is measured against the world it's not a

00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:39,030
critic who judges the world decides you

00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:41,550
know gravity decides if if you had

00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:43,830
faulty judgment in your craft and in

00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:46,140
programming you know as anyone who's

00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:48,480
ever diff tried to enter into a dialogue

00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:50,730
with the pilot of the Python interpreter

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,040
will find that it's a very implacable

00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:55,500
critic and you can try threatening or

00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,270
pleading or begging but if you have a

00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,590
traceback you have a traceback and no

00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:02,850
amount of arguing is going to change

00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:04,920
that so some arts you don't get to have

00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:07,380
a dialogue with your critic but there's

00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:09,930
a more important difference between arts

00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:12,360
between crafts for this talk some arts

00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:14,070
are repeatable so if you're a surgeon

00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,660
you're expected to do a procedure in the

00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:17,100
same way every time if you're a pilot

00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:21,150
you're supposed to land your plane in

00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:23,070
the same way each time reliably but some

00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:25,080
arts are creative and programming is one

00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:28,500
of them like painting or music or

00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:30,270
photography each new work is a new one

00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:34,260
bringing something into existence that

00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:38,420
didn't exist before so they're new each

00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:41,310
time if you go into the theater to see a

00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:44,640
brand new improvise performance that

00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:46,800
could be quite exciting if you go into

00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,870
the operating theatre and find out that

00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,480
you're about to experience and improvise

00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:54,110
in performance of wild creativity you

00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:56,280
might feel differently about that

00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:58,329
so as programmers you know we face the

00:09:56,280 --> 00:10:02,139
blank page that might converse to

00:09:58,329 --> 00:10:03,279
so it's a creative part and that's this

00:10:02,139 --> 00:10:05,799
means that even though programmers

00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:09,069
aren't painters or photographers or

00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:10,480
musicians in one important respect

00:10:09,069 --> 00:10:13,089
they're doing the same thing which is

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,429
practicing a creative skill does anybody

00:10:13,089 --> 00:10:20,199
know who all of these people are or any

00:10:15,429 --> 00:10:22,239
of them just four okay oh well we'll

00:10:20,199 --> 00:10:25,119
come on to that now they each represent

00:10:22,239 --> 00:10:28,899
an important story about artistic

00:10:25,119 --> 00:10:30,730
naivety and we should stop talking about

00:10:28,899 --> 00:10:33,540
being better or worse in art because

00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:36,639
that's literally a one dimensional

00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:39,220
picture of it in fact there are many

00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:40,809
different aspects to being good at an

00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:43,589
art or craft all kinds of things matter

00:10:40,809 --> 00:10:47,709
technique creativity judgment and

00:10:43,589 --> 00:10:51,189
sophistication and you're not a complete

00:10:47,709 --> 00:10:53,769
artist if you lack any one of those

00:10:51,189 --> 00:10:56,619
because if you like technique you're

00:10:53,769 --> 00:10:59,790
inept if you lacked creativity you're

00:10:56,619 --> 00:11:02,339
dull if you like judgment then you're

00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:06,089
uncritical and if you lack

00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:09,309
sophistication you're naive

00:11:06,089 --> 00:11:11,410
to be sophisticated in your craft is to

00:11:09,309 --> 00:11:13,449
be educated not necessarily formally

00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:15,369
educated although of course that can

00:11:13,449 --> 00:11:17,139
help but just to have been brought along

00:11:15,369 --> 00:11:18,850
in its culture to be versed in its

00:11:17,139 --> 00:11:21,579
traditions and able to meet its

00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:24,220
standards and the sophisticated artist

00:11:21,579 --> 00:11:25,899
is in dialogue with their own art with

00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:29,410
the practices and theories of their

00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:33,660
peers and also with their with the arts

00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:33,660
history and traditions

00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:45,560
it's thirsty work doing all this talking

00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:47,510
and I'm a little less than refreshed

00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:49,610
because water started coming through our

00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:53,900
ceiling in the hotel in the early hours

00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:57,590
of the morning so anyway this is Georges

00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:59,780
Braque he's one of the Giants of Western

00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:02,090
art he exemplifies every kind of

00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:05,930
artistic excellence he's the epitome of

00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:08,590
artistic sophistication he was many

00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:13,030
things but above all he was a painter of

00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:15,500
truly exceptional ability and even as a

00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:17,510
very young artist he had an obviously

00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:19,370
great talent but he had some encounters

00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:21,530
with the fauvist sand with Cezanne in

00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:23,150
his early 20s and that ignited one of

00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:27,860
the most extraordinary develops

00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:31,010
developments in one Western art so

00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:33,710
Cezanne following the French

00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:36,170
Impressionists in French Impressionists

00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:38,270
developed new approaches to structure

00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:41,000
and form and perspective and he laid

00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:43,670
down the foundations for a revolution

00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,950
because Braque and Picasso together took

00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:51,290
off from those foundations and they

00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:53,810
invented cubism and cubism isn't just a

00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:56,540
new style of painting it's a deeply

00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:58,570
theoretical intellectual struggle with

00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:01,070
questions about reality and

00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:02,930
representation of it it's an engagement

00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:06,170
that reaches into multiple dimensions it

00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:08,600
reaches back in time to contest with the

00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:11,360
history of painting across the arts to

00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:14,630
engage with developments in fiction and

00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:17,890
poetry music across cultures to draw an

00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:20,630
oriental and african art and it draws in

00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:24,430
trends in science and mathematics in

00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:24,430
politics and technology and philosophy

00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:30,560
rock was an artist in total command of

00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:32,300
his craft he was able to pull everything

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,580
together in layer upon layer of

00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:37,940
intelligence and meaning and to speak

00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:40,070
back to the world through his art he

00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:41,300
brought something so compelling to that

00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:44,090
dialogue that it could never be the same

00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:47,180
again he is an example of sophistication

00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:50,150
at the highest possible level and that

00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:51,260
sophistication is key to what allows us

00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:55,100
to call

00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:56,660
a complete artist now maybe it's a bit

00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:59,260
unfair to bring in a giant like Brock

00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:02,089
because I don't think you need to be a

00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:06,230
giant of that kind to be considered a

00:14:02,089 --> 00:14:09,140
master of your craft but I do think that

00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:12,910
you need to be like Brock you need to

00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:16,670
address your art with sophistication

00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:19,730
so programming is of course is not

00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:21,620
painting but sophistication applies to

00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:23,240
programming in just the same way it's an

00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:25,220
essential dimension of the mastery of

00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:27,800
mastery of the craft and there are

00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:30,200
programmers who have this mastery as

00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:32,510
well as their technical creative and

00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:35,210
critical powers they have an ability to

00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:37,130
think deeply and richly about what

00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:39,620
they're doing and faced with any

00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:42,380
challenge in programming they can draw

00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:44,330
upon all kinds of resources that

00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:46,100
resources from all kinds of directions

00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:47,960
they're versatile and powerful they will

00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:49,460
see parallels and connections

00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:52,220
relationships and tensions that are

00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:55,089
naive programmer would have no access to

00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:57,170
and they work with concepts and ideas

00:14:55,089 --> 00:15:00,500
some of which will come from other

00:14:57,170 --> 00:15:03,140
disciplines that allow them to describe

00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:06,529
and conceptualize the problem field in

00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:09,589
ways that simply wouldn't exist for

00:15:06,529 --> 00:15:13,820
others the sophisticated program it just

00:15:09,589 --> 00:15:17,000
draws from a deeper well and that's the

00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:18,740
programmer that we want to be in

00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,230
possession possession not just of

00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:24,890
technical and creative and critical

00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:26,690
strengths but time this kind of educated

00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:32,060
intellectual power to to have

00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:33,980
sophistication and if the sophisticated

00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:36,170
artist allows us to understand what it

00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:40,910
is to be a sophisticated programmer then

00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:42,290
the same goes for the naive artist so

00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:45,560
earlier I showed you this picture this

00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:48,529
is on Russo the painter sitting in front

00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:50,900
of one of his Buddha cross paintings he

00:15:48,529 --> 00:15:52,310
was the quintessential naive artist as

00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:54,650
far as I know he was the artist for whom

00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:57,260
the term naive art was invented he had

00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:58,700
no education in art if he had influences

00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:01,100
they might have been books for small

00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:03,850
children or drawings and shop windows or

00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:05,830
investments that he thought were pretty

00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:11,920
so this is certainly knows you're

00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:14,920
talking about here so his work was

00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,960
course and buffoonish he painted in this

00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:19,120
flat and primitive style with a child's

00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:21,490
grasp of perspective and his subject

00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:24,460
matter was a childlike or even childish

00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:26,670
and that was the only way he could paint

00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:29,260
he was of considerably greater

00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:32,170
limitation than a decent high school art

00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:35,800
teacher and probably on less artistic

00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:37,150
understanding - and if I'm perfectly

00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,320
honest the main problem with this

00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:39,700
painting is not its lack of

00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:45,700
sophistication but the fact that it's

00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:48,100
utterly hideous his understanding of

00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:50,260
color was so lacking that according to

00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,820
legend he would go into art shops asking

00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:55,900
for tubes of paint the right color to

00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:57,970
paint nudes so it's one step up from

00:16:55,900 --> 00:17:02,740
painting by numbers he was a painter of

00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:04,240
immense deficits clearly at least this

00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:07,360
painting has a quite like this one this

00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:09,939
has got a lot of charm even if it's also

00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:12,640
completely lacking in any sophistication

00:17:09,939 --> 00:17:16,420
sophistication but as an artist he was

00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:18,640
completely oblivious some critics felt

00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:20,470
that his work was so devoid of any kind

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,820
of thought or intentional direction that

00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:25,240
he they couldn't even say anything about

00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:27,189
it he had a total lack of intellectual

00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:30,340
curiosity so there's nothing in his work

00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:32,190
at least some critics thought that could

00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:34,240
be understood or interpreted or

00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:36,360
interrogated or enquired about or

00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:39,640
learned from and he was genuinely

00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:41,440
clueless he was once asked about which

00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:44,020
of the artists in the Louvre he

00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:46,600
preferred and according to legend he

00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:49,630
replied there are too many you can't

00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:51,970
remember all the names so he lacked any

00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:54,490
kind of intellectual framework to order

00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:58,120
and understand the history of art and

00:17:54,490 --> 00:18:02,170
its traditions he's been described as

00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:04,930
having an intention deficit disorder of

00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:08,770
simply delivering paint to the canvas

00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:11,530
without much idea of what he was doing

00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:14,860
or why or of being a kind of aimless

00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:16,990
hobbyist painter a bungler

00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:21,120
and at the same time he was absolutely

00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:24,520
desperate for recognition and he was

00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:27,340
unsurprisingly ridiculed and outsider

00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:29,110
looking in the outward looking in at the

00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:33,160
art world desperate to be on the inside

00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:35,440
but blind to his own inadequacies blind

00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:36,730
to his limitations and blind to

00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,730
everything else that was happening in

00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:42,460
art although he thought he was a painter

00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:45,160
of great importance and he relentlessly

00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:48,309
exhibited his pictures and he'd loved

00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:51,130
and admired the works and artists of the

00:18:48,309 --> 00:18:53,650
Academy but it's doubtful whether he saw

00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:59,169
anything in them other than the paint on

00:18:53,650 --> 00:19:01,240
their surfaces and he endured years of

00:18:59,169 --> 00:19:02,710
sustained mockery from fellow artists

00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:05,740
and critics in the public and people

00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:07,720
literally I mean not metaphorically they

00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:11,020
literally queued up to laugh at his

00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:13,540
paintings and one critic said they he

00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:18,880
paints as if with his feet with a

00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:22,960
blindfold over his eyes and here's the

00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:24,580
knife programmer again so I don't know

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,100
if you can be there but I'll just redo

00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:29,020
the second panel this is like being in a

00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:31,780
house built by a child using nothing

00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:34,179
better but a hatchet and a picture of a

00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:37,450
house so there's something in the tone

00:19:34,179 --> 00:19:41,890
of that same criticism that was leveled

00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:45,160
at Rousseau it's an amateurish Mugler at

00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:48,309
work the naive programmer is as ripe for

00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:51,010
a good laugh as the naive artist limited

00:19:48,309 --> 00:19:54,850
and unaware of being all of those

00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:56,620
limitations I don't think a style guide

00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:58,480
is going to solve those problems the

00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:00,669
problem here is not style the problem

00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:04,169
isn't that the code is a bit messy the

00:20:00,669 --> 00:20:06,520
problem isn't even those deficits being

00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:09,419
identified by the reviewer those are

00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:12,490
just symptoms of a complete lack of

00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:14,710
sophistication of Education a crippling

00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:16,660
lack of intellectual resources to apply

00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:18,429
to the business of programming so the

00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:20,860
naive programmers thinking is shallow

00:20:18,429 --> 00:20:24,040
and impoverished and narrow and weakened

00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:26,620
just as an as the naive artist and it

00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,850
comes out in their work and the naive

00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:30,880
programmer is

00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:31,780
less effective weaker less complete as a

00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,210
craftsperson

00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:36,970
who will always be limited by their lack

00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:40,990
of sophistication and it's not a thing

00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:43,320
to be proud about but here's a funny

00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:45,580
thing because this photograph of

00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:49,120
Rousseau was taken by none other than

00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:51,910
Pablo Picasso and Picasso was absolutely

00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:55,110
fascinated by Rousseau because was like

00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:58,120
Brack an artist of a giant of

00:20:55,110 --> 00:21:00,190
sophistication but Rousseau there's a

00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:02,380
couple of Rousseau's canvases had

00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:05,409
something that Picasso didn't have and

00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:08,710
that Picasso wanted and Picasso saw in

00:21:05,409 --> 00:21:12,100
Russo's naivety not just a lack but also

00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:16,710
something positive a new way of seeing

00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:21,190
and representing what is seen and

00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:23,470
Rousseau lacked sophistication but he

00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:25,059
had other things he had a powerful

00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:26,650
artistic vision and he burned

00:21:25,059 --> 00:21:27,820
obsessively with it he developed a

00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:30,460
language of painting that was all his

00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:32,500
own he may have been limited to his

00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:35,289
style but it was his style his own

00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:37,330
invention he was genuinely creative he

00:21:35,289 --> 00:21:40,750
may have been oblivious to problems in

00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:42,460
art or even unable to describe the own

00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:46,030
problem field that he was trying to

00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:49,179
struggle with but I think his work

00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:52,480
represents a genuine struggle with a

00:21:49,179 --> 00:21:54,400
private problem field he was unable to

00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,780
connect with the history of art but

00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,390
other artists or greater sophistication

00:21:55,780 --> 00:22:00,640
were able to understand his work and do

00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:02,530
that for him so the fact is that without

00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,870
ever developing in sophistication he

00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:06,909
became a painter of major significance

00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:08,590
he was an influence on Picasso on the

00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:12,010
Cubist's on the Surrealists on the

00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:14,669
German Expressionists on Kandinsky and

00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:18,580
became an important figure for modernism

00:22:14,669 --> 00:22:20,500
more widely while being naive so now we

00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:23,220
have two models for the encounter

00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:26,409
between the sophisticated and the naive

00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:27,909
we've got one of Mourne art in which the

00:22:26,409 --> 00:22:29,289
naive is something that can be

00:22:27,909 --> 00:22:35,409
understood and valued and learned from

00:22:29,289 --> 00:22:37,780
and then we have this one and I want to

00:22:35,409 --> 00:22:41,740
know what happens next in this story

00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:44,800
because the fact is that however naive

00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:45,970
programmer has built a house maybe

00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:50,650
there's something new in that building

00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:52,809
amidst the eccentricity and despite the

00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:55,510
lack of sophistication education the

00:22:52,809 --> 00:22:59,950
programmer created something worth

00:22:55,510 --> 00:23:03,059
reviewing and maybe that's in a in

00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:05,860
itself something that's worthy of our

00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:08,010
value of control of considering valuable

00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:11,530
maybe there's a natural talent there and

00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:13,510
the fact is it did compile without

00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:15,730
errors the naive programmer wasn't

00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:18,610
asking for help to get the code ron was

00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:20,559
asking for help to get the foot to find

00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:22,900
a way to make the code better the naive

00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:26,140
programmer deserves better than his

00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:28,660
sophisticated reviewer because she is

00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:30,970
not going to see past his lack of

00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:33,520
sophistication to anything of value in

00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:35,920
the code and Russo is one of many

00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:38,050
artists of complete naivety who has made

00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:40,420
a serious contribution to the ARB there

00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:43,150
are many others like him Alfred Wallace

00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:46,210
or Howard Finster this is a whole

00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:48,940
industry of naive art but since Russo

00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:51,429
art has been alive and sensitive to what

00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:53,830
the naive has to offer and if there are

00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:56,320
naive programmers with similar powers of

00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:58,179
vision and invention the world of

00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:03,220
software should be watching out for them

00:23:58,179 --> 00:24:05,500
- here's another naive artist this is

00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:08,290
mike disfarmer he was a small-town

00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:10,090
photographer in rural Arkansas where he

00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:12,040
maintained their portrait studio in

00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:14,020
Heber Springs a town of just one and a

00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:15,880
half thousand people and he made what

00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:17,620
were known as penny portraits which

00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:20,350
actually was sold for you know three for

00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:23,200
50 cents he was so naive he didn't even

00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:27,580
know he was an artist in fact nobody

00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:29,860
knew he was an artist until many years

00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:31,330
after his death when thousands of his

00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:32,890
negatives were discovered and he became

00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:36,490
one of the photographic sensations of

00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:39,220
the 1970s and all he did was take studio

00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:42,160
portraits of local people in his very

00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:44,110
basic studio he wasn't part of any art

00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:46,570
establishment he wasn't up to date with

00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:48,340
any even the basic technical

00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:50,200
developments in photography so he didn't

00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:52,750
use an enlarger he made he made his

00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:54,210
prints with a contact method using

00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:57,270
natural light

00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:59,130
from glass plate negatives for about 30

00:24:57,270 --> 00:25:00,630
years after everyone else had started

00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:02,430
using film and this would be like

00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:03,870
finding that the people next you were

00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:07,890
still storing their programs on punch

00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:09,780
cards but what's remarkable is the work

00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:14,120
he produced he made these unassuming

00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:17,340
portraits of ordinary mostly not very of

00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:19,110
people modest means mostly looking quite

00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:21,720
care one and they weren't created as

00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:24,480
artworks he was just doing his job and

00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:27,000
his pictures are intimate and startling

00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,550
and and moving and they're composed with

00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,700
immense skill and care he was a master

00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:34,770
of lighting whose only source of

00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:41,490
lighting was a single North facing

00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:43,470
skylight and they're like songs of

00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:45,660
beauty and sadness I think this is one

00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:50,220
of the saddest photographs I've ever

00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:53,100
seen these pictures are thousand worlds

00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:55,380
away from the usual small town portrait

00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:57,480
studio output there are no cliches

00:25:55,380 --> 00:26:00,060
there's no retouching there are no

00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:02,160
standard forms or poses probably because

00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:04,920
he was so naive he hadn't even learned

00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:07,800
them so I think this is sad because this

00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:10,230
is her name is Emma Mae hi I think this

00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:12,210
is taken during the war her husband's in

00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:14,100
the Navy and this is a photograph she's

00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:15,300
having taken to please him so this is

00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:20,310
why she's wearing the kind of Navy

00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:21,750
blouse and cap and you know his

00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:24,060
photographs have these people with

00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:27,450
they're worn rough hands and their sad

00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:31,020
eyes and he only had one song but it was

00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:33,210
so beautiful and all the resources that

00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:35,010
he had were his own he had nothing else

00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:37,200
to draw on he wasn't part of any

00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:38,580
artistic culture unlike Rousseau for

00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:41,010
example he he didn't even have

00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:42,600
pretensions to it and these

00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:46,080
extraordinary pictures came from nothing

00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:49,530
else but his astounding eye for people

00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:52,440
and you don't get to make pictures like

00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:56,460
this unless you know exactly what you

00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:58,980
are doing as I say this was his only

00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:02,250
song the only thing he knew he didn't

00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:03,930
have versatility versatility or range he

00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:06,480
lived in his own little world just doing

00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:08,940
his job making these pictures of his car

00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:11,130
stammers and maybe in programming there

00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:13,160
are mike disfarmer stu toiling away on

00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:16,770
their own in their small isolated worlds

00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:21,390
producing amazing little masterpieces

00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:24,059
that nobody else gets to hear about and

00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:25,770
not every programmer is a software

00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:29,010
professional some are just completely

00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:30,900
normal people who for some reason have

00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:33,419
dared to write a computer program

00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:35,549
so think about workplaces offices or

00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:36,330
factories or laboratories or anything

00:27:35,549 --> 00:27:38,280
across the world

00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:40,260
where someone with a problem has allowed

00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:42,390
themselves to imagine that they could

00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:44,460
solve it by themselves by writing a

00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:45,630
computer program and we occasionally

00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:47,460
meet these people they've picked up a

00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:48,990
book on Python and they've made

00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:51,690
something they've done these things in

00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:54,090
their own little worlds unaware of the

00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:56,400
culture working in eccentric and

00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:58,169
peculiar and naive ways that they

00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:00,240
arrived at because they found something

00:27:58,169 --> 00:28:01,620
that worked for them and nobody was

00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,990
around to show them anything different

00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:05,400
and sometimes they haven't heard of

00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:07,770
things like version control or

00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:09,210
separation of concerns or automated

00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:10,410
testing and you'll find them doing

00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:12,150
things like writing their code in

00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:13,470
Windows notepad or using an online

00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:16,710
environment because they didn't know how

00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:18,809
to make one on their computer but

00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:21,390
software development is a profession and

00:28:18,809 --> 00:28:23,720
like any profession it puts up because

00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:26,340
it has two barriers of exclusion to

00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:29,010
guarantee quality to protect the

00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:32,040
profession software professionals should

00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:34,500
not be using outdated inadequate tools

00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:36,630
or following poor practices so in

00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:39,510
programming we very rightly pay

00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:41,040
attention to how people work and don't

00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:43,799
hesitate to make remarks about their

00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:46,799
tools and practices but I'll say it's

00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:49,250
again that not every programmer is or

00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:51,330
needs to be a software professional and

00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:53,160
there are more of these programmers than

00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:56,549
you think and they suddenly don't come

00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:58,679
to chanko cons and we don't know how

00:28:56,549 --> 00:29:00,450
many of them are out there solving their

00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:02,700
problems in any way that works for them

00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:04,440
and we don't know what remarkable things

00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:07,830
they might be making and what things of

00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:09,690
value they might be inventing and I

00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:11,760
wonder what the implications of this

00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:15,210
might be for them even if it's not

00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:18,420
directed at them personally

00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:21,000
or even statements like this which are

00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:22,620
not meant to put anyone down and Jacob

00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,940
is you know is a software professional

00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:26,340
the most accomplished kind and more

00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:30,270
importantly a kind and generous man I

00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:31,800
don't think that statement is true if a

00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:33,180
django girl goes into work the week

00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:35,160
after her first introduction to

00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:37,350
programming and she writes a program

00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:39,270
that solves a problem it's not broken by

00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:41,760
design because she wrote it without

00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:46,650
tests or wrote it in Python 2 or didn't

00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:48,630
use version control or M if a graduate

00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:50,400
student in a science lab realizes that

00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:52,920
she can write a simple application to

00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:55,010
automate some tedious process then as

00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:58,050
long as it actually solves some problem

00:29:55,010 --> 00:30:00,390
are we entitled to call it broken in any

00:29:58,050 --> 00:30:02,810
respect however deficient it might be by

00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:07,140
the standards of a professional

00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:08,900
developer we're increasingly putting

00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:11,580
hands into the people starting with

00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:14,460
children who will never become software

00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:16,380
developers we don't expect that they'll

00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:18,420
have a formal education in programming

00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:20,730
we just want them to know a bit about

00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:22,710
programming simply as a tool for life

00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:23,580
and work in the world and if we're going

00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:26,190
to do that if we're going to put

00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:28,020
programming into their hands whether we

00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:30,090
like it or not we're going to increase

00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:32,730
encounter increasing numbers of naive

00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:34,860
programmers and absolutely rightly these

00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:37,080
people will consider programming if if

00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:40,980
they decide to do any to be nothing but

00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:44,070
means to their ends and we need to get

00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:47,490
used to having naive programmers around

00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:49,200
us and I think we need to consider what

00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:55,290
it means to make proclamations about

00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:58,080
what things are broken here's my final

00:30:55,290 --> 00:31:00,240
choice for looking at and in my final

00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,710
story when I was a teenager I discovered

00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,300
the records of talking heads and they

00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:05,640
turned out to be an important part of my

00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:07,680
education I chose Tina Weymouth their

00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:15,120
bass guitar player was Hospital love

00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:16,980
with her so here are the four Talking

00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:22,500
Heads and they became famous for having

00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:25,590
really long necks and I mean I'm not

00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:31,200
kidding you can I

00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:34,700
fear between 1977 and 1988 Talking Heads

00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:38,279
released ten albums of exceptional

00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:39,690
creativity and quality as artists they

00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:41,130
hit the ground running but they were

00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:43,080
already quite sophisticated because

00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:44,520
they'll all be into art school and they

00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:48,120
followed their first record with three

00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:50,150
more of increasing depth and complexity

00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:53,070
and they dig deeper and reach further

00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:54,960
and first I just like the sound that

00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:57,059
they made but later especially through

00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,890
reading about them I realized that

00:31:57,059 --> 00:32:02,179
something else was going on and as a

00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:05,429
teenager it was my first encounter with

00:32:02,179 --> 00:32:08,220
sophistication as an artistic quality

00:32:05,429 --> 00:32:10,110
and you can play their records one after

00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:12,390
the other and trace an artistic journey

00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:14,640
or development so after the morning

00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:16,470
immediate response to the music there's

00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:19,980
another level to explore that yields

00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:24,330
more that as their sophistication as

00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:26,370
artists deepened by the time with their

00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:27,299
fifth studio album they were masters of

00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:28,529
their craft you know they're so

00:32:27,299 --> 00:32:30,690
important that they were being reviewed

00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:33,450
but this record was read in The Wall

00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:35,549
Street Journal this is speaking speaking

00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:38,730
in tongues and for much of this record

00:32:35,549 --> 00:32:42,240
they were exploring this tone seething

00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:43,529
with paranoia and menace and it opens

00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,450
with a song called burning down the

00:32:43,529 --> 00:32:46,880
house which itself starts with the words

00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:48,899
watch house and the whole thing is quite

00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:51,960
threatening if you like that kind of

00:32:48,899 --> 00:32:53,580
thing and as a record it's quite

00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:56,250
sinister and darkened and very brilliant

00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:58,590
and most the songs seem to be conjuring

00:32:56,250 --> 00:33:00,120
up impressions of flames or sin or

00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:03,720
madness licking at the edges of the

00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:05,669
world as a band they would do me exactly

00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:11,429
what they wanted they were in complete

00:33:05,669 --> 00:33:13,860
command of their craft but the most

00:33:11,429 --> 00:33:15,390
beautiful song on the record is the last

00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:18,480
one it's called this must be the place

00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:20,940
and it's the smallest simplest song of

00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,529
them all it is so small and simple and

00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:24,240
unassuming that numerous reviewers all

00:33:22,529 --> 00:33:26,250
the time seemed appeared to fail to

00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,230
notice it it only contains three chords

00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:31,679
all the way through and it has a

00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:33,720
parenthetical subtitle and it's unlike

00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:35,490
almost any other Talking Heads song at

00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:37,890
that point until that point it's the

00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:39,960
most tender and following this kind of

00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:42,390
P sidewinding Funke of the rest of the

00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:44,640
record is like emerging into blinking

00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:45,840
into gentle daylight after spending a

00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,780
troubled night in the company of

00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:52,140
exorcists and demons so speaking in

00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:54,090
tongues starts with a song about burning

00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:57,030
down a house and ends with a song about

00:33:54,090 --> 00:34:01,049
being home and not much was said about

00:33:57,030 --> 00:34:04,400
this song but in the 35 years since 1983

00:34:01,049 --> 00:34:07,110
it has taken on a life of its own

00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:10,320
other Talking Heads songs seem to resist

00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:13,109
being adopted by other artists by other

00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:16,169
musicians but this one invites it has

00:34:13,109 --> 00:34:18,330
been it's been recorded by many other

00:34:16,169 --> 00:34:20,280
musicians it's been appeared on many

00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:23,280
film soundtracks as in a film by Paolo

00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:25,080
Sorrentino with Sean Penn named after

00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:28,790
this song and I haven't seen in any of

00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:30,119
these films or heard many of these

00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:31,169
recordings of it

00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:36,330
because I didn't know until I was

00:34:31,169 --> 00:34:38,580
researching something for this talk so

00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:40,470
why is this little song flowered so late

00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:42,419
in life because there's richer material

00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:44,399
on the record it's not a sophisticated

00:34:42,419 --> 00:34:47,760
song if I were to choose a Talking Heads

00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:49,220
song to present to a new generation it

00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:53,700
wonderful code to me to present that one

00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:57,690
so I can't say why this song has taken

00:34:53,700 --> 00:35:00,570
on this new life but maybe because it

00:34:57,690 --> 00:35:02,190
works as a canvas for other musicians in

00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:05,550
a way that other songs don't because of

00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:06,390
its simplicity maybe it gives people

00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:09,090
more room

00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:11,670
maybe it's naivety speaks more directly

00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:13,950
to people like mike disfarmer portraits

00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:15,660
but that was actually what I was

00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:17,730
expecting to say I only discovered that

00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:20,880
just recently my main point was going to

00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:23,700
be something else a mark of

00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:25,680
sophistication in artists is close

00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:27,210
attention to process and practice and

00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,859
programmers are very familiar with this

00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:30,750
programmers are fascinated by the

00:35:28,859 --> 00:35:33,359
process of programming and sometimes

00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:36,660
spend more attention on how things are

00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:38,609
done than what actually does get done so

00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:40,710
they explore and debate strategies and

00:35:38,609 --> 00:35:43,170
workflows and methodologies and

00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:44,760
processes because by the way is that

00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:47,760
they pay lot of attention to practice

00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:50,220
he's a nice joke I felt about that so

00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:51,160
there's craft work inventing electronic

00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:53,200
music

00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:55,630
desks and scrum meetings all at the same

00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:58,240
time so of course programmers love this

00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:59,740
kind of humor and programmers are

00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,180
convinced that if they get their working

00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:04,180
methods right everything else will be

00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:05,560
unblocked and will just flow so planning

00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:09,840
get your planning your teamwork your

00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:09,840
execution right everything will work

00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:14,350
that's what sophisticated programmers

00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:16,960
think because naive programmers just

00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:18,970
trying to work on their programs but

00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:21,550
attention to practice is the same thing

00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:23,610
in both programmers and artists in any

00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:27,030
level at any level of sophistication

00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:29,560
education the artist Peter Schmidt

00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:32,320
collaborated will collaborate it with

00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:34,330
Brian Eno producing a set of cards for

00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:36,190
creative and practitioners oblique

00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:37,840
strategies I don't if you can read them

00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:41,110
so there's give way to your worst

00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:43,750
impulse what wouldn't you do abandon

00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:46,570
normal instruments and these cards are

00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:48,880
intended to suggest a course of action

00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:51,970
or a change in direction to a system the

00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:53,440
creative artist and Eno used his cards

00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:55,240
with David Bowie on the three albums

00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:57,190
they recorded together in Berlin and

00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:59,980
although Talking Heads recorded three

00:36:57,190 --> 00:37:03,220
albums with you know they didn't use

00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:05,050
these strategies but the members of

00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:07,840
Talking Heads had been to art school and

00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:11,410
they were acutely aware of process in

00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:14,800
art and they had their own strategies to

00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:19,450
freshen stale habits and unblocks told

00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:21,850
created creative efforts their favorite

00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:23,590
technique was to swap instruments in the

00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:25,240
studio so that each musician would be

00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:27,280
playing an instrument they weren't very

00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:29,620
skilled at and that's often how they

00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:31,420
would compose new material and swapping

00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:33,580
instruments was a way of forcing

00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:35,350
themselves into a sideways turn out of

00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:38,560
ruts out of dead ends out of tidal

00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:41,110
grooves because with unfamiliar

00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:44,080
instruments in their hands their playing

00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:46,060
was less expert had to be simpler it

00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:50,220
became less sophisticated and more naive

00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:54,340
they made more mistakes and discovered

00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:58,270
unexpected things so as singers rattling

00:37:54,340 --> 00:38:01,150
a bit so out of the naive they found

00:37:58,270 --> 00:38:03,420
ways to bring forth something new and

00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:05,620
Talking Heads reinvented themselves

00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:08,830
continually and Syria

00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:11,440
and surprisingly with sophistication for

00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:15,040
their entire existence and one key to

00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:19,890
their ability to do that was their

00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:19,890
ability to harness the power of naivety

00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:24,400
so earlier I said that being naive is

00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:26,920
not a thing to be proud of it would like

00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:30,640
it would be like being proud of being

00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:32,950
ignorant sophistication is necessary to

00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:35,940
being to be a complete programmer and

00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:37,660
its absence is deficit but

00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:39,360
sophistication is not all that's

00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:42,130
required to be in command of your craft

00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:44,500
it's no substitute for technique or

00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:46,930
creativity or judgment and worse the

00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:49,330
pursuit of sophistication can come at

00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:52,000
the expense of them and the history of

00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:53,860
art is littered with examples of artists

00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,580
whose a sophistication left no room

00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:58,990
crowded out those other things it grew

00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:00,940
so much and became a burden that they

00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:05,470
couldn't set aside and I'm sure the same

00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:07,720
thing happens to programmers if I had to

00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:09,880
choose I would rather be a naive in

00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:12,430
expert programmer with a creative vision

00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:14,920
than a sophisticated expert who could

00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:17,500
solve all the standard problems but who

00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:20,890
had seized to invent any new ones of

00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:22,780
their own to solve and as a completely

00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:24,520
naive programmer I labored on my own

00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:26,950
invention a new way of solving a certain

00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:28,210
problem and I imagined and hoped it

00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:34,120
would set a little bit of the world on

00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:36,250
fire and it didn't but something I did

00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:38,140
along the way did manage to stick which

00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:40,150
is why I'm standing here getting to

00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:41,980
speak to you and most of you are much

00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:45,700
more sophisticated programmers than I

00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:49,090
will ever be so I'm quite honored to be

00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:51,220
able to do that it's like already

00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:55,030
Rousseau being invited to address the

00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:58,630
academicians that he admired so much but

00:39:55,030 --> 00:40:00,310
as for my code well it was messy and it

00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:03,160
didn't have tests and it wasn't elegant

00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:04,860
and in some way maybe it was like house

00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:07,120
built with a child

00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:09,190
built by a child with a hatchet and

00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:14,110
little idea of how to use it

00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:17,560
and it was naive but it worked the house

00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:19,099
they built as a programmer stood and it

00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:20,779
did the job that it was supposed to do

00:40:19,099 --> 00:40:22,130
much better by the way than the

00:40:20,779 --> 00:40:24,859
creations of some of them much more

00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:26,509
sophisticated and expensive programmers

00:40:24,859 --> 00:40:29,329
who had tried to solve the same problem

00:40:26,509 --> 00:40:31,489
and it delivered something that the

00:40:29,329 --> 00:40:33,440
institution I worked for badly needed

00:40:31,489 --> 00:40:36,019
and it saved it many thousands of pounds

00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:38,269
over several years as a means to an end

00:40:36,019 --> 00:40:39,769
it was a success it served the

00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:42,890
institution of the people who worked in

00:40:39,769 --> 00:40:48,819
it it was of real value or real value

00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:53,170
and I'm definitely proud of that and

00:40:48,819 --> 00:40:55,789
these figures and stories all represents

00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:59,680
different models of the relationship

00:40:55,789 --> 00:41:02,690
between sophistication and naivety and

00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:05,599
of all of them I think this is the only

00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:06,949
one without any value as a critic or a

00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:09,349
code reviewer you should be

00:41:06,949 --> 00:41:13,009
sophisticated enough yourself to

00:41:09,349 --> 00:41:15,049
recognize deficits of sophistication but

00:41:13,009 --> 00:41:18,680
what will you miss out on if your only

00:41:15,049 --> 00:41:21,949
response to naivety is dismissiveness or

00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:26,089
ridicule what harm will you do what will

00:41:21,949 --> 00:41:28,599
you fail to learn without sophistication

00:41:26,089 --> 00:41:30,170
you're an incomplete programmer

00:41:28,599 --> 00:41:32,809
sophistication matters

00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:36,170
its absence is a deficit in both the art

00:41:32,809 --> 00:41:38,329
and the artist and if you're a software

00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:40,940
professional aspiring to mastery of your

00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:42,859
craft you need to develop develop this

00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:46,339
sophistication along with your other

00:41:42,859 --> 00:41:48,380
qualities and georges braque was a

00:41:46,339 --> 00:41:50,900
complete artist but you don't need to be

00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:53,890
georges braque to be a complete artist

00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:53,890
and

00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:59,400
in all honesty most people most of you

00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:01,920
are not going to be a georges braque

00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:06,660
because hardly anyone gets to be a giant

00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:10,170
in their craft and you're probably not

00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:12,480
going to be a Picasso either but you can

00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:15,930
be like Picasso a sophisticated

00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:18,780
practitioner who is able not just to see

00:42:15,930 --> 00:42:21,900
past the deficits and limitations of the

00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:23,700
naive but also to reach out for its

00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:26,700
powers and gifts and to take advantage

00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:29,280
of them or you could be like Talking

00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:31,680
Heads sophisticated masses of their arts

00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:33,720
swapping instruments in the studio to

00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:35,700
draw upon the naive is a creative

00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:37,290
resource finding ways to remain to

00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:40,530
remain fresh and inventive stepping

00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:42,300
outside sophistication to allow new and

00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:45,780
unexpected solutions to reveal

00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:48,710
themselves you can see what I mean about

00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:53,880
their necks are amazing aren't they them

00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:57,300
or maybe you're not a sophisticate and

00:42:53,880 --> 00:43:01,290
maybe you never will be but you could be

00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:02,850
a Russo or at least like a Russo it

00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:04,740
would be a prouder thing I think to be

00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:06,930
Russo whatever your limitations

00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:11,100
producing work of incandescent invention

00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:15,000
then any tired old sophisticates in the

00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:18,180
academy history hasn't recorded their

00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:22,050
names so after all despite their mockery

00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:24,540
its Russo whom we remember if you're a

00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:26,700
programmer however naive you have every

00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:29,190
right to be proud when you exercise your

00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:31,050
powers of creativity and invention to

00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:33,900
solve a problem even if they're small

00:43:31,050 --> 00:43:36,720
problems even if the itch you scratch is

00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:38,610
only your own and even if your grasp on

00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:43,440
the craft is in some respects badly

00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:46,110
deficient or you could be a dis farmer

00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:47,910
so naive that you're barely aware of the

00:43:46,110 --> 00:43:49,830
cultural and of the culture and

00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:53,370
traditions of your craft but working

00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:56,100
quietly producing modest creations of

00:43:53,370 --> 00:43:58,890
unassuming beauty as a programmer

00:43:56,100 --> 00:44:01,560
creating work that represents small but

00:43:58,890 --> 00:44:04,350
real value doing it in whatever way you

00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:08,420
know how however limited and made it

00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:08,420
might be to solve problems

00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:16,020
so you know long live the naive artist

00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:23,500
since the early 20th century

00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:26,460
we understand we understand those the

00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:31,810
value of it and and the values behind

00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:34,150
this call oh what I've talked about the

00:44:31,810 --> 00:44:35,710
examples that these are useful ways for

00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:38,220
us to think about our relationship with

00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:40,870
our craft and if anything I've said

00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:43,840
makes a single programmer feel better

00:44:40,870 --> 00:44:45,700
about their expertise or lack of it or

00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:48,820
makes a single programmer hesitate

00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:51,580
before pouring scorn on the naive that

00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:54,130
might be worth something in modern art

00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:56,080
since the early 20th century the naive

00:44:54,130 --> 00:44:58,690
has had an important and influential

00:44:56,080 --> 00:45:02,590
place the adventures of honor Rousseau

00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:04,240
took place over a century ago and he

00:45:02,590 --> 00:45:09,610
lacked sophistication he was an

00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:13,480
incomplete flawed lesser artist but it's

00:45:09,610 --> 00:45:16,390
the ones who dismissed him for it that

00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:19,750
we now judge harshly because they were

00:45:16,390 --> 00:45:24,700
the ones who lacked vision which is much

00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:27,160
worse than being naive and I can't wait

00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:31,120
for the same thing to come true in the

00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:32,460
culture of programming thank you very

00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:40,570
much

00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:43,870
[Applause]

00:45:40,570 --> 00:45:45,370
we have time for some questions yeah I'd

00:45:43,870 --> 00:45:47,460
be very happy to have some questions and

00:45:45,370 --> 00:45:50,560
sorry also a bit unsure the timing and

00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:52,770
some may have rushed through that but

00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:55,980
we're really interested to hear your

00:45:52,770 --> 00:45:55,980
thoughts on that

00:45:57,990 --> 00:46:05,620
thank you an amazing talk as so

00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:08,770
frequently from you you've managed to

00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:10,600
help me identify what it is about one of

00:46:08,770 --> 00:46:12,700
my work colleagues and I believe this

00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:14,550
might be a feeling shared by others in

00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:18,040
the audience oh that's what's wrong with

00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:20,490
Bob or Joe or whoever it is their lack

00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:23,950
sophistication in their programming

00:46:20,490 --> 00:46:26,260
quite apart from your final point of

00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:29,410
maybe that's not necessarily a bad thing

00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:32,140
if we've been able to identify that our

00:46:29,410 --> 00:46:34,540
colleague lacked sophistication how do

00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:38,050
we lead them down that path to gain a

00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:41,980
little bit more sophistication that's a

00:46:38,050 --> 00:46:45,160
good question and if someone wants to be

00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:48,580
a professional software developer you

00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:51,750
knows a complete practitioner of their

00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:56,170
craft they will need sophistication

00:46:51,750 --> 00:47:00,910
education and they will need to want

00:46:56,170 --> 00:47:03,310
that and some people are content to be

00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:05,110
without that and someone like that might

00:47:03,310 --> 00:47:10,270
be inventive and creative and valuable

00:47:05,110 --> 00:47:12,160
in all kinds of ways but as somebody who

00:47:10,270 --> 00:47:14,830
participates in the culture working with

00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:19,960
other people it will be problematic if

00:47:14,830 --> 00:47:23,080
they refuse to see sophistication as one

00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:24,520
of their obligations as a developer in

00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:26,560
fact this is you know people felt that

00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:30,300
Russo had failed in his obligations as

00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:36,160
an artist because he refused to do that

00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:37,660
so your your task will be to educate but

00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:41,610
you will have you can only educate

00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:44,470
people who want to be educated I I'm

00:47:41,610 --> 00:47:47,320
I've no experience whatsoever in

00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:49,660
actually doing that and I suspect that

00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:51,990
it's probably a lot less easier than it

00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:57,849
might might seem

00:47:51,990 --> 00:48:00,070
yeah but maybe I seen that you know that

00:47:57,849 --> 00:48:02,290
it's not stupidity it's it's it's not

00:48:00,070 --> 00:48:04,720
lack of creativity it's not lack of hard

00:48:02,290 --> 00:48:06,130
work but sophistication is a dimension

00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:10,320
all of its own that's really important

00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:15,160
might be a clue to finding that answer

00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:17,740
thank you really amazing github doesn't

00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:20,950
exist in a random person's basement so

00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:23,530
how do we discover the mike disfarmer x'

00:48:20,950 --> 00:48:25,210
in programming I mean you know you

00:48:23,530 --> 00:48:27,010
discover a disk in a basement there's

00:48:25,210 --> 00:48:29,410
bit rot there's what-have-you and you

00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:33,099
know we're missing something ourselves

00:48:29,410 --> 00:48:37,630
to find the the jewels of the naive

00:48:33,099 --> 00:48:39,550
programmers potentially yes we are and I

00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:42,430
think that you know we won't discover

00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:46,210
many of these things but I don't think

00:48:42,430 --> 00:48:50,050
that's completely true because I'm

00:48:46,210 --> 00:48:53,290
standing here I was invited to join the

00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:56,609
Django core team as a naive a very naive

00:48:53,290 --> 00:48:59,920
programmer I mean I have other

00:48:56,609 --> 00:49:03,040
advantages that allowed me to make a

00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:04,839
contribution and what I found was I mean

00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:07,930
my experience of being a knife

00:49:04,839 --> 00:49:09,130
programmer was never like that one in

00:49:07,930 --> 00:49:12,490
the cartoon

00:49:09,130 --> 00:49:16,000
I showed my experience was the

00:49:12,490 --> 00:49:20,349
sophisticated people asking me how they

00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:23,010
could help me looking at my eccentric

00:49:20,349 --> 00:49:25,690
work and they're helping me with it and

00:49:23,010 --> 00:49:30,099
encouraging me so I'm extraordinarily

00:49:25,690 --> 00:49:31,480
extraordinarily grateful to the culture

00:49:30,099 --> 00:49:34,599
that we have in the Python Django

00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:36,940
community for extending me that hand

00:49:34,599 --> 00:49:38,920
because it's that's been the story of my

00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:42,430
life for for the last eight or nine

00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:44,500
years and literally life-changing I

00:49:42,430 --> 00:49:46,300
believe that we should be doing that and

00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:48,430
I think we're doing it already I think

00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:49,869
of course we can do it more I have

00:49:48,430 --> 00:49:52,810
encountered some of those attitudes but

00:49:49,869 --> 00:49:55,000
not from our community and I'm really

00:49:52,810 --> 00:49:58,390
grateful for that so everyone who has

00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:01,400
helped me over the years it has made it

00:49:58,390 --> 00:50:04,880
possible for me to do what I do

00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:09,400
but be aware keep looking out I asked

00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:09,400
laughing that's all you all you can do

00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:15,190
okay thank you very much Daniela for

00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:16,270
this sophisticated and interesting

00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:22,110
keynote

00:50:16,270 --> 00:50:22,110
