as a last point today we have lightning

00:00:10,179 --> 00:00:15,180
talks again and I think we were all

00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:18,270
looking forward to that so I'll just

00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:20,700
to Russ again all right it's time for

00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:23,310
lightning talks again so we all remember

00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:25,710
from yesterday what the deal is five

00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:27,180
minutes no more but can be less if you

00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,439
want to and we do like people who do

00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,689
less because we means you get more talks

00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:32,730
through there is a gong over here that

00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:34,379
will be attended to by my lovely

00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:36,120
assistant who will make sure that

00:00:34,379 --> 00:00:37,890
whoever is over here gets the message

00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,330
whenever their time is up

00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,820
there is a timer down here we're keeping

00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:43,199
keeping time to and while what we sit

00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,640
here and wait for people to get their AV

00:00:43,199 --> 00:00:48,000
setup I get to regale you with

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,620
delightful stories about the the the

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,890
individual yesterday he went was was

00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:56,489
dealing at the wasps after meeting the

00:00:52,890 --> 00:01:00,540
the head of the wasp con as an expert

00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:02,250
wasp observer got involved with the

00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:03,480
organization of wasp con and catering is

00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:06,930
a very big important part of any

00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:09,210
conference as we all know but stories of

00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:10,410
this will progress first up on stage we

00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,000
have Peter Kellner talking about

00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:15,170
recording lectures with Python and

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,170
GStreamer and please welcome

00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:23,250
thank you very much I Peter I would like

00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,500
to give you a small introduction to the

00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,659
house often Hardware we are using here

00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,789
in this venue and at a lot of other

00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:32,009
conferences to record live streams of

00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:37,740
lectures and doing live streaming and

00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:39,720
recording I can switch my slides I am

00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:42,509
from city wok we are the video

00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:44,460
Operations Center of the CCC you can

00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:46,319
find tons of information about video

00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,600
recording and streaming and production

00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:51,689
and distribution in our Vickie and it's

00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,520
really not all that clean up but it

00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:56,579
contains tons of information you can

00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:00,780
find me personally under the snake and

00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:02,789
on Twitter and this is part of our type

00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:05,069
of our pipeline it's only half of it and

00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:07,289
the upper half is concerned with

00:02:05,069 --> 00:02:09,269
capturing video signals from speaker

00:02:07,289 --> 00:02:10,920
notebooks and audio and video signals

00:02:09,269 --> 00:02:14,430
from the cameras around the lecture room

00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:18,360
all those signals are then fed into rock

00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:19,920
to mix that's these parts and it's a

00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,430
patent and gstreamer based mixer

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,930
solution you can see from the schematic

00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:27,930
that it's basically split into two

00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:30,480
halves one is rock 2 core it's the like

00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:36,090
a headless server and the other one is

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:38,040
work to GUI this is the streaming

00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:39,660
diagram block diagram of octo-core it

00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,609
basically acts as a network server

00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:43,889
accepting and providing video feeds on

00:02:41,609 --> 00:02:45,630
tcp ports the mixing pipeline we

00:02:43,889 --> 00:02:47,730
implemented this very specific for

00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:50,850
lecture recording you can transmit a

00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:53,100
nice pause animation and some elevator

00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:55,260
music during a break while continue to

00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:57,600
recording the actual content so if you

00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:59,100
accidentally miss hitting the go-live

00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,620
button you'll still have a useful

00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:03,870
recording the mixing pipeline also can

00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:06,120
handle multiple audio feeds for life

00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:08,579
translations for example and it probably

00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:11,730
can be extended to two other nifty crazy

00:03:08,579 --> 00:03:13,109
stuff from the code perspective it

00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:16,620
basically looks like this we are

00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:18,480
plugging together gstreamer pipelines in

00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:20,910
Python are strings and then giving them

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,489
to gstreamer 2003 streamer then

00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:25,290
implements builds a multimedia pipeline

00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:27,150
from it it's likely go for audio and

00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:30,659
video you'll stick together the pieces

00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:32,099
you need the UI looks like this it

00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:34,769
connects to work to

00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:37,620
via TCP network and when you press a

00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:40,200
button it sends commands over there over

00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:42,569
a simple line based protocol so writing

00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:45,299
new gooeys or other interfaces is quite

00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:47,400
easy you can literally mix video with

00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:50,099
netcat and telnet it's really trivial to

00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,689
automate just one example is are these

00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:53,280
little guys we have them here on our

00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:56,189
cameras they are raspberry PI's that

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,409
connect to the octo-core and receive the

00:03:56,189 --> 00:04:00,510
line based protocol and turn the light

00:03:58,409 --> 00:04:04,950
on the LED on whenever the camera is

00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:06,689
nice you can find all the code and a lot

00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:08,120
of the documentation in github and if

00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:10,439
you want to talk to us and have

00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:13,739
questions please visit us we are

00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:16,400
upstairs there if you go upstairs please

00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:21,780
be a little bit cried out there winking

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:23,970
wink again way if you go upstairs please

00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:25,620
be quiet but you can always talk to us

00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:27,690
and we're really open and welcome to

00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,610
explain to you what we're doing and

00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:31,500
because we have a really nice setup here

00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:33,419
I have some pictures this is the main

00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:36,330
camera that's right there in the middle

00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:39,510
of you we have a second camera above

00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:41,699
there and we also have like this is a

00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:44,639
really nice view from our mixing console

00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:45,960
upstairs so thank you very much and if

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,060
you have any questions please approach

00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,740
us and we will explain you how to set up

00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:53,210
your own video recording for your own

00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:53,210
conferences thank you

00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,750
[Applause]

00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,810
[Music]

00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:59,380
[Applause]

00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:02,330
[Music]

00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:04,400
thank you very much Peter while we get

00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:06,650
our next speaker set up so he gets this

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,300
this guy gets the job to organize the

00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:10,820
conference Catering and so he goes out

00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:13,010
to a essentially a conference conference

00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:14,540
to guess where all the vendors turn up

00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:16,040
and show their wares and talk about what

00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:17,930
they're what they can do and what they

00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:20,060
can provide for your conference and if

00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:21,740
this this place has got tents set up and

00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:23,660
every avery vendor has their own tent

00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:25,220
where they can you know demonstrate how

00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:27,740
they can serve food and how much food

00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:29,240
they can serve and what-have-you and so

00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:31,370
he turns up and he sort of walks into

00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,320
the first tent and the first chant is

00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:36,230
selling essentially German themed food

00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:38,270
is like a selection of a versed and

00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:40,400
sauerkraut and homemade mustards and

00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:41,720
there's some decent queues people drunk

00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,280
lining up to get in there and then

00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,660
there's some really really long queues

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,680
because they're also serving beer in the

00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:47,410
tent and though you know the longest

00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,900
queue is for the is to get to the beer

00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:52,370
so this guy sustainer he tries the food

00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,330
yes this is all very good food but you

00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:54,530
know the queues are a bit of a problem

00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:56,630
particularly the long lines for the

00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:57,890
drinks people are willing to wait for

00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:58,970
you know food for a little bit but you

00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:02,330
know you really don't want to get them

00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:04,580
waiting too long for a drink so okay

00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:06,830
maybe I'll try again I'll try and have

00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:08,120
another location another one of the

00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:10,520
tents and see where maybe where that's

00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:13,550
going to be better suited to to our

00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:15,590
needs so he goes on to the to the next

00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:18,320
tent the next tent is an American

00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:20,090
barbecue so themed tent and they've got

00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:22,580
all sorts of different barbecues of

00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:24,979
southern barbecue or Texas barbecue for

00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:26,450
Kansas barbecue then all very don't ever

00:06:24,979 --> 00:06:28,340
get into a barbecue discussion with an

00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:31,340
American they get very very touchy about

00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:32,810
barbecue and there's always barbecue and

00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:34,550
it's fresh coleslaw

00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:36,080
there's no some decent cues again people

00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:38,419
lining up and getting their food getting

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,010
their barbecue but then there's then

00:06:38,419 --> 00:06:41,270
there's some freshly squeezed lemonade

00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:43,340
as the sort of the drink that they're

00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:44,630
offering there and again really long

00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:46,580
queues for this fresh-squeezed lemonade

00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:47,930
because it's really good but also it's

00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,970
just it takes a while to produce to get

00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:52,160
a good glass of lemonade so there's this

00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:53,419
long queues and guys in there and he

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,800
tries it out and so the food's really

00:06:53,419 --> 00:06:56,210
good barbecue is really good good

00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,650
selection of barbecue and the the

00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:05,060
coleslaw goes with it's really good as

00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:07,099
well and still going all right the but

00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:09,770
and again the lemonade is refreshing and

00:07:07,099 --> 00:07:10,639
it sounds tasty but again long really

00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:13,639
long lines get

00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,780
to get this get yourself a drink so okay

00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:18,590
so probably probably not gonna be the

00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:21,560
one for us we nope alright so he tries

00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:22,759
the next tent this is moving through far

00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,919
too many of my tents here I got to

00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:26,180
convince some new tents he gets through

00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:28,009
the next ten the next tent is a

00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:31,129
different type of barbecue is Brazilian

00:07:28,009 --> 00:07:32,749
barbecue so Brazilian barbecue if you

00:07:31,129 --> 00:07:35,509
don't know is basically all about meat

00:07:32,749 --> 00:07:37,400
brazilians really do like their meat so

00:07:35,509 --> 00:07:39,620
he goes in and says okay yes here we go

00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:41,120
some beautiful meat on the on the on the

00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:42,949
the great big skewers you've into a

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,650
choice here it's a fantastic way of

00:07:42,949 --> 00:07:47,659
having having Brazilian barbecue and the

00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:50,060
the vendors they're a slicing big pieces

00:07:47,659 --> 00:07:52,069
of meat off of the off of the rescuers

00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:57,199
and and serving to each of the

00:07:52,069 --> 00:07:58,520
individual patrons as they turn up being

00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,000
Brazilian though there is no salad the

00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:03,830
guys with it's just just the meat and

00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:09,199
they've also got so I'm still waiting

00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:13,279
for okay we're still going we he's going

00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:14,659
through the they've got a Capri Mia

00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:16,189
station there's the Brazilians they do

00:08:14,659 --> 00:08:19,580
make a very good Cap'n you're made out

00:08:16,189 --> 00:08:21,650
of a really good imported Casa delicious

00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:22,939
but again reasonable queues for the food

00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:25,789
they can get the food out going out

00:08:22,939 --> 00:08:27,580
relatively quickly but the the the drink

00:08:25,789 --> 00:08:30,289
station it takes a while to mix a good

00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:33,289
capellini ax so there's a there's really

00:08:30,289 --> 00:08:37,940
really long lines for the for the Capri

00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:40,459
Mia's and sorry moves on to the next

00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:50,630
tent next tent is a italian-themed

00:08:40,459 --> 00:08:53,329
tent we got an ETA at all yes so it's an

00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:55,250
Italian theme tent and it goes in there

00:08:53,329 --> 00:08:59,149
and as you predicted sort of the pastors

00:08:55,250 --> 00:09:02,380
and and meals like that with some nice

00:08:59,149 --> 00:09:02,380
nice salad on the side as well

00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:16,640
[Applause]

00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:18,020
this was not the agreed pattern this is

00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,490
gonna turn into a five-minute joke in

00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:21,650
between all the other tear all the

00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:23,090
others all right so we're getting

00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:25,640
another laptop liner so it's the Italian

00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:27,110
themed booth we have the Italian the

00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,250
Italian theme meal we've got the pastors

00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:29,870
and the pastors are all there and

00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:31,100
there's some salads and of course it's

00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:33,080
Italian so we've got some good red wine

00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:35,840
there and they've got the red wine

00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:36,980
coming out but again these aren't cues

00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,690
for the food people are moving the food

00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:40,550
through relatively quickly but then the

00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:42,230
lines for the for the for the drinks for

00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:44,630
this red wines really really long lines

00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:47,450
as everybody gets their gets that gets

00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:49,480
the gets their drinks this is a

00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:52,210
possibility I might get a breather here

00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:54,350
we're getting we're getting close

00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:58,790
actually so we're waiting for flashes

00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:59,840
okay I'm sorry okay the the the the the

00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,680
guy who organized this conference is

00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,090
starting to get a little bit concerned

00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,710
it seems to be a recurring theme here

00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:06,500
he's sort of going to all these booths

00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:09,680
really really good creative food vendors

00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:11,540
producing really really tasty food but

00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:18,220
there's long lines at every drink

00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:22,330
station that they turn up to and and and

00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:22,330
STR GL and

00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:35,700
that's the line up there yeah there we

00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:38,460
go alright but he can tell that that

00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:41,580
he's going to have to keep looking keep

00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:42,750
looking as well to to see if he can find

00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:48,510
the vendor that's going to be right for

00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:55,410
him and we got to download the whole

00:10:48,510 --> 00:11:00,210
okay and that it would work here we go

00:10:55,410 --> 00:11:02,280
all right so the search will continue

00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:03,900
after the break next we have with run up

00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:06,270
here on stage now we have our needle art

00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:08,370
with cosmic ray research with data and

00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:09,600
analysis via Jango and some

00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:12,370
astroparticle physics

00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:16,170
take it away Ani

00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:20,980
[Applause]

00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:23,170
good afternoon I now work at local I

00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:27,430
doing web development my previous job

00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:29,730
was doing astroparticle physics as a

00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:33,880
particle physics at mica up in Amsterdam

00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:35,680
there I analyzed stuff with supernovas

00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:40,510
so this is an image of a supernova

00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:42,880
explosion where star explodes the shell

00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:44,950
of particles being ejected by the

00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,840
supernova accelerates particles which

00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:49,300
are just out there in space it picks

00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:51,820
them up and accelerates them and using

00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:53,740
big magnets it keeps them until they're

00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:57,010
fast enough and then injects them all

00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:59,770
throughout space some of those particles

00:11:57,010 --> 00:12:03,040
moving at almost speed of Lights hit

00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:05,500
earth then this happens there's a

00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,840
particle at the top and it hits another

00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:10,150
particle in our atmosphere and there's

00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:12,010
so much energy that they creates more

00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:13,720
particles and those particles have

00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:16,450
enough energy to collide again and

00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:18,640
create more particles until you have on

00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:21,540
the ground maybe between one and several

00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:24,580
billion particles those are just

00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:28,510
electrons muons which are slightly

00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:32,770
heavier version of electrons and there's

00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:34,960
at high spark we detect those particles

00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:38,200
so in the top right you see a

00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:41,200
scintillator which glows a bit if those

00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:44,230
particles go through it we wrap those in

00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:46,210
light tight plastic and then we put them

00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:48,520
in those key boxes and our

00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:50,710
photomultipliers connected which see the

00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:53,350
scintillator glow and they convert that

00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:55,360
to a strong electrical signal then you

00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:57,310
have a little box on the lower right

00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:01,870
left and it converts the electrical

00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:03,190
signals into bits and bytes and it

00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:05,140
continuously reads

00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:07,840
out the signal every two-and-a-half nano

00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:11,140
seconds so you get this really sharp

00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:13,330
signal and then we put several of those

00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:15,210
detectors very close together so you can

00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:17,260
see if multiple of them are hit then you

00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:19,510
are dealing with one of those air

00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:21,000
showers if only one sees something then

00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:24,360
it's probably some background radiation

00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,369
not interesting

00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:29,369
so this is how the network looks like

00:13:26,369 --> 00:13:32,220
you have huge things in space which

00:13:29,369 --> 00:13:35,069
shoot out these cosmic rays these cosmic

00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:38,129
rays interact in our atmosphere and we

00:13:35,069 --> 00:13:42,209
have several detector stations and they

00:13:38,129 --> 00:13:43,980
detect these events all the data is sent

00:13:42,209 --> 00:13:46,949
to the Nick F in Amsterdam where we do

00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:49,439
bunch of data analysis and there's this

00:13:46,949 --> 00:13:52,529
nice django application which does all

00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:54,360
the bookkeeping and manages all this so

00:13:52,529 --> 00:13:56,129
they're about a hundredth of these

00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:58,399
detection stations most of them are at

00:13:56,129 --> 00:14:00,360
high schools so it's an outreach project

00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,920
high school students built these

00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:06,600
detectors they put them on the roof of

00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:08,399
their schools and they can then work

00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,259
with the data from their station from

00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,089
all the other stations and do nice

00:14:10,259 --> 00:14:14,249
experiments see what they can learn

00:14:12,089 --> 00:14:17,910
about relativity quantum physics and

00:14:14,249 --> 00:14:19,980
other interesting stuff this is an

00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:21,899
example of an event at the Science Park

00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:25,019
in Amsterdam where there are several

00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:27,480
stations very close together the color

00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:31,110
indicates the arrival times more blue is

00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:32,999
earlier redder is later so you have this

00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:35,160
one particle coming from outer space it

00:14:32,999 --> 00:14:37,019
creates all these new particles and they

00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:39,239
all go at the speed of light so you

00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:41,309
basically if you take a snapshot it's

00:14:39,239 --> 00:14:43,079
all these particles in a flat plane so

00:14:41,309 --> 00:14:46,319
they also hit the ground in the plane in

00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:48,089
that plane so first they hit on the

00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:48,989
right and then a bit later there and

00:14:48,089 --> 00:14:51,480
there and there now

00:14:48,989 --> 00:14:54,059
so using that timing difference you can

00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:57,389
get the sense of the direction of this

00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:59,220
air shower and using the number of

00:14:57,389 --> 00:15:01,649
particles which is indicated by the size

00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:03,179
of the blobs you can guess where the

00:15:01,649 --> 00:15:04,739
center of the core was and then you know

00:15:03,179 --> 00:15:05,970
something about the energy of the air

00:15:04,739 --> 00:15:07,259
shower you know something about the

00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:08,790
energy of the cosmic rain you might

00:15:07,259 --> 00:15:11,910
guess where it came from at the

00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:14,160
direction and so very interesting so we

00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:16,470
have a lot of teaching material and

00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,749
tools for these high school students to

00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:20,759
work with this data a lot of

00:15:18,749 --> 00:15:23,269
documentation all the code is open

00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:27,139
source so the code running on the

00:15:23,269 --> 00:15:32,220
detection stations the jungle that's

00:15:27,139 --> 00:15:34,529
managing all the data coming in this

00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:37,209
project has been running since 2004

00:15:34,529 --> 00:15:38,679
there's about six billion events and

00:15:37,209 --> 00:15:41,189
have been detected which is about six

00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:43,779
terabytes of data which is then reduced

00:15:41,189 --> 00:15:46,209
reconstructed and all the data is made

00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:48,730
available via nice API and we provide a

00:15:46,209 --> 00:15:51,279
nice JavaScript tools to do stuff with

00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:56,439
it and bitin frameworks also do analysis

00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:57,939
with it and so very nice and yeah this

00:15:56,439 --> 00:16:01,689
used to be a movie but now it's PDF

00:15:57,939 --> 00:16:05,639
because it's on my laptop and but maybe

00:16:01,689 --> 00:16:05,639
I can show it quickly and let's see

00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:12,749
where's the slash yeah

00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:25,599
[Applause]

00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:32,970
all righty

00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:35,280
thank you very much honey okay so whilst

00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:36,960
our next speaker gets set up the search

00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:39,420
continues for the purpose perfect

00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:41,910
conference food I so having been to the

00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:44,430
German tent and the Italian tent and the

00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:47,340
Brazilian tent and in the u.s. barbecue

00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:49,290
tent the the guy walks onto the next n

00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:51,330
the next tent is a Mexican tent and it's

00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:52,950
a little little taco truck set up in

00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:54,840
there so they've got the people behind

00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:56,700
the counter furiously making tacos for

00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:58,830
everybody and their beautiful fish tacos

00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:00,150
and chicken tacos and beef tacos they're

00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:02,610
all fantastic

00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:03,750
and then I've got a little margarita

00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:05,100
stand on the side so they're making

00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:07,500
margaritas for everybody to drink while

00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:09,930
they're at it and are we good to go

00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:11,460
oh sorry again there gets a long lines

00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:12,870
for the margaritas but the rest of the

00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,950
food goes through well the long lines

00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:14,190
are a problem need to look somewhere

00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,840
else

00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:17,490
our next speaker is Lacey Williams

00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:21,380
Henschel talking about how to propose I

00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:21,380
talk like a welcome

00:17:25,049 --> 00:17:29,940
I have to figure out where to stand

00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:32,100
because I'm really short but I don't

00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:33,119
have a clicker either so yeah I wanted

00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,499
to talk to you about how to propose a

00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:35,669
conference talk because I work on

00:17:34,499 --> 00:17:37,590
conferences and I speak at conferences

00:17:35,669 --> 00:17:39,090
and so I've done this a few times I need

00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:40,980
to stay over here though so the mic

00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:42,720
catches me so the first thing that you

00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:44,220
need to do a conference talk oh there's

00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,289
the timer over there that's nice is an

00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:48,059
idea right and so where do you get ideas

00:17:46,289 --> 00:17:50,519
so you can think about what have you

00:17:48,059 --> 00:17:52,350
learned recently my personal opinion is

00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:54,360
that the most qualified person to speak

00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:56,549
on a given topic is the person who was

00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:59,759
most recently completely perplexed by

00:17:56,549 --> 00:18:01,769
that topic because you know what you had

00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:04,379
to do to get over that hump to figure

00:18:01,769 --> 00:18:05,940
out how to understand that sometimes you

00:18:04,379 --> 00:18:07,440
have really strong opinions about

00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:08,879
something like you think that testing

00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,859
should be done a very particular way or

00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:13,139
you think that code should be organized

00:18:10,859 --> 00:18:15,119
in this very very specific way you can

00:18:13,139 --> 00:18:18,149
share those very strong opinions with a

00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:20,820
group sometimes something that really

00:18:18,149 --> 00:18:23,820
confused you now make sense to you and

00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:25,470
so again this is related to one but it's

00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:27,059
also its own separate thing so there's

00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:28,739
learning a new thing but then there's

00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:30,450
taking a thing that you you kind of

00:18:28,739 --> 00:18:32,580
understood before and then finally you

00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:35,279
really really really understand it for

00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:36,539
example Katie's talk about the ORM then

00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:38,759
you need to think about your talk a

00:18:36,539 --> 00:18:41,159
little bit so you want to think about is

00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:44,129
your how broad is your your topic so

00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:45,210
like like I said for example testing you

00:18:44,129 --> 00:18:47,009
really can't just give a talk about

00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:49,289
testing in about half an hour right like

00:18:47,009 --> 00:18:52,139
a general topic a general conference

00:18:49,289 --> 00:18:54,210
talk is about 25 to 30 minutes so think

00:18:52,139 --> 00:18:54,779
about can i sum up this topic in two

00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:56,249
minutes

00:18:54,779 --> 00:18:58,590
to someone who doesn't know very much

00:18:56,249 --> 00:19:00,809
about it like hit my high points get my

00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:03,600
arc and then you know okay I've got a

00:19:00,809 --> 00:19:05,190
decent idea once you have an idea and

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,139
you're thinking I am ready I want to

00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:09,509
propose this talk you want to find the

00:19:07,139 --> 00:19:11,369
CFP CFP stands for call for proposals

00:19:09,509 --> 00:19:14,639
and the first thing that you want to do

00:19:11,369 --> 00:19:16,619
is read that CFP carefully not all CFPs

00:19:14,639 --> 00:19:19,529
are created equal they all have their

00:19:16,619 --> 00:19:21,389
own special requirements they also all

00:19:19,529 --> 00:19:22,859
have deadlines and it is very

00:19:21,389 --> 00:19:24,450
unfortunate as an organizer whenever

00:19:22,859 --> 00:19:25,889
someone emails you and they said oh I'm

00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:27,720
so sorry I just missed the deadline I

00:19:25,889 --> 00:19:29,279
had it wrong in my calendar you don't

00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,109
want that to be you so you want to pay

00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:33,130
very close attention to the deadline and

00:19:31,109 --> 00:19:37,120
also attention to the timezone

00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:40,300
that the deadline is in finally you want

00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:42,160
to make sure that that you know what the

00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:44,410
anonymity requirements are right so a

00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,540
lot of CFPs require an anonymous

00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:49,000
submission so you might be tempted in

00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:50,200
your your talk to you know talk about

00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,120
your credentials and there's certainly

00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,740
place for you to do that but you want to

00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:56,020
make sure that if this isn't an

00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:57,970
anonymous review process that you're not

00:19:56,020 --> 00:20:01,300
putting identifiable information in the

00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:02,590
body of your proposal finally or not

00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,840
finally the next step is you actually

00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:06,100
have to write the CFP right you have to

00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:08,440
write your proposal get it ready to

00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:10,240
submit in general you're going to want a

00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,710
short abstract which is gets printed in

00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,560
the program or put on the website that's

00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:16,090
about 300 characters then you'll want a

00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:18,490
longer description that gives the

00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:20,050
organizers a chance to see that that

00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:21,840
you're prepared to talk on this topic

00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:24,100
that you you know what you're doing

00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,840
sometimes you want an outline some

00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:27,640
conferences even want you to have an

00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,350
outline that includes the time so you

00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,460
you know you're gonna spend one minute

00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:31,960
on the introduction and you're gonna

00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:33,730
spend three minutes talking about this

00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:36,190
those are kind of annoying but you have

00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:38,380
to do it anyway so make sure again read

00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:40,900
the CFP closely and make sure that

00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:43,300
you're following their their

00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:45,100
prescription then you want to write your

00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:46,960
bio and this is the thing that really

00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:48,820
trips people up it is really hard to

00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,040
write about yourself like it sucks a lot

00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:52,780
so there are some tools online that can

00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,920
help you I will tweet those later on and

00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:55,090
you'll notice that my Twitter and a

00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,370
couple of other Twitter accounts are at

00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:59,230
the bottom there so yeah you'll want to

00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:00,790
prepare some kind of statement about

00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:01,180
yourself that again gets put on the

00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:03,160
website

00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:05,830
maybe printed in the program to let

00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:07,930
people know who you are then you'll want

00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:10,000
to edit your CFP so this is before you

00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:11,710
submit don't just type it all into the

00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,990
window and then hit submit you want to

00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:15,730
run this by somebody so you can run this

00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:17,110
by your friends you can run this by

00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:18,310
colleagues at the place where you work

00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:20,950
or people that you've worked with before

00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:22,720
a lot of times conferences will have

00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:24,490
speaker mentors so you can go to the

00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,540
website or email the conference and see

00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:27,610
if that's something that you can take

00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:29,200
advantage of you can reach out on

00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:31,300
Twitter and say hey I want to submit a

00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,920
talk on this topic will someone review

00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,540
this and people will say yes they will

00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:36,190
they will just say hey send me the link

00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:38,020
and they will give you feedback also

00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:41,170
slacks that you're in are a really great

00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:42,370
opportunity then you actually hit submit

00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:44,710
and this is a really really proud moment

00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:45,750
right but you might have some concerns

00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:47,310
about speaking at conference

00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:49,290
so for example you might wonder if you

00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:51,210
know enough to present on a topic and

00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:52,920
the answer is yes that you do you also

00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:54,540
might be worried about how much it costs

00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:56,460
a lot of a lot of conferences have

00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:57,510
financial aid you might be concerned

00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:59,220
about your work and whether they'll

00:21:57,510 --> 00:22:00,660
support you you should just ask and my

00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,950
experience is that a lot of bosses if

00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:03,900
you're if you're speaking will say yes

00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:05,880
and you might wonder if you'll get

00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:08,460
rejected so if you have spoken at a

00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:10,020
conference ever raise your hand if you

00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:13,140
have never been rejected from a

00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:14,850
conference keep your hand up or like I

00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:16,410
guess oh god sorry I did that wrong cuz

00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:17,610
I'm running out of time but basically

00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:18,870
there are two CFCs that are open right

00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:20,520
now I have two seconds left take a

00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:29,880
picture of this slide Django Khanna you

00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:33,360
and Jake upon thank you very much lazy

00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:37,170
okay so we've Mexican didn't work out so

00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:39,210
our next speaker next one Bend of the de

00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:41,190
Troyes out is the Spanish Spanish vendor

00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:43,380
and inside the Spanish tent they've

00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:45,150
they've got a little tapas bar set up so

00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:46,500
pick up your own little pieces of tapas

00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:49,760
from though from from the selections

00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:51,870
that are there and there's a you know

00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,850
really wide selection of tap it's quite

00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:57,270
impressive not too bad queues going on

00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:58,710
without with what's there and the the

00:22:57,270 --> 00:23:01,110
drinks is there they're serving sangria

00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:03,750
which is lovely but again really long

00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:05,070
queues on the sangria so this is gonna

00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:06,870
be a problem it seems if your recurring

00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:07,920
theme is like the food food doesn't seem

00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:11,580
to be an issue people can get the food

00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:13,710
out relatively quickly but the but the

00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:16,650
but the drinks lines are becoming a bit

00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:17,730
of a concern we good to go yes we're

00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:21,090
good to go alright so our next speaker

00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:22,680
is I made a clock in Python they live or

00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:25,900
Hagen hello

00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,900
[Applause]

00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:31,410
well hello my name is Leila and I will

00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:34,380
talk to you about making a clock in

00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:38,460
Python so a few hours ago my crack was

00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:42,690
broken just like this one and I wanted a

00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:46,050
newer with a few basic requirements

00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:47,610
it had to be blue and the time had to be

00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:50,330
visible when it was dark

00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:54,120
after searching a lot and only finding

00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:58,350
red and green and green ones I finally

00:23:54,120 --> 00:24:01,020
decided to make it myself to make this

00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:04,860
crack I used an NGO Gingka

00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:07,890
OTC module and a blue squad 7 segment

00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:12,510
display and it's driver I also used a

00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:14,850
breadboard and a lot of wires as you can

00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:17,700
see I used a medium and a small web

00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:21,390
board on the top is a secret place it's

00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:24,690
a secret with that component and on the

00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:28,020
bottom the thing in the middle it's a

00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:31,620
treat from three word to five watt when

00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:35,310
we logic converter because the datasheet

00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:39,000
side Jody Seay and these beta drivers

00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:44,130
needed five words and the trinket

00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:48,000
outputs treatment reward but I should

00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:52,140
have a two-way dodgy convert to this to

00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:55,590
this to work and I didn't I've won in

00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:58,830
the end it turns out both the RTC and

00:24:55,590 --> 00:25:03,210
the display driver work fine with a 3.3

00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:05,940
word Sanger so I got rid of the logic

00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:09,300
converter or to the other at this point

00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:11,700
I also decided to use a single with

00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:15,930
young breadboard so I had to make a new

00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:18,270
circuit both RTC and this pi driver come

00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:22,320
with their own Python module but both

00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:24,360
modules can fit in memory at once so I

00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:27,480
added my own death time management

00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:31,500
library to under the LTC module and

00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:33,960
saved somewhere away as you can see on

00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:36,330
this photo the personal trainer works

00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:39,200
after four days of making circuits and

00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:41,900
she hours of grinding code

00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,550
it was very very satisfying to see it

00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:45,920
work

00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:46,340
well after my success with the smart

00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:49,190
club

00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:52,280
I know when we go on a slightly

00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:55,180
different a slightly different one I

00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:58,250
decided to make one with pizza boxes and

00:25:55,180 --> 00:26:01,760
neopixels if you don't know new pixels

00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:03,200
are bright RGB LEDs right now this

00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:07,280
project is still work in progress

00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:09,770
because I haven't time to finish it but

00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:10,480
I think I will work on it after this

00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:13,040
conf

00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:15,920
if I talk to you about this truck today

00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:19,040
it's because I know that sometimes we

00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:21,740
want to give up but I also know that if

00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:26,710
we preserve the server we can crimp

00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:26,710
client mountains and even work thank you

00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:38,030
[Applause]

00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:42,680
thank you very much

00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:44,960
um okay yep yep all right there we go we

00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,950
have another speaker so the search

00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,430
continues

00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:50,510
we've tried Mexican we've tried the the

00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:51,950
Spanish we've tried the American

00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:54,530
barbecue we tried Brazilian barbecue

00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:56,930
tried the German all got the same basic

00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:57,980
problem going on here so recite next

00:26:56,930 --> 00:27:00,890
okay we're going to there's an Indian

00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:02,630
tent in the Indian it's a subcontinent

00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:04,780
India there's all sorts of curries so

00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:07,430
it's a large large sort of bain-marie

00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:09,170
trays filled with all sorts of aromatic

00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:10,160
curries and bonus some of these of one

00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:13,070
of these are vegetarian they're all

00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:14,960
still really really great food and one

00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:17,030
big bowl of rice to serve that as well

00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:19,640
so relatively fast-moving Hughes getting

00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:21,830
to all of the all the curries that are

00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:23,270
there but then there's the the drift

00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:26,360
station they're making a map mango

00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:28,520
lassis yogurt yogurt drinks and again

00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:31,220
really long queues on the mango lassi

00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:32,990
for some reason so okay so this probably

00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:35,450
isn't gonna be the one we've got our

00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:37,760
problem with the long queues again sorry

00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:40,280
the search continues our next speaker is

00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:43,660
Lorenzo Pena talking about multi ten a

00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:46,580
polymorphic users okay

00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:49,430
[Music]

00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:51,440
hi everyone my name is Lorenzo Pena I am

00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:53,240
wrinkles at Twitter github Facebook

00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,800
Gmail in pretty much every where I come

00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:56,570
from Holguin Cuba and it's a great

00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:58,940
privilege to be here today big thanks to

00:27:56,570 --> 00:28:00,770
the Yangon crew this is my first younger

00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:02,780
con ever my first time in Europe my

00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:04,430
second time it's out of Cuba my first

00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:05,960
time publicly speaking in English and my

00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:08,450
ninth year in the exciting world of

00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:10,310
young go I somehow expect that 9/2

00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:12,200
compensates for the former ones and twos

00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:14,600
the code name for this lining talk is

00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:16,550
MTP U which stands for multi-tenant

00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:18,140
polymorphic users which in turn is the

00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:20,420
fanciest name I could find to summarize

00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:21,470
the otherwise longer week recipe for

00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:23,420
creating a simple software-as-a-service

00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:26,570
with user hierarchies that gratefully

00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:29,000
downcast based on the current tenant so

00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:30,410
big disclaimer this is just a recipe I

00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,170
didn't create any of the ingredients

00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:35,060
myself this is only intended as a fun

00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:36,380
experiment this is no simple board for

00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:37,520
anything consult your doctor before

00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:39,260
attempting this on production

00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:42,200
environment ready okay here we go

00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:44,090
suppose we own China domain.com and we

00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:46,820
want to build a shiny software service

00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:49,010
using a single dangle project at triple

00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:50,660
W sonido domain.com we're going to have

00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:52,730
the corporate side where our customers

00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:54,080
will like acquire private space at

00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:54,950
whatever name they choose shiny

00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,110
domain.com

00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:58,850
so far so good now come the users for

00:28:57,110 --> 00:29:00,410
most practical cases we might not want

00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:02,690
to store information for our possible

00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:05,390
user types in a project like this think

00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:06,890
of it at the triple W site we're going

00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:08,270
to have our corporate users who should

00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:09,830
be dealing with 10 and management

00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:11,270
customer service all sort of super cool

00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:12,170
enterprise cover operations and

00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:14,990
hopefully

00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:16,160
payment processing and at any sub domain

00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:17,420
shiny domain.com

00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,740
we're going to have the use of structure

00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:20,330
that makes sense at the application

00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:22,670
level we are offering as a service and

00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:24,500
isolated users it could be a single user

00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:25,370
type or it could actually be a hierarchy

00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:27,650
of user types

00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:29,000
Yanko contrib alpha comes with default

00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:30,470
user model in order to store all

00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,210
relevant information depending on the

00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:34,040
user type we could fall back to using

00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:36,020
profile models with one-to-one

00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:38,000
relationship to the user as it still

00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:40,220
suggested somewhere in the angle Docs

00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,050
however that would take all the fun out

00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:43,700
of this experiment besides there's

00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:45,770
another implicit way of creating

00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:48,410
one-to-one field so we are going to use

00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:50,570
a custom user model actually a custom

00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:52,190
concrete base user model that other user

00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:55,160
models will enter it to create a

00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:57,140
hierarchy so cooking time here are

00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:59,210
selected ingredients for the MTP you

00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:00,200
recipe for solving the multi-tenancy

00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:01,519
problem in a single

00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:03,500
project we're going to use the angle

00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:05,029
tenants utilize some Postgres scheme us

00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:07,279
to isolate tenant tables within a single

00:30:05,029 --> 00:30:09,320
database and as other packages that are

00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:10,940
impossible schemas it creates a new

00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:12,740
schema for every new tenant while

00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:14,480
keeping all shared tables in default

00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:16,730
published schema for morning business

00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:19,220
like deeds can be found at the fresh

00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:21,529
market aka Django packages come under

00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:23,570
the multi-tenancy grid and for handling

00:30:21,529 --> 00:30:25,190
not too complex model hierarchies we're

00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:27,169
going to use the angle the Django

00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:30,169
polymorphic with this package if we

00:30:27,169 --> 00:30:31,970
define models that that use concrete in

00:30:30,169 --> 00:30:34,309
urchins we can query the parent models

00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:36,139
and get down casted instances so it

00:30:34,309 --> 00:30:38,000
replaces restaurants and bistros where

00:30:36,139 --> 00:30:39,860
place is the base class for resource and

00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,690
bistros we can query places and get not

00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:43,970
just places instances as familiar angle

00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:46,190
returns but the actual type of existing

00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:48,049
instances this comes at the cost of some

00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:49,610
extra join some drag in performance and

00:30:48,049 --> 00:30:51,230
a little bit of dark magic but shouldn't

00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:52,970
be a great problem if the hierarchy is

00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:54,679
not super complicated monetary again

00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:56,840
more ingredients like this can be found

00:30:54,679 --> 00:30:58,519
Molly inert Sanskrit of younger packages

00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:00,529
will come so how these ingredients work

00:30:58,519 --> 00:31:01,820
together first forgetting polymorphic

00:31:00,529 --> 00:31:03,559
users we just need to define accuse to

00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:05,360
Musa model and in edit polymorphic model

00:31:03,559 --> 00:31:07,279
we might want to ignore it also abstract

00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:09,139
bakes user to incorporate common user

00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:10,519
fortune re just make sure polymorphic

00:31:09,139 --> 00:31:12,620
model is the first one in place so that

00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:13,940
polymorphic behavior actually works we

00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:15,470
must also find a manager that narrates

00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:17,179
polymorphic manager and uses default

00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:18,799
management for the base user model for

00:31:17,179 --> 00:31:19,970
young co-tenants to work properly there

00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:21,860
are some preliminary steps we need to

00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:23,720
take like creating the tenon and all my

00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:25,429
models however we are going to spare the

00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:27,169
details here for the sake of time the

00:31:25,429 --> 00:31:28,580
only thing we're going to cover here is

00:31:27,169 --> 00:31:30,470
tenon and shared application the

00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:31,789
Angleton's has the concept of share apps

00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:33,679
and tenon apps with this the regular

00:31:31,789 --> 00:31:34,010
setting for install apps becomes just an

00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:36,350
order

00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:38,389
Union of the former models in shared

00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:40,639
apps will live in the default schema

00:31:38,389 --> 00:31:41,960
while models in models internal apps who

00:31:40,639 --> 00:31:42,950
live in every other schema that is

00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:45,049
created for a tenon

00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:47,240
if the same app is provided both in

00:31:45,049 --> 00:31:49,250
share and ten apps its models will live

00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:51,409
in all schemas but notice in the context

00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:52,610
of any tenant tables in tenon schemas

00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:54,019
will take precedence over those in the

00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:55,340
Polish schema there is much about this

00:31:54,019 --> 00:31:57,679
where you can skip the correct details

00:31:55,340 --> 00:32:00,919
for now so only we just have to do is

00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:03,919
know where to place everything and since

00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:06,740
we don't have time anymore and this we

00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:09,470
could be and this I inside a cage I'm

00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:11,600
just going to live here

00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:14,529
proof of concept if you want to see it

00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,529
in action thank you very much

00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:25,200
thank you very much all right we have

00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:27,720
our one last lightning speaker to talk

00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:30,930
to a talk today while they get set up

00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:32,550
our intrepid wasp expert has starting to

00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:33,870
get a little bit desperate it is really

00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:35,580
trying to look for like the perfect

00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:37,440
cuisine that is going to work and be

00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:40,650
able to be served quickly to a large

00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:42,660
wasp enthusiast audience and he finally

00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:44,130
comes across the Australian tent in

00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:46,740
Australian tent is sort of this weird

00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:50,100
Asian fusion things like kangaroo

00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:53,100
carpaccio or tank okay and there's is mu

00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:56,520
satay and all sort of weird combinations

00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:58,350
of of Australian food Australian native

00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:00,500
animals that are done in a sort of a

00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:03,480
vaguely Asian sort of style which is

00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:04,440
unusual it's buddy you know there's

00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:06,030
still there's still people here so

00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:08,580
obviously it can't be bad so he lines up

00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:10,050
and the gets in the queue and yeah this

00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:11,490
is this fruits really really good it's

00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:15,390
being expertly prepared and it comes out

00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:16,320
quickly and so okay so and then you goes

00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:18,540
over and it looks for the drink

00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:20,310
situation and there's a--there's oh

00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:22,200
they're serving a fruit punch does have

00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:23,760
a native Australian fruit punch which

00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:26,540
want a salad sounds good it isn't

00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:29,010
there's no line it's no line at all

00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:32,940
missus this is we're sorry I have to

00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:35,220
work out what's going on here our next

00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:36,960
speaker is the is Daniel hippo talking

00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:38,770
about the hidden powers of custom Jango

00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:43,059
pass converters thank you very much

00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:43,059
[Applause]

00:33:44,259 --> 00:33:50,570
hi I'm Daniel and I want to show you a

00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:53,749
somewhat obscure feature I that's new in

00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:56,659
django 2.0 so who read the release notes

00:33:53,749 --> 00:33:58,610
what's new in Django 2.0 yay no more

00:33:56,659 --> 00:34:00,950
regular expressions in URLs we have

00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:03,919
simplified URL routing syntax instead of

00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:06,529
using URL with the path with a regular

00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:10,669
expression in it you use the path method

00:34:06,529 --> 00:34:15,200
with a capturing and to capture and URL

00:34:10,669 --> 00:34:17,000
argument to use angle brackets and it

00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:18,560
after the : that's the name of the

00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,929
argument and before the : that's a

00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:24,500
so-called path converter which you can

00:34:20,929 --> 00:34:26,960
define so path converter converts so if

00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:29,179
in this case it converts document into

00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:32,540
in integers so your view will actually

00:34:29,179 --> 00:34:34,099
get an integer and not a string as it

00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:36,589
used to be so there are a couple of

00:34:34,099 --> 00:34:38,300
built-in path converters under the hood

00:34:36,589 --> 00:34:41,270
they still use a regular expressions of

00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:45,679
string integers lock path and also you

00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:46,159
your ID but now you might say wait a

00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:48,260
minute

00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:50,540
that's not really feature equivalent the

00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:53,329
regular expression that accepts exactly

00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:55,760
four tickets and an integer can be like

00:34:53,329 --> 00:34:58,010
any number of tickets basically so

00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:00,160
that's where custom path convertors come

00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:03,349
into play it's plane class that has

00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:04,880
again a regular expression so if you

00:35:03,349 --> 00:35:07,940
hate regular expression kind of bad news

00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:11,000
and it has a to Python method which

00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:14,270
handles converting from the URL to the

00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:17,089
Python object and it has a two URL

00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:21,010
method which handles the reversal so now

00:35:17,089 --> 00:35:24,619
we for a for ticket URL pattern that's

00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:27,829
the you the custom path converter to use

00:35:24,619 --> 00:35:29,510
it you have to register it and give it a

00:35:27,829 --> 00:35:32,869
name and the name is what you then use

00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:35,420
in url so far so good that's all in the

00:35:32,869 --> 00:35:39,050
documentation but this line caught my

00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:41,089
eye is it says it should raise the value

00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:43,460
error if it can't convert a given value

00:35:41,089 --> 00:35:45,440
but it doesn't say is what happens when

00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:46,970
that value error gets raised you might

00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,470
expect that you get a server error or

00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:51,109
something like that but actually the

00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:53,359
conversion is part of the matching so if

00:35:51,109 --> 00:35:55,790
a real error gets raised the path just

00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:57,390
doesn't match so how can we use it let's

00:35:55,790 --> 00:36:00,359
say whatever you

00:35:57,390 --> 00:36:03,239
which gets an ID and then you have a

00:36:00,359 --> 00:36:06,799
view which gets an object or returns a

00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:09,599
four for four and you also have the URL

00:36:06,799 --> 00:36:11,369
tag in a template that does the reversal

00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:14,609
now you can write a custom converter

00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:17,759
class which fetches the object in the to

00:36:14,609 --> 00:36:20,089
Python method and raises a value array

00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:22,949
if the object doesn't exist and the

00:36:20,089 --> 00:36:26,069
two-year-old method chest takes returned

00:36:22,949 --> 00:36:27,660
the ID of the object you register that

00:36:26,069 --> 00:36:29,819
converter and give me the name in this

00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:32,819
case I was not very creative so it's a

00:36:29,819 --> 00:36:35,039
question-- converter and now you you

00:36:32,819 --> 00:36:38,299
receives a question object and you can

00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:41,759
also just pass a question object to your

00:36:38,299 --> 00:36:44,849
URL reversal now you don't want to write

00:36:41,759 --> 00:36:47,809
a converter for each model obviously so

00:36:44,849 --> 00:36:50,309
you can generalize that and I wrote a

00:36:47,809 --> 00:36:53,279
register model converter method which

00:36:50,309 --> 00:36:57,239
dynamically builds a model converter

00:36:53,279 --> 00:36:58,949
class which you can use like this and by

00:36:57,239 --> 00:37:02,189
default it just uses the name of the

00:36:58,949 --> 00:37:03,869
model as the name of the converter then

00:37:02,189 --> 00:37:06,869
I came up with a couple of other useful

00:37:03,869 --> 00:37:08,549
features like passing an optional name

00:37:06,869 --> 00:37:10,019
and using a different field for lookup

00:37:08,549 --> 00:37:12,630
and different using a different base

00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:16,069
class if for example your primary key is

00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:18,539
the UID you can also pass a query set

00:37:16,069 --> 00:37:21,479
that's where the advertising part starts

00:37:18,539 --> 00:37:22,949
I packaged that in a Hyson package which

00:37:21,479 --> 00:37:26,130
you can just install with pip install

00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:29,429
Django model path converter and then you

00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:32,489
just do register model converter with

00:37:29,429 --> 00:37:37,349
your model class and then you have used

00:37:32,489 --> 00:37:41,910
in models in your view here are the

00:37:37,349 --> 00:37:44,519
links to pi PI and github and also my

00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:45,479
Twitter and my email if you want to tell

00:37:44,519 --> 00:37:47,130
me why that's a bad idea

00:37:45,479 --> 00:37:50,499
thank you

00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:50,499
[Applause]

00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:56,609
thank you very much that concludes the

00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:58,190
lightning talks for today thank you very

00:37:56,609 --> 00:38:00,089
much to all the lightning talk speakers

00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:02,520
thank you very much to a delightful

00:38:00,089 --> 00:38:03,690
going person who didn't have a great

00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:06,540
deal of need to Gong because everybody

00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:07,800
was under time it's wonderful one last

00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:10,230
issue that we have to work out though is

00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:11,339
why why was the Australian queue I would

00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:13,560
old boy they were to get through the

00:38:11,339 --> 00:38:16,500
drinks so quickly and so the the guy

00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:19,140
who's organizing what's pecan comes up

00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:20,790
to the coast goes to find the the the

00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:21,960
manager of the Australian tents is sorry

00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:23,310
okay what's the story here what's going

00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,540
on like everyone else I've been to all

00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:25,770
these other tents I've been to Mexican

00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:26,700
tents I've been to American tents I've

00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:28,650
been to Brazilian turns

00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:30,119
they've all got you know good rates of

00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:32,099
throughput for the food but they've

00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:33,540
they've got huge huge loans for the

00:38:32,099 --> 00:38:34,710
drinks and I come in here and you're

00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:36,240
serving this delicious punch which is

00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:38,339
you know it's it's fantastic but there's

00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:41,220
there's no queue so what's the story and

00:38:38,339 --> 00:38:42,420
the so the Australian manager turns to

00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:44,310
turns to the guy and looks him straight

00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:46,760
in the eye and says why would there be a

00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:46,760
punch line

00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:55,300
