I think everybody's ready to take their

00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:15,930
seats that would be very great right now

00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:18,900
so welcome everybody to the last session

00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:21,029
of changuk on Europe or the talk days

00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,550
will continue to have great workshops

00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:26,100
tomorrow and we'll start off with

00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:28,619
Daniela who's going to tell us what

00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:30,930
Sprint's actually are so that all of you

00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:39,840
who come to the Sprint's will know what

00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:42,510
is going to happen there thank you if

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,070
you're very lucky or very good then this

00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:46,710
might be the last time you see me on

00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:50,880
stage today so try not to get up here

00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:56,100
anymore so we're finished or we're just

00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:58,500
about to finish our three days of talks

00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,719
and we're going to follow it up with two

00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,930
days of code sprints and somebody was

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,630
just talking to me outside and said why

00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:09,180
is changuk on Europe five days long and

00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:13,190
my first thought was well because we

00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:13,190
probably couldn't get away with ten but

00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:18,509
more people tend to come to the talks

00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,979
then to the code sprints and partly it's

00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:23,580
because people aren't really sure what

00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:26,369
code Sprint's are although for those who

00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:28,860
come regularly and come to the code

00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:32,009
Sprint's they often turn out to be the

00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:34,770
most important and enjoyable part of the

00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:36,630
event and if you think that something

00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:38,520
can be more enjoyable and important in

00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:41,250
the last three days then you can believe

00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:44,910
it because come to the Sprint's and you

00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:49,200
might find out it's really true so what

00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:52,349
is a code sprint well has any who here

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:55,649
has never been to a sprint code sprint

00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:58,830
in a conference before a lot of you good

00:01:55,649 --> 00:02:01,050
okay so how they haven't come to the

00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:02,580
Sprint's yet but it's I mean it's good

00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:05,640
they're here we'll say good ones

00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:09,539
so most of us who collaborate on open

00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:12,599
source projects collaborate at a

00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:14,520
distance and a code sprint at a

00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:19,770
conference is a chance for us to get

00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:24,030
together and talk and work in person on

00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:27,690
the project so if fam if you've done any

00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:30,330
open source collaboration then already

00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:33,960
you're in a good position to take part

00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:37,890
in a code sprint what happens at a code

00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:40,590
sprint a number of developers who might

00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:44,910
be programmers designers documentation

00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:47,130
writers so not necessarily only

00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:49,200
programmers will get together in a room

00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:51,150
they'll be talking to each other sitting

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,220
at their computers working on their own

00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:58,230
or in pairs or in groups or discussing

00:02:53,220 --> 00:03:00,030
problems and what typically happens is

00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:03,210
that if you decide that you're going to

00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:06,030
sprint on something is that you will

00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:08,070
select a ticket or a problem perhaps a

00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:11,250
bug or an improvement that a particular

00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:13,980
project needs and you'll get to work on

00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:19,620
that and as you work you'll find that

00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:21,780
there are maybe more experienced members

00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,490
of the project around to help you with

00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:25,500
it or possibly you might be one of those

00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:29,850
more experienced people who's there to

00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:31,290
help other people get started so you

00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:33,450
it's a very good way of getting feedback

00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:39,330
on your work in a in a really nice

00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:41,580
environment and the the word sprint is

00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:45,000
maybe a bit unfortunate because it

00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:47,400
doesn't matter if you just walk or take

00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,050
a few faltering steps because those are

00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:55,890
also both absolutely fine so you don't

00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:57,480
need to feel that at a sprint you

00:03:55,890 --> 00:04:00,420
actually have to do anything very fast

00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:03,000
or keep up with anyone else I'd like

00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:06,030
another show of hands for all the people

00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,310
here who already know they're going to

00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:10,200
be at the code sprints in order to work

00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:13,440
on a particular project whether as a

00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,580
leader or just to contribute to

00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,680
something just please put your hands up

00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,850
so everyone can see who's already got an

00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,830
idea of what they're going to be doing

00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:22,790
good thanks

00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:27,630
some of those people are going to be

00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:30,090
sprinting on Django itself so if you

00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:31,670
ever thought that you might like to do

00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:33,740
some work on Django

00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:35,810
this is an excellent opportunity because

00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:38,150
there are several django core developers

00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:41,210
here and they are here because they want

00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:47,900
to help you and other people do

00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:48,380
something in or with django can I join

00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:51,440
in

00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:55,130
well yes funny you asked everyone is

00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:58,670
welcome it's not an elite club it's not

00:04:55,130 --> 00:05:00,680
for experts only all of the projects

00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:05,180
every single one of them that will be

00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:08,270
running sprints will welcome anyone who

00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:11,240
wants to help and there are lots of

00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:15,760
different ways to help you don't need as

00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,760
I said to be a programmer you might be

00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:22,400
translating things you know from English

00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:25,400
to another human language without

00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:28,430
actually touching any code and that can

00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:32,690
also be a very valuable contribution to

00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:34,700
a project you might be a user getting

00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:36,320
the project started up and running on

00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:40,250
your own computer for the very first

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:41,960
time and decide that you noticed that

00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:44,420
you had some problems with it and that

00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:48,020
you can help other people by documenting

00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:49,070
how to get around those problems so

00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:52,520
there are lots of different ways in

00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:56,210
which you can participate but you've

00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:57,800
never taken part in a sprint well there

00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:59,720
will be a first time for everything and

00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,640
the important thing is that there are

00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:06,230
going to be people there to help you and

00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:08,630
to induct you into the process what do

00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:12,290
you need it's very basic you need a

00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:13,760
computer of your own to work on and or

00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:15,590
you may even find that Sunny's got one

00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:18,230
to lend you and you need to be able to

00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:20,900
put in a bit of time so we've got two

00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:22,700
days for it there's no pressure but if

00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:24,920
you've got the time to sit there with

00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:28,520
the code and the computer with the

00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:31,480
problem and you'll make some progress

00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,480
doing something

00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:37,890
what if you're not a very good Python

00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:40,440
programmer well it's okay neither am i

00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:42,510
and not everybody else who's there is a

00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:44,340
very good Python programmer and I

00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:46,050
already said you don't actually need to

00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:48,960
be much of a program Python programmer

00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:50,520
any kind of program at all because there

00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,260
are lots of different ways that even the

00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:57,030
most novice sprinter can make a valuable

00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:58,500
contribution and you might be worried

00:06:57,030 --> 00:07:01,880
about holding up other people because

00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:04,650
you're slow but it simply does not work

00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:07,200
like that because one of the main points

00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:10,020
of the Sprint's is to encourage and help

00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:11,820
new people you'll be able to learn at

00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:13,860
your own pace learning the things that

00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:18,750
you need to learn as you go along and

00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:23,060
you'll be supported and when I went to

00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:26,030
my first code Sprint's I dropped in and

00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:28,230
to see what it was and the next year

00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:30,660
somebody finally showed me how to use

00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:32,850
git and the third year I ran a workshop

00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,920
showing people how to use git so that's

00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:36,630
the way it works it might take you two

00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:39,540
or three years through it but that's

00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:41,850
fine we're not in a hurry here even

00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:43,350
though it's called a sprint you don't

00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:45,390
have to stay for the whole thing

00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:47,610
drop-in just to get a taste of the

00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:49,020
atmosphere because you know atmosphere

00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:51,510
you want nerds in front of computers

00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:55,140
this atmosphere that's like club 54 in

00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:56,250
New York in the 1970s but there'll be

00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:58,110
plenty of other things on the day

00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:59,790
there'll be workshops and clinics so

00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:01,470
maybe you don't want to miss those

00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:03,750
either and other people will be dropping

00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:05,660
in and out and nobody's keeping tabs on

00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:09,140
you

00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:11,850
the curious are very welcome to and

00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:14,190
Tobias reminded me that lunch will be

00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:15,900
provided but very sadly it won't be as

00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:17,790
elaborate as the lunch group that nice

00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:21,450
lunches we've had here but don't let

00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:24,090
that disappoint you so I hope that if

00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:26,190
anybody was thinking maybe they might

00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:28,800
come that just tip them over the edge

00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:32,190
into thinking that perhaps they they

00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,610
will indeed so I hope that we'll see you

00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:34,320
there

00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:38,230
you'll join in and learn something and

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:41,429
contribute something see you tomorrow

00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:41,429
