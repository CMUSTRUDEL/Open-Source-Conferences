In the 1850s, Edward Orange Wildman Whitehouse was appointed the lead engineer of the first attempt to build a trans-Atlantic telegraph cable. This is a tale of a project gone horribly wrong in the age of magnificent facial hair. Step up to learn the secrets of recovering your project from failure!

In the 1850s, Edward Orange Wildman Whitehouse was appointed the lead engineer of the first attempt to build a trans-Atlantic telegraph cable. With the entire population of two continents waiting for his go-live, their handlebar moustaches aquiver, he demonstrated in fine form just how spectacularly a big project can be a bigger disaster.

This is a tale of long-winded rants, spectacular sideburns, and gentlemen scientists behaving badly. It is also a lesson about the importance of honest reflection in technical teamwork. Lilly outlines some of the mistakes made during one of the biggest tech delivery projects in history, and how a constructive view of failure helped to turn it all around. Through the public meltdowns of Wildman Whitehouse you will learn the importance of feedback, how to handle complex tasks gracefully, and the best way to recover from having your pipeline eaten by a whale.

all right after this lunch break we now

00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:17,890
have on deck Lily Rhine and she's going

00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:31,510
to give us the world's only telegraph

00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:35,260
driven conference talk hey folks thank

00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:37,510
you for coming to my talk um yeah I saw

00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:40,930
I can promise you a lot of drama and

00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:43,989
backstabbing and poetry and useful

00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:45,250
lessons but before I do that as Marcus

00:00:43,989 --> 00:00:48,760
alluded to I want to talk a bit about

00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:50,739
these slide changes just for fun and

00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:52,629
because it's a bit on theme I've got to

00:00:50,739 --> 00:00:53,379
Telegraph Keys one makes the slides go

00:00:52,629 --> 00:00:58,170
forward

00:00:53,379 --> 00:01:03,610
does it whoa what makes him go back in

00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:05,440
and I'm gonna use this to drive the talk

00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:07,830
and I figured I might as well make the

00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:10,750
Telegraph key drive the talk

00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:13,500
figuratively as well as literally so

00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:16,360
there we go

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:19,720
moving right along my name is Lily Ryan

00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:21,780
and my career so far has existed at

00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:25,330
various points on the spectrum between

00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,740
historian and hacker and I really like

00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:28,240
to talk about all of the weird things

00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:30,670
that went down in the past so that we

00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,340
can learn something from them because I

00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:35,079
think that being able to reflect on the

00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:37,240
mistakes and the failures of the past

00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:39,850
helps us to build better teams and do

00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:41,920
better work in the future and the story

00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:44,140
I'm going to tell you today is one of

00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,119
the biggest failures of tech history and

00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:48,980
I want to tell you a bit about how

00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:50,460
reflection worked for that project I

00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:53,619
[Music]

00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:56,829
think that successful reflection comes

00:01:53,619 --> 00:01:58,750
in two halves firstly we want to

00:01:56,829 --> 00:02:01,990
understand how we got to where we are

00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:05,740
and then we want to apply those lessons

00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:08,110
to where we're going next the problem is

00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:11,320
when a team only does the first half of

00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:13,480
this which is what can often happen we

00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:16,390
think about what we did we don't take

00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,450
any lessons from it and then we do it

00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:19,680
again

00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:21,780
and you can get away with this for quite

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,090
a long time if things are going well but

00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:26,879
when things go wrong applying these

00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:28,799
lessons to future actions is quite often

00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:31,620
the only thing that can pull you out of

00:02:28,799 --> 00:02:34,049
a bad cycle and it's usually when we

00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:36,540
fail that our projects are thrust right

00:02:34,049 --> 00:02:38,220
into the spotlight which is the worst

00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:42,510
time this is when we would really rather

00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:46,110
hide on the other hand succeeding at

00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:48,569
something usually feels awesome one of

00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:51,060
my favorite things about the release of

00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:53,310
a successful project is the go live

00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:55,079
celebrations and it doesn't matter much

00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:57,690
to me if this comes in the form of an

00:02:55,079 --> 00:03:00,450
office party or if a few of the teams

00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:01,799
linked off to a bar after work or if the

00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:04,140
team is even actually allowed to

00:03:01,799 --> 00:03:06,209
celebrate at all instead of waiting by

00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:09,930
the build pipeline lighting candles and

00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:12,540
praying that things stay green probably

00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:15,540
one of the best go live parties on

00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:17,069
record happened in 1858 after the

00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:21,900
completion of the first transatlantic

00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:24,329
Telegraph cable to understand why this

00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:26,819
one Telegraph cable was such a big deal

00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:29,370
I need to explain what a Telegraph is

00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:31,049
because it's hardware that's so old that

00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:32,209
it is still not vulnerable to meltdown

00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:35,579
or Spectre

00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:38,430
so most people here per blog probably

00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:39,359
haven't used one that's a picture of a

00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:41,489
telegraph receiver

00:03:39,359 --> 00:03:42,599
these are telegraph keys normally you

00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:44,220
would only have one of them at the one

00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:47,879
end but I've got one for the back and

00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:51,180
one for forward basically Telegraph's

00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:53,160
were the first internet in the Victorian

00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:56,040
era people started to send messages to

00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:59,280
each other along copper wire using basic

00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:01,500
electrical pulses mostly they would use

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,449
Morse code for this this was a system of

00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,940
long and short pulses that correspond to

00:04:03,449 --> 00:04:07,680
the letters of the Roman alphabet so

00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:09,449
you'd write your message down and you

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,879
take it to the telegraph office and an

00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:13,590
operator would key it in and someone at

00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:15,569
the other end would listen to that

00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:19,260
sequence of dots and dashes and write it

00:04:15,569 --> 00:04:20,340
down back into the language and send it

00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,420
on to the person who was meant to

00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:25,270
receive it

00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:27,400
it was better than normal mail because

00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:28,930
electricity can travel much faster than

00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,030
trains or horses

00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:35,500
so Telegraph messages got to their

00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:38,860
recipients much faster and by 1858 both

00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:41,290
North America and Britain had nationwide

00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:43,900
telegraph systems and they'd had them

00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:46,090
for a few decades this was how most

00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:48,790
people did business on on either side of

00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:51,820
the Atlantic Ocean but to send a message

00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:53,590
from Britain to North America or vice

00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:55,540
versa during this same time would take

00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:57,550
several weeks because you would have to

00:04:55,540 --> 00:05:00,180
write it down and put it on a boat and

00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:02,710
sail it across the Atlantic Ocean and

00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:04,330
this was why when the world heard that

00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:05,800
there was now going to be a telegraph

00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:09,220
cable that would connected the two

00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:14,410
continents they went absolutely wild for

00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:17,800
it the 1858 Telegraph cables completion

00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:20,860
was one of the most spectacular go-live

00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:23,080
projects in history go live parties in

00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:25,570
history sorry on both sides of the

00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:27,910
Atlantic people fired cannon and they

00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:30,730
let off fireworks they danced in the

00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:33,460
streets and they wrote reams and reams

00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:39,550
of some of the worst poetry that I've

00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:42,700
ever heard here is some of it tis done

00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:45,370
the angry sea consents the nation's

00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:47,680
stand no more apart with class bird

00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:51,640
hands the continents feel the throbbing

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:54,610
of each other's hearts speed speed the

00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:57,280
cable let it run a loving girdle round

00:05:54,610 --> 00:06:02,160
the earth till all the nations Neath the

00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:04,570
Sun shall be as brothers of one heart

00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,970
believe me there is heaps more where

00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:09,580
that came from

00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:12,730
people really really really loved this

00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:14,950
cable they loved it so much that they

00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:19,150
were still celebrating about it three

00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:21,160
weeks later but the weeks apart hit a

00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:26,140
snag when this brand-new transatlantic

00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:28,660
Telegraph cable went completely dead so

00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:31,560
these days when a big release goes bad

00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:33,850
we usually have some strategies in place

00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:36,040
we don't always assume that things are

00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:39,370
going to work we hope they will

00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:40,930
but we will plan for the worst we might

00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:43,750
have thought of a way to roll the

00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:45,640
changes back if we need to we do a soft

00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:48,400
launch just to make sure things are

00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:50,950
really working but the telegraphed guys

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:53,950
hadn't thought of anything except

00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:57,310
success there was no fallback plan when

00:06:53,950 --> 00:07:03,190
this failed there was just lots and lots

00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:04,570
and lots of a rage we all like to feel

00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:09,070
like our projects are going to change

00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:10,750
the world often they do we change

00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:12,790
people's lives all the time by rolling

00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:14,680
out new stuff to make sure that the

00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:17,800
people who trust us with their business

00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:20,050
can do what they need to do but the

00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,940
transatlantic Telegraph project changed

00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:25,180
the world in a really huge and

00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:27,340
history-making way this kind of makes

00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:29,080
all of the fireworks understandable from

00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:31,450
the Victorian perspective in my opinion

00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:35,050
I don't find the poetry understandable

00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:36,370
but we can put that part aside but I

00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:38,770
also hope that it will help you

00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:43,620
understand just how dramatic things got

00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:46,840
when this amazing cable totally died and

00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:48,460
when your stake holder literally the

00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,780
entire population of two continents

00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:51,130
including the Queen of England who

00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:53,080
because she was the queen of England

00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:55,420
wanted to be the first person to use

00:07:53,080 --> 00:08:00,280
this thing you really feel the heat when

00:07:55,420 --> 00:08:03,100
things go wrong it's always a hard time

00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:04,840
when a project fails and a lot of us

00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:06,760
have experienced this at one time or

00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:08,950
another and if you haven't yet

00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:11,410
believe me you almost certainly will at

00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:13,870
some point no matter how excellent the

00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:15,730
team is or how good the idea is not

00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:18,700
everything is going to go smoothly it's

00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:21,490
just life but failures are also very

00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:22,870
valuable for me they've been the places

00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:25,420
where I've learnt the most about myself

00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:28,480
and got the most valuable feedback about

00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:30,760
my work as a team player my strengths

00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:33,490
under pressure the ability of all of us

00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:35,620
to bounce back when things go wrong and

00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:37,599
I think that reflecting on your work is

00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:40,270
often richer after you've had a failure

00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,930
asking yourself and your team what did

00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:43,180
we learn

00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:45,450
gives us really useful fuel for moving

00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:45,450
on

00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:51,430
unfortunately for the transatlantic

00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:53,620
Telegraph cable team 1858 was only 15

00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:57,400
years after the first computer program

00:08:53,620 --> 00:09:00,940
was written and it was 48 years before

00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:03,430
the first computer was built it was a

00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:05,260
time when the phrase agile retrospective

00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:07,390
would only ever be used to describe

00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:09,070
someone looking over their shoulder for

00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:12,010
bad guys as they sprinted down an

00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:14,470
alleyway they really didn't have any

00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:16,270
models to learn from but this doesn't

00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:18,370
mean that we can't still learn something

00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:20,200
from this project which was one of the

00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:23,020
biggest tech delivery projects in

00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:25,330
history because in many ways it forms

00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:27,880
the cornerstone of every modern delivery

00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:31,210
project and the key person we're gonna

00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:34,990
learn this lesson from is dr. Edward

00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:36,940
orange Wildmon Whitehouse this guy so in

00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:39,010
addition to having the best name and the

00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:42,130
wildest facial hair of his entire team

00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:44,250
he was also the chief electrician of the

00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:47,380
transatlantic Telegraph cable project

00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:49,030
this was basically their tech lead he

00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:53,440
was also the main architect of its

00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:56,610
demise Whitehouse had a history as a

00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:59,050
doctor and scientist and an inventor

00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:01,060
when I was doing research for this I

00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:05,530
pulled up a bunch of patents that he'd

00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:07,780
had for a new type of rollerskate but in

00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:12,070
terms one of the other patents that he

00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:14,530
had released was for Telegraph invention

00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:17,020
he dabbled a bit in telegraphy as part

00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:19,780
of his side projects and patented some

00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:21,790
deviations on Telegraph technology which

00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:23,620
when you look at them today was what

00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:25,060
he'd done was basically he had a forked

00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:26,770
other people's repose and he had changed

00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:31,330
maybe a single line and then he'd put

00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:32,890
all of that out as his work anyway fact

00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:35,920
that he had all of those green squares

00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:37,600
on github had impressed Cyrus field who

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,250
was the American businessman who was

00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,170
providing all of the money for this

00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:44,410
transatlantic Telegraph cable endeavor

00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:46,990
so despite the fact that White House had

00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:49,210
no actual experience with actually

00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:51,520
running or implementing Telegraph

00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:53,290
systems he got appointed as the chief

00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:55,390
electrician of the Atlantic Telegraph

00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:57,830
Company

00:10:55,390 --> 00:11:01,040
the main problem with the transatlantic

00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:02,870
Telegraph cable was that nobody was

00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,990
actually sure if it could actually be

00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:09,770
done I mean we'd had Telegraph

00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:11,030
technology for a little while but we'd

00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:13,550
never really had something that went

00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:16,190
underwater for quite such a long way

00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:19,070
especially no continuous cable that had

00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:21,980
to be unbroken about 3,000 kilometers

00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:23,390
long felt about as impossible as you

00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:25,670
know you think of building a space

00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:28,190
elevator to the moon and the other

00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:30,710
problem was that scientists the time was

00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:32,000
still discovering some of the basic laws

00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:34,700
of physics that we take for granted

00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,860
today electric currents were being used

00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:39,230
for a lot of stuff in 1858 but people

00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:42,110
didn't really understand that much about

00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:43,610
how they worked and this meant but a lot

00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:45,680
of the ideas that people had about how

00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:48,410
to actually build this cable to run this

00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:51,650
entire way and put an electric pulse

00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:54,200
across this such a distance these were

00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:56,750
just guesses and the only way to prove

00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:58,610
or disprove the theory was to build the

00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:00,040
thing which was going to be very

00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:02,360
expensive

00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:04,370
fortunately for everybody Cyrus field

00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:05,930
had absolutely no idea that this was

00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:10,280
supposed to be impossible he just kind

00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:12,680
of hired some people to do it one of the

00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:13,970
other people that field hired to be on

00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,710
the board of his Atlantic Telegraph

00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:18,230
Company was this guy he was a young man

00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:20,990
called William Thompson he had fewer

00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:23,300
cool names and fewer credentials than

00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:25,340
Whitehouse but he was also a keen

00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:27,230
physicist with an interest in

00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:28,820
electricity and telegraphy and he had

00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:31,700
some interesting new ideas about how

00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:33,650
electrical currents worked and feel' had

00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:35,120
discovered Thompson after Thompson had

00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:37,340
written a bunch of proposals about how

00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:40,220
to build the Telegraph cable and feel

00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:43,100
liked his spirit so he hired the guy and

00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:46,340
when Whitehouse met Thompson it was

00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:49,250
rivalry at first sight they hated each

00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:52,760
other Whitehouse was used to being

00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:54,680
listened to and Thompson was younger

00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:57,380
than him and questioning his authority

00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:59,750
and Thompson had his own measure of

00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:02,800
respect with the board and Thompson's

00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:05,660
facial hair wasn't nearly as good as his

00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,460
although later in life he would have

00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:09,050
grow a beard that was so magnificent

00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:14,390
that it would make a hipster

00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:16,490
to see it was amazing the main point of

00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:19,670
contention between the two of them about

00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:20,750
how to build the cables was literally in

00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:22,010
the construction of the cables

00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,720
themselves and how they should be

00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:25,970
designed so that they could hold up to

00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,590
the distance they had to cover and a

00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:30,620
situation they had to cover test and

00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:33,110
still carry a signal so White House

00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:34,580
argued that the copper that was used to

00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:37,160
conduct the signal should have a very

00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:38,720
small diameter but that the voltage that

00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:41,210
was used to carry the signal across

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:44,630
should be very strong kind of like

00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:47,210
yelling the current across the entire

00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:49,250
ocean he also decided that the cable

00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:50,780
should be very heavy so that it would

00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:55,040
sink to the ocean floor and it wouldn't

00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:57,890
move around too much Thompson disagreed

00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:00,890
with White House about every single one

00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:02,600
of these points but White House was

00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:04,700
confident that he was right and he was

00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:06,380
more senior and he refused to hear any

00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:08,210
of Thompson's ideas he was the tech lead

00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:11,030
and Thompson was just this junior guy

00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:13,160
and there also wasn't much time for

00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:15,860
Thompson to persuade somebody as

00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:18,890
stubborn as White House that there were

00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:21,560
other points of view field and the board

00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:22,730
also wanted this project to be completed

00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,800
as quickly as possible

00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:27,710
because they'd gotten their investors

00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,990
and most of the people in Britain and

00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:33,430
America really excited about the project

00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:36,470
everybody wanted it delivered yesterday

00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:38,930
so they rushed out the cable using White

00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:41,600
House's design and they stuck two halves

00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:43,790
of it on two ships one of these ships

00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,220
was going to spool the cable out behind

00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:47,690
it from Newfoundland in the Americas and

00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:50,690
the other ship was going to do the same

00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:52,820
from Western Ireland the idea was that

00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:55,090
they would meet in the middle and join

00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:58,880
up the cable and you would get a working

00:14:55,090 --> 00:15:00,290
transcontinental telegraph cable this

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,840
picture shows a bit about how they were

00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:04,910
loading the cables onto the ship's they

00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:06,860
basically made a little bridge to roll

00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:09,560
them along because they were so heavy

00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:11,690
they weighed about an imperial ton per

00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:13,610
mile they couldn't just be carried on

00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:16,960
they had to feed them onto the boats and

00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:18,920
then feed them back off out at sea

00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:21,260
unfortunately White House's health

00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:22,350
wasn't that great when this project was

00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:24,030
going on

00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:26,400
this meant that it was up to Thompson to

00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:28,410
actually get on the boat that was going

00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:30,390
to carry the cable out to sea and spool

00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:31,860
it across the ocean so the younger man

00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:34,350
had to oversee the project while

00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:37,950
Whitehouse remained on shore and waited

00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:41,660
and the first attempt out to sea was a

00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:44,970
total disaster after about three days

00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:46,920
the incredibly expensive cable snapped

00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:48,900
under its own weight and sank to the

00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:52,700
bottom of the ocean which on my point

00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:52,700
out it was actually designed to do so

00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:57,930
field went and made his excuses to the

00:15:56,310 --> 00:16:00,000
investors and he got some more money to

00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:01,950
make a replacement cable and this is

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,870
what you can see them doing in this

00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:06,000
picture there covering the cables with

00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:08,490
this layer of couple of layers of what

00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,950
they call gutta-percha which is tree sap

00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:13,260
that could be molded soft and then it

00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:14,790
hardens like plastic and this was before

00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:16,560
plastic had been invented so the

00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:19,590
Victorians were using good aperture for

00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:21,860
everything to the point where the trees

00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:24,300
that it came from nearly went extinct

00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:25,860
and then plastic was invented and the

00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:29,580
tree did not go extinct but a lot of

00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:32,250
other things did anyway after about a

00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:34,800
year of very expensive cable making the

00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:36,840
new cable was finally ready and so they

00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:40,020
loaded it onto the ship same way along a

00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:41,790
bridge and set out again the idea the

00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:43,890
second time around was that the two

00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:45,960
ships would start together in the middle

00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:48,320
of the ocean and then go towards the

00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:51,300
coast from there and it took them three

00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:53,610
more tries meeting in the middle and

00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:56,430
spooling it out sailing out again and

00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:59,220
every single time the cables snapped and

00:16:56,430 --> 00:17:01,470
sank I was getting more and more

00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:03,090
expensive and one of their attempts the

00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:04,910
cable was almost completely destroyed by

00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:07,080
a passing whale which you can see here

00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:13,020
this is what I like to call the original

00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:15,480
fail whale but by the fourth attempt

00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:18,720
they had made it the whole way across

00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:20,160
without the cable breaking and it was

00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,230
connected to the local Telegraph

00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:26,190
networks at either end and it was

00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:28,170
declared ready for business and this was

00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:29,910
about the point where the entire Western

00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:31,500
world went completely wild and they

00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:33,600
kicked off that go live party that we

00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:36,220
talked about earlier

00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,980
this was also where Wildmon Whitehouse

00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:41,320
sealed his own fate

00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:43,750
he and Thompson had argued about how the

00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:45,310
cable should be built and now they

00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:48,010
fought about how it should be operated

00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:50,470
as I said earlier Whitehouse had

00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:52,150
designed this system to generate a very

00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:54,870
strong electrical current along the

00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:56,740
entire length of the line and Thompson

00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:58,840
didn't think that this was the greatest

00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:01,660
idea and had managed to convince him to

00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:03,040
put a few brakes on the voltage the

00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:04,690
system wasn't getting nearly as much

00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:07,240
power as it was capable of generating

00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:10,090
but in terms of physics and stuff this

00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:12,100
is actually kind of what you want but as

00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:14,380
the week's went on the demand for the

00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:16,180
Telegraph cable grew and grew and

00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:18,010
letters were piling up at both ends of

00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:19,840
the line waiting to be sent through you

00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:22,210
know Morse code can only send one at a

00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:27,010
time it was not you know there was one

00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:28,750
line so in order to make it faster so he

00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:31,020
thought Whitehouse secretly increased

00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:34,030
the voltage as high as he could make it

00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:37,510
yeah someone's making a noise like they

00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:38,980
know that's a bad idea because White

00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:40,960
House's expectation was that the

00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:42,940
stronger the current the faster and

00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:46,680
clear of the messages would get to the

00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:49,000
other end of the line the reality was

00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:51,880
that this amount of voltage completely

00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,950
fried the extremely expensive cables he

00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:55,540
had overwhelmed them with power which

00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:57,940
meant that they short-circuited into the

00:18:55,540 --> 00:19:00,600
sea and some of the nearby sharks had

00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:03,880
boiled fish for dinner

00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:06,790
so the upshot of White House's secret

00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:10,330
tinkering with the system in Prague mind

00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:11,980
you meant that this famous cable was

00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:14,560
completely dead within three weeks of

00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:17,740
going live and the world was very angry

00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:19,510
and so with fires filled and so is the

00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:21,550
entire board of the Atlantic Telegraph

00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:24,520
Company because they literally had one

00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:26,100
job it was in the name and they hadn't

00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:29,860
managed to do it

00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:31,780
this is to put it in modern terms about

00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:34,120
as big a disaster as if the entire

00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:35,440
internet had gone down and they didn't

00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:38,010
know if they were ever going to be able

00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,010
to get it back

00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:43,800
when a project fails this spectacularly

00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:45,600
and when this much money is involved

00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:48,060
there's usually a lot of public head

00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:51,960
scratching and soul-searching about what

00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:54,300
went wrong and where questions get asked

00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:56,370
and as you would probably expect the

00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:58,800
best companies will take some time to

00:19:56,370 --> 00:20:01,740
step back step back and reflect on

00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:03,950
what's happened to see what lessons they

00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:06,480
can learn to make it better

00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:08,190
and while most of the board of the

00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,590
Atlantic Telegraph company were doing

00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:13,740
precisely this the one man who wasn't

00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:15,900
was Edward orange wildmen Whitehouse he

00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:18,150
had skipped right across reflection and

00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:20,760
into blame which is a pip that it is

00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:22,890
unfortunately very easy to fall into he

00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,900
didn't want to reflect because he knew

00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:29,010
whose fault it was

00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:31,530
everybody's except for him and the

00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:34,500
public was so angry with the failure of

00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:36,570
this cable that it demanded and it got a

00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:38,760
public inquiry into the whole project

00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:40,740
this is one of the first project

00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:43,740
retrospectives to take place in front of

00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:46,740
two entire continents during this

00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:49,080
inquiry William Thompson testified to

00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:51,680
the reams of his advice that had been

00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:54,390
ignored by the chief electrician and

00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:56,630
other stepped in to testify to the fact

00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:59,100
that they had seen the chief electrician

00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:01,290
messing with the voltage on the cable in

00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:02,760
the weeks after its completion which was

00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:04,290
completely against what the board had

00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:08,340
decided to do and against all known

00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:10,580
scientific advice getting feedback like

00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:13,200
this is always a bit of a blow

00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:16,020
especially when you thought that you've

00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:18,930
been doing a good job getting feedback

00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:20,640
like this publicly is even harder it is

00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:22,920
natural to feel defensive when this

00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,990
happens and honestly public feedback

00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:27,000
about specific individuals is generally

00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:30,390
not a great idea but that's what

00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:33,150
happened in this case and it's not

00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:35,520
usually a great idea because it often

00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:39,090
leads to situations like what followed

00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:41,640
after this White House hadn't entered

00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:43,110
into the inquiry with an open mind but

00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:45,690
honestly he hadn't entered into the

00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:48,180
entire project with an open mind he was

00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:50,640
a self righteous Victorian era gentleman

00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:51,250
scientist and a doctor and a member of

00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,380
the royal

00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:54,910
Society and he was used to being treated

00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:56,880
as though that meant he could do

00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:58,960
whatever he wanted

00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,910
unfortunately for White House there was

00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:03,960
no software development community in

00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:06,900
1858 to suggest to him how he might

00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:10,540
tactfully handle this kind of situation

00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:12,970
so he did what angry self-righteous

00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:16,210
victorian-era gentlemen scientists would

00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:21,610
do he published a pamphlet about the

00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:23,920
whole affair gasp and he sent it to all

00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:27,910
the papers and he had them publish it to

00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:29,440
the pamphlet was called it was kind of

00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:32,560
understated it was called the Atlantic

00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:36,040
Telegraph but a better title might have

00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:40,060
been everyone is wrong except me the

00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:42,310
greatest scientist in the world I could

00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:43,930
describe what was in it but I'm going to

00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:48,460
let Whitehouse speak for himself here

00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:51,040
because it's better the charges leveled

00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:54,280
against my ignorant unsuspicious are

00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:57,160
three three of the most derogatory and

00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:59,890
detrimental not merely to the fame of a

00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:03,670
public but to the character of a private

00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:08,890
man in the one case however error is but

00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:12,040
human in the other disgrace from the

00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:15,160
first my advice and wishes as projector

00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:17,380
had been disregarded and overruled and

00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:20,170
as an officer I had constantly been

00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:23,620
thwarted and obstructed in my operations

00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:25,930
I do not shrink therefore from the

00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:27,850
avowal that customed to such treatment

00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:29,680
and aware of the incompetence and

00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:32,290
division of counsel existing on the

00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:34,720
board I determined to do my best on my

00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:39,430
own responsibility to save the

00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:41,080
enterprise from destruction like it was

00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:45,970
Star Trek yeah

00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:48,750
I make no appeal ad mr. cottham I seek

00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:50,910
for no sympathy on scientific grounds

00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:53,980
sufficient for me that I have been

00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:56,950
identified and from the first with that

00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:58,750
great prodigy of this age which may

00:23:56,950 --> 00:24:02,470
become a new starting point in history

00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:04,660
until the end of time a great

00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:06,940
responsibility rests upon those who have

00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:09,430
in any way contributed to the failure of

00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:12,580
this enterprise but for my own part I

00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:15,850
can safely say that neither zeal labor

00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:18,190
caution nor anxiety was wanting upon the

00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:18,730
part of Edward orange Wildmon white

00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:21,940
house

00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:23,970
and then he signed it at the bottom so

00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:26,730
you knew it was him

00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:30,070
so it may surprise you to learn that

00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:32,650
publishing this defensive pamphlet did

00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:34,870
not really convince anyone that the

00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:39,160
failure of the Telegraph cable was not

00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:40,960
somehow White House's fault at any rate

00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:42,820
it convinced lots of people that whether

00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,650
or not the cable had been ruined because

00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:46,810
of White House's failure to listen to

00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:48,340
anyone else they sure as hell did not

00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:52,780
want to work with him on any other

00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:54,850
project after this he was unasked to be

00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:57,430
chief electrician of the transatlantic

00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:58,900
Telegraph cable company which was fine

00:24:57,430 --> 00:25:02,020
by him because he didn't want to work

00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:03,670
with them anyway and he folded his arms

00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:06,090
and he stormed off and went to his room

00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:06,090
or something

00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:11,410
unfortunately I've seen many projects

00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:14,470
even in this day and age in this way and

00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:16,990
this is a real shame because in 1858 we

00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:19,930
knew that this was a really bad way to

00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:21,490
run a team it was kind of vyas there are

00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:23,260
a few things I want to highlight out of

00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:26,730
this Telegraph cable affair that I think

00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:29,790
are really important firstly

00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:32,500
open-mindedness among your team is

00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:36,130
crucial to success but it's also crucial

00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:37,900
to good failure constructive reflection

00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:39,490
can't happen if there are members of

00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:41,290
your team who aren't open to being

00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:43,090
challenged or to having their minds

00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:47,170
changed even by people who are

00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:49,030
considered junior to them secondly if

00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:52,210
the project gets to the point that

00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:53,200
things are really bad feedback should be

00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:56,430
given sense

00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:59,740
and with tact and most importantly

00:25:56,430 --> 00:26:01,570
privately people are naturally going to

00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:03,490
get defensive if they feel like they're

00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:05,230
being attacked and especially if they

00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:10,540
feel like they're having their value

00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:12,460
challenged in public thirdly in order to

00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:13,840
be effective retrospectives should

00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:16,510
generally follow the prime directive

00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:18,820
which is here regardless of what we

00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:20,710
discover we understand and truly believe

00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:22,330
that everyone did the best job they

00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:25,090
could given what they knew at the time

00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:27,750
their skills and abilities the resources

00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:30,100
available and the situation at hand

00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:31,870
having something like this on the wall

00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:35,230
if you're starting a formal

00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:37,390
retrospective creates a safe space for

00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:39,520
reflection where people can openly

00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:41,350
discuss failures without fear of being

00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:44,260
blamed for them they can discuss them as

00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:45,730
the failure itself it's also a good

00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:47,830
reminder for everyone in the retro that

00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:49,750
blame is not appropriate

00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:51,220
I often print it out and put it on the

00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:54,370
wall before a star of the retro that's

00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:57,070
just me I think it can help finally

00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:59,740
there's no room for hero behavior in a

00:26:57,070 --> 00:27:02,620
strong team the story of the first

00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:04,540
transatlantic Telegraph cable might have

00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:07,380
been very different if the project

00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:09,520
didn't include Wildmon Whitehouse and

00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:11,320
while there were definitely problems

00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:13,690
with the way that the inquiry after the

00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:15,910
failure of the cable was handled they

00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:17,410
may not have even needed one if they had

00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:20,710
appointed someone else to be chief

00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:22,300
electrician in the first place one of

00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:25,480
the strongest findings of this inquiry

00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:27,820
was that White House's behavior was a

00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:29,290
huge problem most particularly his

00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:31,570
inability to listen to the advice of

00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:33,340
others and his tendency to run off on

00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:35,440
his own and make crucial changes to the

00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:38,280
project without telling anyone else

00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:40,660
especially while it was live and

00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:43,270
occasionally you will get people who

00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:45,250
want to be seen as heroes this is

00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:46,840
because our culture often romanticizes

00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:48,700
the idea of someone who swoops in and

00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:51,390
saves the world all by themselves and

00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:53,620
this is all really cool if you're Batman

00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:55,480
but if you've ever watched a Batman

00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:58,000
movie you'll see how many innocent

00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:59,650
people get their legs broken or you know

00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,500
they're gonna smash building crushing

00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:03,460
they're parked car when Batman's chasing

00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:05,680
after a bad guy

00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:06,870
and the same thing happens with heroes

00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:09,460
on projects

00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:10,690
they might get some personal glory when

00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:12,250
it's all said and done but the team

00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:14,650
members who ended up with those broken

00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:16,690
legs and smashed cars I'm not going to

00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:17,980
remember that person fondly and they

00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:19,110
probably won't want to work with them

00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:22,270
again

00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:24,610
all in all hero behavior makes for a

00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:26,470
terrible team environment and we all

00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:29,890
know that unhappy teams don't do good

00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:31,210
work here is a quick recap of all of

00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:34,350
that in case you missed any of it

00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:37,410
firstly open mindedness is crucial

00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:40,500
secondly treat feedback sensitively

00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:43,630
thirdly remember the prime directive and

00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:49,780
fourth there's no room for Heroes on a

00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:51,400
strong team so with the moral of this

00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:53,290
story over you might be wondering what

00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:57,460
happened to the Telegraph cable after

00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:59,200
the dramatic pamphlet incident and

00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:00,910
you'll be pleased to learn that the

00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,320
Atlantic Telegraph Company did learn

00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:04,930
something about teamwork from their

00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:07,710
first iteration they appointed William

00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:10,540
Thompson as the next chief electrician

00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:12,430
this was great because in addition to

00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:14,320
having far more solid ideas about

00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:16,240
physics than his predecessor he was also

00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:18,430
delightful to work with and he knew how

00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,530
to treat his team with respect and at

00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:22,810
this point the Western world's demand

00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:25,690
for transatlantic Telegraph cable was so

00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:28,060
large and the Atlantic Telegraph company

00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:30,730
had by now had so much experience laying

00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:32,530
telegraph cable across the sea that they

00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:35,380
didn't have much trouble getting more

00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:37,450
money to try again which was good at

00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:40,270
this time they built the cables the

00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:42,730
exact opposite of white houses they were

00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:44,770
large in diameter and not quite so heavy

00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:46,360
so that instead they could be flexible

00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:48,640
and move with sea currents and things

00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:52,450
like that and they used a comparatively

00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:54,220
tiny amount of voltage to power them so

00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:56,290
they built these they put them on the

00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:57,880
ships they went out to sea they started

00:29:56,290 --> 00:30:00,090
to lay the cable out and the first time

00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:03,280
they went out the cable snapped again

00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:05,680
but because they've been through this so

00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:07,330
many times by now Thompson and his crew

00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,860
knew enough that they were able to

00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:11,860
retrieve the cable from the ocean floor

00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:13,810
and repair it and then they also went

00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:15,280
back for a second cable and by the time

00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:17,620
that that second cable had reached both

00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:19,020
coasts they'd repaired the one the of

00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:23,790
the first one and hooked

00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:26,580
up as well so then there were two cables

00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:30,360
across the Atlantic and this time they

00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:33,690
worked and after they had tested it to

00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:35,550
make sure that it really worked the

00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:37,650
whole Western world had another wild go

00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:40,020
life party and eventually they laid

00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:40,950
undersea telephone lines even more

00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:42,840
eventually they were undersea

00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:45,180
fiber-optic lines and video chats and

00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:46,950
cat gifts and we all lived happily ever

00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:49,700
after in an interconnected world

00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:49,700
the end

00:30:49,790 --> 00:31:02,510
