Ever wondered about being your own boss? Then this talk is for you. Good experience, bad experience: I’ve had some of both as a startup founder and freelancer in the 23 years after I left my last salaried job. Let me share them with you.

Whether you love your job or hate it, at some time you’ve probably wondered what it would be like to work for your self. 

Maybe you’re working on a sideproject and wonder how you could make some money from it? Or maybe you have the idea for the next Facebook or Uber?

To be a coder in today’s world of work is to have amazing opportunities to design the business life you want. You can work remotely; you can write books, or teach, or consult, with anyone anywhere.

You can have a crazy idea on Friday and have it running by Monday. Design your architecture to use cloud computing, so your tiny team can scale up your huge ideas.

Or keep it small, and just earn some extra money with a Wordpress plugin, or a training course.

It has been 23 years since I last had a ‘real job’ and a regular income.

I survived creating and running a company through the madness of the dotcom years. I made money from sideprojects, that I had started just for fun and for learning. I have freelanced without needing to use an agency to find the work.

Listen to my stories and learn from my mistakes and successes.

	00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:12,849
good morning

00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:12,849
buenos dias BOM dia

00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:21,330
can you hear me at the back fantastic

00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:23,640
so it's absolutely delightful to be here

00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:27,090
thank you very much to the Django con

00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:30,449
people for inviting me this is my first

00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:32,129
ever django con which is a bit of a

00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:34,770
surprise to me because I've been using

00:00:32,129 --> 00:00:37,160
it since it was written probably 10

00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,160
years or more

00:00:37,699 --> 00:00:44,250
I'm absolutely knocked out by the fact

00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:47,160
they are doing live subtitling I shall

00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:50,630
try to talk slow enough that they can

00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,630
understand what I say

00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:57,860
so I I do tend to talk very fast as you

00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:02,399
will find out when you meet me in person

00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:03,480
later I'm going to have to try to talk

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:08,039
talk slowly

00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:11,250
anyway here I am and here is my talk 23

00:01:08,039 --> 00:01:15,420
years without a proper job it's almost

00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:18,149
exactly 23 years since I last had a

00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:21,119
salaried job or what my mum and dad

00:01:18,149 --> 00:01:25,679
would have called a proper job and in

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:29,610
that time I have enjoyed myself enormous

00:01:25,679 --> 00:01:34,740
ly doing tech work and getting paid for

00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:37,979
it without having a salary so to start

00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:41,190
with I I ran my own company I had his

00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:44,690
crazy idea about this was the early days

00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:48,780
of the internet becoming famous and well

00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:50,660
widespread and I had the idea that maybe

00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,509
digital cash would be the next big thing

00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:56,940
so I started a digital cash company in

00:01:53,509 --> 00:01:58,619
1995 and it didn't quite work out

00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:02,759
because the world wasn't really ready

00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:05,729
for it so after 8 years of running my

00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:10,319
digital cash company I went back to more

00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:11,970
conventional self-employment since it

00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:14,580
since then I've been freelancing I've

00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:17,160
been self-employed

00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,810
I'm currently contracted into the

00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,810
Scottish government to help with some of

00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:23,640
their infrastructure work what I want to

00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:26,400
share with you is some of the lessons

00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,510
that I've learned along the way so that

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:33,959
you can avoid making the

00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:34,829
mistakes that I've made so this talk is

00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:38,879
for you

00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:43,170
if you've ever thought about ditching

00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:46,620
the day job about trying to make your

00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:52,079
working life work for you rather than

00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:55,680
you working for it we are amongst the

00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:58,650
most lucky people in the world because

00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:01,230
we tech people who do coding for a

00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:04,950
living we have the opportunity to frame

00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:09,000
the way we work to suit us we can work

00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:13,200
anywhere we can work at any time of the

00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,750
day that suits us not all jobs let you

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,459
do that if you are a bus driver for

00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:22,049
example you have to show up when the bus

00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:23,579
timetable says so but we we can work as

00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:24,810
long as we have our laptops and we have

00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:28,980
an internet connection we can work from

00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:33,239
anywhere what we have to do is to work

00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:37,590
out how we get a job that lets us do

00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:41,099
that how our employer will be happy to

00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:43,500
have you working remotely easiest way I

00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:45,389
found of making that possible is to work

00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,160
for yourself because then you are your

00:03:45,389 --> 00:03:54,180
own employer and you can set your own

00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:56,639
rules so Who am I that might not look

00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:59,370
like me but that was me many years ago

00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:00,090
when I had the digital cache company

00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:04,980
inter trader

00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:07,230
it's a classic bit of indirect benefit

00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:09,000
from being female the reason I'm on the

00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:11,040
cover of this magazine was not because I

00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,250
was hugely successful because I wasn't

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:18,030
at the time I was just odd I was a

00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:20,130
female doing a tech startup when there

00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:23,580
weren't many startups around at all and

00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:24,960
there were very very few women so if you

00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:27,630
actually looked at this magazine that

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:32,370
I'm on the cover of the actual article

00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:33,630
is a single column about page 23 but

00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:37,409
just because I was female they put me on

00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:41,340
the cover fantastic doesn't look much

00:04:37,409 --> 00:04:43,440
like me I took that that home to my dad

00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:46,980
and said what do you think of this and

00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,750
he went well what I'm good this what do

00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:52,890
you think of it well what am I looking

00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:54,780
at it's me you couldn't recognize me I

00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:56,250
didn't actually look like that then

00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:58,350
either they'd airbrushed out all the

00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:01,160
freckles they'd done lots of clever

00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:06,480
stuff but it was me

00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:08,730
so this talk isn't going to be all about

00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:12,390
me but I will just quickly tell you who

00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:14,880
I am I am a freelancer I do DevOps I do

00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:16,710
full stack I am next going to be

00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:22,400
available in the autumn should that be

00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:24,870
of interest I like doing conferences I

00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:29,250
enjoy speaking at them even though I'm

00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:31,530
terrified whilst doing it I'm going to

00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:32,970
co-host the engineering track on ed

00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:34,860
inverse cheering festivals so if you're

00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:37,740
coming to Edinburgh for either Europe

00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:38,160
Python or for the cheering festival come

00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:41,430
say hello

00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,650
I'll be there for some reason I don't

00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:46,920
quite understand people keep asking me

00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:51,320
to do keynotes so I've done your Python

00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:53,880
I've done now Django current Europe and

00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:55,350
Python web last last year I want to do a

00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:57,360
shout out for Python web by the way

00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:59,040
because it's only about 200 kilometers

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,660
down the road from here really good

00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:03,840
conference if you're interested in doing

00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:07,110
web type of Python and Django stuff is

00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:11,330
good good comments coding and I found it

00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:13,950
loves me as well as the digital cache

00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:16,350
company I have a habit of starting

00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:17,610
things I'm good at starting not so good

00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:21,900
at finishing really good at starting

00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:25,080
stuff that's me is my side project it's

00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:27,000
an e-book search site and if you like

00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:29,910
ebooks and you want to buy them cheap

00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,440
it's really good but it's not really

00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:36,990
done as a side project to make money

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:39,450
what it is is somewhere I can learn all

00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:43,110
the technical stuff that I need to be

00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:46,200
able to do when I go and pitch myself to

00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:47,760
do the paid work it's a fantastic

00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:50,100
technical playground where I can play

00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:52,830
with whatever technology I feel like

00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:54,630
looking into at the time and doing with

00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:58,290
a real project as opposed to

00:06:54,630 --> 00:07:01,920
testing exercises helps me understand

00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:03,840
the technology much much better than if

00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:06,960
I was just going to buy a book and learn

00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:09,570
the code the easy way trying to actually

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:13,740
get it new technology to do something

00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:15,750
real is absolutely a fantastic thing to

00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:18,720
do with a side-project don't do it you

00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:20,970
can do it for the money but don't you

00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,950
don't have to the money might come

00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:25,260
because you have had the side project

00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:26,820
and in this case I've been up and

00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:29,310
running this now for I think it's eight

00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:34,320
years and I've made quite a lot of money

00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:36,870
from it indirectly because I'm doing

00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:39,390
this I've got to play with real-time

00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:40,770
data which got me into firebase which

00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:43,500
got me to become a Google developer

00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:45,870
expert because I'm interested in

00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:48,120
real-time data I started getting into

00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:50,010
Jango channels I don't know if Andrew

00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:57,800
Godwin is in the room but if you are

00:07:50,010 --> 00:08:00,750
thank you for Jango channels yes so I

00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:03,450
think as technical people we need to

00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:05,310
explore what we do all the time to play

00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:07,110
with stuff it's not just about work it's

00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:09,510
about play find out what it is do you

00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:12,390
want to do and learn because if you're

00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:14,400
not learning in this industry this is

00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:16,740
one of the the single biggest things

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,830
I've learnt after working in tech for

00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:22,530
three decades now if you're not learning

00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:25,860
and you're bored at what you do it's

00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:28,740
your fault because there's so much out

00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:29,880
there to learn to do that is new that's

00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:35,520
where the fun is

00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:38,849
to me and working should be fun but it's

00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:40,080
not about me it's about you presumably

00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:42,360
some of you are here because you like

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:46,250
the sound of the talk about how do you

00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,250
make money from what you do

00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:53,360
now the classic idea is you have a have

00:08:52,339 --> 00:08:55,519
a brilliant idea

00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,379
safe example you you think it's a

00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:01,069
digital cash startup might be a great

00:08:57,379 --> 00:09:03,379
idea so you leave your job you raise the

00:09:01,069 --> 00:09:06,050
money you hire some staff you get

00:09:03,379 --> 00:09:08,779
investors board of directors all of that

00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:11,449
stuff that is one way of doing it you

00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:14,750
may end up being the next Facebook or

00:09:11,449 --> 00:09:16,490
the next Skyscanner or the next name the

00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:19,339
company that you you think you would

00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:22,250
like to have been an early adopter with

00:09:19,339 --> 00:09:24,589
early started with we don't have to make

00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:27,319
that big jump and one of the things that

00:09:24,589 --> 00:09:31,310
I have learned is that it's a really

00:09:27,319 --> 00:09:33,230
good idea to start smaller even if you

00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:36,889
have the idea that you want to start a

00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:40,970
big company you don't have to do that as

00:09:36,889 --> 00:09:45,829
your first step into the unknown what

00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:48,019
she can do is learn how to run a company

00:09:45,829 --> 00:09:50,300
now in my case I knew I was always

00:09:48,019 --> 00:09:53,059
wanted to run a company so the

00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:55,220
preparation I did for it apart from the

00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:56,959
technical knowledge I was learning was I

00:09:55,220 --> 00:10:00,309
thinking well if I want to run a big

00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:02,420
company I better understand accounting

00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:05,000
so I took myself off and didn't a

00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:08,660
diploma in accounting and finance as a

00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,459
evening class which was fantastic you

00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:12,079
useful when I actually did start the

00:10:10,459 --> 00:10:15,259
company and I wanted to make sure that

00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:18,680
the accountants worked for me not me for

00:10:15,259 --> 00:10:22,040
them when they were telling me how can I

00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:24,199
put it politely nonsense and telling me

00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,699
what I had to do and I don't know that's

00:10:24,199 --> 00:10:29,779
not right because you don't understand

00:10:25,699 --> 00:10:32,259
that figure I do so if you want to do a

00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:34,370
big company and you want to be the boss

00:10:32,259 --> 00:10:36,170
understand what it is that you need to

00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:38,500
have as well as the tech knowledge and

00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:44,480
the great idea to make that successful

00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:47,809
and you can start really small you don't

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:51,370
have to have on a big SAS service one of

00:10:47,809 --> 00:10:55,660
the things in the startup world that I

00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:58,990
circulate around is we do this

00:10:55,660 --> 00:11:01,180
this idea that you can start with the

00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:03,370
smallest possible thing it doesn't have

00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:08,650
to be a service it could be a book it

00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:11,380
could be a course it could be a a tiny

00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:14,650
little ebook that shares knowledge and

00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:17,080
get you through the process of learning

00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:20,980
how to sell to people because for most

00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:23,530
of us as tech people we are famous for

00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:26,080
being introverts the idea of being

00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:29,200
somebody that goes and says I've done

00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:32,680
this pay me for it that's that's quite a

00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,330
hard thing for us to do so you have to

00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:37,330
get used to doing it you have to get

00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:40,530
used to practicing those things that are

00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:47,530
hard so that you can get better at it so

00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:51,730
a small thing like if you do WordPress

00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:55,570
for example a small plug-in could be the

00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:58,080
start of your self-employed career you

00:11:55,570 --> 00:12:01,420
don't have to think of it as a long-term

00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:04,360
investment if you do something like a

00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:06,880
book there is no support cost if you do

00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:08,710
something like an online online training

00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,660
course you might choose to offer that

00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:13,240
support as a part of the the offering

00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:15,760
but you don't have to but what it does

00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:17,800
get you to do is something you can do it

00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,800
in your spare time whilst you're still

00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:23,620
being salivate but it gets you on the

00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:29,530
road to being that person that controls

00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:33,490
their working life you could do it you

00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:37,480
could do a service the great thing about

00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:40,630
having a service offering is it's the

00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:42,460
curving revenue which is a kind of thing

00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:45,610
that accountants get very happy about

00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:48,990
they like recurring revenue because it

00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:53,110
means you can forecast what next month's

00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:55,090
income is likely to be in a way that if

00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:57,190
you're selling single one-off books you

00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:59,350
just don't know people might buy the

00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:01,030
book and never talk to you again but a

00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:03,820
service once they've signed up if you're

00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:06,040
doing something useful then they will

00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:09,670
keep paying you month after month but

00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:12,579
the downside is you have to keep share

00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:14,680
month after month after month and doing

00:13:12,579 --> 00:13:19,350
the support and quite often what people

00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:22,180
do is to forget that support costs money

00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:23,860
if it's yourself that's running the

00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:28,569
business you might say but that's okay

00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:30,819
because my time is free that's the wrong

00:13:28,569 --> 00:13:34,269
way to look at it your time is your most

00:13:30,819 --> 00:13:37,079
valuable resource so you really need to

00:13:34,269 --> 00:13:42,550
think how you're going to spend that

00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:44,499
time well and what I suggest to people

00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:47,230
who who talk to me about business ideas

00:13:44,499 --> 00:13:49,660
is even if you are going to do the whole

00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:52,600
thing yourself as I tend to do with my

00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:54,430
project you can code it you can support

00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,410
it you can promote it you can sell it

00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:58,749
even if you are doing it yourself and

00:13:56,410 --> 00:14:03,850
you are therefore not charging yourself

00:13:58,749 --> 00:14:06,100
any money because you are free cost it

00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:07,990
as though you were paying somebody to do

00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:11,829
that because if you're going to scale

00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:13,360
the idea beyond just you somebody else

00:14:11,829 --> 00:14:16,629
is going to want to be paid for their

00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:19,149
time so you may as well get that in the

00:14:16,629 --> 00:14:21,750
model from the outset so that you can

00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:26,069
understand whether it is a for-profit

00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:26,069
profitable idea or not

00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:39,029
you can publish stuff now a lot of

00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:44,399
people make money from indirect methods

00:14:39,029 --> 00:14:48,600
they stay publish reap of blogs and V

00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:51,620
logs video blogs and then they monetize

00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:53,550
it through the advertising mechanism

00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:55,529
this is something I have not actually

00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:57,269
done yet so I can't really talk about it

00:14:55,529 --> 00:15:02,790
but I have seen people being very

00:14:57,269 --> 00:15:06,209
successful at it so there are many ways

00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:10,410
in which you can make money from it what

00:15:06,209 --> 00:15:11,610
the accountants call monetization it

00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:15,180
doesn't have to be a straightforward

00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:16,709
sell I don't have to give you a book and

00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:19,230
you give me ten dollars it doesn't have

00:15:16,709 --> 00:15:21,589
to be that although that can work very

00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:21,589
well

00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:28,829
affiliate Commission is how I make money

00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:32,579
at the moment who loves me if you buy a

00:15:28,829 --> 00:15:35,670
book through my site I've signed up with

00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:38,819
Amazon with Kobo with Apple so that when

00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:41,220
I send traffic to them and that day but

00:15:38,819 --> 00:15:44,220
people buy through that connection I

00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:45,689
will get a small percentage of it and it

00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:48,029
doesn't cost the person behind the book

00:15:45,689 --> 00:15:50,100
anymore because because Apple and Amazon

00:15:48,029 --> 00:15:52,319
--ax take that as a cost of doing

00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:54,589
business they expect to have to pay

00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:57,300
something for the traffic that they get

00:15:54,589 --> 00:16:00,149
so that can work quite well it doesn't

00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:02,069
work so well when your your your service

00:16:00,149 --> 00:16:04,439
is cheap ebooks which is what my site

00:16:02,069 --> 00:16:06,209
does because when I tell you about a

00:16:04,439 --> 00:16:09,839
book being on sale for a dollar and you

00:16:06,209 --> 00:16:12,660
buy it I get six cents so fantastic

00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:16,920
that's not going to keep me in beer but

00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:21,569
it adds up B can also sell advertising

00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:25,050
because what you do if you're serving a

00:16:21,569 --> 00:16:27,000
particular targeted market somebody else

00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:32,130
wants to get to that market so

00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:34,139
advertising can be done well and it can

00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:36,870
make money it doesn't have to be the

00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:37,889
offered experience that we all know when

00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:41,730
you go to a site and you're just

00:16:37,889 --> 00:16:45,480
bombarded with bye-bye-bye

00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:48,100
but a more a better way perhaps of doing

00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:50,680
that kind of advertising revenue is to

00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:52,030
go for sponsorship which is if you've

00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:54,880
listened to pop podcasts quite often

00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:57,310
they'll have a a message from our

00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:01,150
sponsor so you don't actually have an

00:16:57,310 --> 00:17:04,060
advertising break as such but they they

00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:05,980
the sponsor is paying for the podcast to

00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:07,930
be produced and they get a mention

00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:12,610
because of it so it's kind of like

00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:15,069
advertising but it's a bit more formal

00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:16,810
of a relationship the data analytics

00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:20,199
this is where I've made the most money

00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:22,709
and it's not by doing anything creepy

00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:25,510
like Facebook kind of selling on data

00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:28,020
but through my website at the book site

00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:31,330
I've got an awful lot of data about what

00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:34,990
people are buying and what prices

00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:36,940
they're buying at now that is really

00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:40,060
valuable information if you are a book

00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:41,710
publisher so I make my sixth sense when

00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:43,450
you buy the book through my site I

00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:46,900
actually made about a hundred thousand

00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:49,450
pounds through selling data about what

00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:51,610
people people are doing that's much more

00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:55,680
interesting number two to be thinking

00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:59,020
about so if you are doing anything where

00:17:55,680 --> 00:18:04,660
your project is capable of collecting

00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:08,460
the data not the personal data that we

00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:10,330
are being warned about through GDP are

00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:14,940
that doesn't have to be what you're

00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:17,920
selling it can be a very honest sale of

00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:19,780
people are buying more crime at this

00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:23,230
voice than they're buying romance at

00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:25,150
that price or in the u.s. their

00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:27,130
expectation is that they will pay ten

00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:30,520
dollars for a book whereas in the UK

00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:33,340
it's two pounds that sort of information

00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:37,060
is hugely valuable so do not

00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:39,240
underestimate it I'm gonna give you a

00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:39,240
few examples

00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:50,330
people always say to me oh you can't

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:52,850
make money out of writing an e-book but

00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:56,000
yes you can I don't know if anybody here

00:18:52,850 --> 00:19:00,320
has tried the meteor real-time data

00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,630
system it's it's it's pretty good I've

00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:06,350
moved away from it now I've Janko

00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:11,080
channels and firebase but the story here

00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:15,680
is that two guys Sasha grief and Tom

00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:19,190
Coleman Coleman wrote a book about this

00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:21,590
new technology because the documentation

00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:27,380
that came with the technology was not as

00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:30,880
good as the actual software was so

00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:33,740
because they wrote a very good book and

00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:36,950
it's an absolute classic example of how

00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:39,920
to write a technical educational book

00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:41,960
lots of code examples lots of github

00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:43,520
repositories to say this is exactly what

00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:47,390
you need to do and this is how you do

00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:48,800
that particular thing everybody who want

00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:53,780
to do anything with meteor bought this

00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:56,600
book so when I looked at the stats a

00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:59,210
couple years ago they'd made $300,000

00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:01,790
from it over 18 months I think they've

00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:03,560
made a lot more sense and it was a

00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:07,010
self-published book they didn't have to

00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:11,030
get a contract from a publishing house

00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:12,650
they didn't have to pitch it to anybody

00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:16,420
they just wrote it and started selling

00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:16,420
it and started making money

00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:24,639
people say but you can't make money as a

00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:27,580
solo founder well 1/10 of you any of you

00:20:24,639 --> 00:20:28,720
use balsamic it's absolutely fantastic

00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:31,450
wireframing

00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:35,950
tool that was started as a solo business

00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:38,830
by Pelle Dee who is now when I when I

00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:40,870
did this talk a couple of years ago he

00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:43,960
was talking about profits of annual

00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:45,460
profits of two million checked a couple

00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:48,100
of days ago it's now annual profits of

00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:50,200
six million it's not doing it by himself

00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:52,960
anymore that's about twenty people but

00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:58,870
still that's the solo founder started a

00:20:52,960 --> 00:21:00,639
hugely successful business people say oh

00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:05,740
you can do this in the USA but you can't

00:21:00,639 --> 00:21:07,059
do it here nonsense we're seeing so many

00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:09,250
great companies where I live in

00:21:07,059 --> 00:21:10,710
Edinburgh in Scotland we have a very

00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:13,269
successful company called Skyscanner

00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:16,090
that was started by three people on a

00:21:13,269 --> 00:21:19,840
kitchen table to do travel pricing

00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:23,909
comparison and it just got sold for come

00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:29,500
up with two billion quid a lot of money

00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:32,799

eleven he Patrick McKenzie he's a great

00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:37,120
speaker if you ever get chance to see

00:21:34,149 --> 00:21:41,440
him he has made a very successful

00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:43,690
business out of being the kind of tech

00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,690
person who can talk tech to management

00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:48,970
and management attack and above all make

00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:53,259
money from it and not being afraid to

00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:55,690
charge his colon mantras charge more no

00:21:53,259 --> 00:21:57,220
more even more charge more if you're

00:21:55,690 --> 00:22:01,509
doing something that's useful and people

00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:05,460
want it they will pay for it be happy to

00:22:01,509 --> 00:22:05,460
accept that what you do is worthwhile

00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:13,460
there's always a reason why we go but

00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:17,270
yes Rachel yeah you're talking great but

00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:21,380
I can't do it no no not me well you can

00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:22,180
you can anybody if they want to they can

00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:26,270
do it

00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:28,430
John Merrow is somebody that I have

00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:29,360
never yet met in public in person but I

00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:32,090
would love to

00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:34,670
he has made a successful business out of

00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:39,170
Tech and he cannot move from the neck

00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:42,020
down so if he can do it I can do it and

00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:45,050
you can do it he runs a company about

00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:48,080
logging his particular craft is words he

00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:52,100
does fantastically good writing and

00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:53,630
teaching people how to write good words

00:22:52,100 --> 00:23:00,980
and make money from it through his

00:22:53,630 --> 00:23:03,890
blogging site so you can you can do it

00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:06,470
you can start small I encourage you to

00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:09,350
start small but don't stop there think

00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:11,240
big but learn your craft because in the

00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:13,760
same way as we have to learn how to code

00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:17,810
from a starting point which is hello

00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:20,150
world we need if we're going to work for

00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:24,380
ourselves to learn all the extra skills

00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:26,780
bit by bit at small steps and you have

00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:29,600
to be prepared to fail you have to be

00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:32,030
prepared to make an ass of yourself and

00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:34,460
get it wrong and that's part of the job

00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:38,120
because if you don't fail you're not

00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:40,670
pushing yourself hard enough now one of

00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:44,210
the many things that I've learned over

00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:45,980
the years is I actually like being a

00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:49,640
beginner at things

00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:52,190
my hobby is music my my hobby is jazz I

00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:54,140
am now learning my third jazz instrument

00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:57,500
because I like that step of going from I

00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:59,660
don't even know how to hold a bass - hey

00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:04,390
I'm playing music now with other people

00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:07,040
fantastic you can learn how to learn and

00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:09,590
no matter how old you are you might go

00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:11,500
but I'm too old to start rubbish I was

00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:14,150
50 when I took up the double bass

00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:16,760
by the time I'm 60 I'll probably be on

00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:19,460
the trumpet but you know you can learn

00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:20,810
anything you can start the only thing

00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:24,530
that stops you is the fear

00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:26,330
of failure so learn to get past that by

00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:29,030
failing doing something you know you

00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:35,030
can't do learn to deal with it it's it's

00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:37,700
it's exhilarating so when it comes to

00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:43,100
doing tech work there is a common thing

00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:45,400
which people say don't do Ricci which is

00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:48,350
business-to-consumer

00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:50,390
it's too hard you work to have to work

00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:52,030
too hard for the money people who are

00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:55,970
spending their own money don't like

00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:59,540
spending it sells businesses businesses

00:24:55,970 --> 00:25:01,790
expect to pay for things that's b2b b2b

00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:03,260
they are used to spending money and it's

00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:05,480
not their money they're spending so

00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:06,740
they're much happier to spend it if you

00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:08,780
are selling to somebody on an expense

00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:10,910
account the most important thing you

00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:12,950
need to know is a what are you going to

00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:14,720
deliver them that they will value that

00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:17,360
will make their life better but also

00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:19,160
what's their budget if they've got a

00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:22,520
ability to sign off without

00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:25,580
authorization from anybody else at $500

00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:27,830
that's we're below that is where your

00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:29,450
pitch should be to them because then you

00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:31,670
can take their money and deliver the

00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:38,360
service they want without having to go

00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:39,650
through the death by committee stage and

00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:42,800
you can choose the customers you want

00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:44,930
it's a common problem we all have when

00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:47,200
we start out in business you think I am

00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:52,340
so desperate for money I will do

00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:54,530
anything for anyone just pay me a sign

00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:57,590
of maturity as a business person is when

00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:59,000
you go no thank you but no I don't want

00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:01,430
your business I don't want your money

00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,320
you are the one customer for me you

00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:05,210
would be better served by somebody else

00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:07,910
because when you do that what you're

00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:11,690
doing is addressing the customers you

00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:13,820
want and as soon as you start being able

00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:16,220
to describe the customers that you want

00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:18,200
this is actually what I've found that

00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:21,320
people told me this and I didn't believe

00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:23,000
it until I started doing it when you say

00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:26,000
I don't want those customers paying that

00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,220
money I want the big customers who are

00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,760
going to be prepared to pay me a lot of

00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:34,080
money for doing very little work once

00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,700
once you start pitching what what

00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:38,220
that you can do for that kind of

00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:40,769
customer you are much more likely to get

00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:43,200
that kind of customer than when you

00:26:40,769 --> 00:26:46,740
start out going anything for anybody at

00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:49,919
any price you you have to define what

00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:52,529
the customers you want so you need to

00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:55,440
work out who they are what they are

00:26:52,529 --> 00:26:57,019
going to need from you and how you

00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:01,019
deliver it to them that makes them

00:26:57,019 --> 00:27:03,149
delighted and then you can be prepared

00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:05,519
to charge more because you're giving

00:27:03,149 --> 00:27:07,139
them something that's valuable the

00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:08,659
biggest problem that most people have

00:27:07,139 --> 00:27:10,860
with with doing that is themselves

00:27:08,659 --> 00:27:13,440
because they're going why should anybody

00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:15,510
want what I do the imposter syndrome is

00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:19,340
huge in everybody who starts a company

00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:19,340
and you have to get past it

00:27:19,399 --> 00:27:25,110
ana most important thing you can do any

00:27:22,049 --> 00:27:27,269
kind of startup that you do as a tech

00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:28,919
person you need to start growing the

00:27:27,269 --> 00:27:31,470
mailing list from the first time you

00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:33,510
think about the idea because those

00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:34,860
people who you can attract to be on your

00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:37,260
mailing list are going to be your early

00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:38,460
adopters you already customers and you

00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:40,880
don't have to have the finished product

00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:46,080
before you start the mailing list

00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:50,960
so first thing stop the mailing list now

00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:55,830
I put a few other lessons I have learned

00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:57,330
there are four things this is a great

00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:59,580
book by the way it's a crime book I love

00:27:57,330 --> 00:28:02,039
crime fiction this one is its setting in

00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:03,690
Quebec in Canada and it's got main

00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:05,330
character who is the chief inspector

00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:07,860
who's got a really good view about life

00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:11,159
these four things are what he teaches

00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:13,889
his war graduate recruits who he gets

00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:19,049
sent and and it is you have to set them

00:28:13,889 --> 00:28:20,490
to say these things I don't know I not

00:28:19,049 --> 00:28:24,870
so I've been working in the industry for

00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:25,769
30 years I say I don't know when people

00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:27,659
ask me things cuz I don't know

00:28:25,769 --> 00:28:31,080
everything sometimes people think I

00:28:27,659 --> 00:28:33,299
ought to but I don't that's good I'm

00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:38,100
willing to accept the fact I do not know

00:28:33,299 --> 00:28:39,269
but I can find out I can say I need help

00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:42,059
this isn't working

00:28:39,269 --> 00:28:44,760
I need help with this because it's okay

00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:47,580
to ask for help we all do it all the

00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:51,810
time and I when I start work

00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:53,700
with young graduates they surprised when

00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:55,620
I asked them for help because they go

00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:58,380
aren't you supposed to be mentoring me I

00:28:55,620 --> 00:29:00,360
go that's not the way it works in this

00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:02,400
industry we all help each other all the

00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:05,070
time we always have questions we always

00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:07,220
need help we just have to share it

00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:07,220
around

00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:14,880
neat thoughts say I was wrong no I

00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:17,520
remember the first time I had I said

00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:22,080
this in a work context it was my first

00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:25,440
job I was 22 I had spent six months

00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:27,810
working on-site for my company I was

00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:30,120
working for we'd been doing porting some

00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:33,840
horrible Fortran code onto this horrible

00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:35,700
machine six months work the last thing I

00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,200
had to do before we could get it signed

00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:42,450
off and I could go back to working at

00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:45,090
home in back in Nottingham was to

00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:47,730
archive it all to clear up that what

00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:51,930
I've done by mistake I deleted the whole

00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:54,030
damn lot six months work gone and I'm

00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:56,430
200 miles away from home my boss is

00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:58,560
there to sign it off and to take me back

00:29:56,430 --> 00:30:04,050
and I'll just delete the whole thing I

00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:05,820
just go oh my god what am I gonna do is

00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:07,860
he gonna fire me before he gets me back

00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:10,890
to Nottingham or would he fire me after

00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:12,630
he's driven me home so I went to my boss

00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:14,910
and said Steve I've done something

00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:16,200
stupid I'm really sorry I was I

00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:16,830
shouldn't have done it I was wrong I

00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,540
shouldn't have done it

00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:22,200
but I've just deleted everything and he

00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:23,730
just looked at me and went yeah that's

00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,390
interesting what are you gonna do about

00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:27,660
it

00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:29,130
so he didn't follow me he put back in my

00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:32,070
mind the fact I could do something about

00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:34,950
it and after thinking for a few minutes

00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:36,420
what oh yeah we could restore it from

00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:37,920
the back up couldn't we we could have

00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:40,470
start from the back up I could make

00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:44,520
those two changes again but it's fine we

00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:47,640
good I'm not fired fantastic I was

00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:50,130
robbed it was I needed to say it because

00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:53,130
otherwise I wouldn't been able to be

00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:54,780
told how to fix it and I'm sorry this is

00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:56,660
something that we do not say enough in

00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:59,730
the in the tech industry that I've seen

00:30:56,660 --> 00:31:01,800
we should

00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:04,080
when we've made mistakes and we should

00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:05,970
say to the people that we've hurt by

00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:13,970
those mistakes I'm sorry I got that

00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:16,920
wrong I apologize and I'm gonna add in

00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:19,230
my take on those a couple of those

00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:22,350
things you can change the meaning of

00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:27,600
those words by adding the small word yet

00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:28,500
I don't know can be negative I don't

00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:31,470
know yet

00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:37,830
is a much more positive way of looking

00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:41,550
at it I can't play bass well but I I

00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:43,080
can't play bass well yet is what I'm

00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:44,820
working towards I want to be able to do

00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:50,970
it I mean that I mean that journey I

00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:52,710
can't write groovy yet but I know how to

00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:57,360
learn so next week when I'm doing that

00:31:52,710 --> 00:32:00,180
project I will be able to it's a

00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:03,750
different mindset you can change what

00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:08,610
you do and how you approach problems by

00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:10,650
reframing them yet is a great word so I

00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:15,590
have time for questions

00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:15,590
but first of all I want to say thank you

00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:33,610
so how does this work do I just point it

00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:35,110
asked if there were questions right for

00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:36,730
everybody who wasn't here yesterday we

00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:39,280
have a microphone right in the middle of

00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:41,800
the seeds so if you have any questions

00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:43,990
just step up there and Rachel can answer

00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:48,010
them from up here so everybody can hear

00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:49,360
them thank you before questions I have

00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:51,310
one more thing I want to say which is to

00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:53,740
emphasize what Tobias said in the

00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:55,570
opening things you have to practice

00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:58,120
doing these kind of things like talking

00:32:55,570 --> 00:33:00,100
so use the opportunity to do a lightning

00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:01,930
talk even if you never don't before

00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:03,940
especially if you've known done it

00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:12,520
before get up here and do a talk thank

00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:20,170
you hello hello thank you for the great

00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:24,010
talk I walked a comparable path so yeah

00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:26,740
and my question is what you said about

00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:29,020
learning I agree but how what do you

00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:30,130
think about the pace so how to fit this

00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:32,740
but the all the other things you have to

00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:34,240
do and especially because the at least

00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:39,580
from my point of view the learning pace

00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:40,630
in the IT community is always increasing

00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:42,100
so you have to learn more and more and

00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:43,750
more because more technologies evolve

00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:44,890
especially in the environment so what do

00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:46,930
you think about that and what's your

00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:51,280
opinion better okay that's great

00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:53,860
question so when I started thirty years

00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:56,800
ago it was very possible to know pretty

00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:58,960
much everything about everything because

00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:02,310
there wasn't much going on at the time

00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:05,440
we didn't have the Internet as a public

00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:08,500
service we didn't have desktop computers

00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:10,780
we had many computers it was a it was

00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:12,669
very small and focused and over the over

00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:16,510
the years as you're saying that

00:34:12,669 --> 00:34:21,010
everything has expanded so it is not now

00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:23,919
possible to know everything I think what

00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:26,110
you need to decide is what you want to

00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:30,159
focus on what what your interest is now

00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:31,510
for me because I am interested I'm

00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:35,140
actually interested in everything but I

00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:36,639
know I can't do it all I care about

00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:40,329
being able to deliver

00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:41,889
I describe myself as a full-stack

00:34:40,329 --> 00:34:44,950
developer I want to be able to do

00:34:41,889 --> 00:34:47,409
everything from the front end through to

00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:49,659
the back end and the deployment which

00:34:47,409 --> 00:34:51,519
means I have to choose a stack to be

00:34:49,659 --> 00:34:53,889
able to do that on now that stack

00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:55,539
changes all the time when I started up

00:34:53,889 --> 00:34:58,809
allows me it was initially it was my

00:34:55,539 --> 00:35:03,490
sequel on a Apache on a single computer

00:34:58,809 --> 00:35:06,099
now it is 30 machines using celery as a

00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:07,930
message queue with Django behind it and

00:35:06,099 --> 00:35:10,180
Django channels and react on the front

00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:13,119
end and what so I've made my choice

00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:15,609
about those things I wanted to learn one

00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:17,920
of the new JavaScript frameworks so

00:35:15,609 --> 00:35:20,349
that's why I chose react I could have

00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:23,130
chosen view I could have chosen any of

00:35:20,349 --> 00:35:27,730
the others around you have to focus I

00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:30,369
think and then learn how to deliver

00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:31,599
something with that that training is not

00:35:30,369 --> 00:35:33,970
enough to read the book you have to

00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:36,299
actually build something so depending

00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:38,769
what your interests are I would say

00:35:36,299 --> 00:35:40,809
except that you can't do everything make

00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:45,900
some choices and then build with but

00:35:40,809 --> 00:35:48,519
that's a restricted set of technology

00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:52,150
but the important thing is to choose to

00:35:48,519 --> 00:35:54,069
do anything and then you can always

00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:56,380
choose to do something different but if

00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:59,079
you choose to do nothing and not learn

00:35:56,380 --> 00:36:03,539
then you're restricting your horizons so

00:35:59,079 --> 00:36:03,539
so greatly that that this problem

00:36:05,549 --> 00:36:12,970
continuing on that thought yes you've

00:36:10,089 --> 00:36:14,319
got to do something but doing something

00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:15,819
there's an opportunity cost in all the

00:36:14,319 --> 00:36:17,289
other things that you couldn't do I

00:36:15,819 --> 00:36:18,819
might you might have a million ideas of

00:36:17,289 --> 00:36:20,559
the book you could write the course you

00:36:18,819 --> 00:36:23,529
could write whatever you have to pick

00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:24,789
one how do you pick that one when you've

00:36:23,529 --> 00:36:26,529
got though got this audience and you

00:36:24,789 --> 00:36:27,700
don't know what it is an audience is

00:36:26,529 --> 00:36:29,589
actually going to be interested in

00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:31,569
what's have any suggestions for how to

00:36:29,589 --> 00:36:35,920
narrow down what's what's worth focusing

00:36:31,569 --> 00:36:38,950
on so again great question the the way

00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:40,569
which people I respect would answer that

00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:42,690
question I don't have a good answer

00:36:40,569 --> 00:36:45,819
myself so I shall channel other people's

00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:48,789
is the first thing is to get the

00:36:45,819 --> 00:36:50,650
audience to get the mailing list so that

00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:52,960
you have an a way of

00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:57,820
what people are crying out for for

00:36:52,960 --> 00:37:00,100
example in the Python world a thing that

00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:03,360
you hear people complaining about having

00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:05,260
pain and problems with this packaging

00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:06,790
because there are so many different ways

00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:10,240
to do it a new way comes along every

00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:12,610
week and people have a common problem

00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:16,120
there you might choose to build a course

00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:19,110
of a book on that single pain point what

00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:21,040
I'm trying to do at the moment I I

00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:24,850
suffer from the problem that I have too

00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:28,720
many ideas not in not a few and so for

00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:31,690
me is trying to a sit down I am trying

00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:33,550
to find a problem that people have with

00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:35,020
spreadsheets this is my new idea I think

00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:36,880
spreadsheets of scourge of the world

00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:38,800
that cause lots of problems people have

00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:41,230
problems with spreadsheets so I need to

00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:42,550
get myself an audience of people who

00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:45,280
have problems with spreadsheets and then

00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:46,960
I'm listen to them and find out one

00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:49,450
thing that they have in common they

00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:51,820
complain about and fix it for them so

00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:54,010
that will be my next project is fixing a

00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:55,930
spreadsheet problem I don't know what

00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:59,230
the problem will be yet I can think of a

00:37:55,930 --> 00:38:01,360
list of things that might be but I have

00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:05,430
to get the audience it's not a question

00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:08,590
of Tibet telepathically going oh I

00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:10,360
believe that they will want this you

00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:11,650
don't know that you don't have to even

00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:14,350
think about it what you have to do is

00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:18,190
listen to the people who is the audience

00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:20,350
you want to serve they'll tell you what

00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:22,630
they want and if you can find a small

00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:24,370
thing that you can deliver to them that

00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:26,740
makes their life better you can build

00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:27,400
from it so that's that's not that would

00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:30,460
be my answer

00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:32,740
channeling other people it is don't try

00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:35,290
to make it up yourself find the audience

00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:37,060
first and listen to them because they

00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:38,290
will be howling in pain if there's a

00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:40,680
real problem that they've got that you

00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:40,680
can help with

00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:44,370
anymore

00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:52,140
you said that in general it's better to

00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:54,570
have like businesses as your customers

00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:56,550
right how would you suggest especially

00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:58,590
if you're just starting out to find

00:38:56,550 --> 00:39:02,970
these people of these businesses and to

00:38:58,590 --> 00:39:06,210
convince them that you're serious so the

00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:08,190
first thing is try because you can

00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:12,390
when I had my digital cache company I

00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:15,000
was phoning up people in the banks now I

00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:16,980
was 30 at the time I think I didn't know

00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,420
anything I didn't look like I knew

00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:21,890
anything and I was female

00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:24,570
I mean God women don't do tech the I

00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:26,640
found it amazingly simple actually to

00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:28,290
get to the person I wanted to talk to

00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:31,650
even if they were like the veep vice

00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:36,590
president of of digitalization of their

00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:39,150
glorious job title because I was able to

00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:40,350
just pick up the phone and go I would

00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:43,500
like to talk to the person in charge of

00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:45,570
this could you put me through they they

00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:47,010
actually did to my amazement and then I

00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:50,850
had a meeting and then I tried to sell

00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:53,490
them so the thing you have to do is a

00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:55,980
believe that you can do it and find out

00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:58,590
from rejection that you can't don't

00:39:55,980 --> 00:40:00,450
assume that you can't but having very

00:39:58,590 --> 00:40:02,670
clear up what it is you're trying to

00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:04,260
sell to them or or what is the problem

00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:07,200
that they have that you can help with

00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:09,810
because if they have got a problem yeah

00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:12,420
and you can help and you can either save

00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:16,680
them time or make the money they will

00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:18,150
listen to you so I don't know for an

00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:21,270
individual person how you would address

00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:24,330
it but I do know that just giving it a

00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:28,770
go is a good way to start so give it a

00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:31,770
go then and just don't waste their time

00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:32,310
that's the thing once you get in if your

00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:34,080
foot in the door

00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:35,910

an employee people do care about you

00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:55,050
things like experience and job titles

00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:56,460
and past record in business they don't

00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:58,260

00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:01,490
that's all de Cobo

00:41:02,869 --> 00:41:11,160
thank you very much for your for your

00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:13,589
talk one question if it's possible maybe

00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:17,550
some kind of similar question to the as

00:41:13,589 --> 00:41:20,190
the one before you had some two

00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:23,190
statements which are very important to

00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:27,359
me also the one I need help and I don't

00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:28,980
know and but what's I mean if you say

00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:32,309
something like that you'll need to

00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:36,780
address the also the right people what's

00:41:32,309 --> 00:41:41,730
your advice on finding the right mentors

00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:44,520
or advisors you know I guess it depends

00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:47,030
on what context are you talking about it

00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:50,579
like it's technical or is it business or

00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:52,589
it could be both so for example you

00:41:50,579 --> 00:41:55,079
might be a great adviser for if you want

00:41:52,589 --> 00:41:56,670
to get something running if you want to

00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:59,660
build up a start-up here I have the

00:41:56,670 --> 00:42:01,349
experience and knowledge I could ask you

00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:04,890
almost everything

00:42:01,349 --> 00:42:08,640
how do starts what's what do I need what

00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:12,299
do I know you know what's do you know

00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:14,040
some kind of approach or how do you

00:42:12,299 --> 00:42:17,190
approach the right people find the right

00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:20,549
people that's a very good question

00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:23,130
so in the specific context about the

00:42:20,549 --> 00:42:24,480
startup stuff just following on what you

00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:25,859
just said if anybody does want to come

00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:29,849
and talk to me about that kind of thing

00:42:25,859 --> 00:42:33,869
I'm here till Friday come and talk if I

00:42:29,849 --> 00:42:36,089
was going to look for somebody in safe

00:42:33,869 --> 00:42:37,559
example what I was taking my startup to

00:42:36,089 --> 00:42:40,650
the next level and I needed to find

00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:43,920
people who helped me with finding

00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:46,130
investors or a director that was going

00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:49,290
to help with a particular problem I

00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:51,359
would spend a bit of time framing the

00:42:49,290 --> 00:42:54,270
problem and focusing on what it was

00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:56,579
actually wanted because I would have

00:42:54,270 --> 00:42:58,559
wanted ass particular person for

00:42:56,579 --> 00:43:00,480
particular problem and the closer I

00:42:58,559 --> 00:43:03,839
could define it the better chance I

00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:05,329
would have been getting that and then I

00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:09,510
would having having done that

00:43:05,329 --> 00:43:13,079
description to myself I would just ask

00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:14,109
people I knew so networking is hugely

00:43:13,079 --> 00:43:15,670
important which is why this

00:43:14,109 --> 00:43:19,569
conference is great because you get to

00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:22,210
meet people in terms of like for the

00:43:19,569 --> 00:43:26,319
business side we in Edinburgh have a

00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:32,349
very good ecosystem of meetups that and

00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:34,420
and investors bankers it's there's a

00:43:32,349 --> 00:43:35,950
kind like a little industry going on so

00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:38,019
what all we need to do is find somebody

00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:40,059
who knows somebody in it and then they

00:43:38,019 --> 00:43:42,220
can recommend somebody else down that

00:43:40,059 --> 00:43:44,259
down the line and the important thing is

00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:47,140
to recognize where you get to meet one

00:43:44,259 --> 00:43:50,049
of those people and then not waste their

00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:54,069
time this is a this is a thing which I

00:43:50,049 --> 00:43:56,109
feel people do a lot they waste time

00:43:54,069 --> 00:43:57,249
time is our most valuable resource we

00:43:56,109 --> 00:43:58,869
should not waste it and we definitely

00:43:57,249 --> 00:44:00,400
should not waste other people's if

00:43:58,869 --> 00:44:02,950
they're giving it if they're sharing

00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:05,799
stuff with us so if you can focus what

00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:08,289
you actually want find somebody that's

00:44:05,799 --> 00:44:10,329
near if you don't know anybody that has

00:44:08,289 --> 00:44:12,609
exactly what you look you're looking for

00:44:10,329 --> 00:44:14,890
find somebody that's near it and then

00:44:12,609 --> 00:44:16,779
ask them who they would advise about

00:44:14,890 --> 00:44:17,890
getting to the next stage and it might

00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:20,079
be there you go through three or four

00:44:17,890 --> 00:44:22,239
hoops and jumps to get to the person you

00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:24,369
actually want but you start with this

00:44:22,239 --> 00:44:28,779
person that you know and ask them to get

00:44:24,369 --> 00:44:30,839
you closer that works well for me thank

00:44:28,779 --> 00:44:30,839
you

00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:37,460
thanks Rachel for the great talk you

00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:40,450
talked a lot about product space

00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:43,100
businesses so so how would you say does

00:44:40,450 --> 00:44:47,150
freelancing contracting like directly

00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:50,480
working for people fit into into that so

00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:51,770
I do two types of freelancing one I'm

00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,780
doing at the moment is the straight

00:44:51,770 --> 00:44:55,960
forward contracting where I do five days

00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:58,400
a week in somebody else's office and

00:44:55,960 --> 00:45:02,750
this is a bit of a novelty for me it's

00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:05,480
been many years since I've done this it

00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:07,550
fits into my plan because it's basically

00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:11,270
making me money so that I can invest in

00:45:07,550 --> 00:45:13,580
my next idea well the other kind of

00:45:11,270 --> 00:45:16,430
freelancing that I have done which fits

00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:18,290
better with the building a business idea

00:45:16,430 --> 00:45:19,910
is you're not selling just

00:45:18,290 --> 00:45:21,710
straightforward time for hours

00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:24,500
that time for money what you're selling

00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:27,170
is a solution to a problem that you can

00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:30,830
build in whatever hours you like and

00:45:27,170 --> 00:45:34,400
that that kind of freelancing works

00:45:30,830 --> 00:45:36,790
better for building a business but then

00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:38,870
you don't ten I haven't found that it's

00:45:36,790 --> 00:45:40,460
it ends up being a business in its own

00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:42,740
right so you have to then decide how do

00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:45,650
you use your time to focus on this

00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:46,910
business all that that one it's

00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:49,280
basically you make it up as you go along

00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:51,320
you know this is what I'm doing there is

00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:54,200
no single answer there is no right way

00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:55,940
it's whatever works for you I know I

00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:57,740
know people that have started and doing

00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:59,810
that the five-day-a-week contracting

00:45:57,740 --> 00:46:01,640
that's then turned into the project

00:45:59,810 --> 00:46:03,890
based stuff because they've developed

00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:06,820
the trust with a customer that they can

00:46:03,890 --> 00:46:09,770
deliver other people choose to just do

00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:12,170
six months on six months off six months

00:46:09,770 --> 00:46:15,770
doing money earning six months doing

00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:19,240
their own projects I don't have an

00:46:15,770 --> 00:46:19,240
answer it's making it up as you go along

00:46:23,210 --> 00:46:27,840
thank you very much it's been pleasure

00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:29,740
[Applause]
