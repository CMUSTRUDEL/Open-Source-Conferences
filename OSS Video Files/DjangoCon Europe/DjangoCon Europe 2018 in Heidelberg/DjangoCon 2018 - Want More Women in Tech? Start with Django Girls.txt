Title: DjangoCon 2018 - Want More Women in Tech? Start with Django Girls
Publication date: 2018-05-25
Playlist: DjangoCon Europe 2018 in Heidelberg

	https://media.ccc.de/v/hd-102-want-more-women-in-tech-start-with-django-girls



If your hometown can benefit from a free, friendly environment where women can learn to program, it’s time to bring Django Girls to your city. You’ll learn what it takes to run a successful event while hearing tales from the trenches from a seasoned Django Girls organizer.

Ever heard of Django Girls and thought, “Gee, if only that would come to my city, I’d love to be involved!” Django Girls is a fantastic, free weekend-long workshop that teaches women how to code through a comprehensive, Django-based tutorial. Encouraging more women to strive for programming careers benefits the tech community at large, and spearheading a Django Girls event in your city is a positive, actionable way for you to personally become involved.

##But I’m a Developer - Not an Event Planner!
So you’re sold that Django Girls is a great idea, but maybe you’re not confident you can execute on it. You don’t need a degree in event planning to plan a great event - developers specialize in problem solving, and running a workshop involves just that. All it takes is a little passion. And sponsors. And a great venue with impeccable WiFi. And a team full of mentors, volunteers and organizers dedicated willing to follow you into the battlefield… Okay, okay. It’s a lot of hard work, but it’s incredibly rewarding to yourself and your community, and I’m ready to share my years of wisdom to help your event run smoothly.

##Learn From My Mistakes
From avoiding volunteer burnout to preventing mutiny from your attendees because the caterer was a flop, I’ll share my insights on what’s worked and what hasn’t over the past three years - and how I intend to improve upon the past two years to make my next event my best yet. I’ll cover logistics, and how to make the event memorable and enjoyable for everyone involved, including recruiting attendees, mentors, sponsors, and other organizers; how to find a great location; what small details are illogically important; and how to communicate effectively within your role as you transform from developer into a community leader.

hi everyone I'm here to talk about how

00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:13,180
we can get more women into tech and why

00:00:11,289 --> 00:00:17,289
Django Girls is a really good tool for

00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:19,090
doing that so to start off if you want

00:00:17,289 --> 00:00:20,289
to see my slides after the talk if you

00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:21,189
are convinced that Django Girls is

00:00:20,289 --> 00:00:21,789
something you want to bring to your

00:00:21,189 --> 00:00:23,949
community

00:00:21,789 --> 00:00:27,730
check out my slide it's at s Hines

00:00:23,949 --> 00:00:30,669
github io / Django I'll share them again

00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:32,169
at the end so a little bit about me I'm

00:00:30,669 --> 00:00:33,970
a self-taught developer I've been doing

00:00:32,169 --> 00:00:35,590
this for about five years for three of

00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:37,690
those years I've been really involved

00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:39,700
with Django Girls Kansas City as the

00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:43,510
program director for two of them and as

00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:45,520
the lead mentor for one and I'm from

00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:47,560
Kansas City Missouri it's right there in

00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,390
the middle of the US maybe you haven't

00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,890
heard of it maybe you have but there are

00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:51,220
a couple of cool things about Kansas

00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:54,070
City

00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:55,600
first of all Lawrence Kansas is about 30

00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:58,420
minutes away that's where Django was

00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:01,360
born so that's pretty cool

00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:03,310
and the second cool thing is that we

00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:05,170
have been voted the number two city for

00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:07,150
women in tech in all of the United

00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:08,530
States for about four years in a row and

00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:11,200
this is based off a couple different

00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:13,090
factors such as the gender pay gap and

00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,190
how many women are filling roles and

00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:17,230
technical positions so that's pretty

00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:19,960
cool for being a small to mid-sized city

00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:22,030
and I don't know the exact reasons for

00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:24,370
this but I do have some ideas of my own

00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:27,400
of you know why our city is so good for

00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:29,800
women in tech a big part of that is a

00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,390
grassroots organization called Kansas

00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:36,130
City women in technology they run a

00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:37,540
bunch of monthly events for women one of

00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:39,490
them is coding and cupcakes

00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:40,960
that's for moms and daughters to learn

00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:43,360
how to build websites together there's

00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,850
also coding in cocktails that's for the

00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,590
slightly older crowd we have a bartender

00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:49,720
that comes in while women learn

00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:51,100
front-end technologies and then there's

00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:53,799
also Tech Talks where we just talk about

00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:55,180
trending tech topics but the one I'm

00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:57,580
most excited about the one that I'm

00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:59,590
going to talk to you today about and the

00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:04,090
one that's most relevant obviously to

00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:05,680
this conference is Django girls actually

00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:08,530
let's go back who old was it Django

00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:13,269
girls heidelberg does anyone awesome

00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:15,490
okay so not that many people so for this

00:02:13,269 --> 00:02:17,920
talk I'm going to go over what jingle

00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:19,780
girls is and really why we need it and

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,990
then we're going to go over why any one

00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,190
of

00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:22,960
you can bring this back to your

00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:24,340
community and then once you decide that

00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:26,320
you are the right person for the job

00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:30,640
I'll kind of walk you through how I run

00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:32,320
my workshop so first I want to talk

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,520
about why Django Girls is important

00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:37,810
before we kind of get into the what so

00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,850
there's a really good tech talk by a

00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:41,620
woman named rush Moses Johnnie and she's

00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:44,560
the founder of girls who code and she

00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:47,320
talks about why coding helps girls take

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:50,230
risks and she says that we're teaching

00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:51,820
girls to be brave or sorry we're

00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:53,530
teaching our girls to be perfect but

00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:56,530
we're teaching our boys to be brave and

00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:58,420
that might not sound so bad but it it

00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:02,350
does have lasting effects on these women

00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:05,590
um for instance when applying for a job

00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:07,300
women will only apply statistically if

00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:09,580
they meet a hundred percent of the

00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:11,350
requirements whereas men will apply for

00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:14,050
a job if they only need sixty percent of

00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:15,490
the requirements and so you know men are

00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:17,890
obviously still getting jobs so there's

00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:19,450
kind of a disconnect between you know

00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:20,950
how qualified you actually need to be

00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:26,080
based on what they're listing on the job

00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:28,150
ad so women are automatically

00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,860
disqualifying themselves from jobs that

00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:32,590
are fully qualified for and this is

00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:34,510
obviously an issue but she argues that

00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:38,170
learning the program can really teach

00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:39,220
girls to take more risks and you may

00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:42,370
think why is that

00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:44,950
and it's really because it makes girls

00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:46,960
fail and something that we're not always

00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:49,000
comfortable with doing and that's

00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:51,280
because programming you just can't

00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,950
really write a perfect line of code it's

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,410
very hard to do or especially a block of

00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:57,880
code for instance there's always going

00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:59,620
to be something in Python whether you

00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,060
accidentally forgot to indent something

00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:04,510
you're going to run into mistakes along

00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:06,550
the way it's impossible not to but you

00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:08,680
are going to fix your mistakes and

00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:10,360
you're going to eventually figure it out

00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,040
as long as you stick with it and that's

00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:14,400
just a really important lesson that we

00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:18,250
need to be teaching our girls

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:21,790
so if programming makes girls brave then

00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:25,840
how do we get more girls coding that's

00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:26,950
weird angle girls comes in so what is

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,409
this thing I've been talking about for

00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:31,810
the last few minutes

00:04:29,409 --> 00:04:34,840
well it's a really fun and welcoming

00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:36,909
event that is free to attend there is a

00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,129
tutorial that's already pre-made it's

00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:41,349
very thorough there are mentors around

00:04:39,129 --> 00:04:43,240
to help these women work through the

00:04:41,349 --> 00:04:45,009
problems in the tutorial and most

00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:48,249
importantly it's available worldwide so

00:04:45,009 --> 00:04:49,930
you can kind of bootstrap this event and

00:04:48,249 --> 00:04:53,289
kind of put your own spin to it and

00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:55,539
bring it to your own community so here

00:04:53,289 --> 00:04:57,249
are some photos from our event we had

00:04:55,539 --> 00:05:01,479
about a hundred and ten attendees last

00:04:57,249 --> 00:05:04,139
year 35 mentors 5 organizers so here's

00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:08,289
our really awesome venue it's at a

00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:09,939
startup accelerator here's a really

00:05:08,289 --> 00:05:11,110
happy attendee I'm assuming she just

00:05:09,939 --> 00:05:13,719
solved a problem because that's usually

00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:16,750
not my face when I'm programming usually

00:05:13,719 --> 00:05:19,090
a much grumpier we had really cool

00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:21,370
giveaways like mugs beautiful

00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:23,139
centerpieces

00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:23,879
we even had dogs I'll talk more about

00:05:23,139 --> 00:05:27,129
that later

00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:29,259
mentor shirts lots of different food

00:05:27,129 --> 00:05:31,900
options for people with special

00:05:29,259 --> 00:05:33,639
preferences so if you can see by the

00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:37,300
pictures it just looks like a place

00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:39,099
where you want to hang out alright so

00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:40,779
you may not think that you're the right

00:05:39,099 --> 00:05:43,029
person to bring this to your community

00:05:40,779 --> 00:05:44,770
but I'm telling you you already have

00:05:43,029 --> 00:05:47,560
everything you already you need to run

00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:49,419
an event like this so there's some

00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,339
qualifications first that you don't need

00:05:49,419 --> 00:05:54,610
you think you might beat them but you

00:05:51,339 --> 00:05:56,379
definitely don't and for instance my

00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:58,089
only qualification to run this event is

00:05:56,379 --> 00:05:59,740
I had like six months of Django

00:05:58,089 --> 00:06:01,990
experience I think I might have been one

00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:04,240
of the few female Django programmers in

00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:07,180
Kansas City so I just kind of got like

00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,740
roped into it had never planned an event

00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:09,969
before so I didn't really know what I

00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:13,180
was doing but I was able to figure it

00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:14,500
out so the first qualification you don't

00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:18,490
need is obviously you don't need to be

00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:20,319
perfect you just need to be brave that's

00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:26,319
if you can't yeah it's a little

00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:28,270
dachshund he's so brave you don't need

00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,560
to be a savvy event planner like I

00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:31,960
mentioned before I had no experience

00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:34,089
they actually have a lot of this stuff

00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:36,310
already out there for you their github

00:06:34,089 --> 00:06:38,139
repository has a lot of different

00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:40,149
illustrator and Photoshop files that you

00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:41,740
can tweak for colors you can add those

00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:43,479
to mugs t-shirts

00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:46,270
Flyers presentations everything you need

00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:47,800
they also will give you a django website

00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:51,400
to use so you really don't have to like

00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:52,900
build anything like that there's a lot

00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,699
of blogs and other resources so

00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:56,620
everything you could possibly think of

00:06:54,699 --> 00:06:59,080
there's there's something available for

00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:01,990
you you also don't need to have a large

00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:03,280
budget so the event that I showed we did

00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:06,940
it for about seven thousand US dollars

00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:08,370
which might seem like a lot or not that

00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:11,319
covered about a hundred and ten people

00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:13,750
but you can definitely scale it up or

00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:15,250
down for instance we have some friends

00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:17,500
in Omaha Nebraska which is about three

00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:20,020
hours away from Kansas City they only

00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:22,360
had eighteen attendees in ten mentors

00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:25,599
and it was still a really valuable event

00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:28,000
so maybe a hundred people just isn't a

00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:29,710
reality for your community but as small

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,009
as you have it it will still make a big

00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:34,990
impact so there are some qualifications

00:07:33,009 --> 00:07:36,159
you do need to run an event though but

00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:38,680
you probably already have them since

00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:40,539
your programmers need to be able to

00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,490
solve problems you're gonna run into a

00:07:40,539 --> 00:07:44,199
lot of issues like how am I gonna pay

00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:46,570
for this or you know how am I going to

00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:48,190
attract mentors and just like any other

00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:49,840
problem that you deal with you just have

00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:51,039
to break it down into smaller chunks and

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,330
you'll be able to figure it out and I'll

00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,159
talk a little bit more about how to

00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:57,490
solve those two specific problems later

00:07:54,159 --> 00:08:00,190
on in the talk you need to be open to

00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:03,099
learning new things for instance I had

00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:04,990
no idea how to you know go get money for

00:08:03,099 --> 00:08:07,330
sponsors or you know ask people for that

00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:09,159
so that's definitely something I've

00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:11,229
learned or you know how to effectively

00:08:09,159 --> 00:08:14,099
teach a junior programmer how to code

00:08:11,229 --> 00:08:18,610
without you know being condescending so

00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:20,530
there's lots of things to learn you also

00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:23,380
have to kind of need to want to

00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:24,969
constantly improve so you can't have to

00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:27,340
leave your ego behind you're gonna put a

00:08:24,969 --> 00:08:28,599
lot of energy and pretty much six months

00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,639
of your life into planning this event

00:08:28,599 --> 00:08:31,990
and then no matter what someone's gonna

00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,149
come to you with some negative feedback

00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:35,589
and you should kind of embrace that

00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:38,680
because that's how you're gonna make

00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:40,510
your event perfect or not perfect so

00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,709
you're gonna make your event better so

00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:43,360
you're never gonna have a perfect event

00:08:41,709 --> 00:08:44,770
especially your one you're not going to

00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,959
have a perfect event after doing it for

00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:49,300
five years but if you embrace that

00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:53,770
negative feedback over time you're going

00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:55,209
to have a really great event okay so now

00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:55,510
we'll talk a little bit about actually

00:08:55,209 --> 00:09:00,100
running

00:08:55,510 --> 00:09:02,290
workshop so I'm a little type-a I do a

00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:04,030
lot of planning so this is how I am

00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:05,650
structured it but it is a very flexible

00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:08,170
event you can definitely do it however

00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:10,180
you want but feel free to kind of follow

00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:13,780
my steps if that is helpful to you

00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:15,940
so the first part that I do is I start

00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:17,680
planning and this is where I'll just sit

00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:21,490
down kind of by myself and make goals

00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:23,560
and set a kind of budget and then I

00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:25,630
figure out what other organizers do I

00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:29,710
need to bring on my team and figure out

00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:32,590
like who's gonna sponsor this thing so

00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:34,060
as far as finding other organizers you

00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:36,130
kind of just want like a diverse group

00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:37,780
of people so that they all don't think

00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:39,430
like you because there are definitely

00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:42,430
some weak spots that I have that you

00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:44,710
know other people can help fill so this

00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:47,020
is how our kind of hierarchy is set up

00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:49,090
we have a coach and attendee coordinator

00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:50,740
two different roles but do kind of the

00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:52,330
same thing they manage all the

00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:54,100
communications between coaches and

00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:57,190
attendees respectively I'm kind of

00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:58,840
before during and after the event this

00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:00,370
year we added a diversity and inclusion

00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:02,200
coordinator to make sure you know we're

00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:04,120
marketing our event to all women and

00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:06,880
making sure that once they get to our

00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:09,070
event they feel welcome and safe we also

00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,830
have vendor and sponsor coordinators to

00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:13,210
handle kind of those third party

00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:14,790
communications as well as the marketing

00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:18,390
coordinator who does the social media

00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:20,740
talking to the prospects that are and

00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:22,600
attracting sponsors as you can see reps

00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:23,920
this is actually up there they've been a

00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,700
big supporter I think they're in

00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,990
Lawrence Kansas

00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:30,970
but uh yeah thank you grab sis so you

00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:33,850
have to pay for this event somehow one

00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:35,950
of the few requirements of running a

00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:38,470
jingle girls is that is a free event for

00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:39,760
attendees so someone's got to pay for it

00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:43,810
it's time to start asking people for

00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:45,700
money so the number one thing I can

00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:48,280
recommend is to just use your network

00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:50,200
for instance I have a good friend named

00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:52,900
Justin he works at a big tech company in

00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:54,820
Kansas City he was a mentor last year

00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:56,500
and I just texted him one morning when I

00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:59,500
was trying to find out people the

00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:02,260
sponsor and I was like hey can you put

00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:03,610
me in touch with your HR person and I

00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:06,850
was just expecting to get like an email

00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:08,630
back but within about six hours they

00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:11,449
were writing me a check for like $900

00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:13,550
so I they probably would have just

00:11:11,449 --> 00:11:16,490
ignored me had I just blindly emailed

00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:18,399
her so you know making those connections

00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:22,160
at companies that will give you money is

00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:23,779
absolutely the best way to go once you

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,399
have that contact you want to create

00:11:23,779 --> 00:11:27,740
something like a sponsorship prospectus

00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:29,959
it's got different levels of sponsors

00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:32,060
like platinum gold silver and then we

00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:34,490
have line items so you know you can

00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:36,680
sponsor the t-shirt for $700 and this

00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:38,120
really helps because it kind of tells

00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:40,790
them exactly where their money is going

00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:42,740
which is very helpful and for instance

00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:44,480
the t-shirt sponsor knows they're gonna

00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:48,889
get their logo on the t-shirt so they're

00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:50,420
pretty happy about that you also need to

00:11:48,889 --> 00:11:52,519
kind of polish your sponsors that ask

00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:54,860
and when I say ask

00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:56,930
I really just mean it email and so when

00:11:54,860 --> 00:12:00,350
you send it to an HR person or someone

00:11:56,930 --> 00:12:02,329
else you want to make sure you send like

00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:04,370
your most specific line at the beginning

00:12:02,329 --> 00:12:06,290
of the email since HR people are very

00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:08,690
busy and they will probably skim through

00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:11,019
your email so make sure to ask it as

00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:13,730
soon as possible so they don't ignore it

00:12:11,019 --> 00:12:16,339
you'll also want to include statistics

00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:18,829
and then bold your items to make sure

00:12:16,339 --> 00:12:21,680
they stand out it's kind of using UI UX

00:12:18,829 --> 00:12:24,220
in email format you don't want to go too

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:26,449
crazy here but here's an example of that

00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:28,880
said we've grown from seventy-six

00:12:26,449 --> 00:12:32,300
attendees and nineteen mentors in 2016

00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:34,850
to 110 attendees and 35 mentors in 2017

00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:36,290
so the most important numbers stand out

00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:39,290
and I've also shown that we were able to

00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:41,149
take this event from you know point A to

00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:44,079
point B we're using our money well we're

00:12:41,149 --> 00:12:46,670
also making the event better every year

00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:48,949
and then finally just personalize the

00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:51,500
email just it has it only has to be like

00:12:48,949 --> 00:12:53,839
a line but I hate getting templated

00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:55,880
emails I tend to just ignore them and

00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,439
send them straight to the trash so if

00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:01,149
there's you know that person from your

00:12:57,439 --> 00:13:05,889
network that's involved just you know

00:13:01,149 --> 00:13:08,600
say hi okay step number two is

00:13:05,889 --> 00:13:13,160
recruitment and this is recruiting

00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:15,920
mentors and attendees so for finding

00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:17,660
mentors they don't need to be Jango or

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,370
Python experts they just need to

00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:22,089
understand basic programming concepts

00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:24,519
and this is good because we

00:13:22,089 --> 00:13:27,639
just don't have very many Django experts

00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:29,620
in Kansas City so the tutorial is really

00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:31,449
thorough and very easy to understand

00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:32,920
maybe not for beginners but as long as

00:13:31,449 --> 00:13:35,079
you kind of understand programming and

00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:38,410
maybe go through the tutorial beforehand

00:13:35,079 --> 00:13:40,420
you're gonna do just fine they can also

00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:43,600
be any gender and this is good because

00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:45,339
since only women identifying as female

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:49,800
can attend this is a really great

00:13:45,339 --> 00:13:52,930
opportunity for men to get involved you

00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:54,999
can aim for a mix of junior and senior

00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:56,850
programmers it's a good opportunity for

00:13:54,999 --> 00:13:58,779
junior programmers to you know kind of

00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:02,499
solidify their knowledge by helping

00:13:58,779 --> 00:14:04,059
others kind of gets rid of that imposter

00:14:02,499 --> 00:14:06,279
syndrome that sometimes we have when

00:14:04,059 --> 00:14:07,809
we're first starting out and then you'll

00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:09,850
also want the senior of programmers

00:14:07,809 --> 00:14:11,769
though because things will inevitably go

00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:14,050
wrong someone maybe didn't update their

00:14:11,769 --> 00:14:15,970
computer for the last four years so

00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:19,680
having that Senior Programmer step in

00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:23,309
and fix things quickly is very helpful

00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:25,480
and then as far as attracting attendees

00:14:23,309 --> 00:14:27,999
we have a couple of recruitment ideas

00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:30,059
that we use press releases are a big one

00:14:27,999 --> 00:14:33,160
reaching out to newspapers magazines etc

00:14:30,059 --> 00:14:35,889
doing guest blog posts on local tech

00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:38,319
blogs for instance there's like a girl

00:14:35,889 --> 00:14:41,529
geek blog that's all about comic books

00:14:38,319 --> 00:14:42,999
so she let us do a guest blog post we

00:14:41,529 --> 00:14:45,490
have I've been on the local news a

00:14:42,999 --> 00:14:47,230
couple of times which is really fun we

00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:49,420
sometimes reach out to universities or

00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:51,100
local high schools go to meetups and

00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:52,360
events and this they don't have to be

00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,889
tech meetups actually it's probably

00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,889
better if they're not just kind of any

00:14:53,889 --> 00:14:59,110
meetup where women meet and then also

00:14:56,889 --> 00:15:02,679
flyers just posting them into community

00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:06,579
spaces like coffee shops libraries those

00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:08,499
things can help alright so once you've

00:15:06,579 --> 00:15:12,009
done recruitment then you accept and

00:15:08,499 --> 00:15:14,889
reject attendees usually you just kind

00:15:12,009 --> 00:15:16,629
of decide on a set of criteria like how

00:15:14,889 --> 00:15:18,370
much effort did this person put into

00:15:16,629 --> 00:15:20,050
their application or how much can this

00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:22,300
person benefit does this person seem

00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:24,370
like they're going to be to actually

00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:27,670
enjoy this and like continue learning to

00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:29,499
program after the fact and then you

00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:30,939
don't want to outright reject anyone put

00:15:29,499 --> 00:15:32,230
them on a wait list because you know

00:15:30,939 --> 00:15:34,630
people that you recept will inevitably

00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:37,120
drop out

00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:38,889
after you accept or reject there's kind

00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,810
of this awkward time of about a month

00:15:38,889 --> 00:15:42,190
and a half between letting everyone know

00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:44,680
that they're allowed to come and the

00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:46,690
actual day and this is a great time to

00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:49,990
do all those last-minute ordering things

00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:52,420
like doing t-shirts now that you have

00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:54,220
everyone's t-shirt sizes confirming with

00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:56,829
the caterers that you know you have this

00:15:54,220 --> 00:16:00,160
many vegans that's great time to take

00:15:56,829 --> 00:16:03,009
care of those things then on the day of

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,779
this is kind of our schedule of what we

00:16:03,009 --> 00:16:09,459
do we have a separate Friday night

00:16:04,779 --> 00:16:11,860
install party this is pretty crucial in

00:16:09,459 --> 00:16:13,569
my opinion because I don't know about

00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:16,209
you guys but I hate setting up my

00:16:13,569 --> 00:16:19,329
computer like my environment it's just a

00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:21,069
pain it's not fun you only do it every

00:16:19,329 --> 00:16:23,680
once in a while so I don't know I never

00:16:21,069 --> 00:16:25,000
really got that great at it but we're

00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,709
kind of playing off the fact that it's

00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,199
not fun for attendees either we try and

00:16:26,709 --> 00:16:30,550
keep that on Friday night they have the

00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,110
mentors help them work through that and

00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:35,709
then Saturday morning that can start

00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:37,600
with the fun like hello world stuff so

00:16:35,709 --> 00:16:39,550
that's a good way to do it and then on

00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,680
Saturday we do a breakfast and check-in

00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:44,259
we have an opening presentation where we

00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,639
kind of I like to bring in former Django

00:16:44,259 --> 00:16:48,819
girls and kind of do it where are they

00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:50,589
now a lot of them do get jobs as

00:16:48,819 --> 00:16:53,470
programmers or at least are continuing

00:16:50,589 --> 00:16:56,170
to learn so it really sets a really cool

00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:58,720
mood for the day then we do a tutorial

00:16:56,170 --> 00:17:01,300
session we break for lunch we do more

00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,529
tutorials and in the afternoon that's

00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:04,900
kind of when we like to have our breaks

00:17:02,529 --> 00:17:07,500
and so we brought in some dogs from the

00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:10,240
local rescue project which is really fun

00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:13,750
everyone loves dogs for the most part so

00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,520
it was a nice way to step away from your

00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:19,990
programming and just hang out with some

00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:21,579
dogs and we also had a yoga teacher come

00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:23,770
in and donate her time she was able to

00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:25,900
do about four sessions and it was just

00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:27,579
very relaxing and it kind of taught all

00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:30,159
these women that they can step away from

00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:31,990
their code go do something take a mental

00:17:30,159 --> 00:17:33,460
break and then come back at it and you

00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:37,330
can tackle the problem and maybe see it

00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:39,789
in a new light and then after we wrap up

00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:41,470
we usually get some feedback and then we

00:17:39,789 --> 00:17:43,750
want to show our mentors that we really

00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:45,730
appreciate them they dedicated almost

00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:47,629
all of their weekend to us and their

00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:49,340
energy and so yeah

00:17:47,629 --> 00:17:51,499
last year we just got them some Chipotle

00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:54,139
and had a bartender gave them some free

00:17:51,499 --> 00:17:58,399
drinks and it just played some board

00:17:54,139 --> 00:18:00,919
games and had a really fun time and then

00:17:58,399 --> 00:18:02,299
the last stage after the event this is

00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:04,039
something we're trying to do better this

00:18:02,299 --> 00:18:05,479
year just kind of staying engaged for

00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:09,139
the attendees and really giving them the

00:18:05,479 --> 00:18:13,669
resources they need to be successful if

00:18:09,139 --> 00:18:15,499
they choose to pursue programming so

00:18:13,669 --> 00:18:17,929
hopefully what you've learned today is

00:18:15,499 --> 00:18:19,159
that you know now you know what dingo

00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:22,009
Girls is if you didn't know before and

00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:24,259
kind of why we need this you know that

00:18:22,009 --> 00:18:26,299
you personally can run django girls and

00:18:24,259 --> 00:18:27,799
you know how to survive running the

00:18:26,299 --> 00:18:31,509
workshop for at least you know how to

00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:34,639
plan one get it from point A to point B

00:18:31,509 --> 00:18:35,539
so if I've convinced you this is the

00:18:34,639 --> 00:18:37,220
thing you need to bring to your

00:18:35,539 --> 00:18:39,679
community the next steps would be

00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:41,960
finding a venue I would personally say

00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,279
great Wi-Fi as a must but I guess if you

00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:45,409
have really good network people who are

00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:48,759
willing to dedicate 11 hours like this

00:18:45,409 --> 00:18:51,710
wonderful venue that's also an option

00:18:48,759 --> 00:18:55,099
but if it has great Wi-Fi that's

00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:57,080
obviously better then once you have that

00:18:55,099 --> 00:18:59,299
that's really all they require for you

00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:01,450
to fill out their form it's only about

00:18:59,299 --> 00:19:04,220
five questions long it's really short

00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:05,809
and they'll usually accept with the

00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:07,460
Django girls organization will accept

00:19:05,809 --> 00:19:11,720
your application in about a week and

00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:13,849
then you can get started planning so

00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:15,169
hopefully everyone is ready to go and

00:19:13,849 --> 00:19:17,659
bring Django girls to your community

00:19:15,169 --> 00:19:21,979
because if you don't do it no one might

00:19:17,659 --> 00:19:24,679
so that's really it and I'm not taking

00:19:21,979 --> 00:19:27,859
questions but I would like to take a

00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:29,659
minute hopefully you know how much work

00:19:27,859 --> 00:19:30,739
goes into organizing an event so I

00:19:29,659 --> 00:19:32,509
wanted to give a shout out to our

00:19:30,739 --> 00:19:34,009
organizers because this has been a

00:19:32,509 --> 00:19:35,029
really awesome event so if we can give

00:19:34,009 --> 00:19:35,690
them a round of applause they'll be

00:19:35,029 --> 00:19:37,570
great

00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:37,930
[Applause]

00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:38,500
you

00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:42,269
[Music]

00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:42,269
