hi we have more lightning talks do you

00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:20,380
remember how lightning talks work who

00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:21,790
needs a refresher great lightning talks

00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:23,259
of five minutes five minutes the

00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:25,119
Lightning talks there is a timer down

00:00:23,259 --> 00:00:27,520
here that will count down when the timer

00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:29,950
starts when there are 10 seconds

00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:31,800
remaining the gong person who is a

00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:34,270
common person

00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,110
Laci will be my wonderful demonstrator

00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:43,649
the gong will start slowly making sound

00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:43,649
until right when it goes 3 2 1

00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:49,149
and then we all start clapping and then

00:00:47,649 --> 00:00:50,829
they have to stop talking because they

00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:53,170
can't hear themselves think and then we

00:00:50,829 --> 00:00:55,839
change over and then all the laptops

00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:58,780
will definitely work and everything will

00:00:55,839 --> 00:01:01,989
be great I'm not sure that I have

00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:02,350
anything to add I'm ended up you talk

00:01:01,989 --> 00:01:04,870
for a bit

00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:07,510
I'm gonna check ok so I've prepared a

00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:09,400
little activity for for between these

00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:10,840
sessions here I am not nearly as good a

00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,390
storyteller as Russell is I don't really

00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,010
have stories I like to play games has

00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:16,110
anyone ever played the game never have I

00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:18,730
ever

00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:21,520
ok so if you haven't played the game the

00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:23,590
way that it works is that I'll say never

00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,810
have I ever done a particular thing and

00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:28,360
if you have done that thing you raise

00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:30,490
your hand so if I were to say never have

00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:33,310
I ever been to Jango Khan what would all

00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:34,630
of you do yes everyone's hand should be

00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:36,460
up because we're at Jango Khan right now

00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:38,490
now this does never have I ever

00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:41,200
programmer edition so let's let's start

00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:44,470
never have I ever crashed a client's

00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,520
website I've done that keep your hand up

00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:49,510
if you've done that for more than an

00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:51,430
hour what about more than a day yeah

00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:53,980
sometimes we've had some kind of a bad

00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:56,020
day um bad days here so that's fun never

00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:59,220
have I ever taken a video chat with a

00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:01,810
client or my boss while wearing pyjamas

00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:03,010
that's definitely me I remote I work

00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:05,200
from home I know we had to talk about

00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:09,399
that today so pyjamas are a big part of

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:11,650
that we ready not quite we're blinking

00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:15,700
okay never have I ever gotten myself

00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:17,350
caught in an infinite loop if it lives

00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,790
are fun yeah and I feel like this is a

00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:19,750
really reassuring game because I think

00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:22,150
we've all made

00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:24,430
a lot of the same mistakes all right

00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:26,290
never have I ever spent more than an

00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:29,100
hour debugging something when all I

00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:31,240
needed to do was restart my server

00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:33,400
that's like literally everyone in this

00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:36,190
room right now we have we have all been

00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,420
there and it's so annoying to write

00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,620
because finally you're like all right

00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:41,170
I'm just gonna turn it off and on again

00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:43,120
I swear I've done this before and then

00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:45,459
suddenly it works just fine and it just

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,920
sucks all right never have I ever

00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:49,660
forgotten to update to master before I

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:54,340
submitted my pull request and gotten

00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:58,660
caught in merge conflict hell yeah yeah

00:02:54,340 --> 00:03:00,040
gets hard it gets hard we're still

00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:04,090
linked anyway I haven't made a project

00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:06,220
to work first time oh gosh yeah oof lies

00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:07,870
I know we have we haven't got a few

00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:10,390
Liars here yeah

00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:15,900
all right never have I ever committed my

00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:15,900
secret key to github in a public repo

00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:19,090
then you get to learn how to change your

00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,530
secret key it's it's really a learning

00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:31,030
experience for everybody it's awesome

00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:33,459
are we here almost okay do never have I

00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:35,590
ever been able to say words and they

00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:43,630
immediately appear on the screen in

00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:45,670
front of me well first we have one of

00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:48,730
our wonderful stenographers Cheryl who

00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:50,910
is going to share with us her magic

00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:50,910
piano

00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:54,580
[Music]

00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:03,700
I never realized how short I was until I

00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:06,070
stood by here and first of all I just

00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:07,780
like to say thanks to D Bo who sponsored

00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:09,690
us to come and it's an absolute

00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:12,910
privilege and this is my fourth year and

00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:15,030
it's just been great to come so right

00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:18,970
we'll start with the introductions so

00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:22,330
I'm Cheryl and I'm from Wales and for

00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:25,450
today my colleague captioner Andrew will

00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:28,320
be my ciri Andrew would you like to

00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:28,320
introduce yourself

00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:44,840
[Applause]

00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:44,840
[Music]

00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:51,840
thank you Andrew this is why your

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:55,820
captions are delivered by humans okay

00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,820
Andrew can you really introduce yourself

00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:18,230
okay I'll tell you more about steno so

00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:19,730
we type on shorthand machines which have

00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:22,700
been around for about a hundred years

00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:25,490
now so they originally they were they

00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:28,700
weren't electric it was very much like

00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:30,320
your QWERTY typewriter and that most

00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:38,360
slowly evolved to the machines that we

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:42,560
have mouths so that's the machine we

00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:44,780
type on so it's been evolved over time

00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,320
and so now it's connected to computers

00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:50,030
and allows us to provide these subtitles

00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:51,800
so you play it like your piano so you

00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:53,900
press chords as letters all at the same

00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:57,470
time and then they come up into the

00:05:53,900 --> 00:06:00,320
words so typically as I know a lot of

00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:01,760
you is fascinated by numbers I thought

00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,650
we let you know how many words are

00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:06,950
spoken on an average today at Django

00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:10,690
calm Andrew can you tell us the totals

00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:10,690
for Wednesday at Django calm please

00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,450
[Laughter]

00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:23,450
[Music]

00:06:23,469 --> 00:06:30,080
okay and that would take you about seven

00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:33,189
hours okay can you give me the figures

00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,189
for today's arre

00:06:53,479 --> 00:07:07,379
isn't karma sweets so I'll tell you

00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:10,229
about software and how it works so you

00:07:07,379 --> 00:07:13,289
can see on the screen here this is

00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:15,139
modern stenographic software and you see

00:07:13,289 --> 00:07:17,930
if you see the bar on the Left contains

00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:21,180
the letters that Andrew is pressing

00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:22,949
sorry on the right so on

00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:25,169
yes on the right is because I'm

00:07:22,949 --> 00:07:28,050
backwards okay on the right is the note

00:07:25,169 --> 00:07:32,389
bar and as Andrew presses the latus you

00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:36,630
can see the letters popping up there and

00:07:32,389 --> 00:07:38,340
so what it does it puts the words up and

00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:40,590
it does this by searching the database

00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:42,870
dictionary for the longest matches a

00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:44,880
group of letters and prints it to the

00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:47,280
screen and then adds a space ready for

00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,990
the next word this process happens in

00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,150
the space of one second before the

00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:53,610
translation of the outline is thrown to

00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:55,650
screen so Andrew a little input a word

00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:57,659
and within second it's thrown to the

00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:59,729
plasma screens on the left and right of

00:07:57,659 --> 00:08:02,039
the stage so if you look at the main

00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:03,840
screen and then look at the plasmas and

00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:07,409
see the connection

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:09,659
so how faster people talk traditional

00:08:07,409 --> 00:08:12,960
speed is anything from 180 words a

00:08:09,659 --> 00:08:15,779
minute up to and in excess of 250 words

00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:21,380
a minute ranging far beyond 300 words a

00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:23,080
minute on occasion and say nothing

00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:26,240
[Music]

00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:28,040
so the 4's working is captioners our

00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,930
preference is that the best talks are

00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:32,300
always from those speakers whose

00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:35,210
delivery steady and not at jet engine

00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:38,960
pace we're thinking time less is

00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:40,520
definitely more so we experience lots of

00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:43,310
different words we experience

00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:46,550
philosophers names Latin words Greek

00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:47,210
words double underscores which reminds

00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:48,980
me

00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:53,600
any chance of taking the double

00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:57,730
underscores out of Django codebase would

00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,730
make a life so much easier thank you

00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:02,530
[Applause]

00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,790
thank you so much Cheryl and Andrew it's

00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,210
so nice to have a peek behind the

00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:14,480
curtain that was so cool

00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:16,850
oh but I'm I live with it

00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:19,700
I'm allowed to carry on just a minute or

00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:21,860
two he would that be alright or not what

00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:23,240
do you reckon I kind of feel like she

00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:25,070
just worked really really hard this week

00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,540
okay we will make an exception we will

00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:29,990
make a 60-second exception

00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:32,090
thank you right okay so we experience

00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:34,130
foreign language this is such as German

00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:42,230
and Greek as I've already stated so we

00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:46,790
also have Welsh so how do we cope with

00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:51,070
that print out and our Bob City cry

00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:51,070
sorry Heidelberg now

00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:03,150
as you will see Andrews Welsh is about

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,800
as good as my Scottish Gaelic so you'll

00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:06,330
note that the email went out to speakers

00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,160
before the conference to ask for a

00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:08,490
preview of presentations and speaker

00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,560
notes

00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:13,590

welcome to Heidelberg so for us as

00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:29,250
captioners the pre-information makes our

00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:30,960
lives a whole lot easier it enables us

00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:34,530
to be accurate and not to make rude

00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:37,630
mistakes we're a human after all

00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:58,629
yes it's everything all we don't have to

00:10:57,009 --> 00:11:00,519
stenographer up anymore okay I'm gonna

00:10:58,629 --> 00:11:01,870
make sure I can see it because this is a

00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:05,680
good one um have you heard the one about

00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:09,100
the monk it's this old monkeys

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:11,410
he's trying magic and stuff but you know

00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:14,230
as amongst do he's up in his monastery

00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:16,480
he doesn't have any shoes he needs to

00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:18,310
brush his teeth you know a little bit

00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,350
you know he's the super calloused

00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:32,110
fragile mystic hex with halitosis

00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:34,720
I got a lowercase applause then

00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:36,250
uppercase applause I don't know what to

00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,600
tell you about that it does look like

00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:40,600
we're just about ready though this is

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,220
like the fastest setup that we've ever

00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,660
had I'm sorry that you're you know it

00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:46,089
was the fastest shaggy dog stories

00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:48,699
that's true that's so up alright without

00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:50,410
further ado we have an Apollo Gomez with

00:11:48,699 --> 00:11:53,600
high-test picked

00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:53,600
[Applause]

00:11:55,220 --> 00:12:02,360
so a hi everyone my name is Anna and

00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:05,150
today I'm talking about with you about

00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:07,430
PI test picot so basically I have two

00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:11,810
goes in this light and talk the first

00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:14,510
one is make you understand me so it can

00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:17,560
be quite challenge and the second one is

00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:20,290
gets you to know about PI that speaking

00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:24,050
according you with one of my co-workers

00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:27,920
even if this refers this presentation

00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:29,720
goes wrong maybe you like the this small

00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:34,820
plug-in that I developed during the last

00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:37,360
weekend so let's say that you you will

00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:39,950
ask it for developer a new feature so

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:43,820
basically you wrote the test and then

00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:45,920
you change a few files and you are ready

00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:48,680
for your first commit for this feature

00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:51,140
so basically we have a bunch of files

00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:56,120
modify it so and few test children

00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:57,980
before commit so after all you don't

00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,960
want is acute all the tests available in

00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:01,910
your code test just hypothetically

00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:04,790
speaking maybe you have some code base

00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:08,300
that will take a few hours to to run all

00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:12,140
the tests so basically you decide to run

00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:15,860
that is related to the modified files so

00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:18,530
then you decide to use by test for it so

00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:21,410
then you copy and paste the name of the

00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:25,610
files and then you go through this

00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:27,980
process executing git status and then

00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:29,960
copying the name of the demo job and

00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:34,010
then patel spacing stuff and then

00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:38,030
repeating over and over again so I don't

00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:39,950
like to do repetitive work do you ladies

00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:44,839
and gentlemen I'd like to introduce you

00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:45,380
fight a speaker so I was expecting

00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:48,010
somebody

00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:48,010
yeah

00:13:48,329 --> 00:13:55,889
so basically here is more demonstration

00:13:52,360 --> 00:14:01,630
of five seconds so basically let's say

00:13:55,889 --> 00:14:03,370
we changed a few tasks and probably we

00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:05,019
will execute the gate starts just to

00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:07,800
check the name of the task in this

00:14:05,019 --> 00:14:13,630
project I have the two - modules

00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:16,990
basically is acute by TAS picot and then

00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:19,509
it will filter just the tests related to

00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:24,600
the changed files the tests that were

00:14:19,509 --> 00:14:28,389
uncommitted yet so here you can say the

00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:29,259
test files that that wasn't committed

00:14:28,389 --> 00:14:33,490
before

00:14:29,259 --> 00:14:36,310
so PI test collected 30 treat each items

00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:41,500
I mean thesis but just one module was

00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:45,100
executed so basically that is a small

00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:48,790
plugging but looking for the future I am

00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:51,699
planning to execute Isis related to the

00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:54,819
branch so instead of executed the tests

00:14:51,699 --> 00:14:58,829
that were trained it would be nice to

00:14:54,819 --> 00:15:02,889
execute all the tests modified in a

00:14:58,829 --> 00:15:04,899
branch and also to get attached from on

00:15:02,889 --> 00:15:10,029
a specific module that maybe you change

00:15:04,899 --> 00:15:12,760
by didn't add the end test for it so the

00:15:10,029 --> 00:15:15,339
plug-in of course is open source and I'm

00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:18,580
looking forward to hear your ideas and

00:15:15,339 --> 00:15:23,440
feedback about it so that's it thank you

00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:23,440
[Applause]

00:15:24,029 --> 00:15:30,970
thank you so much Anna so who's next so

00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:31,750
right well Harry will be next Harry

00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:33,430
Harry

00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:36,550
yes sorry so Harry come on out and get

00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:38,879
set up so are we are we story telling or

00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:43,180
are we game playing in the interim oh

00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:48,990
well today wants another story stories

00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:52,629
are good it wants a game games I win

00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:54,699
just kidding say sorry time that's okay

00:15:52,629 --> 00:15:58,209
never have I ever deleted a production

00:15:54,699 --> 00:16:01,720
database yeah there we go those are the

00:15:58,209 --> 00:16:03,399
real errors yeah those are the most fun

00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:06,459
those are really good days aren't they

00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:07,990
yeah never have I ever and some of these

00:16:06,459 --> 00:16:09,910
by the way are taken from some of the

00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:11,769
talks that I've seen this week so they

00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:14,920
should sound familiar so I suppose I

00:16:11,769 --> 00:16:18,310
mean sorry they from mine guess we'll

00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:20,860
have to find out so never have I ever

00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:25,319
run a very important and crucial command

00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:27,600
in the very exact wrong environment yeah

00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:30,879
that one's fun too

00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,889
hey Lacey Oh what we ready yeah there's

00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:33,910
a tremendous okay well I'm gonna stop

00:16:32,889 --> 00:16:35,319
playing this game now and I'm gonna

00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:37,740
introduce you to Harry who's going to

00:16:35,319 --> 00:16:42,980
teach us all how to build a tree house

00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:46,500
[Applause]

00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:48,210
hello cool hey everyone welcome to my

00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:53,960
talk about treehouses which is meeting

00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:53,960
on automatically stop stop that again

00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:01,380
okay oops yeah so I think this is a

00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:02,880
fitting image to start with there's

00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:05,520
something really kind of childlike about

00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:08,250
being in the treehouse as a kind of and

00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:10,320
kind of escapism to being in a treehouse

00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:12,990
with the dog on the other end of the

00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:18,890
spectrum we have a slide which won't go

00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:21,780
on oh no I was gonna do it like this so

00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:24,030
the other end of the spectrum we have

00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:26,070
something like this this is a Horace's

00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:28,530
Cathedral in Tennessee it was built by

00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:31,560
one man over a period of something like

00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:35,400
15 years it's 10 stories high and 30

00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:38,910
meters high in 2012 it was shut down to

00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:41,190
do - fire fire regulations this is

00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:43,170
another really big favorite of mine it's

00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:45,120
a hotel called the woodpecker Hotel in

00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:46,380
Sweden and I really love it because it's

00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,990
basically just a house that you've just

00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:51,300
plunked in a tree you can stay here as a

00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:53,940
guest you have to access it by a rope

00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:55,200
and you're fed food via the rope I don't

00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:57,590
know if you're allowed to leave during

00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:00,360
this day but that's a really cool one

00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:02,820
this is one of the crazier end of the

00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:05,850
spectrum this is a treehouse called

00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:07,590
Sam's treehouse and the guy built the

00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:09,210
house and then thought hey one day he

00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:11,220
thought whatever this house really needs

00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:12,990
is a plane so we stuck a plane in the

00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:16,190
side and there's a boat in the other

00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:18,750
side and around on the right there's a a

00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:20,640
some kind of Apache helicopter as well

00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:23,130
and the picture here of the dock you can

00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,810
see and then this tree house wins the

00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:26,760
award for the most inventive way to

00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:29,340
access the treehouse you just get on the

00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:30,600
bike pedal and up you go I could show

00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:32,400
you pictures of beautiful tree houses

00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,840
and they're a lot I could show you them

00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:37,050
all day but I wanted to give you some

00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:39,030
practical trips ticks trips I'm building

00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:40,500
a tree house when you think about

00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:41,850
building a tree house the thing you

00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,770
might think to be doing first is getting

00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:45,780
a bunch of pieces of wood getting lots

00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:47,760
little nails and hammering them in this

00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:50,070
is a really bad idea because the tree

00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,900
actually lives in a layer underneath the

00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:53,700
bark so if you hammer in loads of little

00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,540
tiny nails what can happen is the tree

00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,280
gets

00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:59,070
I kind of compartment syndrome like you

00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:00,870
get a muscles and it can die another bad

00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:02,670
idea is to think hey I can get away with

00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:04,920
out with making it no holes whatsoever

00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:06,660
just by having some kind of a collar or

00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:09,720
some kind of cladding this is even worse

00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:11,400
because it makes a bigger cut in the

00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:13,350
bark and can completely cut off all the

00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,580
nutrients to the top of the tree so if

00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:17,370
you want a happy tree and you want your

00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:19,950
treehouse to last the best thing to do

00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:21,720
is to take advantage of this modern

00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:23,580
invention which is called the Garnier

00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:25,710
limb it was invented in the world

00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:28,920
treehouse conference which I've always

00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:32,850
wanted to go to in 1997 and it's

00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:34,110
basically a huge bolt you put one in and

00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:35,490
it looks kind of destructive but the

00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:37,320
actual hole you're making in the tree is

00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:39,690
only a small circle most of its living

00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:41,850
inside the dead heartwood and that piece

00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:43,440
of hardware I can hold like three and a

00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:47,190
half metric tons it's really really

00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:49,050
crazy the tree you're building on is is

00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:50,820
a living thing so you've got to take

00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:52,530
account of a few pieces of movement the

00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:54,750
first thing you have to take account of

00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:57,060
his growth a lot of people will think up

00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:58,650
my my bolt in here and over time it'll

00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:00,270
move but actually the bolt stays exactly

00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:02,280
where it is because a tree goes from the

00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:04,140
tips of the branches and it goes

00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:06,150
outwards in layers so all that happens

00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:07,620
really is that your bolt gets kind of

00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:08,940
enveloped by the bark so if you're

00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:11,040
building a tree house make sure that

00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:14,760
your beam is pasted spaced away from the

00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:16,920
bark the tree also moves in the wind it

00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:18,870
acts as a kind of lever as when the wind

00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:20,820
is on the top the amount of force and

00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:21,870
the base is absolutely huge and can

00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:24,420
brick poetry awesome too

00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:25,940
so what people do here on the left is

00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:30,680
called a treehouse attachment bolt

00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:33,630
allows the bolt to slide up up and down

00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:34,740
or you can use cables if you use too

00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:37,830
many cables then you end up with the

00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:39,870
tree swing little treehouse but normally

00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:41,130
what you do is you attach you fix

00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:44,400
yourself to one of the trees and then

00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:47,220
when the other trees sway your treat

00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,780
house is safe cool thank you for my talk

00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:50,310
this is a picture of me in my tree house

00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,570
it's more of a tree platform but

00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:55,170
hopefully one day I'll be living in a

00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:57,600
big house with walls and if you want to

00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:59,370
be inspired or know more about trees and

00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,980
climbing trees I can recommend this book

00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:03,270
the man who climbs trees by James Aldred

00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,800
it's just a really awesome collection of

00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:06,900
stories of climbing and rain forests and

00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,400
what kind of stuff great thank you very

00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:10,529
much

00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,529
[Applause]

00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:20,250
that was cool how is really cool now I

00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,190
want to have like stay in a treehouse

00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:26,130
hotel um our next lightning talk speaker

00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:27,720
can we get like high you you got to go

00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:28,740
around and make sure you're ready we're

00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,920
trying to make sure that people going

00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:33,960
around and stuff yeah people are missing

00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:35,190
I don't know how Russell does it so well

00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:39,330
I don't know I know

00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:41,820
Russell has this down pat looks like we

00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:45,330
might have it do you have a quick story

00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:49,170
do I do I tell a story no maybe not

00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:51,270
maybe not okay not to not not right the

00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:52,530
second next we have Martin who's going

00:21:51,270 --> 00:22:00,090
to tell us about Django rest framework

00:21:52,530 --> 00:22:03,390
surrenderers and parsers wrong so okay

00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:06,180
I'm Martin from Bulgaria and this is my

00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:08,760
first junko never so I'm really glad to

00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:12,180
be here today I'm going to talk about

00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:15,360
the jungle wrists trainers and parcels

00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:18,810
but before we start I want more about

00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:21,660
the project I'm working in so in the

00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:25,230
beginning we just get jangle we used its

00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:29,910
views and templates in just a simple

00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:32,670
HTML with the ginger to template

00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:34,680
language but after that the project

00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:40,710
became a little bit more complicated so

00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:43,260
we decided to use react as a front-end

00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:46,740
view layer in order to have some

00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:50,130
components you know this stuff so we me

00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:54,540
great our views to api's using jungle

00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:57,570
rest we actually built something it

00:22:54,540 --> 00:23:01,710
started working and we the system

00:22:57,570 --> 00:23:04,830
actually started to be used by the by

00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:06,870
our clients but his design became a

00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:09,630
little bit more complicated so we

00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:13,110
decided to move it to a single page

00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:16,470
application with react start using curry

00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:21,150
dogs it's a girl's rotor and so on and

00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:24,110
so on so this actual startup like two or

00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:26,260
three weeks ago so we're actually here

00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:30,340
we're mainly

00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:33,190
working with Django and truck now and to

00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:38,620
be honest it was my first time using

00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:44,679
javascript and I can see it's like

00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:50,590
Python you know it's not that good

00:23:44,679 --> 00:23:53,410
so we're currently using currently kept

00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:56,080
to front late front ends like one which

00:23:53,410 --> 00:24:00,130
is only for react and the other one were

00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:03,940
just me grating it to you know to the HP

00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:06,700
Eskimo so I I'm pretty sure it's pretty

00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:10,450
common architecture so I don't keep

00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:14,850
enough time to tell more about it as I

00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:18,549
said the Python is not like JavaScript

00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:21,160
there are different kind principles

00:24:18,549 --> 00:24:23,830
established and so on and the one that

00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:26,770
really bored means that Python and has a

00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:30,040
Python developer we are music NICUs for

00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:33,309
mainly snake is I mean for functions for

00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:38,140
the variables and so on and JavaScript

00:24:33,309 --> 00:24:41,559
its own Kimmel case so the one thing

00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:44,679
that really real bores me is that in the

00:24:41,559 --> 00:24:48,309
last system the Prius content that we

00:24:44,679 --> 00:24:51,700
were working at we kind of if because

00:24:48,309 --> 00:24:55,630
the Django rest returns the fruits no

00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:59,110
snake is you know so we hit like object

00:24:55,630 --> 00:25:01,390
point from a mistake a spawn point some

00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:06,610
function Kimo case which sofa

00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:09,160
I hate so we went through a couple of

00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:12,580
solutions of that the first and of

00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:15,940
course is to use JavaScript so as to use

00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:17,620
JavaScript to choose we write some UK

00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:21,179
deep came okay snake case

00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:24,460
transformations so when the data comes

00:25:21,179 --> 00:25:26,169
we transform it game occasion when we

00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:30,280
post up into the backyard with

00:25:26,169 --> 00:25:35,679
transformative snake is which is kind of

00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:37,950
bug because if you want to the actual

00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:41,730
the JavaScript knows that you

00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:45,720
the Jazz crispix expects the backend to

00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:47,970
return it a Sneaky's which the language

00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:51,480
does doesn't like it

00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:56,730
second thing I did is that when I become

00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:59,130
a little bit better in react I action in

00:25:56,730 --> 00:26:01,200
the results its results middleware so we

00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:04,200
took schema has middleware like the

00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:06,690
jeongwon's but not that good

00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:10,260
we moved the gate and post

00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:13,530
transformations to the middleware so it

00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:17,700
kind of keepin in the back of the

00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:20,370
developer calling but you know as i told

00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:22,530
you it wasn't that good ass jungle so it

00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:24,950
it was a lot of books with it so we

00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:29,100
decided to remove it

00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:32,010
yeah it kind of worked but I still

00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:34,350
didn't like it so the next thing I found

00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:37,830
is that John risk has renders and parses

00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:41,250
you can write your own custom one so

00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:44,100
that's the last thing we have now the

00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:47,870
logic that transforms chemo kissed a

00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:51,210
kiss and vice versa is in the back end

00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:55,440
this cow custom came okay surrender look

00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:59,960
you just in case from the Jason Ranger

00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,960
from the Raiders and just

00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:04,839
[Music]

00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,839
[Applause]

00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:11,249
thank you so much

00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:13,649
five minutes goes by really really fast

00:27:11,249 --> 00:27:14,849
I definitely understand that um next

00:27:13,649 --> 00:27:16,619
week we'll have shy and he's going to

00:27:14,849 --> 00:27:18,899

no great well I'm gonna continue that

00:28:26,129 --> 00:28:31,099
story after this wonderful talk about

00:28:28,229 --> 00:28:31,099
getting the Norris

00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:44,620
hello I'm shy I've taken Lacey's advice

00:28:41,659 --> 00:28:47,840
thank you from yesterday and picked

00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:50,510
subject where I have a strong opinion so

00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:54,620
what I'm going to talk about here is my

00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:57,650
opinion it's not really a consensus but

00:28:54,620 --> 00:29:01,789
yeah your mileage may vary

00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:04,669
and this is the menorah you might be

00:29:01,789 --> 00:29:06,320
wondering what get menorahs are but

00:29:04,669 --> 00:29:10,190
first I'm going to talk about actual

00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:14,289
menorahs actually there's two kinds of

00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:18,350
menorahs this is a bit of Jewish trivia

00:29:14,289 --> 00:29:20,960
there's the temple menorah with seven

00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:23,480
branches which used to be in the temple

00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:26,780
when it existed in Jerusalem 2000 years

00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:29,870
ago but this is not something that we

00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:32,360
use today in Jewish practice and there's

00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:35,539
the nine branch menorah or the Hanukkah

00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:39,530
menorah which we use every year in the

00:29:35,539 --> 00:29:42,020
holiday of Hanukkah and actually that

00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:45,110
this is the terminology of the

00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:48,260
english-speaking Jewish world and in

00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:51,710
Israel we call the the seven branch

00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:56,059
menorah Minova and the nine branch

00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:59,870
menorah Yukiya for Hanukkah but anyway

00:29:56,059 --> 00:30:02,679
these are the non gate menorahs and this

00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:02,679
is the gate menorah

00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:12,920
yeah I assume this means that you this

00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:15,660
is clear enough the this is the

00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:18,660
repository of a project I was involved

00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:24,720
with anonymized to protect the innocent

00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:29,070
and guilty and basically some of you

00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:32,850
might be wondering what is wrong in this

00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:36,230
picture so to answer this question we

00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:40,830
first need to go to something more basic

00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:45,330
and that is what do we use version

00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:50,220
control for at all and I think that we

00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:53,490
use it for two main goals one is to

00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:55,770
coordinate collaborative work so that we

00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:57,720
can work together on a common code base

00:30:55,770 --> 00:31:01,290
without stepping on each other's feet

00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:01,890
and the other is to keep a record of

00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:05,760
history

00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:11,190
but then this begs the question why do

00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:16,760
we need the history and there again this

00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:16,760
is my opinion there's two main issues

00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:23,310
not to sorry the well basically we need

00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:25,680
the history to fix mistakes we need to

00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:30,270
find when something work so we can fix

00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:32,220
it we need to sometimes reconsider

00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:34,980
decisions because the conditions or

00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:37,290
requirements have changed and sometimes

00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:41,460
some change was simply wrong and and we

00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:44,940
need to revert it and another thing we

00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:48,060
should consider when thinking about why

00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:50,670
we need the history is what we don't

00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:54,480
need in the history and that is the

00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:57,090
exact details of work being done so we

00:31:54,480 --> 00:32:00,390
don't need all the typos and typo

00:31:57,090 --> 00:32:02,580
Corrections we don't need the I fixed

00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:05,910
the white space because of review

00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:08,960
comments all that is is really noise and

00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:11,610
not interesting history

00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:15,210
so now we can answer the question what

00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:19,290
is wrong with this picture well for one

00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:25,320
thing git bisect gets severely limited

00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:29,190
when you have this picture and reverting

00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:30,960
a merge commit just is pure damage it

00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:33,660
and does the individual commits in

00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:36,030
non-obvious ways it's hard to find out

00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:38,310
exactly why the thing you committed and

00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:43,170
pushed like weeks ago it suddenly isn't

00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:45,120
there and usually when you see something

00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:47,400
like this it means someone just worked

00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:52,370
on a branch and finish the work and just

00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:56,130
pushed it and without any consideration

00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:58,080
so in summary if there's one thing

00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:59,970
you're taking from this talk this is

00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:02,100
what I want you to take code history

00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:04,500
should be kept in a way which serves the

00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:06,810
project going forward and not to serve

00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:11,280
pure academic historical research not

00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:13,110
code archaeology so use git rebase to

00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:17,100
reshape the history of your work before

00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:21,530
pushing and follow the example of the

00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:27,360
Django repository which looks like this

00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:30,470
and that's all I have today thank you

00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,470
[Applause]

00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:39,260
very very perfect timing - thank you

00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:40,820
shine alright our next speaker is going

00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:42,830
to be ducky she's going to talk about

00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:44,630
taking five minutes for your mental

00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:46,430
health and while she gets set up I do

00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:51,650
have or ducky do you have anything to

00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:55,100
set up Oh ducky can I finish my story if

00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:56,930
I insist okay so chemists just put up

00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:59,660
this little ceramic unicorn on to the

00:33:56,930 --> 00:34:03,950
counter and and Patricia is just going

00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:05,480
what is that so commit mmm excuse me

00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:07,070
what was your name oh my name is ms

00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:09,470
whack ms whack can you please go get

00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:11,210
your manager so the manager comes out

00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:13,130
and goes okay what's the problem and

00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:15,260
Kermit goes there with his Kermit voice

00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:17,780
that I can't do it says excuse me I

00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:20,000
would like a loan and Patricia just goes

00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:22,310
no no he has only this little ceramic

00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,800
thing for collateral what am I supposed

00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:26,300
to do and the manager knows who Kermit

00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,429
is everyone knows who Kermit is and so

00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:31,160
he just quietly pulls Patricia aside and

00:34:28,429 --> 00:34:33,620
goes it's a knick-knack paddywhack give

00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:38,240
the frog alone his old man's a rolling

00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:45,169
stone and now duckie who's less terrible

00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:46,640
than me hello oh hi everyone I'm duckie

00:34:45,169 --> 00:34:49,580
I'm gonna stand over here because I'm

00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:51,530
sure how are you all doing this is an

00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:55,070
interactive talk so please actually like

00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:58,190
speak back I hope you're doing well

00:34:55,070 --> 00:35:03,170
maybe yeah anyone feeling a bit tired

00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:05,270
like this week is just no no wow you

00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:07,580
have way more energy than I do I am

00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:10,280
really ready to nap and this talk is

00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:12,620
definitely not an excuse to do that at

00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:14,120
all but you know while we're here you

00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:17,600
know what's really important for your

00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:19,970
mental health sleep sleep is really

00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:24,050
important for you so I'm gonna get to

00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:25,790
that in a second but first exercise also

00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:27,980
really important for your mental and

00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:30,560
physical well-being so thank you to the

00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:33,500
organizers of Jagga con for bringing out

00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:35,150
those excellent people teaching us how

00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:38,720
to do exercises at our desk that was

00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:41,030
really awesome also I'm gonna try and

00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,980
slow it down a bit for the stenographers

00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:45,520
because I'm Australian and apparently

00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:46,720
we're very good at speaking fast

00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:51,369
I've known awesome for a little while

00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:54,040
now um and on Russell and him talking

00:35:51,369 --> 00:35:56,850
about time I'm gonna try and slow down

00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:59,800
not time itself I'm not that cool yet

00:35:56,850 --> 00:36:03,760
but I'm gonna try and slow down your

00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:06,130
perception of time so I'm just gonna run

00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:08,890
us through a few kind of body scans

00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:11,350
these are just kind of little exercises

00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:12,880
you can do if you're you're feeling a

00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:15,090
lot of feelings or if you don't feeling

00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:17,830
anything at all and you can just kind of

00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:20,440
run through your body and feel your

00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:23,740
feelings as weird as that sounds just

00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:25,180
kind of be with yourself and so if

00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:28,510
you're feeling angry you're just kind of

00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:30,369
like oh hey that anger what up you're

00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:32,380
just you're just doing your thing if

00:36:30,369 --> 00:36:35,590
you're feeling stressed or anxious you

00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:37,660
can just kind of visualize that and feel

00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:40,420
it inside you rather than fighting it

00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:42,369
which will only make you more anxious so

00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:44,110
I'm gonna get you all hopefully this

00:36:42,369 --> 00:36:46,210
doesn't make you feel uncomfortable but

00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:49,030
if it does feel free to opt out it's

00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:52,619
okay I'm not gonna force you but I love

00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:56,800
you all if you could to close your eyes

00:36:52,619 --> 00:37:08,350
and now just take some deep and slow

00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:12,220
breaths in and out in and out now I want

00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:15,359
you to take your mind to your

00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:20,050
extremities your fingertips or your toes

00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:24,430
doesn't matter which just feel the ends

00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:28,150
of your body you might be able to feel

00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:31,050
them touching the floor or just feel the

00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:31,050
air around them

00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:41,800
now explore further up either your hands

00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:45,250
or your feet very slowly just feeling

00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:50,530
your feet on the ground or your hands in

00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:52,990
your lap and then just slowly bring that

00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:58,710
up through your arms or through your

00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:58,710
legs up into your body

00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:07,169
still breathing in

00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:07,169
[Music]

00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:13,870
now you might be able to like if you're

00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:17,290
having any emotions at the moment I hear

00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:20,680
that's common thing people do you might

00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:24,820
be able to visualize kind of what sort

00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:30,990
of shape that feeling is it might have a

00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:34,410
color or a texture just kind of explore

00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:34,410
be with it

00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:45,160
now I want you to explore back down very

00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:47,200
slowly through your arms or legs maybe

00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:55,960
even shake it up and go to the other

00:38:47,200 --> 00:39:00,490
limbs now back to your extremities and

00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:02,710
you can open your eyes so that is a very

00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:06,640
quick demonstration of what our body

00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:09,520
scan is and you can do these as many

00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:10,930
times as you like any way you want

00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,880
like some people like to start at the

00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:15,700
head go to their feet some people like

00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:17,320
to go up and down it's it's up to you

00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:20,800
it's a really good thing to just

00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:22,540
practice every day for like however much

00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,190
time you feel like you want to spend on

00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:26,260
it and if the more you practice it the

00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:29,080
more kind of you can be with your

00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:30,610
feelings and yourself I don't have time

00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:32,950
but I really wanted to play a game with

00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:34,990
you called sleeping ponies maybe we can

00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:36,490
catch up later and we can play that or

00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:37,840
you can play it for five seconds where

00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:40,990
you oh close your eyes really fast and

00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:43,410
just full of sleep and then you wake up

00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:43,410
at the gum

00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:56,210
I feel so relaxed now sleeping ponies is

00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:57,710
the best game yeah so next we'll have

00:39:56,210 --> 00:40:00,470
Elia talking with to us about

00:39:57,710 --> 00:40:01,940
metaprogramming but while Elia gets set

00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:02,780
up I wonder Katie do you have any never

00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:08,450
have I ever

00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:15,590
I haven't ever have I ever never have I

00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:17,960
ever forgotten to rerun migrations ooh I

00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:20,060
have one never have I ever written a

00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:23,150
custom migration that just totally did

00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:25,220
not work and screwed everything up never

00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:27,230
have I ever tried to run make migrations

00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:28,760
on an older version of Django and

00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:30,260
wondered why didn't work because I was

00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,850
running it when South was a thing before

00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:34,490
make migrations was a thing and I'm

00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:36,620
wondering what's wrong in ah those were

00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:38,980
the days weren't they thank you Andrew

00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:47,450
all right I think we're ready to go whew

00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:49,850
okay so hi my name is Ilya and I want to

00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:51,680
show you the meta programming system who

00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:55,700
of you heard of the meta programming

00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:57,710
system yeah a few hands up I am pretty

00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:59,480
sure that you heard of the company which

00:40:57,710 --> 00:41:01,730
builds this system JetBrains and

00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:05,300
JetBrains is building whoo stuff right

00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:07,310
so what does NPS NPS is a language

00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:09,980
workbench so you can create new

00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:11,810
languages to make specific languages or

00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:14,000
new programming languages and it has a

00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:16,520
projective editor so what is a

00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,830
projective editor a projective editor is

00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:21,830
something different than the traditional

00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:24,500
editor also the traditional editor you

00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:26,600
have a file your Python file is a text

00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:29,110
file it's sort on a file system if you

00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:31,640
open this file it gets parsed and

00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:33,830
converted to an abstract syntax tree so

00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:36,920
it's rear isn't a ssin if you added this

00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:39,590
file this tree is regenerated this tree

00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:41,960
is needed for code completion for syntax

00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:45,800
highlighting and so on a projection

00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:47,750
editor takes this abstract syntax tree

00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:50,450
as the core element as a single source

00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:53,570
of truth and source another file system

00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:57,200
and what you can do now is define

00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:58,940
multiple editors which can be used for

00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:01,130
editing this tree so these are

00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:02,170
projections and I want to show this in a

00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:06,289
demo

00:42:02,170 --> 00:42:13,660
so I hope it's not too small

00:42:06,289 --> 00:42:13,660
its approach oh okay I hope you see it

00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:21,499
so this is a Java based programming

00:42:17,809 --> 00:42:24,170
language to support four MPs and we are

00:42:21,499 --> 00:42:26,480
at the Django con right so I want to

00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:30,049
show you what what it means to have a

00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:31,759
projection not a real text so I can say

00:42:30,049 --> 00:42:35,150
here I'm a Python developer please

00:42:31,759 --> 00:42:37,339
remove all the braces and the left code

00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:40,519
will be converted in a more pythonic

00:42:37,339 --> 00:42:43,849
representation and it's still working so

00:42:40,519 --> 00:42:47,499
if I go here and say I want to return

00:42:43,849 --> 00:42:51,230
something else like example dot-to-dot

00:42:47,499 --> 00:42:54,589
pattern it's working and the cool thing

00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:57,079
is that now I don't like this name of

00:42:54,589 --> 00:42:59,859
this class and I can rename the class

00:42:57,079 --> 00:43:02,749
without using a ring rename refactoring

00:42:59,859 --> 00:43:05,630
because I'm actually referencing a note

00:43:02,749 --> 00:43:08,619
in there AC it's not text anymore so I

00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:13,339
can type something like configuration

00:43:08,619 --> 00:43:17,269
help or provide input so it looks more

00:43:13,339 --> 00:43:22,430
like Java right and you see all

00:43:17,269 --> 00:43:24,470
references are renamed on the fly in the

00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:27,440
top of the code we have this new keyword

00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:30,170
maybe you knew it from Java and I don't

00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:32,569
like this I forgot to remove it and down

00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:35,119
here we have the editor component for

00:43:32,569 --> 00:43:37,069
this statement and it's just a

00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:40,160
templating language so I can just remove

00:43:37,069 --> 00:43:43,369
remove this new convert new new keyword

00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:48,200
and if I find the button rebuild the

00:43:43,369 --> 00:43:52,970
project and it's gone so and we can look

00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:55,039
at generators source code so we like

00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:58,539
generate Java code out of it and you see

00:43:55,039 --> 00:44:03,259
it on the right so it's the normal Java

00:43:58,539 --> 00:44:07,249
so what I can do with this actually I

00:44:03,259 --> 00:44:10,369
can use formulas in my code and edit

00:44:07,249 --> 00:44:12,620
this formulas I can use diagrams and

00:44:10,369 --> 00:44:16,130
edit this diagrams and it will

00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:18,200
be actual valid code I can put date

00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:21,260
pickups into my code and maybe a

00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:23,960
selection for time zones or I can

00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:26,000
represent diagrams and do calculation

00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:28,760
life calculation like you maybe know

00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:32,030
from Xcode playground so it's quite a

00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:34,330
nice tool download it try it out yeah

00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:34,330
thank you

00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:42,970
[Music]

00:44:39,630 --> 00:44:45,640
thank you for that that was cool

00:44:42,970 --> 00:44:47,560
we didn't have one mole yes this is our

00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:49,930
last one Raphael is going to talk to us

00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:51,400
about saving ponies by reducing their

00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:52,210
resource consumption of our Jenko

00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:54,310
servers Oh

00:44:52,210 --> 00:44:55,660
cheng'er took that seems relevant it

00:44:54,310 --> 00:44:58,960
does it does

00:44:55,660 --> 00:45:00,820
one more never have I ever never have I

00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:02,500
ever accidentally see seed instead of

00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:06,430
instead of bcc'd more than a hundred

00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:07,660
people a few of you all right I think I

00:45:06,430 --> 00:45:09,550
think maybe more of you are lying

00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:12,700
never have I ever used the wrong emoji

00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:22,690
oh there you go all right

00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:25,180
Raphael take it away hello so I tried to

00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:27,190
speak a bit slower than my previous tell

00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:30,610
Catholic Anglican some people still

00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:32,680
remember it I'm sorry I'm going to be

00:45:30,610 --> 00:45:35,530
talking about about how to you could

00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:39,430
reduce the resource consumptions of your

00:45:35,530 --> 00:45:42,250
general project so why would you be

00:45:39,430 --> 00:45:44,680
interested in that and so but that came

00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:46,600
from me for our provenance interface so

00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:50,560
we're running a car sharing system in

00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:52,900
Paris and well it's it's a bit big but

00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:56,710
project it's it's now seven years old we

00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:59,980
have train ride models to manage that py

00:45:56,710 --> 00:46:03,190
runs over takes 12 seconds to complete

00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:05,830
before accepting any requests and we

00:46:03,190 --> 00:46:08,920
search ads not bad good we had some some

00:46:05,830 --> 00:46:11,260
much smaller so defaults sitting with

00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:13,330
micro whiskey said yes thought up

00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:15,850
further integrins memory consumption

00:46:13,330 --> 00:46:19,540
nine hundred megabytes on our production

00:46:15,850 --> 00:46:23,590
servers and once the first query arrived

00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:26,880
we still need 3.7 seconds to answer q

00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:30,610
200 okay just an empty response on our

00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:34,990
warm up test end point not very good

00:46:30,610 --> 00:46:38,560
why why does it how does Jenga and micro

00:46:34,990 --> 00:46:41,230
whiskey work together well first micro

00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:43,960
whiskey starts in its default

00:46:41,230 --> 00:46:46,300
configuration and it prepares its local

00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:49,020
processes and then it starts accepting

00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:51,880
requests from your load balancer

00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:54,490
when first request arrives

00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:55,390
the walking process actually starts

00:46:54,490 --> 00:46:58,779
loads

00:46:55,390 --> 00:47:00,940
an event loads your whiskey the by file

00:46:58,779 --> 00:47:03,430
which will change change and also

00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:05,170
requests when you under more requests

00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:07,750
and at some point your Walker dies

00:47:05,170 --> 00:47:09,220
because too many requests and old or too

00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:12,039
much memory consumption or whichever

00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:16,720
satine's you has decided to set it is

00:47:12,039 --> 00:47:20,440
recycled and we go back to step two and

00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:24,099
an important thing is the default Micro

00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:27,160
whiskey configuration it starts in what

00:47:24,099 --> 00:47:31,809
is called lazy mud what does it mean it

00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:34,359
it will load your whiskey by file in

00:47:31,809 --> 00:47:37,630
each worker process instead of the

00:47:34,359 --> 00:47:39,369
master it does make sense on a kiss

00:47:37,630 --> 00:47:41,470
terminal call a deployment where you

00:47:39,369 --> 00:47:44,500
have lots of small applications not much

00:47:41,470 --> 00:47:47,829
load and so it avoids over consuming

00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:49,390
resources or requests what might not

00:47:47,829 --> 00:47:52,150
come you might get one or two requests

00:47:49,390 --> 00:47:54,430
for her work what information it's not

00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:56,470
gonna happen soon isit 8 an experiment

00:47:54,430 --> 00:48:00,160
and I decided to disable it what

00:47:56,470 --> 00:48:02,349
happened well Wow start a time oh yeah

00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:04,930
not bad good we saved a bit of memory

00:48:02,349 --> 00:48:08,500
not much but who's the first query

00:48:04,930 --> 00:48:09,430
handled by our Walker went much much

00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:12,880
sooner

00:48:09,430 --> 00:48:17,140
why is that well the main difference is

00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:19,990
that now micro SD will load the videos

00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:23,799
you're always greeted by file first

00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:26,829
thing then folks it's processes then the

00:48:23,799 --> 00:48:29,980
worker loads chenge and once but workers

00:48:26,829 --> 00:48:33,130
said ready Michael he accepts a request

00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:36,609
so we've moved some of our loading time

00:48:33,130 --> 00:48:38,349
in the master micro whisky loading time

00:48:36,609 --> 00:48:42,000
instead of the Walker and since we're

00:48:38,349 --> 00:48:46,210
recycler Walker in our standard process

00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:49,539
lifecycle we save time on every ladina

00:48:46,210 --> 00:48:53,230
of our requests but if it didn't feel

00:48:49,539 --> 00:48:56,319
good enough so we decided to make a

00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:59,079
small change and to actually load the

00:48:56,319 --> 00:49:01,990
whole jungle code base before

00:48:59,079 --> 00:49:04,359
processes I train wine afterwards so

00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:05,410
basically we just changed our get whisky

00:49:04,359 --> 00:49:07,450
application

00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:11,440
and hold a small function with deterrent

00:49:07,450 --> 00:49:13,420
which says warm-up Django and it what it

00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:19,240
does is basically create a fake request

00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:21,640
and just execute it in Django's turned

00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:23,830
out small tip we have to close

00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:26,110
connections of towards because here we

00:49:23,830 --> 00:49:29,860
are net exactly firing the property as I

00:49:26,110 --> 00:49:32,680
know it was a bit of a hack so and what

00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:35,950
we went okay so global start time nine

00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:40,240
seconds memory usage way lower and first

00:49:35,950 --> 00:49:44,650
query same time at approximately why why

00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:46,150
best change well basically here at step

00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:48,670
two we now load the whole whiskey

00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:51,100
application which means that all the

00:49:48,670 --> 00:49:53,520
general code all your models in

00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:55,750
memorable presentation your URL conf

00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:58,330
everything required and all your prayer

00:49:55,750 --> 00:50:00,730
requests is loaded before the processes

00:49:58,330 --> 00:50:02,980
as are forked and this memory is shared

00:50:00,730 --> 00:50:06,520
between your master process and each

00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:08,830
child even for recycled workers so you

00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:12,450
consume suddenly much less memory and

00:50:08,830 --> 00:50:13,840
your infrastructure team is very happy

00:50:12,450 --> 00:50:15,270
that's it

00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:19,280
think of the ponies

00:50:15,270 --> 00:50:19,280
[Applause]
