What to do and what not to do in order to collaborate remotely on Django projects without losing your mind

Remote working and “smart working” is very much in fashion these days, but what does it entail for the daily routing of a distributed development team? We will talk about tools, the disputed use of email, Skype, Slack but more specifically about time management, what you can expect from yourself and from other members of the remote team. Is your company “remote-friendly” or rather “remote-first”? When it’s time to spend a few days in physical proximity with your colleagues? We will share some examples out of the experience of a distributed team actively working with Python and Django on a daily basis, and show how you can make it all work, if you work on it.

it's very nice to be here it's very nice

00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:18,010
to be here in Heidelberg

00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:20,570
at django con europe this talk I

00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:25,369
presented it in a slightly different way

00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:29,150
yesterday yesteryear at PyCon in

00:00:25,369 --> 00:00:32,599
Florence and the funny thing about this

00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:35,690
talk is that one here to the next a lot

00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:42,680
of things changes and so it's very nice

00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:45,649
to to release it and we will talk about

00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:48,320
remote working remote working is a

00:00:45,649 --> 00:00:51,860
extremely big topic we will just cover

00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,960
the tip of the iceberg and I will try to

00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:59,210
make it short so there could be time for

00:00:53,960 --> 00:01:02,390
some questions at the end and it's very

00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:04,790
nice to do it in a conference when there

00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:07,729
is streaming live streaming so there are

00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:10,820
people out there watching now probably

00:01:07,729 --> 00:01:12,920
remote developers so I would say hello

00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:16,250
to everyone with a remote developer and

00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:18,470
is taking time out of the schedule to

00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:21,920
watch the conference from another

00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:26,780
location which is kind the point of the

00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:30,110
whole thing so another thing it's towel

00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:32,900
day I work for a company that has 42 in

00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:36,500
the name so we cannot just ignore it and

00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:39,439
our company motto is don't panic

00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:42,500
which is always a very useful thing to

00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:49,670
say and to keep in mind the other thing

00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:53,330
is GDP our day so again don't panic it's

00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:55,520
very nice to be in such a theater it's

00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:59,090
probably my first time on a proper stage

00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:02,689
with the proper microphone and with all

00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:05,570
the technology so it's it's tempting to

00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:09,880
feel like a rockstar I'm not a rockstar

00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:12,829
and so I would like to introduce a bit

00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:18,019
Who I am and the people I work with

00:02:12,829 --> 00:02:22,780
because it's very relevant for the kind

00:02:18,019 --> 00:02:26,170
of talk I'm introducing I'm mostly a web

00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:29,980
developer always been in my career

00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:33,370
and especially I work with Django and

00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:36,430
Python and that's the reason I'm here as

00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:40,209
I said I work with a company that has

00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:42,580
agile 42 in the name it's a coaching and

00:02:40,209 --> 00:02:45,730
training company and we are a very

00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:48,660
distributed company in Europe in North

00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:53,530
America in South Africa and especially

00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:55,720
our web and IT team has a net quarter in

00:02:53,530 --> 00:03:01,060
Berlin in a number of people including

00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:04,420
myself that works remotely and in

00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:07,480
particular I work from Milan and not

00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:09,760
only I work remotely for this job

00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:12,760
but I used to do it also for previous

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:16,239
jobs so I have a bit of experience in

00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:20,580
that I've seen it all I've also worked

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:23,519
in offices so I see the difference and

00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:24,760
basically the question I ask myself

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,630
every day

00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:32,370
is how this is possible to do

00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:32,370
effectively and without too much stress

00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:42,870
you know the dream the dream is to be an

00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:47,160
IT worker that works whenever they want

00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:50,560
usually from the from the beach with

00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:54,190
flexible hours leaving a very nice

00:03:50,560 --> 00:04:00,700
lifestyle but actually the reality is

00:03:54,190 --> 00:04:03,700
that you work out of a cramped space you

00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:06,220
work in not very good hours you

00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:09,370
basically have all the problems of

00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:12,610
working in an office and none of the

00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:14,950
perks like chatting with your friends at

00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:15,630
the water cooler or around a cup of

00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:18,850
coffee

00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:22,150
not to mention that remote working as

00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:24,479
this kind of Paris it's very nice that

00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:27,160
you still laugh at this light because

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:29,770
it's a slide from last year and I was

00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:32,800
wondering will be still relevant today

00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:39,080
because but yeah you you know what I'm

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:45,439
talking about so let's get a bit too

00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:48,219
core problem that we may face I took

00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:51,979
this quotation from an article that is

00:04:48,219 --> 00:04:56,150
linked there from Zack Holman and I

00:04:51,979 --> 00:04:59,719
think it encapsulate very nicely the

00:04:56,150 --> 00:05:03,349
problem what's the difference between a

00:04:59,719 --> 00:05:06,949
remote friendly company and the remote

00:05:03,349 --> 00:05:11,599
first company a remote friendly company

00:05:06,949 --> 00:05:16,569
is a lot of IT companies these days you

00:05:11,599 --> 00:05:19,819
can do one or more days of work at home

00:05:16,569 --> 00:05:25,219
you can take time off you can do

00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:27,440
flexible hours the result is is what

00:05:25,219 --> 00:05:30,169
really counts and not the number of

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:33,710
hours you spend in the office but still

00:05:30,169 --> 00:05:37,460
there is an office and people who choose

00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:41,860
not to work in that office a remote

00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:45,259
first company instead is a company that

00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:49,430
breaks the structure of the office work

00:05:45,259 --> 00:05:52,930
and creates a workflow that allows

00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:55,669
people to contribute in a more free

00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:57,650
environment and a more free structure

00:05:55,669 --> 00:06:04,219
and that's really the challenge for this

00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:07,930
century as I mentioned we work in agile

00:06:04,219 --> 00:06:12,229
coaching agile methodologies the whole

00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:15,589
culture of agile tries to help companies

00:06:12,229 --> 00:06:18,529
to work better and workers to work more

00:06:15,589 --> 00:06:21,639
effectively without burning out so we

00:06:18,529 --> 00:06:26,000
ask can a giant methodologies help

00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:28,639
remote workers or can agile

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:34,039
methodologies help a remote culture in

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:36,250
the company we think there are a certain

00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:40,550
set of agile methodologies that

00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:43,400
definitely help remote working for

00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:45,919
example a culture of TDD which means

00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:49,959
test drive and development which means

00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:53,690
that you create first a set of tests

00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:55,740
against which you run your

00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:59,430
actually helps a lot

00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:04,500
remote teams because it says a number of

00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:07,710
boundaries that don't just work because

00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:11,400
people share the same code intimately

00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:14,310
over the same keyboard but in a more

00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:18,930
flexible environment no code over

00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:21,960
ownership the same it's easier to work

00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:24,990
with the remote colleague if we all

00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:29,460
agree that a certain area of the code

00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:35,330
can be improved but all members of the

00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:40,010
teams and especially what we call visual

00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:43,680
radiators meaning that you have

00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:47,060
structures that help understand that was

00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:51,210
the status of the project like backlog

00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:54,960
boards all kind of artifacts that you

00:07:51,210 --> 00:08:02,150
can either share in your office or in a

00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:05,970
virtual board but then comes the kicker

00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:09,720
we know instead from experience and from

00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:12,810
work with companies that actually the

00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:15,420
most effective teams are the one that

00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:19,770
are co-located meaning that they work in

00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:23,220
the same office for example in large

00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:25,050
American companies this they discover

00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:28,020
that not only they have to be on the

00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:33,150
same building but they have to be tied

00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:37,890
together even if people have nice

00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:40,830
offices far from each other it better to

00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:46,410
put them together so they can contribute

00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:50,160
more that seems to break the whole

00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:52,440
reason of remote working this is a

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:56,340
principle from the agile manifesto and

00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:59,610
we know it's a few years old right by

00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:01,620
now and it says explicitly that the most

00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:04,200
efficient and effective method of

00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:05,760
conveying information to and within a

00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:09,600
development team

00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:14,390
face-to-face conversation so this looks

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:20,420
like a problem but I would like to parse

00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:27,300
these principle because it seems obvious

00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:30,240
from from the face of it and I think it

00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:33,930
keeps standing if you check carefully

00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:37,200
what it means so for example we should

00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:42,290
discuss exactly what we mean by face to

00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:45,390
face because in the good old days it was

00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:49,440
quite obvious to say that face to face

00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:52,080
meant some people in the office or even

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,570
some people around the table some people

00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:57,900
around the table discussing the problems

00:09:54,570 --> 00:10:03,180
of a software project but now we are in

00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:07,110
a completely different culture part of

00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:10,530
what face to face meant was proximity

00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:14,630
you are next to your colleague but also

00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:19,860
a sense of truthfulness meaning that

00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:22,290
what a face to face was against was

00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:25,410
against the thick documentation that

00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:27,540
moved from one level to another large

00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:30,360
meetings when there is no real

00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:35,970
discussion and this kind of things that

00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:39,390
were common in enterprise development so

00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:42,660
a face-to-face discussion not only means

00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:45,990
that we are standing with our bodies in

00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:48,360
short proximity also means that we talk

00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:54,510
to each other without the barrier and

00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:58,620
telling things exactly how they are in

00:10:54,510 --> 00:11:02,580
the 21st century in 2018 we have a lot

00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:06,540
of this conversation in chat group chats

00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:09,420
over electronic messaging you can be

00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:13,730
really true with your colleague in slack

00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:18,210
and you can just say a lie face to face

00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:18,900
so like Skype what's up and go out are

00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:23,060
now

00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:27,450
very common tools for teams and this is

00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:31,320
99% of what face-to-face means in that

00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:34,770
sense of course there is still an aspect

00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:37,230
of body language and the pleasure of

00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:40,020
interacting with each other that we we

00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:45,270
don't want to discount but it's a it's

00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:48,570
not the key part of face to face and the

00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:52,730
reason to be face to face is to exchange

00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:56,160
information so what can we call

00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:59,550
information in the area of a project

00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:02,520
development well the most obvious is

00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:04,920
discussion about the project so how we

00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:09,089
should do some things how we should move

00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:11,700
forward and so on very specific details

00:12:09,089 --> 00:12:15,420
about the code very specific details

00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:19,500
about design the artifacts that the

00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:23,279
development team does and also you want

00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:26,279
to communicate to your team the things

00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:28,980
that worked commits tasks done the

00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:33,180
things that didn't work all the bugs all

00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:36,810
the regressions and you want to chitchat

00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:42,270
and grow that team culture that is very

00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:44,790
important for a successful project yes

00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:47,339
this is all information and these are

00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:50,880
all things we talk to our colleagues

00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:54,930
about do we really need to be in close

00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:57,810
proximity to do this not necessarily

00:12:54,930 --> 00:13:00,990
because all these things you can for

00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:03,750
example rely on it's like channel and

00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:09,089
it's like it's very popular of Skype a

00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:11,910
chat or even Google email some of these

00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:16,440
things are actually better to be

00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:19,350
discussed online especially if you are

00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:22,279
talking about code or design having a

00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:25,890
shell screen helps you more than just

00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:30,230
discussing it at a meeting you know so

00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:32,320
we go back to that article by Zach and

00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:36,280
when he says that

00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:41,050
using a culture where everything you do

00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:44,140
is either manually or automatically push

00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:45,850
the intercommunication channel and for

00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:49,060
example I mentioned chatbots

00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:51,760
you know a tool that takes an action

00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:55,060
from some other system and puts it

00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:57,580
automatically in your chat then you

00:13:55,060 --> 00:14:00,100
create a culture where it's not

00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:02,260
important if you're in the office is not

00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:05,230
important if you're in the office that

00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:09,280
day is an important if in the if you are

00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:12,580
in the office ever because basically we

00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:13,810
are all remote workers from different

00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:16,930
locations

00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:19,840
some of them accidentally are in the

00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:21,790
same office and we all contribute to the

00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:25,660
same project and to the same

00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:30,310
communication channel so basically it's

00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:34,600
a cultural challenge rather than a plane

00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:37,810
all the technical challenge this is a

00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:44,230
new slide that I added a couple of days

00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:47,110
ago there are articles from the

00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:49,800
enterprise side of things from example

00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:53,710
from the Harvard Business Review that

00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:56,950
start to talk about this change in the

00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:59,320
workplace you know is not just for one

00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:01,230
team here and there but this real change

00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:04,840
is happening in the workplace where

00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:08,260
electronics electronic tools are the

00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:13,450
glue that they keep together a remote

00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:17,560
team this is a tweet from Lee Bryant

00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:21,610
researcher at paws shift and I suggest

00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:26,830
you check him out we always write very

00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:31,000
interesting stuff so one reason to do

00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:36,760
these at a conference like django django

00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:40,240
con is to help teams and individuals

00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:43,430
that want to go down this down this path

00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:46,370
so here I would like to

00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:50,570
to tell how we do it with our team at

00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:53,180
agile 42 basically we have a lot of

00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:56,270
shell stuff we have a share code

00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:59,390
repository and possibly this is

00:15:56,270 --> 00:16:02,360
reachable from the outside you know you

00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:05,510
have github you have bitbucket some

00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:09,020
companies may have security issues it's

00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:11,899
something you can work around we have

00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:14,110
automated unit testing at integration

00:16:11,899 --> 00:16:17,240
testing and that's what I said that

00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:19,870
agile methodologies or plain old

00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:26,180
methodologies from extreme programming

00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:29,870
they come very useful because all

00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:32,450
testing helps create a safety net for

00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:36,020
developers especially developers who

00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:40,790
don't have someone next desk to confront

00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:45,290
with they can just rely on the structure

00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:48,140
and they can move their code forward in

00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:50,209
a more sustainable way of course we have

00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:53,890
continuous integration which is pretty

00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:57,440
common nowadays but helps us with

00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:59,529
contributing code from different

00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:05,079
individuals who are not necessarily

00:16:59,529 --> 00:17:08,470
synced especially in in time zones or in

00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:08,470
working hours

00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:20,420
we have boards we use all kind of test

00:17:14,809 --> 00:17:24,500
planning and also we like to test a lot

00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:27,679
of things all of these of course must be

00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:30,410
available from any location and all of

00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:34,010
these goes into a channel which is our

00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:39,410
main communication channel and heartbeat

00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:43,520
of our project but of course you also

00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:46,880
have to adjust your personal style

00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:51,640
and the way that the team interacts with

00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,640
each other in order to make it work

00:17:52,190 --> 00:18:01,160
you if you do agile methodologies and I

00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:03,770
strongly suggest you should do it and

00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:05,840
you do your agile ceremonies starting

00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:08,570
with this daily stand-up with the sprint

00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:12,140
planning to review the retrospective and

00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:14,900
whatever your method calls for you do it

00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:19,190
online to do it in a way that allows

00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:22,520
remote workers to attend and remote

00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:25,910
workers to contribute for example with

00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:29,540
my team we connect regularly over Skype

00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:33,740
we even see each other that helps with

00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:39,160
the distance barrier and we do our

00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:39,160
sprint reviews with our daily stand-ups

00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:46,790
you should not work alone in the sense

00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:51,050
that you wake up in the morning you just

00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:54,650
a cure code and you go to bed possibly

00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:58,340
other things as well but you should

00:18:54,650 --> 00:19:00,800
contribute to the life of the project if

00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:04,670
you say I'm going to do this I'm going

00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:08,150
to do that or if you are going to do

00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:12,160
that to a colleague then I can help or I

00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:15,500
think this is a better idea to follow up

00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:19,490
one thing that I discovered in my career

00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:22,490
that is a bit against the whole dream of

00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:25,940
remote working is that having working

00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:27,650
hours that are compatible with the rest

00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:30,980
of the team especially if you have some

00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:32,570
team some parts of the team that work

00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:35,180
out of an office and therefore they do

00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:40,990
something more closely aligned to 9:00

00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:44,990
to 5:00 or at least to be available

00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:48,230
around the time where you expect other

00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:50,870
members of the team to be online and you

00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:54,380
have to keep that chat channel open

00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:56,960
during work hours it's it's basically

00:19:54,380 --> 00:20:00,560
your way of checking in in the office

00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:04,220
and checking out from the office I know

00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:05,380
that a major company that does remote

00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:08,670
working full

00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:11,800
not working so we'd say remote first has

00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:16,290
one of the few requirements is to keep

00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:21,240
the chat channel open during work hours

00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:24,850
you cannot be remote 100% of the time

00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:29,560
occasionally you have to meet if it's

00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:31,330
more than occasionally it's nice the

00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:33,490
kind of interactions you have when

00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:36,010
you're face to face are different from

00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:37,900
the ones you have online and sometimes

00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:40,570
they are just funnier or data or

00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:42,670
sometimes they're just more forward

00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:45,670
thinking so it helps with the planning

00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:49,300
and so every remote team should just

00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:55,660
meet occasionally just to sync up and to

00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:59,140
put a face to the presence online and of

00:20:55,660 --> 00:21:04,030
course there are a few companies I just

00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:06,280
named to that do remote first they like

00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:08,440
to talk about it they like to explain

00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:12,760
the tools they're using and so it's a

00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:16,630
good source of inspiration this is for

00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:20,860
example a screenshot and I understand

00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:24,130
that is the details may be lost but this

00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:26,740
is a screenshot from our own slack

00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:30,600
channel of developers and you see for

00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:34,390
example slack what that remind us of

00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:38,160
agile ceremonies like a stand up an

00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:42,660
error message from our integral from our

00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:46,570
bug tracker trailer which we use for

00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:51,220
lightweight project management sending

00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:55,630
out comments about a work in progress

00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:59,500
and things like this so and you see the

00:21:55,630 --> 00:22:02,680
comments you see for example coming from

00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:05,380
from gitlab comments attached to a

00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:08,140
specific story they are pushed also into

00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:11,050
the channel that's what we meant as chad

00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:13,390
was trying to keep the communication

00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:18,640
channel alive and to put everything so

00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:19,090
we can comment on these are a lot of

00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,750
state

00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:26,190
this from our continuous integration

00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:29,530
project and this is much more lively

00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:33,870
discussion about a certain feature what

00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:37,510
we should do about it and I can say that

00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:40,300
I'm not sure where the people were at

00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:41,980
the time I was remote in Milan but other

00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:44,110
people were probably on vacation and

00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:47,230
contributing little bit so this is the

00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:49,660
way we keep a project moving forward and

00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:51,880
of course the they come from is like

00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:58,660
which a lot of people are using these

00:22:51,880 --> 00:23:00,310
days for this so we are using a lot of

00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:03,640
tools to do that

00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:06,190
and this tools change constantly over

00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:12,370
time we are continually continuously

00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:15,880
refining and changing as we said we do

00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:18,580
test-driven development and we use unit

00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:22,390
tests selenium we have a lot of visual

00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:26,380
tests to align with what we want to

00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:31,480
achieve we try to do infrastructure as

00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:35,440
code another layer that I'll pass get

00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:39,370
away from the concept of having a

00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:41,110
staging server and the test server at

00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:44,500
the moment we mostly use virtual

00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:48,070
machines but docker is a very nice

00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:52,330
solution so I was very happy to hear

00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:54,160
from LaCie from the talk before if I

00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:57,640
understand correctly she is also remote

00:23:54,160 --> 00:24:01,660
developer so we see how all these

00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:06,670
techniques come together and recently

00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:10,600
we've moved to get lab our own Austin

00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:16,240
get lab as a git repository and project

00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:21,280
Center for our for our development this

00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:25,210
also allow us to use pipelines for

00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:28,240
continuous integration tying even closer

00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:30,280
together the development the project

00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,960
management and the continuous

00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:36,010
integration

00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:38,590
inside gitlab at that point we

00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:42,630
integrated gitlab with slack and with

00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:49,450
sentry which is a tool to alert of bugs

00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:52,450
and we created this chat bot that allow

00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:57,370
us to see almost everything that is

00:24:52,450 --> 00:25:01,480
happening in the project in real time we

00:24:57,370 --> 00:25:04,120
also moved the project management to get

00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:05,470
lab with boards and some Trello which is

00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:08,500
always nice because it's very

00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:12,940
lightweight as I mentioned we use Skype

00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:15,280
e4 des îles ceremonies and Google Docs

00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:20,050
whatever basically we try everything

00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:22,330
that can be helpful for having a team

00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:26,050
that is not in the same office to

00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:29,950
coordinate and exchange information here

00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:35,320
I have a screenshot of a pipeline a

00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:38,560
pipeline is indeed lab is a set of tasks

00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:42,310
that you can do to test and build and

00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:45,340
install on either staging or development

00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:48,280
machine and this is very helpful because

00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:51,340
it's triggered automatically by commits

00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:54,550
in the repository and these allow us to

00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:59,640
work as a team and not having for

00:25:54,550 --> 00:26:04,330
example a person who is only tasked with

00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:07,210
in code integration and code testing and

00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:13,360
therefore maybe may feel detached from

00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:17,320
the team as you can see here in we

00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:23,640
develop sorry we configured web books

00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:25,570
from get lab into slack to notify

00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:29,140
everything that's happening in the

00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:33,250
project inside our communication channel

00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:40,540
and therefore to be alerted about what's

00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:45,590
going on one other tool that I wanted to

00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:50,420
mention is sentry which is

00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:59,360
and add add-on to your code that alerts

00:26:50,420 --> 00:27:01,490
you of errors and problems and is

00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:05,630
configured to feed into the the

00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:08,300
selectional as well so if we go back to

00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:10,820
these you see for example notification

00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:13,100
from from sentry that are open

00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:16,970
automatically on the channel and allow

00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:19,220
the team to talk straight away about

00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:21,530
what's going on if it's just a small

00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:26,690
problem or if it's a major problem and

00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:31,850
needs needs to be tackled here instead

00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:35,570
you see more notification about about

00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:40,940
the code and the integration of

00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:44,600
pipelines coming from from gitlab all

00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:47,450
marked with with the team member that

00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:50,450
contributed to that code allow us to

00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:57,790
give a sense of what's going on in the

00:27:50,450 --> 00:28:01,210
development at that specific moment and

00:27:57,790 --> 00:28:03,980
so for example you see the great

00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:09,890
advantage of this approach is to

00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:12,170
intermix this automatic notification

00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:14,570
from example from gitlab with the

00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:19,820
personal comments this means that you

00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:22,160
don't have a separated channel for the

00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:25,880
the more technical stuff but it's all

00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:28,130
part of the team discussion and you can

00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:30,320
have a better sense of what's going on

00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:33,200
in the project without having to move

00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:46,240
from one project from one tool to the

00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:49,840
other okay thank you I think I ran a bit

00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:55,090
faster because I'm always afraid of

00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:55,090
going too late so I'm open for questions

00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:58,709
[Music]

00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:10,510
thank you that's for you

00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:10,510
thank you we have time for questions

00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:22,789
hi I am 100% full time report worker I

00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:25,580
don't do meetings in person I don't go

00:29:22,789 --> 00:29:29,120
see clients the only time I see clients

00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:31,580
is at events like this and one of the

00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:35,570
things you said kind of bother me and I

00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:38,389
wanted to know if you could tell more

00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:39,830
about this is that you said that you a

00:29:38,389 --> 00:29:42,769
lot of companies when it's the

00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:44,269
communications travel to be open during

00:29:42,769 --> 00:29:48,559
business hours yeah

00:29:44,269 --> 00:29:50,809
and this in my experience this is really

00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:52,399
bad because people see you online they

00:29:50,809 --> 00:29:54,919
want to talk to you and so you don't

00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:57,019
have your time to concentrate and do

00:29:54,919 --> 00:29:58,519
your work you're constantly interrupted

00:29:57,019 --> 00:30:00,860
so do you have any guidelines that you

00:29:58,519 --> 00:30:03,590
want to shirt you to avoid this kind of

00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:07,809
problem yes no it's a extremely good

00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:12,260
question because it opens up a whole

00:30:07,809 --> 00:30:14,029
area which is kind of team management so

00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:17,240
what do you expect from your team

00:30:14,029 --> 00:30:20,389
members and so on in this respect I

00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:22,720
don't think it's different from a team

00:30:20,389 --> 00:30:25,940
that is co-located in the same office

00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:29,419
you shouldn't assume that since your

00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:32,210
coworker is at the desk at the desk next

00:30:29,419 --> 00:30:36,559
to you is always ready to take questions

00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:39,019
and this basically happens in the same

00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:42,860
way when you're removed since you're

00:30:39,019 --> 00:30:47,470
remote you are not expected to be

00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:47,470
available to chat at any moment because

00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:53,410
just because you know you have a green

00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:57,179
dot next to your avatar or something

00:30:53,410 --> 00:31:00,460
similar depending on on the tool you use

00:30:57,179 --> 00:31:03,429
one thing that I skipped over because

00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:06,940
it's it's a whole lot er it's a lot of

00:31:03,429 --> 00:31:09,160
other things is you have to have a work

00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:12,100
in agreement with your team a working

00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:15,040
agreement is the term we use a lot in in

00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:17,530
agile coaching and basically it starts

00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:20,020
with nothing with an empty piece of

00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:22,660
paper and can grow to be extremely

00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:26,100
complicated the work in agreement you

00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:31,330
have with your team is for example that

00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:35,110
you have you are online it doesn't mean

00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:37,510
that you are available you may say on

00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:40,600
the channel well today I'm just doing

00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:44,340
lightweight work and so I'm free if

00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:47,830
anyone needs help or the contrary

00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:49,600
usually you're free but if you if today

00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:51,970
you're going to do something that really

00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:56,160
need concentration I'm not available for

00:31:51,970 --> 00:32:01,059
anything I cannot give you exactly

00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:05,050
what's best the thing I can say is you

00:32:01,059 --> 00:32:06,820
have to talk about it in the team you

00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:09,700
have to come up with something that is

00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:12,400
probably written down because it helps

00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:16,330
just you have a shared document and you

00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:19,510
put down these rules as well we prefer

00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:22,470
to call it work in agreement sometimes

00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:24,460
the rules are pushed down by management

00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:29,200
that's unfortunate

00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:33,700
sometimes it's necessary the the thing I

00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:38,429
said is yes management asked this as to

00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:41,020
have the chat or the chat channel open

00:32:38,429 --> 00:32:43,210
it's good or it's bad well they probably

00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:47,679
have the reasons is something that is

00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:49,450
part of a discussion and it's as part of

00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:51,760
an agile coaching company something that

00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:53,980
probably get a lot from us I'm sorry you

00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:55,870
have to talk about it because that's the

00:32:53,980 --> 00:33:00,050
key now you have to you have to define

00:32:55,870 --> 00:33:06,350
your own process one thing

00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:08,570
I can suggest more precisely one of the

00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:11,810
ceremony is the edge is the daily

00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:15,110
stand-up it's common to most agile

00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:18,830
methodologies and we found that it's

00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:20,150
very useful even if you and the rest of

00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:22,850
your team are working on different

00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:26,180
projects or different sub projects

00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:28,430
different tasks even if you work

00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:28,970
remotely and even at different time

00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:33,800
zones

00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:36,680
you should find a time each day to sync

00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:39,620
up with the rest of the team so for

00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:45,110
example myself and my team we do it at 3

00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:49,400
p.m. each day and over Skype if you're

00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:51,680
really busy with your project or form

00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:54,500
the task you're doing which is part of a

00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:57,800
larger project you should still find

00:33:54,500 --> 00:34:00,470
time to do these 5 to 15 minutes and

00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:03,080
this 5 to 15 minutes say to the rest of

00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:03,650
the team and working on this I'm sorry

00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,780
guys

00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:09,260
I cannot help with anything else because

00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:11,990
I'm 100% focused on this and the team

00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:14,960
should understand then at that point if

00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:16,780
someone shuts you up oh did you see the

00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:20,270
things that I'm sorry I said very

00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:24,830
specifically that today is devoted to

00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:26,510
this so it's then we enter in the area

00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:30,860
of rudeness which is a completely

00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:34,880
different thing and since it's a

00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:37,880
ceremony and it's not when you have time

00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:40,940
but this fixed time each day you plan

00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:42,980
your day around it so if you know if

00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:45,770
it's first first thing in the morning or

00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:48,679
after a break and so on is not

00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:51,110
interrupting you because you plan your

00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:57,470
day around it everyone gathers around

00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:59,720
either in person or with a tool and they

00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:02,210
tell each other how much they are

00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:07,170
available to help each other with the

00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:09,369
things I working on ourselves thank you

00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:10,299
that's another question at the back if

00:35:09,369 --> 00:35:13,900
you're up for that

00:35:10,299 --> 00:35:15,940
yep definitely yes thank you and I too

00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:19,890
had an issue with one of the things she

00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:21,700
said yeah he said no code ownership

00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:24,369
mm-hmm

00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:26,890
this resonated with one of my personal

00:35:24,369 --> 00:35:31,619
mantras which is if you ride it you own

00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:34,660
it which means take responsibility so

00:35:31,619 --> 00:35:37,990
how do you avoid if people are not

00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:40,359
allowed to own parts of the code how do

00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:43,559
you avoid that nobody takes

00:35:40,359 --> 00:35:48,160
responsibility for problems that arise

00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:53,859
well the responsibilities is from the

00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:55,539
team if you work in a team and our idea

00:35:53,859 --> 00:35:59,019
is that we always work in a team rather

00:35:55,539 --> 00:36:01,630
than individuals of course if you're if

00:35:59,019 --> 00:36:06,690
you've been subcontracted to just work

00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:06,690
on a specific piece of software and

00:36:07,019 --> 00:36:13,509
you're the only one really working on it

00:36:10,529 --> 00:36:16,440
so things may be different but in most

00:36:13,509 --> 00:36:20,829
cases you work on a project as a team

00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:24,430
the the code is owned by the team the

00:36:20,829 --> 00:36:28,329
team has responsibility and individuals

00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:32,069
within the team may take action on a

00:36:28,329 --> 00:36:35,170
specific part of code on a specific task

00:36:32,069 --> 00:36:38,710
always saying to the rest of the team we

00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:41,460
are doing this because of this I've

00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:45,460
chosen this solution because of this

00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:51,240
other members may contribute or may even

00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:56,799
change it giving explanations now if

00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:59,640
someone from your team enter in the code

00:36:56,799 --> 00:37:04,150
you've been working on for six months at

00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:09,460
very astute level with a lot of good

00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:12,039
ideas and put bad bad code inside it

00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:16,299
because it didn't understand what you

00:37:12,039 --> 00:37:20,180
were trying to do and commits it then

00:37:16,299 --> 00:37:22,760
again we entered the state of rudeness

00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:27,109
it's a problem within the team it's a

00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:30,529
problem that your colleagues are not up

00:37:27,109 --> 00:37:32,240
to the same level of quality that you

00:37:30,529 --> 00:37:38,150
have and you should have a discussion

00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:41,240
with them about this so I understand

00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:48,079
since I I always had a career as a

00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:52,039
developer how we feel about the code and

00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:54,289
the artifacts we have developed without

00:37:52,039 --> 00:37:57,319
entering into the world of code reviews

00:37:54,289 --> 00:37:59,569
and also pair programming which is very

00:37:57,319 --> 00:38:03,619
useful and now basically can also be

00:37:59,569 --> 00:38:06,529
done online in a number of ways you

00:38:03,619 --> 00:38:08,119
should always be up for discussion and

00:38:06,529 --> 00:38:11,349
review of what you've done with the rest

00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:14,510
of the team and in this respect the

00:38:11,349 --> 00:38:17,480
responsibility of what the code does

00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:20,270
moves from yourself personally to the

00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:22,760
whole team I don't know if it's the

00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:24,289
answer you wanted to hear no it's

00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:26,900
exactly what I wanted to hear thanks ok

00:38:24,289 --> 00:38:32,210
thank you ok that's one more question in

00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:35,599
the front so I want to try to the first

00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:38,119
question yes and I think that like one

00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:42,770
of the most common problems with tools

00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:46,549
like slack is defining what has to be

00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:50,000
real-time communication what can happen

00:38:46,549 --> 00:38:52,099
offline it's like so imagine I have an

00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,420
issue I want to talk to someone it's

00:38:52,099 --> 00:38:55,789
like a lightweight meeting we chat for

00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:57,230
five minutes that works but if there is

00:38:55,789 --> 00:38:59,299
something that requires somebody's

00:38:57,230 --> 00:39:02,329
attention and doesn't have to happen

00:38:59,299 --> 00:39:06,289
immediately then an email is probably

00:39:02,329 --> 00:39:08,930
better or a ticket on whatever so my

00:39:06,289 --> 00:39:13,369
question is how do you define the things

00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:14,720
that can go on slack and things that you

00:39:13,369 --> 00:39:16,940
probably better not put on slack because

00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:19,309
then there will be buried by 500 more

00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:20,750
messages and it was something that could

00:39:19,309 --> 00:39:22,279
have waited and it's better if you deal

00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:24,260
with it like one sorry when you look at

00:39:22,279 --> 00:39:28,819
all your emails or tickets or whatever

00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:32,779
yes sure no I probably notice from from

00:39:28,819 --> 00:39:33,980
my hair not exactly a freshman out of

00:39:32,779 --> 00:39:36,619
college so

00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:39,260
I grew up with email and still find that

00:39:36,619 --> 00:39:41,510
emails is extremely valuable tool you

00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:43,910
can express your point of view

00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:47,829
especially about design of code or a

00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:50,540
project much more clearly and allows for

00:39:47,829 --> 00:39:53,750
also for a bit more time to articulate

00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:57,079
your message so my co-workers get a lot

00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:59,359
of emails from me you know it's I'm

00:39:57,079 --> 00:40:02,450
active on the companies like but they

00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:06,530
get more emails and sometimes they say

00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:12,700
oh it's one of those long emails from

00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:15,619
Alessio again and they say well how what

00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:18,560
which is my you know boundary between

00:40:15,619 --> 00:40:23,420
slack you know real-time communication

00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:27,230
and the email I think the synchronous or

00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:30,109
synchronous evaluation is the best one

00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:34,550
as I mentioned I have a rough feeling of

00:40:30,109 --> 00:40:38,000
the time my co-workers are in the office

00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:40,670
or they are active I don't know for sure

00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:43,400
especially you know 5 p.m. is the in

00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:49,430
easy out or whatever but I have a rough

00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:51,470
idea so I don't just like at evenings

00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:57,130
Saturdays and Sundays of things like

00:40:51,470 --> 00:41:01,550
that and also I don't push long

00:40:57,130 --> 00:41:03,170
discussions over slack by the finish on

00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:05,690
a long discussion something that I want

00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:08,119
to say about the project doesn't need to

00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:10,609
be resolved in the next five minutes

00:41:08,119 --> 00:41:15,740
it's something that can wait and can

00:41:10,609 --> 00:41:19,730
also have a longer discussion and I so I

00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:21,650
put it an email and I explain well these

00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:25,700
are this is my point of view we can

00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:28,160
discuss it or sometimes I say if you

00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:31,609
have some idea just let's chat about it

00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:34,220
or let's review it at the next stand-up

00:41:31,609 --> 00:41:36,849
meeting which is always a good singing

00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:42,140
point for this kind this kind of stuff

00:41:36,849 --> 00:41:46,339
not way nowadays I've I've moved to in

00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:47,269
even more a synchronous way meaning if I

00:41:46,339 --> 00:41:49,569
have something very

00:41:47,269 --> 00:41:52,429
to say I usually put it in a Google Doc

00:41:49,569 --> 00:41:55,189
allowing other members of the team to

00:41:52,429 --> 00:42:01,669
comment and even edit what I what I've

00:41:55,189 --> 00:42:04,369
written I use chat basically now slack

00:42:01,669 --> 00:42:09,259
but in the past it was Skype and other

00:42:04,369 --> 00:42:12,729
tools up first when I when I have

00:42:09,259 --> 00:42:17,049
something to ask to a co-worker of mine

00:42:12,729 --> 00:42:21,229
that would be in a traditional office

00:42:17,049 --> 00:42:25,609
just moving to their desk and asking so

00:42:21,229 --> 00:42:28,339
are you working on this have you have

00:42:25,609 --> 00:42:33,039
you seen that problem do you think we

00:42:28,339 --> 00:42:33,039
should act immediately or you can wait

00:42:34,479 --> 00:42:41,929
what are your plans for today and things

00:42:37,159 --> 00:42:46,279
like this or help help help the server

00:42:41,929 --> 00:42:48,679
has a system load the system load of 120

00:42:46,279 --> 00:42:51,019
and I ran out of ideas and that's

00:42:48,679 --> 00:42:56,760
probably the best use for an instant

00:42:51,019 --> 00:42:58,120
message yes thank you

00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:01,320
[Applause]

00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:01,320
[Music]

00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:10,890
last slide I will put them on SlideShare

00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:14,960
there are some links to thing I talked

00:43:10,890 --> 00:43:14,960
