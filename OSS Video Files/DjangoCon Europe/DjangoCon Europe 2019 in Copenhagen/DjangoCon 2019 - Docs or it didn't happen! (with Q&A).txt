hello everyone it's really great to be

00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:09,660
here this is my second django con europe

00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:14,280
ever the first one was in 2016 in

00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:16,800
Budapest and I was not able to enjoy it

00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:19,890
as much as I am enjoying this one so

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,689
it's really great to be back today we

00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,789
are going to talk about ducks or didn't

00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:26,939
happen which is how I kind of live my

00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:30,119
life I hope to see more ducks talks next

00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:32,880
year but let's see right so why are we

00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:34,320
here here as in in this room not on this

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,920
planet this is not an existential

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,930
question why are you sitting here in

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,390
this talk because we want to have more

00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:44,969
users more contributors we want to

00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:48,149
increase adoption of our open source

00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:50,430
projects and we are hoping to believe

00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:52,079
that documentation can help us but

00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:54,930
something something is stopping us from

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:58,260
writing documentation so this is a very

00:00:54,930 --> 00:01:00,090
special edition as Sarah said of this

00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,160
talk and this is only something that I

00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,780
would do for a Django community which is

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,270
I'm going to take questions because I

00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:09,479
never take questions and I did get some

00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:11,729
questions in advance on Twitter

00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:13,799
so I've already incorporated these into

00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:15,540
the end of the presentation and I'm also

00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:18,119
going to encourage you to write to your

00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:20,070
questions on slack there's a questions

00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:23,520
channel on the slack and we have a great

00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:25,740
moderator for online questions and then

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,880
if we have time at the end maybe I'll

00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,860
let some people come up to the

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,210
microphone but we will see the reason I

00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:32,040
know where the reason I don't normally

00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:34,409
take questions is because most of the

00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,509
questions are best answered when you ask

00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:38,640
me face-to-face and when we have a

00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:40,680
laptop with us right so a lot of the

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,329
stuff is I have this readme it's in

00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,070
really bad shape how can I fix it I

00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:47,250
can't really answer this from this stage

00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:49,020
right so I do want to encourage you to

00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:51,659
come and talk to me afterwards write to

00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:55,920
me on slack Twitter Email I'm here for

00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:58,320
you so Who am I as they said I am that

00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,090
Docs lady I have been for the past five

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,950
years or so I may have been a technical

00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:03,719
writer for about ten years but five

00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:05,670
years ago I joined Red Hat's I live in

00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:07,740
Prague I work at Red Hat I document

00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:10,560
OpenStack platform which means I read a

00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:12,030
lot of Python and I used to work in

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,470
containers and I kind of played with him

00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:16,750
like this

00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:18,340
like most of us before that I was

00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:20,860
working in the Java space

00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:24,010
I'm also recovering scrum master and I

00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:26,410
still love a Jalan DevOps I really do

00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:28,300
I'm on the core team community

00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:30,220
management of write the docs

00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:33,010
together with my friend Satoru mine and

00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:35,230
two other people and if write the docs

00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:36,610
sounds like read the Ducks to you then

00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:38,950
it's because it was started by the same

00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:40,600
people so era culture is the co-founder

00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:43,510
of both write the docs and read the docs

00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:45,550
and it's a wonderful community built on

00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:47,530
open source principles specifically

00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:49,420
built on Django and Python community

00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:50,800
values which is part of the reason I

00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:53,950
really love it

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:56,050
I'm a Django girls alumni I used to

00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:59,350
organize workshops in Czech Republic and

00:02:56,050 --> 00:03:02,020
I roam around pi Khan's and Django

00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:04,990
Khan's in around Europe coaching

00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:07,540
developers on documentation running docs

00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:10,150
sprints I was very fortunate to join

00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:13,660
Django under the hood for a few years to

00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:16,000
run sprints I'm also contributing to

00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:17,470
fedora and I'm the co-author together

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,209
with Sacha of the happiness packets

00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:20,890
project which has nothing to do with

00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:22,300
technical or software but it has

00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:24,310
everything to do with being nice to

00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,760
people so I highly recommend you to look

00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:26,110
it up

00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:29,500
I have stickers for most of these things

00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:32,050
out in the front and also in my bag so

00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,880
what am I going to talk about today the

00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:36,370
main parts of the presentation are going

00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:39,670
to be content strategy which basically

00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:42,570
means think before you dock which I hope

00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:44,739
you are also implementing in your coding

00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:46,810
so it's the same thing

00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:49,420
plan a little bit save a lot of time and

00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:51,580
aggravation later DevOps for docs

00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:53,770
because when I first started working as

00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:56,920
a technical writer we used framemaker

00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:58,540
which is a very Microsoft Word Z type of

00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,160
July see some heads nodding yes I'm so

00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:02,170
happy and that we don't use that anymore

00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:04,270
and then Houck xml came along and

00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:06,340
everybody was happy and now xml is going

00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:09,040
away and everybody is even happier so

00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:10,989
I've seen the the technical spectrum of

00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,790
the technical writing world changed

00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:14,680
quite drastically in the last 10 years

00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:16,419
so there's a lot of cool stuff happening

00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:18,640
there and the last thing is the

00:04:16,419 --> 00:04:20,650
community spirits because we do not work

00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:23,380
in a vacuum and we are all in this

00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:25,270
together so I would like to invite you

00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:27,040
to join the documentarian club currently

00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:30,090
populated by capybaras and

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,990
humans and what is a documentarian a

00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:35,860
documentary this is from the right to

00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:38,620
Docs manifesto a documentarian is

00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:41,200
someone who cares about documentation

00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:44,470
and communication in the software

00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:46,630
industry regardless of job title okay so

00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:49,120
it's no longer tech writers developers

00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:51,940
you know designers everybody can care

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:55,840
about communicating and describing the

00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:58,240
software regardless of job role so we

00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,800
are all documentarians okay it doesn't

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,050
matter if you're a community manager if

00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:04,690
you're a support engineer everybody can

00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:07,360
have something to do to make this a

00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:08,730
better place it's the same as we're all

00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:16,840
involved in the software development

00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:18,460
cycle in one way or another so content

00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:23,160
strategy means asking the right

00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:26,380
questions ahead of time and I'm going to

00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:28,300
give you a slight bit of different way

00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:30,490
of thinking about this okay because this

00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:33,280
is the kind of strategic thinking about

00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:35,470
documentation that I have to deal with a

00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,920
lot when I work with engineers at work

00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:41,920
for example because I often find that

00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:44,770
for some people when you create a tool

00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:46,540
when you make software and you send it

00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:48,640
out to the world then you want to tell

00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:49,860
everybody everything about it you know

00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,790
so it's almost like this existential

00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:53,320
validation you know when you're a child

00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:55,000
and you show your drawing to your

00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:58,030
parents if they don't acknowledge it it

00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,060
means it doesn't exist right so we are

00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:03,250
trying to change that way of thinking

00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:05,470
whereas you no longer think of this as

00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:07,690
what it's in it for me is what is in it

00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:11,170
for my readers and my readers are my

00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:12,940
users okay so I want to create value in

00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:15,160
the documentation I don't have to

00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:18,130
document every single thing anymore

00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:21,060
which is quite nice actually so I'm

00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:24,460
going to use the 5w questions the why

00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:28,930
who what when and where probably in this

00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:31,240
order I can't remember so why do I need

00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:33,550
to know this it's the first thing that

00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:36,070
you should consider why do I care about

00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:38,380
the documentation that I'm reading which

00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:40,400
is exactly the same question is why do I

00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:42,440
care about the software that

00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:45,110
trying to get me to use right so if

00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:47,300
we're thinking about this not from a hey

00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:50,180
this tool can do all this cool stuff is

00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:51,800
ask not what your tool with your tool

00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:56,660
can do for you is what you can do with

00:06:51,800 --> 00:07:01,120
this tool okay so so as an example I'm

00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:03,199
giving the this example which is quite a

00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,780
interesting thing when you think about

00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:08,449
it because we have this problem in many

00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:10,850
of the bigger documentation sets but

00:07:08,449 --> 00:07:13,250
also in the smaller project is something

00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:14,930
you can consider something we've been

00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:17,600
working on at Red Hat for the last few

00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:20,229
years is right now our documentation

00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:23,150
tells us what every single button does

00:07:20,229 --> 00:07:25,400
but what our readers want to know is how

00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:27,350
to fly a plane okay so it's not gonna

00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,120
matter if they know what every single

00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:32,539
control I mean it's this is kind of a

00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,039
Genki I don't know it looked nice in my

00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:35,360
laptop so I might have to change the

00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:37,130
screenshot to something a little bit

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,660
more modern right but I've run into

00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:43,550
software that looks like this okay so

00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:45,020
you get all sorts but this is exactly

00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:46,970
the strategic thinking that I want why

00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:48,680
should I care what every single button

00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:51,110
does when I just want to know how to fly

00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:53,449
plane so goal oriented documentation is

00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:55,490
the key and then the next thing I want

00:07:53,449 --> 00:07:57,349
to know is who my readers are which is

00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:59,360
the same question as who is using my

00:07:57,349 --> 00:08:01,789
software so as an example I'm going to

00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,050
give the genome help which I love and

00:08:01,789 --> 00:08:04,639
they've been doing this really well for

00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:07,070
years this is where you get to the

00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:09,530
static duct site so if you type in help

00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:11,990
genome org and then you get to their web

00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:13,789
sites they don't know who you are when

00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:15,320
you get to their web site so the first

00:08:13,789 --> 00:08:17,780
question they ask you is who are you

00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:20,750
okay if it worked for the caterpillar it

00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:22,639
can work for these keys so depending on

00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:25,280
what you choose you get entirely

00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:27,620
different sets of documentation okay so

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,510
persona based documentation is something

00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:33,320
that we're really trying to emphasize

00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:34,669
here so you get the information that you

00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,050
need and you don't get the information

00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:37,490
that you don't need so if I'm a

00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:40,219
developer I don't really need to know

00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:42,860
how to use different things on the

00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:45,950
desktop for example and by the way the

00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:47,959
users option is the same screen that you

00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:51,110
get if you click f1 in your genome

00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:54,230
desktop so in the right context it's

00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:56,029
okay to display directly the users

00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:57,589
because I know if I'm clicking at fun in

00:08:56,029 --> 00:08:58,940
my desktop I probably have a question

00:08:57,589 --> 00:09:00,830
about something that I'm using right now

00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:03,710
but if I'm an administrator or a

00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:06,200
developer I don't really care and then

00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:08,240
the next question is what and what in

00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,920
the sense I mean what type of

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,160
information okay

00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:16,430
so depending on who your readers are

00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:18,470
okay and why they are already opening

00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:20,870
the documentation what our goal are they

00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:22,730
trying to achieve it effects the type of

00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:26,470
information that you're going to give

00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:29,570
them so for example if you want to

00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:32,180
showcase different aspects of your tool

00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:35,180
or of your software you can give them

00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:37,670
fancy diagrams or architecture charts or

00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:40,279
if they're already coming into your

00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:41,600
readme for example on github then you

00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:43,399
can assume that they are certain

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,740
personas and then you can give them

00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:47,870
different types of information and for

00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:50,899
the example for that I will go to our

00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:52,880
humble readme some of you already know

00:09:50,899 --> 00:09:56,839
I've heard a great talk hello my name is

00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:58,850
readme by Rafael is very good so one of

00:09:56,839 --> 00:10:00,589
the things I really like this is a

00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:03,440
project that I used to be involved with

00:10:00,589 --> 00:10:06,110
at Red Hat called mini shift and it's a

00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:09,050
localized containerized deployment of

00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:10,730
single note open shift and we had a

00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:13,250
small team and I was really lucky to be

00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:14,810
able to get this project Doc's on the

00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:16,760
ground floor and actually structure it

00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:18,529
properly instead of coming in like a

00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,970
documentation Mary Poppins and just

00:10:18,529 --> 00:10:23,480
trying to clean up your help you clean

00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:25,520
up your house so I use this as examples

00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:27,610
and I will use it until they do

00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:30,440
something to it and I hope they don't

00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:34,220
mmm the reason I'm showing you this

00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:37,640
readme is because it's short okay it's

00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:40,880
short and it acts like a portal to your

00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:44,209
open source project so if I have a

00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:47,029
github readme that's the home page of my

00:10:44,209 --> 00:10:49,250
code repository it's also the home page

00:10:47,029 --> 00:10:52,190
of where I'm most likely to get people

00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:53,720
who wants to contribute or people who

00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:56,930
are slightly more advanced than the

00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:59,690
average user who so if you have a static

00:10:56,930 --> 00:11:01,790
dock site help dot whatever dot org you

00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:04,370
know then that's where you get most of

00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:06,709
the common personas but your github

00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:07,340
readme is a little bit more specialized

00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:09,410
than that

00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:11,810
and I get a lot of questions about Reid

00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:14,570
knees and I say think about the readme

00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:17,360
like the foyer or the entrance to your

00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:20,480
house you do not want to have all of

00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,670
your crap there okay because people can

00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,340
get really disoriented and a lot of

00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:27,560
times projects start small and then they

00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:29,840
have just a few bits and pieces of

00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:31,760
information in the readme and then as it

00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:33,080
gets bigger the readme gets longer and

00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,180
it becomes a dumping ground for

00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:36,860
everything about the project at some

00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:39,470
point you're gonna have to see how many

00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:41,540
times do I scroll to get to the end of

00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:43,100
the readme okay that's a good indication

00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:44,810
because if you do it more than a few

00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,890
times then you probably should split up

00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:47,750
your information

00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:49,820
so this readme has everything it has a

00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:52,190
table of contents it is written in ASCII

00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:54,260
doc but github will render most markup

00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:57,710
languages for you on the fly it has a

00:11:54,260 --> 00:12:00,620
welcome it has which projects we have

00:11:57,710 --> 00:12:04,310
used to fork this as a fork of mini cube

00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:06,320
mini shift mini cube from kubernetes how

00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:09,230
to get started we already have

00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:12,410
documentation some smaller help topics

00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:14,180
on installation and configuration so it

00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:16,850
has links there it has links to the

00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:19,250
documentation and a very important part

00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:21,050
it has the community section okay

00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:23,900
because a lot of times people will get

00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:26,330
to your github readme wanting to

00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:29,090
contribute and this is what's going to

00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:30,350
help them get started okay so a lot of

00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:33,100
times I get questions how do I get

00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:35,390
people from users to contributors

00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:37,780
welcome them show them how it's done

00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:40,070
okay show them how they can get in touch

00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:42,680
mailing lists you know if you have

00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:46,490
contribution guidelines for patches code

00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:49,340
patches and documentation patches so the

00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:52,070
next thing I want to ask is when when do

00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:54,200
I need to know this information let's

00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:57,290
talk about error messages a little bit

00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:59,480
okay and troubleshooting information no

00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:02,000
error messages is next to sorry I just

00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:06,140
retain re-edited a little bit so the

00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:09,610
when means at which point of the usage

00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:13,160
cycle of the software am I going to

00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:14,810
encounter documentation so yeah error

00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,680
messages okay I will talk about them a

00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:18,250
little bit but I'll show an example

00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,420
later so when I see an error message

00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:22,790
something's broken okay

00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:25,640
and I am not in a happy mood when things

00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:28,460
get broken so I need to know how much

00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:31,010
information to deliver to my readers

00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:32,810
when they see an error message a hint

00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:35,330
it's usually a little bit more than you

00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:37,910
think okay most of the time when I edit

00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:40,850
to error messages I need to expand them

00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:43,280
rather than compress them so from my

00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:47,390
experience as a writer working with with

00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:50,360
developers so and it also helps you

00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:53,450
figure out how to optimize the content

00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:56,630
delivery so for the when I want to show

00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:58,340
the arch linux wiki our choosers I can't

00:13:56,630 --> 00:14:00,470
see anything yeah that's about the same

00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:02,810
and that's about similar with and when I

00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:05,090
asked her in the conference's but I love

00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:07,280
this wiki because they they love this

00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:09,920
wiki right and why do they love this

00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:12,710
wiki because of this because it's

00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,390
optimized for impatient frustrated I've

00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:18,080
already tried everything

00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:20,180
users ok it doesn't need to look sexy

00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,950
you know it needs to work all the

00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:23,840
information is in there and you

00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:26,570
basically just search for whatever it is

00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:28,970
that you need to do so by the time I get

00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:30,560
to this piece of documentation I have

00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:33,320
tried everything else and so I don't

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,950
want to waste time on browsing help

00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,990
topics

00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:38,180
I know roughly the keywords and so you

00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:42,050
can optimize your content delivery based

00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:46,220
on that in the last question I want to

00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:48,950
ask is where and where I want to talk

00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:52,370
about error messages again so the where

00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:53,810
and when are connected obviously because

00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:57,140
by the time I get to an error message

00:14:53,810 --> 00:15:00,340
I'm like I said I'm frustrated but how

00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:02,750
much information do I give at each

00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:04,910
platform of delivery so you can have a

00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:06,470
static duck sites you can have a readme

00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:08,540
you can have an error message you can

00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:10,820
have embedded help you can have hover

00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:12,560
text you can have a lot of different

00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:15,230
ways of interacting you can have man

00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:17,330
pages even doc strings in your API which

00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:20,240
would hopefully get generated into some

00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:22,700
kind of API reference there's a lot of

00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,670
automation around that already but how

00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:26,600
much information do you give that where

00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:30,740
so you need to make the information

00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:33,800
accessible and because if you can write

00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:34,190
if you write the greatest documentation

00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,440
set

00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:37,850
ever but I can't find it it doesn't

00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:40,010
exist I'm sorry

00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:42,440
you know so you have to make sure that

00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:44,720
people find this information so as an

00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:47,840
example one of the things that we worked

00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:50,270
on an mini shift was there was a problem

00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:52,730
where if you install too many packages

00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:55,670
on the root filesystem of a mini shift

00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:57,830
vm you can lock up the VM and it'll just

00:15:55,670 --> 00:16:01,360
get too full the problem is we couldn't

00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:03,830
stop the users from doing this okay and

00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,510
unfortunately from our experience a lot

00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:07,520
of times people will try to stretch the

00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:09,770
boundaries of the software you provide

00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:13,190
them unless you actually block them

00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:14,600
right so the proposed draft for this

00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:16,730
error message that you see in the

00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:18,740
terminal was installing additional

00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:22,160
packages is not supported for more

00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:23,540
information see the documentation there

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:26,750
is a problem there are several problems

00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:29,270
with this error message okay one is not

00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:32,090
supported in tech jargon means

00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:35,180
physically blocked cannot technically be

00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:36,890
done which is wrong because the users

00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:39,110
can install whatever they want on the

00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:41,330
root filesystem it's just going to cause

00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:44,510
them problems so first of all that's

00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:47,750
incorrect second is why is this not

00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:51,200
supported what is the problem that this

00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:54,620
is going to create and just sending them

00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:57,110
to a documentation link feels a little

00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:59,600
bit like a cop-out you know it's like

00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:02,300
you can't do this and then go and copy

00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,189
the link and put it in your browser you

00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:07,579
know so we are not giving them enough

00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:08,750
information that they can trust us not

00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:11,750
to do this thing that they're not

00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:13,069
supposed to do okay so why is this

00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:14,900
unsupported and what are the

00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:17,569
alternatives are the questions that we

00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:19,490
should ask and the answers are going to

00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:22,970
affect the error message that we

00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:24,589
eventually came up with was installing

00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:27,589
additional packages on the root

00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:29,330
filesystem might exceed the allocated

00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:31,520
overlay size we can assume that they

00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:33,230
know what overlay size means okay so

00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,090
these are assumptions about our users

00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:36,860
that we are making I did not know what

00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:38,660
overlay size means but as soon as I

00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:41,330
figured it out I was able to say okay so

00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:47,080
that works and it will lock the mini

00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:49,660
shift VM so we have action result

00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:51,400
okay action cause results locking the

00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:53,140
mini shift vm proceed with the

00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,760
installation at your own risk which is

00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:58,960
something that Linux users really like

00:17:54,760 --> 00:18:00,520
to hear it's quite common right so I

00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,650
mean you don't have to be like very

00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:05,710
fluffy and you're in your language so

00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:07,930
this is a relatively casual error

00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:12,060
message and then we give them the link

00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:15,820
in case they still don't believe us okay

00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:17,890
so if they really don't believe us we

00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:20,410
have a help topic in the troubleshooting

00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:23,110
guide that actually describes in many

00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:26,080
more words basically the same thing that

00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:28,540
we said in the error message okay but as

00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:30,160
far as that sorta gives you the mountain

00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:31,630
the SD a and then like if people really

00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,610
want to geek out about why is this

00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:36,730
technically a problem okay

00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:39,310
but for most people this will be enough

00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:42,490
okay and we do give them a link to the

00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:46,000
next thing to more information so where

00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:48,970
do I deliver the the information how

00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,580
much do I give you know why do I need to

00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:53,530
know this who needs to know this what do

00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:55,270
I need to know when do I need to know it

00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:57,940
and where am I going to get this

00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:59,800
information this is basically content

00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:02,590
strategy which kind of you know it could

00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:04,480
sound like a big you know anything with

00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:07,030
the word strategy and it sounds kind of

00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:09,070
big but if you ask these questions it

00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:11,520
could be a matter of a five-minute

00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:14,500
discussion that can help save you hours

00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:16,930
you know of a lot of documents in

00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:25,540
documentation work that you might not

00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:27,760
even need to use anymore okay so let's

00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:29,860
talk about DevOps for docs I can't say

00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:32,440
doc ops because some company copyrighted

00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:34,180
it and it's not even a DevOps thing that

00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:39,360
they did I don't know

00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:42,820
so processes tools and workflows oh my

00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:45,130
the name of the game for us in the tech

00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:47,470
writing field over the last five or 10

00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:49,690
years as definitely being integration

00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:52,600
because we all work together I am

00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:54,850
surrounded by extremely talented and

00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:57,670
very skilled engineers who make

00:19:54,850 --> 00:20:00,460
wonderful DevOps tools for themselves so

00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:02,770
why can't I use them you know why not

00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:04,300
okay so there are some things here that

00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:06,280
if you're active in the Django community

00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:09,160
you will already know but you'll get

00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:11,050
validation right which is also nice so

00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:14,140
things that are being done right I will

00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:17,530
call out and if you find things that you

00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:19,660
are not still doing not yet doing then

00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:23,080
hopefully this will inspire you to do

00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:26,040
something a little bit different so Docs

00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:28,780
is code as an example you have a

00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:31,960
documentation a Doc's folder inside your

00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:34,570
github repo which makes it easier when

00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:36,700
you submit code patches to also submit

00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:38,950
documentation patches if everything is

00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:41,260
stored in the same place I get asked a

00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:44,050
lot whether documentation requires its

00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:49,590
own repository and I hate to say this

00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:52,780
but it depends it depends on how much

00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:55,270
codes are you trying to manage how many

00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:56,650
code repositories do you have because if

00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:58,660
you have something with 12 code

00:20:56,650 --> 00:21:01,090
repositories and then they all get

00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:02,770
integrated into one big platform if

00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:04,450
we're looking at Red Hat OpenStack

00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:06,850
platform for example it's got like

00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:08,950
dozens of upstream components that we

00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:11,440
pull in into a single platform that we

00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:14,200
package together and put in channel

00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:17,110
downstream into our customers okay there

00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:19,090
is no way that I can edit every single

00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:21,580
component in the upstream OpenStack

00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:21,970
repository and get a meaningful set of

00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,410
Doc's

00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:26,950
especially if we remember the

00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:28,630
goal-oriented ducks you know so the all

00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:30,880
the upstream components for example in

00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:34,330
the OpenStack foundation repositories

00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:37,000
are specifically in the components that

00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:39,760
they are relevant for but when we

00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,740
deliver a platform then we need to

00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:45,030
provide end-to-end use case scenarios

00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:47,590
how to deploy real time compute how to

00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:50,020
apply H a proxy and all of these

00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:52,450
different things require a different set

00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:54,880
of documentation so we have our own

00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:57,640
documentation repository for OpenStack

00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:00,430
platform at Red Hat but most of the time

00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:03,100
this will be enough for the smaller open

00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:05,740
source projects and the integration here

00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:08,110
is really really important and you can

00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:11,470
always move it out but it's really hard

00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:13,630
to put it back in so hierarchical source

00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:14,530
content hopefully you have a similar

00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:15,940
thing in your

00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:17,740
where you have some kind of folder

00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:20,679
structure and then things are grouped

00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:23,080
into folders you can do this here we

00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:25,510
have just topics because it's a

00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:27,100
relatively small documentation set but

00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,460
theoretically when your project gets

00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,200
bigger

00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:31,390
instead of having one topic for

00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:34,270
installation you can have a folder ok

00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:37,240
and we try to make it so that the

00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:39,460
content topics the the topic chunks are

00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:41,770
small enough that you can move them

00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:43,960
around and you can reuse them so I

00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:48,400
believe in scroll free as much as

00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:51,610
possible and then you will be able to

00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:54,130
have the source file structure mirroring

00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:57,220
your published documentation set

00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:59,500
hopefully the other thing and this is

00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:02,679
something that Django does write is

00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:05,830
having an integration of doc doc bugs

00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:09,190
into your issue tracking that part is

00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:11,620
done right the issue tracking itself

00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:13,480
might use a bit of work but that has

00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:15,850
nothing to do with the documentation we

00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:19,740
but I mean all issue tracking platforms

00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:22,840
have their upsides and downsides so

00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:24,910
having a documentation component means

00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:27,610
you can flag issues as documentation

00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:29,860
issues and then you can also mark them

00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:31,270
as tasks as bugs you know that's the

00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:33,970
usual thing that you would do for any

00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:36,700
kind of coding task so if you integrate

00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:39,190
this it also helps people feel like you

00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:40,690
know if you have a writer who wants to

00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:41,770
contribute it feels like they're doing

00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:43,660
something a little bit more meaningful

00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:45,490
if you're giving them you know the

00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:49,840
ability to say this is a documentation

00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:52,090
issue at the same level of respect that

00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:55,270
another that a code a technical code

00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:57,700
issue would have so just bringing them

00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:59,370
into the family you know makes them feel

00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:02,950
welcome

00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:04,780
so continuous publication I remember

00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:07,150
when we made Doc's CDs that was a

00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:08,470
nightmare we don't have to do this

00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:10,059
anymore you don't have to do this

00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:11,500
anymore with most of your software right

00:24:10,059 --> 00:24:13,540
I mean I don't know who will be me is

00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:15,480
anybody still writing code for something

00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:21,910
and gets published on a DVD and not also

00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:27,440
online alright isn't it great yeah and

00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:29,480
it's less wasteful so good

00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,610
publication there are lots of really

00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:34,429
easy ways to do this if you're in Python

00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:37,190
you can use Sphinx and read the docs ask

00:24:34,429 --> 00:24:39,019
you doctor and ask you doc for Ruby you

00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:40,879
have McDuck C of get book you have a lot

00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:43,070
of different parsers a lot of them are

00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:44,570
available out of the box you know even

00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:46,730
if you have a small project you can even

00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:48,440
you just check a checkbox and github

00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:50,230
pages will publish your duck set for you

00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:53,570
you know so there's a lot of different

00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:56,960
low effort ways that you can do

00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:59,120
asynchronous publishing you can put

00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,129
stuff into your build sequence you know

00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,570
every time you know you cut a release

00:25:01,129 --> 00:25:04,490
you can also cut the release on the

00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:05,600
documentation you can version you can

00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:08,929
branch could do all kinds of great

00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:11,840
things you also could have like previews

00:25:08,929 --> 00:25:13,850
of your documentation site at right the

00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:18,039
Ducks we use net Lefroy and we have a

00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:18,039
lot of different now you get this again

00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:45,050
okay no that's the other one

00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:47,630
wrong way okay we're still good on time

00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:50,450
so um what did I talk about I talked

00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:53,570
about this yes so testing automation is

00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:57,200
still hard for documentation because

00:25:53,570 --> 00:26:00,050
unlike code prose is harder to compile

00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:02,090
neatly into binaries so a lot of the

00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:04,190
tools out there are more aimed for

00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:06,440
uncovering problems rather than let's

00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:08,420
say fixing them for you and it's a lot

00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:12,230
trickier when you're talking about you

00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:14,960
know linguistic grammar and syntax so I

00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:17,300
would be happy to hear if anybody's

00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:19,040
working on cool things especially there

00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:21,650
are solutions for things like that but

00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:22,940
not so many open source ones okay so I'm

00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:27,500
only talking about open source stuff

00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:29,330
here and so for example I'd literally

00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:32,060
last week found out that one of my good

00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:35,060
friends from KDE project they built a

00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:37,070
tool that aims to do just one job which

00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:39,860
is testing code blocks in markdown files

00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:41,690
okay you can run it locally you can run

00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:44,000
it in you can put it in your build

00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:45,770
sequence and it basically runs code

00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,200
blocks from markdown files in a shelf

00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:50,990
okay so which shell it is depends on

00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:52,460
your system and it just validates that

00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:55,370
whatever you have in your code blocks

00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:56,960
works now I know for restructure texts

00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:59,060
and ask you doc and the more robust

00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,980
markup languages there are tools for

00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:03,230
this there's doc testers you can

00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:05,360
dynamically embed code blocks in your

00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:07,460
topics but a lot of projects still use

00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:09,530
markdown right so this is a quick and

00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:11,030
easy way to do this and people can

00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:14,690
extend it and it's open source and you

00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:17,090
can look at it later the next one is of

00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:19,700
course the trusty Hemingway app which

00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:21,830
will help you if you feed if you copy

00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:23,990
and paste some text into it it can

00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:28,990
highlight some things that are a little

00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:31,430
bit flowery and probably not so concise

00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:33,200
unfortunately it only works it works

00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:35,180
best in smaller chunks of text so you

00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,580
probably don't want to feed a 500 page

00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:39,440
manual into it but this is

00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:41,900
an example of the things that it can do

00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:44,090
right so if you want to get more robust

00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:46,670
this is where things get a little bit

00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:49,430
harder so this is a test automation

00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:53,360
framework for documentation for English

00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:55,550
or translated prose there are open non

00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:57,110
open source solutions for this which I'm

00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:59,600
not going to mention but this is a tool

00:27:57,110 --> 00:28:01,040
that my colleagues at Red Hat content

00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,960
services are working on it's free it's

00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:05,300
open source and it's called amend err

00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:07,790
and you basically feed your style guide

00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:11,270
into it and feed your grammatical

00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:13,670
conventions to it and of course you will

00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:15,680
be faced with the question how much do I

00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:17,690
invest in test automation versus how

00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:19,010
much value I get out of it but that's

00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:21,020
something that you're already dealing

00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:23,330
with these questions when you're coding

00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:29,630
so this is another thing that you can

00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:31,820
consider and the last thing I want to

00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:34,400
talk about before I get to the questions

00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:37,070
part is the community spirit so when I

00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:39,590
joined Red Hat when I moved I'm from

00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:41,960
Israel now I live in Prague and when I

00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:43,700
started traveling around especially

00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:46,700
Python and Django and then write the

00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:48,410
docs I realized that there's a lot of

00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:50,510
things that we can do when we

00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:52,760
collaborate and one of the great things

00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:54,530
about working in open-source is that

00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:57,770
there's a lot of that spirit of

00:28:54,530 --> 00:29:00,920
collaboration and I mean I'm I drank the

00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:02,690
kool-aid I'm all in it and it's really

00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:05,000
really wonderful and I'm happy that I

00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:06,830
get to come here and talk to a lot of

00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,110
people from different roles and there's

00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:11,870
a lot of things that we can do to be

00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:14,330
more welcoming to contributors and to

00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:16,400
more users whether it's from

00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:18,860
documentation or code or whatever it is

00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:20,180
to our project okay so it's not just

00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:22,520
about the code it's not just about

00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:23,180
developers it's about sorry the

00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:28,760
community

00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:29,480
okay so doc sorry didn't happen repeat

00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:32,840
after me

00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:33,260
doc sir I didn't happen let's try this

00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,690
again

00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:42,980
doc sir didn't happen

00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:42,980
thank you very much this is not just yes

00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:52,310
this doesn't work at every conference

00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:54,570
like this community okay

00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:57,060
documentation as a deliverable as a

00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:59,670
requirement doc sir didn't happen is not

00:29:57,060 --> 00:30:01,860
just a funky tagline it means give me

00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:02,940
Doc's or I'm not accepting your patch

00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:04,860
okay

00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:06,450
Chang your project does this Linux

00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:09,000
kernel OpenStack a lot of different

00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:11,450
projects do this and I mean yes you

00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:15,510
should actually enforce this obviously

00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:17,730
but having it documented on your

00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:19,260
contribution guidelines is a good start

00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:21,810
because you're saying this is an

00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:24,270
official thing this is a policy okay you

00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:27,900
make documentation contributions into

00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:30,210
your code contribution policies okay

00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:32,400
step number one and now that you've made

00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:34,500
it into your policy how are you how are

00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:37,320
you going to help people learn how to

00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:40,320
contribute so you write contribution

00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:42,660
guidelines okay and and give them help

00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:44,910
who will doc the docs you know so how to

00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:46,500
doc the docs this is something we did

00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:49,050
for Nick so as a few years ago there's a

00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:50,790
lot of different projects who have this

00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:55,410
kind of thing and I will talk about this

00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:57,060
in a second and so of course you want to

00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:58,710
give them also templates right code

00:30:57,060 --> 00:31:01,770
templates you know a lot of people copy

00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:03,780
and paste things and why not have this

00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:06,600
for your documentation as well this is a

00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:08,400
relatively this is on the right the docs

00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,530
websites and I'm pretty sure we've

00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:14,160
gotten the most hits is on this page

00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:16,080
okay the readme template and so whether

00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:17,670
you're just doing a small readme or

00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:20,700
whether you're doing a much bigger doc

00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:23,760
set then templates are great there are

00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:26,910
many out there one of the latest things

00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:28,290
that I've come across is something we're

00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:30,540
doing a Tran hat which is called the

00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:32,040
modular docs project so if you're

00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:34,170
looking at I mean this is a very small

00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:38,910
readme it's very cute but if you want to

00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:41,130
do a documentation plan okay or if you

00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:43,470
uh naturally build a strategy for

00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:45,720
something that will scale okay it's

00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:49,050
worth checking out this project because

00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:51,630
it gives you we have a reference guide

00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:53,850
where you can read all about we know

00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:55,830
what is modular documentation and when I

00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:59,250
say modular documentation I mean small

00:31:55,830 --> 00:32:01,110
content chunks that are reusable movable

00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:04,860
and you can assemble them in different

00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:06,480
ways the terminology is actually not the

00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:08,010
most critical part here you can call the

00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,690
modules you can call them topics it

00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:11,640
doesn't matter the point is this is a

00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:14,040
free and open source project that we

00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:16,410
encourage communities to use okay and

00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:19,500
you can understand things like you know

00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:22,740
and this is based on the topic based

00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:25,170
architecture which breaks down topics

00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:26,670
into concept tasks reference which is

00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:28,650
fairly standard in the tech writing

00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:30,630
world but what I like about this is we

00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:34,410
have templates okay so there are

00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:37,260
templates here for any kind of for the

00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:40,650
most part the most common documentation

00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:44,610
types that you will need and if you this

00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:47,400
is a just a raw output of the procedure

00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:49,380
template so this is a module and it

00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:51,630
tells you you know it gives you

00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:53,820
suggestions for naming conventions and

00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:55,950
it also gives you things like you know

00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:58,170
start each step with an active verb and

00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:59,730
all sorts of things like that include

00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:03,390
one command so it gives you best

00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:05,250
practices on how to write a task topic

00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:06,960
and I know something people still

00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:08,880
struggle with this because it's not a

00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,830
lot of engineers a lot of people who are

00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:13,410
not writers you know just like people

00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:15,690
have developed a skill set in writing

00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:17,430
code you know I have developed the skill

00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:19,290
set in writing Docs you know and it's

00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:21,420
not something you know a lot of people

00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:24,030
ask me you know how do I write

00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:25,650
documentation if I'm not gonna change

00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:27,150
careers now and you don't have to do

00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:29,310
this because we put out some best

00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:32,190
practices thankfully and some templates

00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:34,200
so these resources are available and

00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:37,230
then the last thing I want to talk about

00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:39,900
before I get into the questions is like

00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:42,150
I said we are surrounded by humans we

00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:46,770
work with humans whether it's remotely

00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:48,990
or in person and the personal

00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:51,150
connections and the social aspect of

00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:54,870
working in open-source community is much

00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:58,500
more felt when you're talking about

00:33:54,870 --> 00:34:01,170
documentation because it's all about

00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:02,490
communication right so I want to talk

00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:03,780
about write the docs

00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:06,360
because it's one of the happiest

00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:08,850
communities that I have been very

00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:10,679
fortunate to be a part of we have this

00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:11,940
year we have five conferences we've been

00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:14,610
around for six years

00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:16,830
I joined five years ago we have

00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:19,409
conferences in Portland and in Prague

00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:21,179
those are our main conferences and we

00:34:19,409 --> 00:34:23,340
have new conferences well Australia is

00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:25,440
in the third year already we have

00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:28,169
Cincinnati last year collaboration with

00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:31,980
open help and we have a new one this

00:34:28,169 --> 00:34:35,010
year in Vilnius in June and this is the

00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:37,290
place where you go and learn about you

00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:39,690
know way more things than I talked about

00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:42,480
today like this this presentation is

00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:43,800
kind of a hopefully to inspire to think

00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,710
a little bit differently but also to

00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:49,740
tease you to want to learn more about

00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:52,889
this okay about the documentation world

00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:55,830
about content about collaboration okay

00:34:52,889 --> 00:35:00,240
about communication so this is my home

00:34:55,830 --> 00:35:03,600
and I'm really happy to be there and the

00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:05,280
other thing that I do is I come to these

00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:07,710
conferences I've done this in the past

00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:10,590
at Django under the hood and I've been

00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:12,119
running documentation sprints so you

00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:14,700
know next time you go to any kind of

00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:17,760
Python Django or any kind of open source

00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:21,030
event you know know that writers walk

00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:24,210
among you and we are here and we might

00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:29,490
not be the majority at these events but

00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:31,920
we do try to get to a wider range of of

00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:33,390
open source and technical events to be

00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,850
able to collaborate so I'm not just

00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:38,430
inviting you to come to my home at write

00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:41,580
the docs I'm also telling you that we

00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:43,500
are among you and it's probably good if

00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:47,340
you're next to us because we might write

00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:49,410
some ducks for you I do want to give a

00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:52,109
shout out for a season of ducks if you

00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:53,940
know Summer of Code then it's like this

00:35:52,109 --> 00:35:56,390
but for ducks and they're doing it this

00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:58,950
year for the first time the application

00:35:56,390 --> 00:36:01,560
period is open now and open source

00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:04,350
projects can apply and then you can get

00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:05,850
writers for free to do things for you

00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:07,440
and you get paid and the writers can get

00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:10,050
paid and it's like a mentorship and it's

00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:12,180
and they can you can help you can get

00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:14,530
help for open source projects that you

00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:17,380
would not have otherwise gotten

00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:20,230
in the documentation area so google

00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:25,120
google season of ducks is a cool thing

00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:26,800
that they're doing now okay we're good

00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:30,880
all right so i have 10 more minutes i

00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:33,550
want to start with a few questions that

00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:36,820
I got in advance okay

00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:38,740
I've been tweeting like hell in the last

00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:40,540
couple weeks asking for some questions

00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:42,880
and I have crowd

00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:45,580
I have crowd-sourced anonymized and non

00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:48,160
weaponized questions I do not accept

00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:50,470
weaponized questions we may not have

00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:52,480
time for the microphone stuff okay but

00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:56,500
the online things could happen hopefully

00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:57,970
they are non weaponized as well I mean

00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:59,200
if you ask me a weaponized question you

00:36:57,970 --> 00:37:02,200
better be prepared to deal with the

00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:06,310
answer this is why I don't take

00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:09,070
questions okay so the first question is

00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:11,890
about in it has to do with grammar

00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:14,170
syntax and linguistics and the question

00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:16,090
was do you see benefits in using or

00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:17,620
avoiding pronouns and Docs and then

00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:19,840
later we've kind of elaborated or

00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:22,390
clarified that it's also a matter of of

00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:25,030
gerunds and infinitives property X

00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:27,130
allows you to do y versus property X

00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:29,770
allows for doing Y and do you have any

00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:31,030
recommendations on when which version

00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:33,280
makes more sense or it's more

00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:35,470
appropriate so there's a lot of few

00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:37,240
examples that we were iterating on on

00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:39,280
Twitter until I understood what the

00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:42,910
question was but the answer to all of

00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:45,610
that is minimalism okay which means use

00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:47,860
fewer words and one of the things one of

00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:49,600
the first things that I was taught when

00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:52,180
I became a technical writer is you have

00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:54,190
to keep it really really simple okay

00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:58,750
and even more simple than you think and

00:37:54,190 --> 00:38:02,050
and not as in the topics that we write

00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:04,210
about are so complicated sometimes that

00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:08,470
the language has to be extremely simple

00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:10,420
so these are things that for example so

00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:13,300
if we're looking at the examples that

00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:15,400
the question was listing so property x

00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:19,600
allows you to do Y property X allows for

00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:22,090
doing Y with X one can do Y with X doing

00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:27,820
Y as possible with X it's possible to do

00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:28,280
y you do Y with X okay or you do X with

00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:31,990
y

00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:36,560
because the X comes first so why am i

00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:39,800
flipping all of this into you do X with

00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:42,140
Y this is a minimalistic approach okay

00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:43,760
and even if before it was called

00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:49,210
minimalism and you can google minimalism

00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:52,760
right so you second voice I have notes

00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:55,400
second voice you in the relevant context

00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:59,390
okay so you are addressing the user or

00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:02,060
the reader directly okay this is what we

00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:03,500
try to do as persona based documentation

00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:05,150
so you're not saying you know

00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:06,950
administrators can do that and we want

00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:09,580
to make sure that we are addressing the

00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:12,860
user directly as much as possible okay

00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:16,220
and then the second reasoning for this

00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:17,720
is that things cannot allow humans to do

00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:20,600
things it's the same way

00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:22,490
it's an anthropomorphism I think I'm

00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:24,860
pronouncing it right it's a really long

00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:27,320
word but it's basically giving human

00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:30,230
attributes to inanimate objects and I

00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:33,140
see this happen a lot the other so

00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:35,810
things like a software or a tool cannot

00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:38,810
allow you to do something you use the

00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:41,290
tool to do something okay so we flipped

00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:44,960
the way we think about it and it's

00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:48,740
action based goal based user based the

00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:50,480
other side tangents have very few side

00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:53,380
tangents in this presentation I'm quite

00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:54,560
proud of myself things cannot have

00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:59,300
things

00:39:54,560 --> 00:40:02,440
okay this tool cannot have attributes it

00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:05,960
includes it can describe it does things

00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:08,840
software cannot own possessions also

00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:10,520
have is a really dangerous word anyway

00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:12,500
active voice indicates the goal first

00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:14,210
and the method second so if we're

00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:16,730
looking at goal-oriented wording and

00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:21,560
then gerunds which is anything ends with

00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:23,420
ing doing streaming browsing writing are

00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:27,670
grammatically ambiguous and hard to

00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:29,990
translate sometimes so if you have

00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:31,910
probably sometimes if it's in the middle

00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:35,840
of the sentence it could have different

00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:40,160
ways to slice the sentence but generally

00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:41,370
using jaren's is best avoided in regular

00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:43,470
sentences

00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:46,530
so unless you have a title for example

00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:48,660
that says installing this tool okay a

00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:50,750
gerund is fine because it indicates a

00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:53,250
continuous action and it's not ambiguous

00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:56,550
okay so you have to use gerunds very

00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:58,790
carefully so that was the linguistic

00:40:56,550 --> 00:41:01,110
question that I got the neck the second

00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:04,470
theme I got a few questions that are

00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:07,710
actually related and I'm going to have

00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:09,630
there's a lot of text here so I got a

00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:11,520
project I know I need ducks I can write

00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:12,750
but I know it's not my strength what do

00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:14,070
I need to do to make it easier for

00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:14,580
someone who does of those skills to

00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:16,410
contribute

00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:18,840
I went starting a project from scratch

00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:20,760
how does one figure out how to structure

00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:23,730
the documentation and what are the first

00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:25,230
end things one should take care of it's

00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:26,970
very hard for someone to write

00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:29,010
documentation for a project if they

00:41:26,970 --> 00:41:30,660
don't know how the project works how do

00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:32,910
you best facilitate that knowledge

00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:35,820
transfer other than of course writing

00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:38,340
Docs how do you bootstrap the process I

00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:41,510
don't know what I don't know so how can

00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:45,330
I possibly know what you don't know

00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:48,750
that's a really good question and I I

00:41:45,330 --> 00:41:51,990
have to say not everybody it has enough

00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:53,850
awareness to even ask this question okay

00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:55,920
so I thank you for all these questions

00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:58,250
and they are all related because the

00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:59,550
answer is you have to talk to people

00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:08,460
sorry

00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:10,410
you know I talk to people all day this

00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:12,210
is my job I understand that it's not

00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:15,240
everyone's job to talk to people all day

00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:17,430
but this is something that would be the

00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:20,040
easiest it the easiest way to solve

00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:22,350
things would be to talk to people so if

00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:23,760
I take the first question you know how

00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:25,800
do I get people who might have

00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:28,460
documentation skills to contribute to

00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:31,140
the project so here's a few tips okay

00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:34,260
find people with writing experience as

00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:37,140
in you know I said we walk amongst you

00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:39,300
or you can do some calls to action you

00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:41,880
find people with writing experience or

00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:45,450
who are interested in it ask them to

00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:47,400
test your software okay and then figure

00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:50,220
out what kind of workflow they're using

00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:52,250
ask them to give you feedback and then

00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:55,170
he'll and then help you build

00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:58,020
contribution guidelines okay

00:42:55,170 --> 00:43:00,300
another thing that I think is great KDE

00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:01,890
project does this and I don't know how

00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:03,930
many other projects are doing it I just

00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:07,350
recently learned about it is that if you

00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:10,440
have easy pickings or junior jobs flag

00:43:07,350 --> 00:43:13,320
in your issue tracker they attach a

00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:15,180
mentorship to this so it's not enough to

00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:16,860
say that something is easy right because

00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:19,410
easy is a subjective thing

00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:20,880
please remember this what's easy for you

00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:24,120
might not be for someone else especially

00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:26,220
if they're new so attaching a mentorship

00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:31,020
to the easy pickings

00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:34,170
issues can help bring people in to your

00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:35,610
project so it could help yeah it can

00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:36,930
bring in new contributors who can fix

00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:39,690
your Docs but might not necessarily have

00:43:36,930 --> 00:43:41,850
programming experience Oh or even have

00:43:39,690 --> 00:43:42,660
experience with your project you know my

00:43:41,850 --> 00:43:45,000
own my favorites

00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:47,370
well my least favorites admission is

00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:52,890
self documented code is code that you

00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:54,600
wrote recently so I mean even if our Red

00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:56,190
Hat's most of our users are developers

00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:58,200
but they didn't write the stuff that

00:43:56,190 --> 00:44:00,390
they're using you know this is another

00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:01,590
perspective that you can put in and the

00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:04,560
other thing is you can do is you can

00:44:01,590 --> 00:44:07,170
facilitate skill sharing sprints so for

00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:10,170
example if you invite writers to your

00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:12,900
developer sprint and then you do some

00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:15,570
kind of pair hacking or you know some

00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:17,130
kind of collaborations where let's say

00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:18,960
if I'm a writer I can learn more about

00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:20,670
your project and then I can help you

00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,170
contribute I did this for PI B I did

00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:24,960
this work with a lot of different

00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:26,220
projects and then I think it was it was

00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,930
quite well because then you can take

00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:30,450
what you learn and you can implement it

00:44:27,930 --> 00:44:33,660
later so the second question for that

00:44:30,450 --> 00:44:36,120
was when how to structure the

00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:38,280
documentation okay so there's a couple

00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:39,510
of things you can do first of all I

00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:42,300
already talked about things like

00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:44,820
templates and the modular Docs project

00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:48,200
and figure out how to store your content

00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:51,540
to scale but you got to ask

00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:53,190
quote-unquote potential users how their

00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:54,360
workflow how do they actually use your

00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:58,410
tool okay

00:44:54,360 --> 00:45:00,180
and then from that common set of tasks

00:44:58,410 --> 00:45:03,570
that people want to achieve with your

00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:05,400
tool this is you can port that back to

00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:07,590
your documentation so in a similar way

00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:08,700
that in bigger Enterprise projects we

00:45:07,590 --> 00:45:11,609
collaborate with the

00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:13,770
testing teams so they build test plans

00:45:11,609 --> 00:45:16,250
and then we use we leverage that to make

00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:18,329
documentation so it's a similar thing

00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:20,000
whatever you're testing in more than

00:45:18,329 --> 00:45:22,589
unit tests oh man talking end-to-end

00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,240
testing and then you can also research

00:45:22,589 --> 00:45:28,349
best practices and templates there are

00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:29,760
more resources out there for that and

00:45:28,349 --> 00:45:31,290
then these last two questions are

00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:33,359
basically the same I love this I don't

00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:35,369
know what I don't know so how can I

00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:38,640
possibly know what you don't know and

00:45:35,369 --> 00:45:40,260
that is a great question and accepting

00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:42,950
that you have a problem is the first

00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:47,510
step in solving that problem so just by

00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:50,309
admitting okay an understanding that

00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:52,290
different people have different starting

00:45:50,309 --> 00:45:54,240
points in their knowledge and just

00:45:52,290 --> 00:45:56,099
because they don't know what you already

00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:58,290
know that doesn't mean they don't know

00:45:56,099 --> 00:46:02,160
anything okay so they might know

00:45:58,290 --> 00:46:05,660
different things so reach out to your

00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:08,819
peers make yourself available for

00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:10,859
training and for mentorship and be kind

00:46:08,819 --> 00:46:15,569
to the people who want to contribute

00:46:10,859 --> 00:46:18,359
because welcoming projects get more

00:46:15,569 --> 00:46:19,680
contributors okay and that is something

00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:22,650
that I've seen in a lot of different

00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:24,859
places and this is part of why I'm still

00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:27,630
involved in Django and Python

00:46:24,859 --> 00:46:30,089
communities because you have been

00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:32,520
extremely welcoming to me even though I

00:46:30,089 --> 00:46:35,460
do not write code at all

00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:37,160
okay and you've you've embraced the

00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:40,230
different skill sets that are needed to

00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:42,599
create better software in an open-source

00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:44,700
way and this is why I'm still here so if

00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:50,640
you want to be bringing more people into

00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:52,280
your projects be nice to them so and

00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:55,470
then the last thing I want to say is

00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:58,049
most or a good percentage of technical

00:46:55,470 --> 00:47:00,809
writers or documentation oriented people

00:46:58,049 --> 00:47:02,460
such as myself and many peers that I

00:47:00,809 --> 00:47:05,760
have who are extremely talented writers

00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:08,490
we do not have a deeper understanding of

00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:10,200
how your code is written okay but the

00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:12,510
strategic communication and the ability

00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:14,730
to see things on the bigger picture can

00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:16,410
help your project so you should respect

00:47:14,730 --> 00:47:19,230
that and you should embrace that in a

00:47:16,410 --> 00:47:20,700
collaborative way and we have I think

00:47:19,230 --> 00:47:21,359
maybe a few more minutes from more

00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:23,640
questions

00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:27,140
what's happening on slack all the time

00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:29,670
is up ah wait can we take like where is

00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:31,529
Rafael okay do we have like a non

00:47:29,670 --> 00:47:33,509
weaponized question from slack and that

00:47:31,529 --> 00:47:35,549
so I will just say that if people ask

00:47:33,509 --> 00:47:37,859
questions on slack I will read it later

00:47:35,549 --> 00:47:39,359
and I will answer them personally later

00:47:37,859 --> 00:47:41,069
so if we don't get to it now I will

00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:44,309
answer it there's a question about

00:47:41,069 --> 00:47:45,869
having not much time and if you have a

00:47:44,309 --> 00:47:47,789
software project that doesn't have any

00:47:45,869 --> 00:47:49,079
Doc's and you have little time where do

00:47:47,789 --> 00:47:51,720
you start what's the single most

00:47:49,079 --> 00:47:53,450
important thing T to document or to

00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:57,509
write read me

00:47:53,450 --> 00:47:59,400
easy read me you can base it on the

00:47:57,509 --> 00:48:01,859
template from write the docs or

00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:03,269
something like that and you have just

00:48:01,859 --> 00:48:05,369
enough information it could be a

00:48:03,269 --> 00:48:07,950
paragraph okay it could take you like a

00:48:05,369 --> 00:48:10,529
couple hours just to understand what the

00:48:07,950 --> 00:48:13,079
basics of the project is just start with

00:48:10,529 --> 00:48:14,730
the readme okay I think the other

00:48:13,079 --> 00:48:16,440
questions are best left to be answered

00:48:14,730 --> 00:48:19,830
honestly yeah probably

00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:24,619
probably okay let's write some dogs

00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:24,619
