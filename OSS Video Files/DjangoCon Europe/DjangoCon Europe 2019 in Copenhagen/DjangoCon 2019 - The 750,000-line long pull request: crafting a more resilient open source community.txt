hello everyone so my name is Anne Olivia

00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:12,840
and I'm on Twitter if you wanna check

00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:15,660
that out but other than finding very

00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:20,939
catchy titles for talks I'm also a

00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:24,930
Python developer and I i co host the PI

00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:27,240
ladies meetup in Paris and I've been

00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:29,699
working on open source projects as a

00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:35,280
full-time job now for the last two years

00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:37,920
and something that has been in the back

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,870
of my mind for those two years is to see

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,290
the relationship between tech and

00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:45,239
community and I realized that more and

00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:48,210
more I don't want to separate soft

00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:52,920
skills from like other skills that would

00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:55,559
be not soft iron but basically this idea

00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,109
that they're completely separate things

00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:00,809
is bothering me more and more and I

00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:03,300
wanted to talk to you today about a case

00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:08,119
where the fact that we worked on the

00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:11,850
community helped us to deal with a big

00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:13,619
technological challenge so what's going

00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:15,810
on first I'm gonna talk to you about

00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:17,689
this project called open fisca because I

00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:22,470
need to tell you about a bit about the

00:01:17,689 --> 00:01:26,400
context around the 750,000 line pull

00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:29,220
request and then I'm gonna talk about

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,869
building bridges which is one of the two

00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,880
things you can do with social capital

00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:35,280
one is building bridges and the other

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,340
one is doing some bonding and we're

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,049
gonna see when you can use one and the

00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,960
other to deal with technological

00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:44,549
challenges and finally we'll have some

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:49,500
closing words and I'll take some

00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:52,520
questions okay so what is open fisca

00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:55,320
open fisca is an international and

00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:58,170
contributed open source project the

00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:01,829
github is open fisca and the idea is to

00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:06,390
turn law into code so the idea is that

00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:11,009
you take any fiscal or benefit law text

00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:13,500
of law and you turn it into Python so

00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:16,970
as one of my friend said it's like the

00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,970
Sims but for real life

00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:23,280
so this is an example for countries

00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:25,530
starting out we have something called

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,590
the country template and it's basically

00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:30,630
when you do a Django admin and then

00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:33,690
start project and it just creates the

00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:35,730
whole architecture of your project this

00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:38,580
is what you do when you want to use open

00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:41,549
fisca you use our country template and

00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:43,769
we have some very simple equations I

00:02:41,549 --> 00:02:46,290
don't know if you know but fiscal law is

00:02:43,769 --> 00:02:48,690
complicated so I'm just going to take

00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:50,790
that very simple example but basically

00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:53,190
what it does here it says that if you

00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:55,560
want to have the income tax of someone

00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:57,780
then you take the person's salary and

00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,860
you multiply it by something called an

00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:07,319
income tax rate and that would give you

00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:08,849
their tax their personal taxes so what

00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:11,010
do we do with that because it's very

00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:13,110
nice to have Python equations we all

00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:16,560
like them but what do we do with that

00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:19,350
two things two projects right now mostly

00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,950
in France but in other countries as well

00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:24,900
Lexx impact which is a tool for

00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:28,109
Parliament so that they can know what

00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:31,350
affects changes in the tax law will have

00:03:28,109 --> 00:03:34,290
uncertain types of household and the

00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:35,670
other one is method and there is a

00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:39,000
French version and there is a version

00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:40,920
for the city of Barcelona now and the

00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,500
idea is that you input all your

00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:45,450
situation how many kids you have how

00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:48,900
much you earn and all that information

00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:51,329
and then it tells you which benefits you

00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:53,489
can apply to so instead of going around

00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:55,829
and having to apply to one after the

00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:58,109
other after the other you just do one

00:03:55,829 --> 00:04:02,250
time this one simulation and it tells

00:03:58,109 --> 00:04:05,849
you everything you can apply for so how

00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:09,030
does it work so open-face guys like a

00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:11,489
game console pretty much you have one

00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:14,370
big engine that we call open fisca core

00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:16,680
and then you have several cartridges

00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:18,479
that are the country packages so you

00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,549
have one engine and then you can have

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:22,919
the tunisian cartridge or the french

00:04:20,549 --> 00:04:26,189
cartridge or the one for new zealand

00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:28,319
and you also have local cartridges such

00:04:26,189 --> 00:04:32,400
as the city of Barcelona or the help

00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:34,020
from the city of Paris and to do that so

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,710
we have the core and the core is

00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:39,419
vectorial computing which is basically

00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:41,819
you can run simulation on millions of

00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:44,449
households at a time which is great for

00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:48,689
researchers who use open fisca on

00:04:44,449 --> 00:04:52,740
anonymized databases of all the French

00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:55,740
tax system and they can do that because

00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:58,199
its vectorial computing so we have two

00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:01,590
types of experts in that community one

00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:03,659
is tech experts who do the engine mostly

00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:08,069
and the other one is economics expert

00:05:03,659 --> 00:05:10,610
who understand the law so the more tech

00:05:08,069 --> 00:05:13,860
experts you have the better open source

00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:16,229
project because you will have a code

00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:18,569
that is reusable because you will have

00:05:16,229 --> 00:05:20,839
tools to have new contributors come in

00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:24,960
because you will have like complete

00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:27,379
documentation and if you have more econ

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,379
expert

00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,810
you

00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:42,020
your systems will be so you have new use

00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:44,180
cases and you can use all that code to

00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:50,030
do more simulators and to create more

00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:53,120
value for citizens but in all

00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:56,080
open-source community you have the issue

00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:59,480
of sometimes interpersonal conflicts and

00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:02,990
when there is no social capital left

00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:07,070
while sometimes these people fork a note

00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:08,600
about forking what is it the idea of for

00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:12,650
Kings that you have a community that has

00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:14,510
a product and it's certainly a part of

00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:17,570
it the community wants to change and the

00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:20,330
other doesn't and so they just decide to

00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:22,460
move away the problem with forking is

00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:25,130
that usually after a while you cannot

00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:28,550
really reconcile the two projects

00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:31,220
anymore so it's a big loss for a project

00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:33,110
when someone leaves because it's with

00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:35,540
time as time passes it's harder and

00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:38,060
harder for those contributors to come

00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:40,430
back I know when I arrived on the

00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:45,710
project one of the contributors had just

00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:48,800
left and so we wanted to prevent this so

00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:50,900
we worked a lot on I mean as well as

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,940
working on the engine and working on

00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:56,720
making the documentation better and

00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:59,450
working on creating new content we

00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:02,000
actually worked on this social capital

00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:03,920
which it's like having a newsletter that

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,200
asked you not a lot of work I know how

00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:08,480
many of you started a newsletter and it

00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:10,580
kind of disappeared after a while it

00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:12,530
happened to me a lot like it always

00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:15,650
seems like a good idea but after what

00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:18,320
the what you need to you need to keep on

00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:20,450
doing it so we find a way to have a

00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:23,150
newsletter every two weeks and what we

00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:26,450
did said we just to the name of the PRS

00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:29,450
we emerged and we just list them and

00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:33,830
it's good enough it's good enough to

00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:35,600
have a way to talk to your audience to

00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:38,960
show them that things are moving along

00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:40,400
and to show their work because as they

00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,470
receive the newsletter they tell you

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,050
about their news and you could put it in

00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:47,870
the newsletter we started having monthly

00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:49,550
after work events and co-working

00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:51,980
sessions where new contributors will

00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:54,290
come to our offices and can get

00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:56,420
bootstrap and ask questions in real life

00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:58,850
and for people who are not used to work

00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:00,530
in open source being able to talk to

00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:04,100
someone instead of writing down an issue

00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:06,350
can be something very useful and finally

00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:08,480
we started having roadmapping workshops

00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:10,940
where everybody in the community could

00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:13,550
come in and we could agree together

00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:17,030
where that core component should go

00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:22,580
toward what it should go towards to go

00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:25,130
towards and so this is where we were we

00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:31,480
were working on knowing more about our

00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:31,480
contributors and suddenly this happened

00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:39,590
one fine morning so this is the error

00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:42,800
message github it gives you when you

00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:45,790
have more than 3000 change files so I

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,790
never saw it before

00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:51,770
and the first thing to do is not panic

00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:55,670
because things are not as dire as they

00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:58,400
seem we panicked a little bit at first

00:08:55,670 --> 00:09:01,460
but then we realized we know this person

00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:03,590
we've had you know coffee with them and

00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:06,620
we've worked with them on other projects

00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:10,730
so we just gave them a call and try to

00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:12,470
understand their context and that's one

00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:14,420
of the first thing you need to do when

00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:16,190
you work on that social capital inside

00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:18,470
your open-source project is to

00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:20,720
understand that your context as a

00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:23,150
developer might not be the context of

00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:26,380
other people who have other kind of work

00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:29,240
environment other experiences and other

00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:32,150
way of working and especially in the

00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:34,340
economics world for example one of the

00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:37,910
things that we discovered is that their

00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:39,620
habit was to finish a project until the

00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:43,910
end before they would show it to the

00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:45,830
world so the idea was this person she

00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:50,570
worked for three months and she updated

00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:52,970
the whole French tax system so this PR

00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:55,190
would like update everything tax wise on

00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:57,890
open fiscal France which is a huge deal

00:09:55,190 --> 00:10:01,450
for us and she just waited until

00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:04,930
everything was perfect to open the PR

00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:07,450
which is a good intention so we are

00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:11,680
noise it with her and we discovered that

00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:14,620
she actually wrote a script to to

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,940
generate automatically tests which was

00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:17,770
great I mean she understood that tests

00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:21,400
were really important but they were

00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:23,710
randomly automatically generated so once

00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:26,650
we took that out we went from seven

00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:29,560
hundred and fifty two thousand lines to

00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:32,170
a mere two hundred and fifteen so that

00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:36,430
was a big you know improvement on the

00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:39,520
work we had to do now but so it's a it's

00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:42,730
a it's a large amount of lines to read

00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:45,340
so with my colleagues there were three

00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:47,530
different strategies one was just push

00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:51,480
the merge button and let's go to lunch

00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:54,580
strategy we'll deal with it later

00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:57,400
another one was just rejected just close

00:10:54,580 --> 00:11:00,580
that PR saying no and but that would

00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:04,090
mean maybe our contributors who do such

00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:07,270
great work would just fork and maybe not

00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:10,180
come back and the other one was to find

00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:12,370
a compromise and that's the option we

00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:14,860
chose because we thought this is just

00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:17,380
too much work she'd worked for three

00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:21,010
months if we closed it now if we say no

00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:24,090
now like in human terms it's an it's not

00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:27,970
something you come back from very easily

00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:30,400
so we met we met for half a day and we

00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:32,230
talked we talked about their context we

00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,970
talked about what they could give in and

00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:37,330
why we could give in so that we could

00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:40,780
move forward together so in the end we

00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:42,760
agreed on 15 smaller PRS that would

00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:46,210
amount to the two hundred thousand lines

00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:48,430
of code we agreed on review guidelines

00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:53,020
which part of the PAP eight we would

00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:57,040
apply which part of the of testing we

00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:58,900
would apply and especially the point

00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:02,410
that was the most important is that they

00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:04,840
needed the tools to succeed because

00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:07,630
telling someone just you know just do

00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:09,630
just do just cherry-pick and then a

00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:12,400
rebase and I'll come back in a few days

00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:14,710
this doesn't fly you need to be with

00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,920
people and you need to hold their hands

00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:16,990
out

00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:19,600
first so that they know how to do this

00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:22,630
and then they can teach others how to do

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:26,050
this a quick point what is greed

00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:29,910
freebase get rebase allows you to take a

00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:33,570
branch from your project and then

00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:36,010
actually base it on another comet and

00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:38,290
cherry picking it allows you to take a

00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:43,149
comment from a branch and put it on

00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:46,149
another branch which is quite useful but

00:12:43,149 --> 00:12:49,740
those are technical tools the real thing

00:12:46,149 --> 00:12:52,510
that we developed is social capital

00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:55,660
because by create by doing those fifteen

00:12:52,510 --> 00:13:00,699
it took us two months sixty-five days to

00:12:55,660 --> 00:13:03,310
merge those 215 lines of code and by

00:13:00,699 --> 00:13:06,519
doing this we created social capital we

00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:09,279
created trust in our project so what is

00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:11,260
social capital social capital has many

00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:13,510
ways of being defined it's quite elusive

00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:16,060
so I'm gonna define as it has the

00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:19,990
quality and momentum of relationship

00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:23,220
within a community and there are ways

00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:27,910
you can create that momentum in that

00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:29,740
positive quality in your project and the

00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:32,890
first thing we want to do is put energy

00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:36,070
and enthusiasm in what you do but also

00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:38,649
what others do in your community not

00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:39,760
only should you should I mean if you

00:13:38,649 --> 00:13:42,130
want to create that social capital

00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,709
something that is great is organizing

00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:48,730
things organising conference organizing

00:13:44,709 --> 00:13:51,430
events around what you do is cooperation

00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:54,339
make it easier for people to work with

00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:57,490
you and find things that are kind of

00:13:54,339 --> 00:13:59,649
hard let's say a documentation that is

00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:02,949
not you know quite right it might be

00:13:59,649 --> 00:14:04,329
doing our country template was something

00:14:02,949 --> 00:14:08,050
that helped a lot of new contributors

00:14:04,329 --> 00:14:11,230
work with us and finally work on trust

00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:14,230
and reciprocity having guidelines that

00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:17,589
you never budge on will not create that

00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:21,310
trust trust means taking some risks and

00:14:17,589 --> 00:14:22,779
people can then take risks with you so

00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:26,680
it's important to find those

00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:27,660
opportunities to build trust so once you

00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:30,660
have capital

00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:33,750
what do you do with it there are two

00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:35,130
things you can do with it and I think I

00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:36,990
mean there are many things you can do

00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:39,030
with it but two of the main thing is are

00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:41,520
called bridging which means that you're

00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:43,800
gonna create external ties for example

00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:45,810
for us we use our social capital to

00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:49,320
bridge the gap between our developers

00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:50,940
culture and the economics culture but

00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,880
the other thing you can do is called

00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:55,080
bonding which means like stretch

00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:59,100
strengthening the ties within your

00:14:55,080 --> 00:15:02,190
community and I have another example of

00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:05,190
a open source community who use social

00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:08,670
capital to do something great but more

00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:11,310
into the bonding than bridging I don't

00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:14,190
know if you heard of OpenStreetMap but

00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:18,990
it's a contributed open-source project

00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:22,200
and they had this project of delimiting

00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:25,530
city limits in France they are 30 more

00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:28,980
than 36 thousand cities in France it

00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:30,720
took them six years to do it so it's an

00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:34,590
open source project doing a six year

00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:37,920
long technical challenge and from their

00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:40,260
own account having some community

00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:43,260
meetings having their yearly conference

00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:47,880
was one of the determining factors in

00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:52,050
their success so finally what does it

00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:55,530
mean for open source well we often think

00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:58,140
about community work as strengthening

00:15:55,530 --> 00:16:00,810
the bonds between us and I think it's

00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:02,910
great but if you want more diversity I

00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:05,090
think we should use that social capital

00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:07,860
we built to actually build bridges

00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:10,170
towards other kind of skills that we

00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:12,960
have but also other kind of people that

00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:16,260
we usually see in open-source because

00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:18,840
now that if we can create the tools they

00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:21,090
need and the path they they need to

00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:23,610
become part of our communities I think

00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:25,770
will be richer and we can have those

00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:28,680
like open source project that are well

00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:31,080
designed and well marketed and who can

00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:34,680
be you which can be used by other types

00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:37,460
of peoples so thank you very much and if

00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,460
you have any questions

00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:49,190
thank you all there any questions

00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:57,829
there's always a question Russell sorry

00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:59,820
yes there is always a question the

00:16:57,829 --> 00:17:02,670
contribute the contributor who submitted

00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:06,449
this hundred thousand line patch away

00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:08,520
however many it was the question that

00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:11,069
comes to my mind is how did we get into

00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:13,020
a situation where they got so far down

00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:14,730
that path before they came to you or we

00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:17,520
even knew they were working on that I

00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:20,429
mean pre-empting a problem is always

00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:23,429
better than solving it how much do you

00:17:20,429 --> 00:17:25,500
think the role of setting up

00:17:23,429 --> 00:17:28,020
expectations about how people are going

00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:29,780
to engage before they start engaging is

00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:33,090
part of this process

00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:35,700
so if I understand the question well you

00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:38,160
are asking first

00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:40,830
was there any way for them to kind of

00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:46,260
ping us beforehand before we got to this

00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:50,940
part and then if we could have some kind

00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:53,130
of documentation for it like a ritual so

00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:55,080
while I understood from my conversation

00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:58,020
with them is that for them you don't

00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:59,790
vote for her beforehand you wouldn't

00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:03,360
show your work before it was perfect

00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:05,250
this so if you have that in mind there's

00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:08,400
no reason for you to ping anyone until

00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:10,200
it's perfect and I mean if you want

00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,840
information you have to look for it and

00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:14,460
that's the thing if you if you think you

00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:18,929
know you're not going to look for that

00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:20,970
information but now she now she knows so

00:18:18,929 --> 00:18:23,580
now she tells her colleagues and so we

00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:26,299
have a better community for it so having

00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:28,320
gone through this experience and having

00:18:26,299 --> 00:18:31,320
been on the other side of this

00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:33,090
experience now it really helped the

00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:35,790
community as a whole learning this

00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:37,740
together but it's still an issue and I

00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:39,360
think it's it can be an issue for any

00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:41,669
community working with people who are

00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:44,429
not used to just opening up here as soon

00:18:41,669 --> 00:18:46,980
as it works there's this idea of pride

00:18:44,429 --> 00:18:49,380
there's the fear of being judged on your

00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,890
work and all of that I think we need to

00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:52,980
have

00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:56,040
so we need to behave ourselves better

00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:59,280
when we answer and when we talk to new

00:18:56,040 --> 00:19:02,640
contributors to show them that any work

00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:04,320
is good work and I mean at least that's

00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,350
what I believe and I believe we can have

00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:12,930
better open-source communities if we can

00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:15,990
convey that this idea all right

00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:19,670
are there more questions are there

00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:22,250
questions from the internet audience no

00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:25,250
okay thank you again

00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:25,250
