	00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:07,319
so as Don said I'm Lily I'm a

00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:10,080
penetration tester from Melbourne and

00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:12,690
I'm a board what board member of Digital

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:17,699
Rights Watch Australia and I'm a former

00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:20,130
historian and a future cyborg and you

00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:21,840
may remember me from such conference

00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:24,359
talks as the one where I rant about

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,760
history the one where I rant about

00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:28,109
privacy or most popularly the one where

00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,510
I rant about history and privacy

00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:32,430
together and today's talk fits into that

00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:34,800
latter category I want to talk about

00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:36,329
arsenic and mass surveillance because

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,710
there is a lot that we can learn from

00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:42,600
one about the other and as a quick note

00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:46,170
during this talk I'm going to mention

00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:49,260
death a lot and I'll talk about murder a

00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:50,850
bit and you'll hear quotes of threats

00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,890
that people have made to other people

00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,930
and if you are not in a good place to

00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:57,469
hear about those things right now that

00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:59,969
is very okay you can leave this session

00:00:57,469 --> 00:01:00,930
to not do another thing instead whatever

00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:03,000
you would like I don't want to make

00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:08,159
anyone uncomfortable so that's a small

00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:11,610
heads-up before we get into this so this

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,890
is arsenic trioxide arsenic is a natural

00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:15,330
element it's been used for all kinds of

00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:18,030
things since the time of the ancient

00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:19,729
Greeks but for the next half hour when I

00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:22,799
talk about arsenic I'm referring

00:01:19,729 --> 00:01:25,979
specifically to this stuff arsenic

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:28,500
trioxide or white arsenic this is an

00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:30,329
industrial byproduct it started showing

00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,430
up everywhere when the Industrial

00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:35,280
Revolution began it looks a lot like

00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:39,360
sugar or flour when it's mixed into food

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:43,229
arsenic is colorless tasteless odorless

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:45,450
and extremely poisonous if you take a

00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:47,369
lot at once it hasn't affected like

00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:49,229
cholera which is more or less the worst

00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:49,880
diarrhea that you have ever had in your

00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:54,930
life

00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:57,000
followed by the end of your life if you

00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:59,670
only take a little bit of arsenic at a

00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,700
time it can make you tired and achy and

00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:04,469
give you trouble breathing in England in

00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,060
the 1800's arsenic was very cheap

00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:08,190
because it was a waste product that

00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:09,750
factories wanted to get rid of and you

00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:11,849
could get it almost anywhere in almost

00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,470
anything and buy anything I really do

00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:16,200
mean pretty much anything

00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:18,090
it was in cosmetics for example there

00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,220
were many companies that produced

00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:22,230
arsenical wafers or powders that promise

00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:24,360
to get rid of pimples and blackheads or

00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:26,130
to slow the signs of aging and I mean

00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,020
it's kind of easy to claim that your

00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:30,030
customers won't age when they use your

00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:34,920
products because when they use them they

00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:37,320
will die it was used domestically to

00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,810
kill mice and cockroaches and rats and

00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:41,520
other pests so it was easy to walk into

00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:44,250
a shop and get a box of the-- the pure

00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:46,050
stuff to keep in your kitchen but

00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:49,020
arsenic was most popular as a color

00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:50,820
pigment especially in emerald green also

00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:53,970
known as Paris green which was used in

00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:56,550
the same form as a pigment by artists

00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:57,990
and as a pest killer by farmers

00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:59,790
literally they would walk in and buy the

00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:03,780
exact same product and it looked like

00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:06,540
that it produced a really vibrant green

00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:09,120
that no other pigment to that date was

00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:11,130
able to give and because it was in

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,070
pigments that meant it ended up in

00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:15,600
anything that needed color in cases were

00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:18,720
recorded of people being poisoned by

00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:21,330
arsenic in their playing cards in fabric

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,489
dyes and in product packaging arsenic

00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:26,370
also found its way into famous art like

00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:27,989
van Gogh's Starry Night and this is one

00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:29,400
of several reasons that art galleries

00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:36,630
don't like it very much when you try to

00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:39,540
lick their paintings most notoriously it

00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:40,709
was also in wallpaper wallpaper was put

00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,720
up in the homes of anyone who could

00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:44,670
afford it and because our Cenacle

00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,370
pigment was cheap that meant that most

00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:49,800
people eventually could afford it the

00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:51,989
pigment dust would come off come off the

00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,690
walls if people brushed past it or if

00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:56,250
there was a breeze and if it was damp

00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:59,550
which it did get damp in England

00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:02,640
especially it admitted a toxic arsonist

00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:05,340
gasps people who felt sick would often

00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,019
go on holiday to the seaside to take in

00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,700
the sea air and they would find

00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:11,130
themselves feeling much better after a

00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:13,860
day or two and what they didn't realize

00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:16,799
is that most seaside cottages had

00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:18,630
whitewashed walls not wallpaper and they

00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:22,320
were feeling better because they weren't

00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:23,760
constantly breathing in poison you could

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,039
get our cynical wallpaper in most

00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:27,169
Western countries but it was especially

00:04:26,039 --> 00:04:29,659
a problem in

00:04:27,169 --> 00:04:31,039
England and in the United States the two

00:04:29,659 --> 00:04:34,699
countries that were not really keen on

00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:36,560
government regulation of industry what

00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:39,139
you're looking at right now is a

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,539
digitized arsenical wallpaper sample

00:04:39,139 --> 00:04:44,509
that came from a book called shadows

00:04:41,539 --> 00:04:47,270
from the walls of death and this book

00:04:44,509 --> 00:04:48,979
was published in 1874 as part of a

00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:51,080
public health campaign to raise

00:04:48,979 --> 00:04:53,629
awareness of the dangers of arsenical

00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:55,370
wallpaper and it was eventually so

00:04:53,629 --> 00:04:57,650
successful that it's aimed that out of

00:04:55,370 --> 00:05:00,500
the original 100 or so copies that were

00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:03,050
produced there are now only four left

00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,909
because of how poisonous they are some

00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:06,379
brave soul at the University of Michigan

00:05:04,909 --> 00:05:09,620
digitized this one and they are

00:05:06,379 --> 00:05:11,120
hopefully still okay but because these

00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:13,490
are pretty and they're in the public

00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:18,020
domain you'll will see a few examples of

00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:20,810
them as I keep talking maybe most

00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:23,360
importantly arsenic also has had a

00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:25,639
reputation as a way to make money

00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,919
quickly because your family wouldn't

00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:30,139
taste it if you baked it into a cake or

00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:32,150
served it in a cup of tea and for this

00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:37,279
reason it was also known as inheritance

00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:39,650
powder but we're at a tech conference

00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:42,500
which is why we're also talking about

00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:45,050
digital privacy or lack thereof and by

00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:46,939
this I mean the current practice of

00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:48,830
governments and corporations gathering

00:05:46,939 --> 00:05:50,750
literally as much data about everybody

00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:53,000
as they possibly can and storing it

00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:54,560
forever and not usually very well I'm

00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,500
talking about Facebook and Google's

00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,589
advertising networks and the Australian

00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:03,560
Government's metadata retention and

00:05:59,589 --> 00:06:05,149
vague assisted access legislation the

00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:07,219
dodgy apps that promise to make you look

00:06:05,149 --> 00:06:10,520
good in photos but then ask for a

00:06:07,219 --> 00:06:13,399
suspicious number of permissions and the

00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:15,529
five eyes I'm talking about the nine

00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:17,449
thousand five not ninety five thousand

00:06:15,529 --> 00:06:18,919
one hundred and eighty gdpr violation

00:06:17,449 --> 00:06:20,779
complaints that the European Data

00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:23,719
Protection Board has received since the

00:06:20,779 --> 00:06:25,849
laws came into effect last May and the

00:06:23,719 --> 00:06:27,740
forty one thousand five hundred and two

00:06:25,849 --> 00:06:30,050
notifications of data breaches that

00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:33,169
organizations have submitted since that

00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:35,300
time the fact that google has already

00:06:33,169 --> 00:06:37,729
been fined 50 million euros for

00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:39,259
violating this law and that this amount

00:06:37,729 --> 00:06:40,200
of money is basically a trivial

00:06:39,259 --> 00:06:43,290
operational expense

00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:45,810
to a company of that size I'm talking

00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:47,850
about the inevitable and unknown large

00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:50,370
number of data breaches that remain

00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:52,620
undiscovered or unreported and I'm also

00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:54,510
talking about the fact that the rest of

00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:56,160
the world is not covered by regulations

00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:58,530
like the gdpr and mass surveillance

00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:01,500
practices persist just like they always

00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:04,020
have so I'm talking about all of that

00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:06,030
and then what happens to this data

00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:08,220
gathered in technically GDP are

00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:10,500
compliant ways or not when it isn't

00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:12,390
secured properly or someone inside a

00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:14,640
data gathering organization develops a

00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:17,130
grudge or even when it's used as

00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:20,700
intended and a thoughtless new feature

00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:22,770
up ends everything with the topics of

00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:25,260
digital privacy and arsenic intersect is

00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:27,000
that for a good period of time despite

00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:28,530
the best efforts of the people who knew

00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,240
what they were talking about the public

00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:34,710
didn't really give a damn about either

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:36,540
of them arsenic and mass data gathering

00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:39,060
are both things that have pervaded

00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:41,060
everyday life in large-scale ways that

00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:43,380
have seemed impossible to change and

00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:45,570
despite lots of well-informed people

00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:47,520
agreeing in their respective centuries

00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:50,640
that these things are damaging to our

00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:52,350
well-being or our way of life it is hard

00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,460
to get people to care or to think that

00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:56,610
things can change

00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:59,580
these things aren't great but they're

00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:02,760
just too useful and convenient arsenic

00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:04,650
makes vibrant and cheap shades of green

00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:07,430
that look nice it gives you a clear

00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:10,080
complexion it kills mice really well

00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:12,810
data can tell us how to plan cities and

00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:15,900
provide accurate medical care and help

00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:18,270
us catch bad guys but while things don't

00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,830
change people's lives have also been

00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:21,080
upended by these things in increasing

00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:24,270
numbers

00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:26,430
inhaling ambient arsenic didn't make

00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:28,920
everybody sick in the same way one

00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:30,720
person might die and another person in

00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:33,780
the same home might just get bad

00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,160
headaches in the same way mass

00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:37,050
surveillance and privacy invasion

00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:38,790
disproportionately affect the members of

00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:40,919
society who are already the most

00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:43,110
vulnerable then there are the more

00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:45,720
targeted attacks both with arsenic and

00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:47,490
with data that can become devastating to

00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,870
whoever's on the receiving end and to

00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:53,580
illustrate my point I want to tell you

00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:55,890
two short stories in 1852

00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:58,350
English coal mine worker named William

00:08:55,890 --> 00:09:02,210
Mowbray married a young woman named Mary

00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:04,860
Ann and together they had nine children

00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:07,290
over the next few years seven of these

00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:10,350
children died tragically from what was

00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:12,210
recorded as gastric fever in the mid

00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:13,620
19th century times were hard and it

00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:16,890
wasn't uncommon for children not to

00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:18,540
survive childhood the company the couple

00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:22,230
collected the life-insurance money and

00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:25,470
went on after 13 years of marriage in

00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:28,640
the January of 1865 William Mowbray

00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:30,810
himself died tragically of gastric fever

00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:33,270
leaving Mary Ann and her two remaining

00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:34,740
daughters to make their own way in the

00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:36,990
world with a little bit more insurance

00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:39,000
money to help them by the way the

00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:41,220
average life insurance payout in England

00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,050
for an adult man at that point in time

00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:45,050
was about equivalent to his year's wages

00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:50,340
George Ward who was an engineer was

00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:53,580
recovering for an illness in hospital in

00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:56,190
1865 when he fell in love with a nurse

00:09:53,580 --> 00:10:00,060
named Mary Ann and they were married in

00:09:56,190 --> 00:10:02,970
August 1865 Ward tragically died of

00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:07,020
gastric fever 14 months later his wife

00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:10,890
collected the insurance payout James

00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:13,140
Robinson was a shipwright in 1886 he had

00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:15,780
a new baby son and a recently deceased

00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:18,900
wife so he hired a housekeeper to help

00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:21,270
him out the new housekeeper a woman

00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:22,770
named Mary Ann had only been living in

00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:25,610
the household for a month when the baby

00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:27,960
tragically died of gastric fever

00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:31,980
Robinson found that Mary Ann's presence

00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:35,250
was emotionally helpful and he married

00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:36,600
her in the August of 1867 by this time

00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:38,040
Mary Ann was pregnant with their

00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,230
daughter who was born two months after

00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,910
the wedding but the baby only lived for

00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:45,600
three months before dying tragically of

00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:48,900
gastric fever Mary Ann's misfortune

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,880
continued while she had been living with

00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:53,040
Ward and one of her surviving children

00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,410
from her first marriage had died

00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,660
tragically of gastric fever after

00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:59,160
marrying Robinson her only remaining

00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:01,530
daughter from her first marriage also

00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:03,240
died tragically of gastric fever and so

00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:03,960
did two of Robinson's children from his

00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,900
first marriage

00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:07,379
so did Mary Ann's mother just after Mary

00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,929
Ann went to

00:11:07,379 --> 00:11:14,009
visit her marianne inherited almost

00:11:09,929 --> 00:11:17,669
everything soon after all these

00:11:14,009 --> 00:11:19,199
tragedies james robinson the shipwright

00:11:17,669 --> 00:11:21,949
discovered that Maryann had been

00:11:19,199 --> 00:11:24,689
stealing from him and running up debts

00:11:21,949 --> 00:11:27,059
he also noticed that she was becoming

00:11:24,689 --> 00:11:29,059
weirdly insistent that he should take

00:11:27,059 --> 00:11:31,999
out a life-insurance policy on himself

00:11:29,059 --> 00:11:34,139
which he refused to do

00:11:31,999 --> 00:11:36,929
Robinson kicked Marianne out of the

00:11:34,139 --> 00:11:41,279
house he did not die tragically of

00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:43,139
gastric fever one of Marianne's friends

00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,759
took pity on her tragic circumstances

00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:47,669
and introduced Marianne to her brother

00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:49,649
Frederick cotton cotton was a widower

00:11:47,669 --> 00:11:52,259
with two small children of his own and

00:11:49,649 --> 00:11:55,829
he fell into Mary Ann's arms when in the

00:11:52,259 --> 00:11:59,509
March of 18th century 17 his beloved

00:11:55,829 --> 00:12:02,789
sister died tragically of gastric fever

00:11:59,509 --> 00:12:05,749
cotton and Mary Ann married in September

00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:07,589
1870 and in 1871 they had a son

00:12:05,749 --> 00:12:09,569
unfortunately before the year was over

00:12:07,589 --> 00:12:12,359
Frederick cotton also died tragically of

00:12:09,569 --> 00:12:15,449
gastric fever Mary uncollected the

00:12:12,359 --> 00:12:17,549
insurance money you know what happens

00:12:15,449 --> 00:12:19,769
next she moves in with another guy and

00:12:17,549 --> 00:12:21,839
brings the surviving kids and stepkids

00:12:19,769 --> 00:12:23,639
with her wills get rewritten and

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,829
suddenly pretty much the entire

00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:29,579
household dies tragically of gastric

00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:32,639
fever this left Mary Ann with one

00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:36,509
remaining stepson who she complained

00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:38,939
loudly about to her employer when the

00:12:36,509 --> 00:12:44,720
boy took ill and died tragically of

00:12:38,939 --> 00:12:49,199
gastric fever her boss became suspicious

00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:52,679
and got the local doctor to delay

00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:54,149
issuing the death certificate when Mary

00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:56,399
Ann discovered that she couldn't get the

00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:57,749
insurance payout on her stepsons life

00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:01,049
without the death certificate

00:12:57,749 --> 00:13:04,159
she had a public meltdown about it which

00:13:01,049 --> 00:13:06,899
led to people asking questions and then

00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:09,569
more questions and then testing her

00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:13,349
stepsons remains for arsenic which was

00:13:09,569 --> 00:13:15,359
found in abundance Mary Ann was

00:13:13,349 --> 00:13:19,909
convicted of his murder and died

00:13:15,359 --> 00:13:19,909
tragically of rope poisoning in 1873

00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:28,170
in her lifetime she had murdered 16 of

00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:30,600
her own children and stepchildren four

00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:32,400
of her partner's her mother and an

00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,170
inconvenient friend and collected

00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:38,490
insurance payouts and will benefits from

00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:40,890
almost all of them it now takes a lot

00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:42,390
less time for a criminal to make a lot

00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:44,100
more money than Mary Anne cotton ever

00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:46,620
did but instead of marrying and

00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:48,420
murdering they can use the info out of

00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:50,130
stolen data dumps which are about as

00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:52,700
cheap and plentiful as arsenic was back

00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:56,010
in the day so here's my next story

00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:58,770
sometime after July last year some of us

00:13:56,010 --> 00:14:00,240
opened our inboxes and saw a threatening

00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:02,280
email that might have looked like it had

00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,780
come from our own email address the

00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:08,340
message probably went a bit like this

00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:10,200
one hello I'm a programmer who cracked

00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:12,690
your email account and device about half

00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,490
a year ago you entered a password on one

00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:17,340
of the insecure site you visited and I

00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:20,070
catched it your password from Fredrik

00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:23,280
cotton at gmail.com on moment of crack

00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:24,930
was haunted too of course you can and

00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:27,270
will change your password or already

00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:30,150
made it but it doesn't matter my rat

00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:33,390
software updated every time please don't

00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:36,540
try to contact me or find me it is

00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:40,080
impossible since I am emailing you from

00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:41,940
your email account through your email I

00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:44,370
uploaded malicious code to your

00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:45,839
operation system I saved all of your

00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:47,880
contacts with friends colleagues

00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:51,870
relatives and a complete history of

00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:53,610
visits to the Internet resources also I

00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:56,520
installed a rad software on your device

00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:59,100
and longtime spying on you you are not

00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:01,740
my only victim I usually lock devices

00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:03,930
and ask for a ransom but I was struck by

00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:07,650
the sites of intimate content that you

00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:10,710
very often visit I am in shock of your

00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:13,080
reach fantasies wow I've never seen

00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:16,820
anything like this I did not even know

00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:16,820
that such content could be so exciting

00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:25,630
so when you had fun on intimate sites

00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:28,630
you know what I mean

00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:30,520
I made screenshot with using my program

00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:32,230
from your camera of your device

00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:34,900
after that I jointed them to the content

00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:36,370
of the currently viewed site will be

00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:38,440
funny when I send these photos to your

00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:40,330
contacts and if your relatives see it

00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:42,940
but I'm sure you don't want it I

00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:44,800
definitely would not want to I will not

00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:46,600
do this if you pay me a little amount I

00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,160
think seven hundred and fifty four

00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:51,070
dollars is a nice price for it

00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:55,660
I accept only bitcoins my bitcoin wallet

00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:59,200
is some long string you have two days 48

00:15:55,660 --> 00:16:01,150
hours for to make a payment if this does

00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:04,180
not happen all your contacts will get

00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:06,430
crazy shots with your dirty life do not

00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:13,690
take this frivolously this is the last

00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:16,870
warning I hope you will be prudent by in

00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:18,960
just one months after these emails first

00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:22,240
appeared researchers found that about

00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:25,750
70.8 bitcoin which is about 2.3 million

00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:28,420
Danish kroner or just over 300,000 euros

00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:30,160
at today's exchange rates that had been

00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:32,380
deposited into the wallets that had been

00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:34,930
listed in this game emails and why I

00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:36,520
checked again back in November just one

00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:38,650
of those wallets had nine hundred and

00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:40,960
twenty eight point nine Bitcoin in it

00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:44,920
which is about 31 million Danish kroner

00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:47,260
or 4.2 million Europe I tried checking

00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:49,930
again this morning but after ten or so

00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:51,880
months this extortion scam idea has now

00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:53,920
spread to so many people and turned up

00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:55,480
in so many languages that tracking the

00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,400
number of Bitcoin wallets that were

00:16:55,480 --> 00:17:00,760
involved took way more time than I had

00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:05,200
available this amount of money is many

00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:08,530
many more times than year's wages for

00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:10,000
most of us I think and more money than

00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:12,040
Mary Ann cotton could ever have dreamed

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,350
of and I know that some of us in this

00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:16,240
room would have received this email and

00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:17,830
read it and saw it for the scam that it

00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,200
was and then probably had a good laugh

00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:22,240
but clearly many thousands of other

00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:26,290
people suffered through their own

00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:28,180
private hell before paying up the thing

00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:30,790
that sets these so-called sextortion

00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:34,120
emails apart from other traditional spam

00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:36,700
is the inclusion of real passwords from

00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:38,830
all data dumps some of you probably know

00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:41,320
exactly the kinds of breaches that these

00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:43,540
things came from this data is easy

00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:45,550
enough to find mail merge is pretty

00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:47,730
quick to use and you only need a few

00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:51,250
scared people to start seeing results

00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:53,590
but most people don't know this stuff

00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:54,970
even today and the inclusion of

00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:58,300
something like a password which they

00:17:54,970 --> 00:18:00,400
thought was extremely private and secure

00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:01,900
makes it more likely that they are going

00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,660
to get really scared and pay up and

00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:09,010
clearly they are paying up personal data

00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:11,890
is potent like that but serial killers

00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:14,740
like Mary Ann cotton were outliers when

00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:16,450
it came to arsenic death most people in

00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:17,920
Victorian England didn't need to live

00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:19,720
with a murderer to be poisoned with

00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:23,260
arsenic because it like as we already

00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:25,630
said it was everywhere grown men died

00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:28,600
from inhaling it off the walls in their

00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:30,190
sleep an elderly women died after

00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:33,010
mistaking it for sugar and putting it in

00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:35,080
their own tea children died from being

00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:36,940
looked after by nurses wearing uniforms

00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:40,870
that had been dyed with our cynical

00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:43,270
pigments and far far more people didn't

00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:45,040
die but lived with chronic headaches and

00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:46,660
breathing problems in poor digestion

00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:49,660
that they could never find the cause for

00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:51,790
in their day and age in the same way a

00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:53,200
large scale personal data is not

00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:55,300
something that needs to be used by

00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:58,780
individual criminals to create problems

00:18:55,300 --> 00:19:00,370
as we know more formal uses of this kind

00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:03,460
of data by governments and by private

00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:06,070
companies alike can end up adding trans

00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:07,450
people like what happened in 2014 when

00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:09,310
Google consolidated some of their

00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:11,440
messaging services and launched hangouts

00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:13,780
which merged previously separate

00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:16,030
accounts into one legal name identity

00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:18,490
and put lots of trans Google users in

00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:20,680
dangerous situations it can end up

00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:22,870
strongly influencing Democratic

00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:24,700
ostensibly democratic elections like

00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:27,460
what Cambridge analytic added to the

00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:30,250
u.s. presidential campaign in 2016 using

00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:32,380
Facebook's data it can end up stealing

00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:33,880
company secrets like we learned in

00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:36,430
November last year when a Dutch company

00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:38,800
a Dutch team actually revealed that

00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:41,440
microsoft office 365 was sending the

00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:43,130
sentences before and after spelling and

00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,350
grammar checked strings

00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:49,820
to the Redmond mothership as telemetry

00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:51,770
data that you can't turn off anecdotally

00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:53,240
I've also heard of plenty of people who

00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:55,970
have given up on using large parts of

00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:57,530
the internet because working out what to

00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:59,390
trust and how to stay safe and in

00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:01,280
control was too complex without the

00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:04,850
layers of knowledge but people like us

00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:06,350
have from working in this industry but

00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:09,080
despite how much we know it isn't great

00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:12,020
most people are still kind of about the

00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:14,539
whole issue and it's easy to understand

00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:16,669
why people are either apathetic about

00:20:14,539 --> 00:20:18,650
big problems or resigned to the fact

00:20:16,669 --> 00:20:21,650
that horrible things are happening and

00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:24,260
they can't do anything about them the

00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:26,150
scale of them seems impossible and the

00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:31,690
likelihood of it becoming a huge problem

00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:34,520
for you this week is probably fairly low

00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:38,240
the period of time were the most people

00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:40,610
give the least of a dam is known as peak

00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:43,610
indifference this is a term that was

00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:46,010
coined by a Cory Doctorow in 2016 when

00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:47,720
he was talking about how the world was

00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:50,870
at a turning point around the issue of

00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:52,520
digital privacy and he argued that after

00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:55,010
this turning point increasing numbers of

00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:57,490
people would begin to care about their

00:20:55,010 --> 00:21:01,280
privacy as increasing numbers of people

00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:04,039
were affected by breaches and incidents

00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:07,070
or someone they cared about was affected

00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:08,600
and doctor who linked this idea to the

00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:10,520
eventual success of public health

00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:13,669
campaigns about tobacco smoking but

00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:15,520
almost every issue reaches peak

00:21:13,669 --> 00:21:18,080
indifference at some point or another

00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,400
and what happens to the issue after that

00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:22,669
tipping point is something that we can

00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:24,559
learn a lot from where we passed peak

00:21:22,669 --> 00:21:26,960
and difference about privacy in the West

00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:28,760
is kind of nebulous to work out and was

00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:32,630
it after Edward Snowden's actions in

00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:35,690
2013 or after Ashley Madison or Target

00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:38,659
or Sony I think it was definitely

00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:40,610
sometime in March last year after the

00:21:38,659 --> 00:21:43,630
Cambridge analytical stuff really came

00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:46,490
to light because after that point we saw

00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:48,380
large-scale inquiries into corporate

00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:50,809
data use in the United States and lots

00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:53,240
of Penance and looking CEOs and public

00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:56,169
commitments to change and even if these

00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:58,509
things were only for show they

00:21:56,169 --> 00:22:01,359
to appease this growing sense of public

00:21:58,509 --> 00:22:04,210
disgust and mistrust about the way that

00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:06,820
data was being gathered and used in June

00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:08,499
last year the Pew Research Center in the

00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:11,799
United States found that in the previous

00:22:08,499 --> 00:22:13,480
12 months 74 percent of US Facebook

00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:15,549
users had either adjusted their privacy

00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:18,149
settings taken a long break from

00:22:15,549 --> 00:22:20,799
Facebook or deleted the app completely

00:22:18,149 --> 00:22:22,450
then the gdpr came into force in this

00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:24,369
part of the world which of course meant

00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:27,070
that companies suddenly had to start

00:22:24,369 --> 00:22:29,230
paying a lot more attention to the data

00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:31,179
that they had and everyday people was

00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:33,220
finally starting to get emails from

00:22:31,179 --> 00:22:35,259
everyone they had ever forgotten they

00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:37,119
had signed up with and telling them how

00:22:35,259 --> 00:22:39,249
important their privacy was and how

00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:40,720
meaningful their consent would be if

00:22:39,249 --> 00:22:44,649
they would so graciously deign to give

00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:47,049
it an awareness of just how much data

00:22:44,649 --> 00:22:48,909
complete randoms could see about them

00:22:47,049 --> 00:22:51,009
led to more people taking proactive

00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:52,720
steps to gain control of whether

00:22:51,009 --> 00:22:56,200
information was going both inside and

00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:58,269
outside of the EU but how do we keep up

00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:00,249
this momentum I mean we can let it

00:22:58,269 --> 00:23:02,019
happen naturally more and more people

00:23:00,249 --> 00:23:04,119
ending up the victims of data breaches

00:23:02,019 --> 00:23:06,730
and identity theft and account takeovers

00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:09,639
and leaked nudes or we can maintain it

00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:10,570
thoughtfully and with purpose and we

00:23:09,639 --> 00:23:12,940
spent all this time talking about

00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:15,299
arsenic for a reason not just because I

00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:18,429
like talking about historical poison

00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:20,559
19th century England had its own peaked

00:23:18,429 --> 00:23:22,629
indifference moment and people tried a

00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:25,840
whole bunch of ways to keep these issues

00:23:22,629 --> 00:23:27,460
central is tomato peak indifference

00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:30,399
about the domestic arsenic problem

00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:34,509
probably happened somewhere between 1850

00:23:30,399 --> 00:23:37,149
and 1870 by 1900 our cynical wallpaper

00:23:34,509 --> 00:23:38,799
was hardly worth mentioning except when

00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:41,259
someone occasionally found some and then

00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:43,299
they had to handle its removal and in

00:23:41,259 --> 00:23:45,789
this time two important things games

00:23:43,299 --> 00:23:50,109
gained momentum awareness of the problem

00:23:45,789 --> 00:23:51,399
and resistance to the problem awareness

00:23:50,109 --> 00:23:54,070
happened the more that people were

00:23:51,399 --> 00:23:56,249
educated literacy increased and I don't

00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:59,100
mean just actual reading skills but

00:23:56,249 --> 00:24:01,509
general scientific literacy increased

00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:03,879
tiny particles of poison in an

00:24:01,509 --> 00:24:05,859
environment are hard to see and without

00:24:03,879 --> 00:24:06,669
advanced scientific knowledge to that

00:24:05,859 --> 00:24:09,279
point in time

00:24:06,669 --> 00:24:09,880
ambient poisoning was kind of a

00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:13,150
conception

00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:17,380
a difficult thing to understand but

00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:19,630
slowly over time concepts like germs and

00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:21,880
disease communication and chemical

00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:24,250
pollutants became understood by

00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:28,270
scientists and eventually more generally

00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:29,740
understood by the public in 1840 James

00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:31,300
Marsh developed a test which could

00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:32,950
detect the presence of arsenic in the

00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:36,420
human body something which had

00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:39,280
previously been impossible basically

00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:41,080
suddenly knowing that your use of

00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:43,540
arsenic could be traced back to you

00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:47,770
meant that people were a lot less casual

00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:51,580
about poisoning each other on purpose in

00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:56,350
1854 a doctor called John Snow not this

00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:58,480
guy a sky in 1854 a doctor called John

00:24:56,350 --> 00:25:00,820
snow realized that a series of cholera

00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,410
outbreaks in London were happening

00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:03,970
because one of the public water supplies

00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:06,700
was contaminated with something that

00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:09,070
spread the disease this one against this

00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:11,800
commonly held theory that disease was

00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:13,750
spread by miasma or bad air and that

00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:16,330
breathing the air around the sick or a

00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:19,870
dead person was what would transmit all

00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:20,950
diseases snow tracked down the source of

00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:22,870
the contaminated water

00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:25,120
he removed the handle off the public

00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:28,900
pump they gave access to it and the

00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:30,940
cholera outbreak stopped this led to the

00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:32,890
development of modern sewer systems and

00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:36,850
a built better public understanding of

00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:39,910
germs and microorganisms awareness led

00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:42,250
to resistance protests literature played

00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:44,230
a big part in helping people convince

00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:46,780
others to join the resistance efforts

00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:48,930
things like the toxic shadows from the

00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:50,890
walls of death was an in-your-face

00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:52,990
presentation of the problem and it put

00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:54,760
the focus on wallpaper manufacturers to

00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:56,530
make changes and not just the

00:25:54,760 --> 00:26:00,490
individuals who might have our cynical

00:25:56,530 --> 00:26:02,950
wallpaper in their homes England to this

00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:06,060
day has never passed any meaningful laws

00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:10,960
banning the use of arsenic in wallpaper

00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:12,760
never but it turned out that the

00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,400
regulations in other countries like

00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:17,530
France and Germany had much more of an

00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:19,960
impact on how much arsenic turned up in

00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:23,060
English households and this was mostly

00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:25,610
down to fashion and consumer choice

00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:27,590
most European countries had outright

00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:30,380
banned the use of arsenic in pigment

00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:32,390
manufacturing since about the 1860s and

00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:34,520
because of this they suddenly became

00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:36,590
innovators for new paint pigments that

00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:38,720
created bright colors without using

00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:43,000
arsenic and because everything French is

00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:46,250
automatically fancy people were into it

00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,320
fashion like it does eventually trickle

00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:50,780
down through the whole industry and over

00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:52,850
time lots of places in England ended up

00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:55,790
offering arsenic free products like

00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:58,640
wallpaper for affordable prices in fact

00:26:55,790 --> 00:27:00,050
most manufacturers had no choice the

00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,910
pigments that they used to color their

00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:03,560
wallpapers mostly came from Europe in

00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:05,270
the first place so it was getting

00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:08,750
difficult to find any that contained

00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:10,430
arsenic even if they wanted to one of

00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:12,800
the best things about this outcome was

00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:15,200
that it created accessible alternatives

00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:17,690
for people who still believed in things

00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,880
like the miasma theory it was really

00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:22,400
unrealistic to expect that the average

00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:24,170
person in the 19th century England was

00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:26,170
suddenly going to suddenly going to

00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:28,780
develop a scientific understanding

00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:31,430
equivalent to a professional chemist

00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:34,000
people had jobs to do and lives to get

00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:36,200
on with the vast majority of people

00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,760
didn't even have access to the kinds of

00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,080
educational backgrounds that would allow

00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,630
them to begin to start understanding

00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:44,480
just exactly how domestic arsenic use

00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:46,310
was a problem so the creation of arsenic

00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,920
free tech that was affordable to obtain

00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:51,920
and easy to use and provided just the

00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:54,200
same kind of experience meant that those

00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:55,520
people were carried along and helped to

00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:58,460
solve the problem without needing to

00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:00,110
become activists themselves by the start

00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:02,210
of the 20th century in England our

00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:04,400
cynical wallpaper had been torn out of

00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:06,560
most houses and replaced with newer

00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:08,750
wallpaper and eventually with plain

00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:11,150
paint as fashions changed and nowadays

00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:14,740
it's rare to see arsenical wallpaper

00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:17,150
except behind thick glass and museums

00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:19,130
for those of you who have already read

00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:20,870
this far into the analogy you know that

00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:22,460
we are already doing a lot of these

00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:24,890
things when it comes to the privacy

00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:27,920
fight we are doing the awareness bit

00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:30,170
seems like everyone and their goldfish

00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:32,900
has either been - or run at least one

00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:35,240
crypto party every other day there's a

00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:36,020
new how-to guide about signal and tor

00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:38,000
you

00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:39,590
VPNs get advertised on commercial

00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,250
television at least in Australia they do

00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:45,770
oh and we're doing between the

00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:46,300
resistance bit too you know the gdpr is

00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:49,760
a thing

00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:51,860
ubiquitous HTTP is a thing firefox

00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,960
builds ad blockers into their browsers

00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:56,050
now password manages the things that our

00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:59,510
relatives have started asking us about

00:28:56,050 --> 00:29:01,280
Apple markets privacy as a feature of

00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:03,320
their tech and the people who can afford

00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:06,740
it pay thousands of dollars to get it

00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:09,080
and besides just focusing on telling

00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:10,940
people not to use Facebook or Google and

00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:13,550
putting the blame on individuals for

00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:16,250
trusting online services which marketing

00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:18,410
has primed them to trust we are going to

00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:20,510
the source we're calling out companies

00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:23,510
that perpetuate unfair systems and

00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:28,010
pressuring them in a thousand ways to do

00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:30,050
things differently so why does it still

00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:32,990
feel like in a lot of ways nothing has

00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:34,820
really changed except that now we have

00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:36,230
to click through about 100 more pop-ups

00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:39,950
that say please accept cookies to use

00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:42,290
this site I mean don't get me wrong all

00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:44,120
of these things are really positive

00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:46,220
steps in pushing back against accepting

00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:48,560
data harvesting and privacy violation as

00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:51,050
normal or inevitable but the third thing

00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:53,680
which the Arsenic fight had going for it

00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:57,530
which we don't really have yet is time

00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:59,810
this all took a lot of time and a lot of

00:29:57,530 --> 00:30:02,480
effort a lot of repeating information

00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:05,090
and a lot of petitioning governments to

00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:08,150
make changes and sometimes it worked and

00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:10,910
sometimes it didn't work but people kept

00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:13,130
doing it because arsenic kept poisoning

00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:15,830
people and it was the right thing to do

00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:18,260
and now we have wall decorations that

00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:20,480
don't kill us slowly in our sleep and

00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:22,250
now it is a lot harder to walk out of a

00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:26,090
corner shop with a bag of arsenical

00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:29,300
powder thinking about the long game is

00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:30,770
really hard I'm a millennial so if you

00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:33,610
believe the newspaper's I am something

00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:37,190
about avocados and patience is difficult

00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:39,260
but time is really the key ingredient we

00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:42,110
have to keep doing this and not give up

00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:43,580
and not give it to cynicism and repeat

00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:45,920
ourselves until we're sick of it and

00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:47,540
then keep going we have to keep

00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:49,250
reminding people how important these

00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:50,029
things are even when we have things like

00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:52,070
the GDP

00:30:50,029 --> 00:30:54,259
to back us up because if we grow up on

00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:56,419
complacent for one second things will

00:30:54,259 --> 00:30:59,690
get worse we have to do this for much

00:30:56,419 --> 00:31:02,239
much longer than we think we need to so

00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:04,340
here's what we need to keep doing keep

00:31:02,239 --> 00:31:05,960
pushing for grassroots public education

00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:08,299
efforts like crypto parties and

00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:09,710
community events and official education

00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:12,830
efforts from local governments and

00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:14,059
anyone who wants to get on board talk to

00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:15,979
your friends in the relatives when they

00:31:14,059 --> 00:31:17,509
ask you about it help the people who

00:31:15,979 --> 00:31:20,299
want to understand this to get the

00:31:17,509 --> 00:31:21,919
information that they need keep writing

00:31:20,299 --> 00:31:24,349
and speaking about these issues

00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:27,679
everywhere you can boost the voices of

00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:29,719
others who are already doing it keep the

00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:31,940
heat on lawmakers inside and outside of

00:31:29,719 --> 00:31:34,039
your country if your government isn't

00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:35,269
doing anything meaningful remember that

00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:37,789
the French and German laws had

00:31:35,269 --> 00:31:41,059
significant impacts on English attitudes

00:31:37,789 --> 00:31:42,799
to arsenic in a lot of ways the gdpr is

00:31:41,059 --> 00:31:44,779
doing a similar thing for personal data

00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:46,460
control outside of Europe it's had

00:31:44,779 --> 00:31:48,169
benefits for us in Australia even though

00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:51,409
it's a European law precedent-setting

00:31:48,169 --> 00:31:53,419
helps push for more legislation that

00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:55,700
gives us back control of our private

00:31:53,419 --> 00:31:58,099
information and imposes strong pen

00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:59,269
release for its misuse and push against

00:31:58,099 --> 00:32:01,879
every piece of legislation that

00:31:59,269 --> 00:32:03,710
threatens to weaken that argue for

00:32:01,879 --> 00:32:05,269
considered regulations that will

00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:08,330
actually work in practice

00:32:05,269 --> 00:32:10,729
and do this even though we already did

00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:14,570
it last month and three months ago and

00:32:10,729 --> 00:32:16,339
last year and in the 90s governments and

00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:17,869
corporations will keep trying it on

00:32:16,339 --> 00:32:19,999
again and again and they trust that we

00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:22,279
will get tired they trust that we will

00:32:19,999 --> 00:32:23,749
not notice when they bend the law we

00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:27,440
need to be aware of that and to work

00:32:23,749 --> 00:32:29,929
around it be a voice of reason in your

00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:32,029
own communities there are probably

00:32:29,929 --> 00:32:33,679
people in this room who probably knows

00:32:32,029 --> 00:32:36,080
someone who's stolen information and

00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:37,729
used it to mess someone else up or know

00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:41,089
people who set meaningless data

00:32:37,729 --> 00:32:43,820
gathering as a KPI challenge these folks

00:32:41,089 --> 00:32:45,200
to do better if you have ever been one

00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:47,539
of these people because it is not a

00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:50,779
perfect universe challenge yourselves to

00:32:47,539 --> 00:32:51,339
keep doing better too and do your

00:32:50,779 --> 00:32:55,190
research

00:32:51,339 --> 00:32:57,349
fact-check corporate privacy spin we

00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:59,419
know Facebook especially invests big

00:32:57,349 --> 00:33:01,669
money into saying that it is doing the

00:32:59,419 --> 00:33:03,860
right thing they paid through the nose

00:33:01,669 --> 00:33:07,100
for global billboard campaign

00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:09,080
and an apology tour to do that hold them

00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:10,909
accountable the GDP ah does not

00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:15,080
magically mean that everything is fixed

00:33:10,909 --> 00:33:16,340
forever we need to remember this if you

00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,690
are feeling good about the laws in your

00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:20,600
own countries that is really excellent

00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:22,399
but it isn't the end even though we

00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:24,559
don't have our cynical wallpaper anymore

00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:26,029
people still suffer from arsenic

00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:28,220
poisoning all the time

00:33:26,029 --> 00:33:29,990
this mostly happens in places where

00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:31,870
we've outsourced to the Messier parts as

00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:33,860
a manufacturing industry like China

00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:36,380
white arsenic is an industrial

00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:38,899
byproducts China currently produces

00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:42,649
about 70 percent of the world's supply

00:33:38,899 --> 00:33:44,090
of white arsenic and it gets freely used

00:33:42,649 --> 00:33:46,130
as a pest killer and a lot of those

00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:47,779
sorts of places mostly for the same

00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:49,850
reasons that it used to be used in

00:33:47,779 --> 00:33:52,519
Europe it's cheap its productive its

00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:54,169
effective at what it does that means

00:33:52,519 --> 00:33:56,510
that it ends up in the water supply and

00:33:54,169 --> 00:33:57,950
leads to skin cancers and breathing

00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:59,480
difficulties and many more things for

00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:01,279
all the people who work with it and

00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:03,620
around it but if it isn't happening

00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:07,070
where you are that can be hard to bear

00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:08,629
in mind in just this way if we want a

00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:10,879
really good solution for digital

00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:12,859
surveillance it has to be global we

00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:14,599
can't just look around us and see okay

00:34:12,859 --> 00:34:15,980
things are good here because usually

00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:18,169
that only means the problem has moved

00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:19,639
somewhere we can't see it anymore or

00:34:18,169 --> 00:34:21,859
it's affecting places or people that we

00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:26,119
might not think about very much keep

00:34:21,859 --> 00:34:28,099
looking outward we probably have the

00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:29,419
biggest responsibility to try to keep

00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:32,540
making the world better for the people

00:34:29,419 --> 00:34:35,570
who don't have the knowledge that a lot

00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:37,129
of us do the average person in the 19th

00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:39,649
century wasn't a chemist the average

00:34:37,129 --> 00:34:42,020
person in the 21st century isn't a tech

00:34:39,649 --> 00:34:44,290
worker not everybody wants to be and not

00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:46,310
everybody can be and that is fine

00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:47,450
some folks are gonna keep calling us

00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:49,339
paranoid forever

00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:51,440
or if they'll minimize the risks or

00:34:49,339 --> 00:34:53,290
they'll insist that they have nothing to

00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,429
hide and anyone who does is a criminal

00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:57,910
but we can keep making the world better

00:34:55,429 --> 00:35:01,130
anyway because we are the ones who can

00:34:57,910 --> 00:35:03,170
all of us in this room are in a unique

00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:05,150
position to understand the scale of

00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:06,440
suffering and damage that's caused by

00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:08,720
pervasive surveillance and privacy

00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:11,750
invading systems no matter whose hands

00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:13,609
they're in it's likely that most of us

00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:15,650
are here because we like building things

00:35:13,609 --> 00:35:17,110
or breaking things solving puzzles

00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:18,460
getting creative with

00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:20,800
Computers and because we have that

00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:24,270
knowledge we can do something about it

00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:26,770
we have to keep doing something about it

00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:28,120
for me the scariest thing about giving

00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:32,260
this talk is that nothing is so

00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:34,210
incredibly uncool as optimism but I

00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:35,800
really want to be optimistic and I

00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:37,300
really want you folks to be optimistic

00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:40,110
and to keep giving a damn

00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:42,610
because cynicism gets you retweets and

00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:44,950
donking on optimism is a lot easier than

00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:46,870
caring about something but if you

00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:48,100
actually do give a damn you have to

00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:50,380
think about the long game

00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:52,960
and have patience and keep doing what

00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:54,970
you think is right even though there are

00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:57,460
days and years where sometimes it seems

00:35:54,970 --> 00:36:00,220
like nothing changes and I know some of

00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:03,060
you burnt out on this years ago decades

00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:05,950
ago really does take time decades of it

00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:07,540
burnout is real and it is a thing that

00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:10,060
you are definitely allowed to feel but

00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:14,050
we can't do it if you're exhausted by it

00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:15,550
support other people to keep trying so

00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:18,550
imagine someone is giving this talk in

00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:21,160
150 years provided that we have managed

00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:23,800
to survive the sea levels rising what

00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:27,070
does the long view of this fight look

00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:29,410
like what is the optimistic end goal who

00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:31,270
are the Mary Ann Cotton's in this future

00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:33,880
version of the talk and who are the

00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:35,710
James marshes and the John snows what

00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:37,450
does shadows from the walls of death

00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:40,060
contain that's so toxic that nobody

00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:42,070
wants to touch it anymore we can't

00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:45,280
answer these questions as long as we

00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:47,320
don't give up thank you so much to all

00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:50,860
of these people who helped me make this

00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:52,900
talk a thing and thank you for coming

00:36:50,860 --> 00:37:00,849
along to hear me

00:36:52,900 --> 00:37:00,849
