care its handling sensitive data like

00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:10,420
database passwords tokens to support API

00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:13,180
etc it's also sharing settings between

00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:15,609
your team members and as we all know

00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:18,519
junga settings is a regular Python code

00:00:15,609 --> 00:00:21,849
so it could have some tricky and obvious

00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:24,970
logic there are different approaches to

00:00:21,849 --> 00:00:28,390
cell to solve this issue so let's

00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:31,659
briefly talk about most popular ones

00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:34,630
so settings local approach it's maybe

00:00:31,659 --> 00:00:40,030
the most simplest and the most older

00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:42,040
sync so you split your settings to base

00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:44,110
settings in settings dot PI and

00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:48,640
environment specific settings to

00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:51,130
settings local dot by this approach

00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,400
partially solves issue with sensitive

00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:59,580
data but still has a lot of

00:00:53,400 --> 00:01:01,990
disadvantages so the next approach is

00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:04,619
separate settings file for each

00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:08,469
environment with this approach you

00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:11,409
separate your settings by environments

00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:15,420
to have this base file so it's like an

00:01:11,409 --> 00:01:18,340
extension of previous method and it's

00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:20,200
solve this issue with different

00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:23,530
environments there in version control

00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:25,270
system and it's easy to share settings

00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:28,469
between developers but still you need

00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:32,829
somehow handle secret secret data and

00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:36,009
still you have this inheritance the next

00:01:32,829 --> 00:01:39,280
approach is environment variables and

00:01:36,009 --> 00:01:41,700
this is just some basic example and has

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:45,909
some issues so let's have a look on

00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:49,030
advanced example instead of using AWS

00:01:45,909 --> 00:01:54,579
dot env Ron directly it's better to

00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:57,130
write some wrapper and to handle K arrow

00:01:54,579 --> 00:02:00,520
and also you can add their default

00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:02,759
values and type conversion but it's

00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:06,639
better to use a third-party application

00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:10,720
we will talk about it later in several

00:02:06,639 --> 00:02:15,160
slides so this approach has a lot of

00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:17,620
advantages finally we have configuration

00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:19,690
separate from coat you have environment

00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:21,850
parity between all your servers there is

00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:23,980
no inheritance and also there is a

00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:26,430
theoretical grounding for using

00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:30,280
environment variables for configuration

00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:32,620
it's twelve factors so twelve factors

00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:37,840
it's a collection of recommendation to

00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:40,870
build web apps to be easily deploy and

00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:44,560
scale in cloud it was created by Heroku

00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:46,480
a well-known cloud hosting provider and

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,750
in terms of this talk we are interested

00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,670
in configuration factor which literally

00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:54,490
says that we need to use environment

00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:56,860
variables for this so if you're not

00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:58,930
familiar with twelve factor I strongly

00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:01,240
recommend you to check their website

00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:04,540
they have really clear explanations for

00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:07,440
each factor and architecture all in all

00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:11,500
and now let's go back to the tooling and

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:13,540
we found that junga environ it's very

00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:17,770
convenient up it has really nice API

00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:20,440
that handles all type conversion default

00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:23,320
values etc so let's have a look an

00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:25,660
examples that's how your settings look

00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:28,600
before that's how they look after

00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:32,140
applying jungle environ so the code

00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:36,850
became clearer and more readable so

00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:40,930
please check this up several words about

00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:43,330
structure we recommend to split your

00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:45,910
settings but not by environment but by

00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:49,870
groups in this case you can

00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:53,820
differentiate it jungle third party and

00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:56,860
your custom settings and if you project

00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:59,170
will be growing you can implement each

00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:01,950
of this file as a package and split it

00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:06,400
more granularly

00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:09,459
as we all know name in variables is the

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:12,760
most hardest part of the development so

00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:15,430
this work is settings - we cannot imply

00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:17,500
on junga or third-party settings but we

00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:20,560
can follow these simple rules for our

00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:23,950
custom settings so let's give them mean

00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,750
full names use prefix with the project

00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:28,700
name for our custom settings and write

00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:31,640
descriptions so

00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:34,300
with quickly summarize keeping wire keep

00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:36,920
settings in environment don't hard-code

00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:39,830
split settings intergroup and follow

00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:42,320
naming conventions this is linked to

00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:46,200
slides and other resources also please

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:49,860
check article on our blog site thank you

00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,860
[Applause]

00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:57,530
thank you very much Alexander next

00:04:55,819 --> 00:05:01,009
speaker is Seth's if he can't jump up on

00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:03,710
stage and get ready um so I arrived in

00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:05,810
in Denmark the first time on Tuesday and

00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:07,729
on the train coming in from the airport

00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:08,900
actually had a really broke up a start

00:05:07,729 --> 00:05:10,699
of a really interesting conversation

00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:13,039
with a local who told me piece about a

00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:15,490
bit of history about a Spanish gentleman

00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:18,020
who came to live in Denmark named Juan

00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:21,410
who's come down become very very well

00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:23,449
known in in Denmark for the impact that

00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:26,150
he's had on on politics and and sort of

00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:27,889
the Danish way of life one one was just

00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:29,740
universally loved by his neighbors he

00:05:27,889 --> 00:05:33,169
was just a quiet guy lived by himself

00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:35,449
kept to himself but but but was just a

00:05:33,169 --> 00:05:37,340
model for for what a citizen should be

00:05:35,449 --> 00:05:39,380
you know came from Spain came to live in

00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:42,139
Denmark became a model a model citizen

00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:45,009
and everyone was sort of wondering how

00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:51,080
does he get to be such a good citizen

00:05:45,009 --> 00:05:54,500
are we ready do we have slides no no we

00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:55,759
still no slides yet okay um so his

00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,860
next-door neighbor I sort of found out I

00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,270
found out about about one first and came

00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:01,639
over and had a bit of a chat with him to

00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:03,560
find out what was going on and and lured

00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:06,020
said Risa this really really valuable

00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:07,729
lesson and and took it back in and

00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:10,400
started to leave his own life following

00:06:07,729 --> 00:06:11,990
the same rules and patterns that that

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,550
one had taught him in this in his really

00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:16,099
really simple conversation that had

00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:17,509
happened and and again they said the

00:06:16,099 --> 00:06:19,070
message started going all of a sudden

00:06:17,509 --> 00:06:20,810
there was two people living next door to

00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:23,509
each other that were living the best

00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:25,130
possible life and and stand everybody

00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:28,250
around the stud to notice that here are

00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:30,289
two very very happy people living the

00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:35,590
best model of what it is to be a Dane in

00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:39,190
the in the modern world still going

00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:41,840
still waiting for slides okay

00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:43,340
yes we have we have slides now all right

00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,229
so we will continue the story of one

00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:47,670
after Seth yes trove talks to us about

00:06:45,229 --> 00:06:51,880
type checking your Django thank you

00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:54,680
[Applause]

00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:57,620
hi I'm gonna talk about type shaking or

00:06:54,680 --> 00:07:03,080
Django project so if you don't know

00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:05,630
Python has type annotations added since

00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:08,420
Python 3 and you can also put them and

00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:13,910
you'd also put type annotations in your

00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:17,840
Python 2 code with some type comments my

00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:21,710
PI is a type checker you can install it

00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:25,010
and let's say you have a function and

00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:27,980
you want to annotate the the argument

00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:30,800
and return type you can call it with

00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:33,590
wrong type in this case string although

00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,960
it should be an int you get an error so

00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:38,750
that's great but what if you want to

00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:40,390
type check your Django code well there

00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:44,300
are stop files which define the

00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:47,930
interface for all sorts of Django

00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:51,410
functions classes and so on it's a

00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:53,780
project on github by Maxine Kona cough

00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:57,620
and other people who have contributed as

00:07:53,780 --> 00:08:01,240
well you can just type install it to

00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:04,430
your project so let's say I made a tango

00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:09,560
project and I want to type check it with

00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:14,270
my PI so I make a a my PI an I file and

00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:16,850
add in some options and then run it and

00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:20,980
I get this error about me some type

00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:20,980
annotation something in the settings

00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:28,220
let's see and if I add this plugin to

00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:32,000
this config the plugin comes with the

00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:35,839
the stubs it will not complain in this

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,479
plugin it does some cool magic stuff so

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:41,320
that you can actually type check some of

00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:47,260
the cool Django features like the Orem

00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:50,450
so if you try to construct some object

00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:54,050
model and it doesn't have actually the

00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:57,650
attribute your you're using it will tell

00:08:54,050 --> 00:09:00,500
you about that let's say you have a

00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:03,860
character field on your model

00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:06,620
and you try to pass it a nun but it's

00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:13,339
not nullable they will complain about

00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:17,360
that let's say you have yeah let's say

00:09:13,339 --> 00:09:19,880
you have a relation to a foreign key to

00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:23,089
a related model and you try to access

00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:25,759
that on another model and access field

00:09:23,089 --> 00:09:29,300
on that it will also be able to follow

00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:32,990
that relation and type check that field

00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:36,139
so in this case you can't add one an

00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:42,350
integer to a string its name on the

00:09:36,139 --> 00:09:47,870
publisher and finally a more complicated

00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:50,779
example if you are using this values

00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:54,560
list function to to get in this case

00:09:50,779 --> 00:09:57,430
just one value from query as your result

00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:00,740
in this case the name field of this

00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:03,589
person model then you should get a

00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:05,839
string back but because you are only

00:10:03,589 --> 00:10:09,220
asking for the first row you might get a

00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:13,240
none back if the row didn't exist so

00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:15,769
actually if you try to pass this to a

00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:18,889
function that takes a string it will

00:10:15,769 --> 00:10:21,800
complain because it might have a might

00:10:18,889 --> 00:10:26,709
actually be none and we had a strict

00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:32,720
optional setting enabled on my PI so

00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:36,620
this is very cool there are also non

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:39,199
Oram stuff these stubs there are stops

00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:41,389
for pretty much all of django but it's

00:10:39,199 --> 00:10:44,660
probably not entirely correct or

00:10:41,389 --> 00:10:51,589
incomplete because a lot of it was

00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:53,209
generated with some tools yes if you

00:10:51,589 --> 00:10:56,480
have a custom settings module you can

00:10:53,209 --> 00:11:00,829
also specify that in config file and it

00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:06,920
will understand that and you can

00:11:00,829 --> 00:11:08,660
contribute at github it's actively

00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:11,689
developed and there's also a kiddo

00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:12,740
channel and there's also a related

00:11:11,689 --> 00:11:15,110
plugin

00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:20,030
and stops if you're using Django rest

00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:23,210
framework so where to go from here

00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:25,400
yeah the project has some tests actually

00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:28,670
on type checking the Django tests itself

00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:33,980
which they don't all pass so some things

00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:36,260
ignored but if more of them pass and

00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:38,630
it's it kind of shows that it's pretty

00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:41,600
legit or at least pretty accurate and

00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:44,270
not giving false positives and you guys

00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:53,060
should try it out on your projects thank

00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:55,370
you Thank You Seth

00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:57,410
well our next speaker gets set up so one

00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:58,910
has told his next-door neighbor about

00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:00,470
this great secret and now we've got two

00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:03,350
people living there best lies the best

00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:04,550
day next finish lives they then start

00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:06,890
that people are people in the rest of

00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:08,630
the street they noticed this is going on

00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:09,770
and so they come over and say so you

00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:12,760
know what's what's what's the big secret

00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:15,650
here and they Seth and sorry Ron and the

00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:17,480
Inez neighbor both share this this one

00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:22,190
little short secret about how to live

00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:25,690
your best life and really sorry our next

00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:27,760
speaker is Francois Sugoi take it away

00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:31,250
[Applause]

00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:33,230
hey mojo hi my name is Francois Siegel

00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,850
my twitter handle is hole D it's not an

00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:37,670
engineer Esther and Liverpool in case

00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:41,180
you see some mentions I work at pulley

00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:44,110
con say when Paris company which among

00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:48,140
other things we make information systems

00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:49,910
behind electric vehicle charging and car

00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:54,650
sharing systems such as sauce London and

00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:57,350
blue la in Los Angeles so switch

00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:58,550
carriers actually a year ago I've been

00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:00,620
working at pretty cool site for six

00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:02,990
months and my mission at the moment is

00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:06,020
how to implement privacy by defaults in

00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:09,080
an existing jungle app so we have a

00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:10,790
million lines of code approximately so I

00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:13,700
couldn't afford to do it by hand and

00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:17,090
manually I'm not crazy and I'm very lazy

00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:20,660
so also if I missed anything that could

00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:23,210
cause a very bad personal data leak so

00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:25,880
I'll take an example in logs for example

00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:26,540
we what if we logged something very

00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:30,050
badly

00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:32,060
the customer would edit their details so

00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:33,560
we have an email address we have a phone

00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:36,500
number

00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:38,480
birth dates some additional details what

00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:40,400
we wanted what some something with

00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:43,910
redacted values something that would be

00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:47,690
anonymized op student pseudonym eyes so

00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:50,810
the solution we came to was for instance

00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:52,970
an example with strings have a variable

00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:56,180
that is a name it's a string the value

00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:58,610
is jean-michel it's very French and what

00:13:56,180 --> 00:14:01,250
we do is we wrap it we give it an

00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:03,440
alternative value and it turns it into a

00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:07,670
different object that has an original

00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:11,900
value John Michell and an alternate

00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:14,300
value which is redacted so what we do

00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:19,330
then is we wrap the color balls for

00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:22,730
instance if I want to print the name the

00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:25,490
object will called the danjo STR method

00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:28,520
and this method the method has been

00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:30,500
redefined to check the context am I

00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:33,470
supposed to show the original value our

00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:35,150
show native value if it's supposed to be

00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:39,110
redacted and I return redacted and of

00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:42,410
course if not return John Michell so

00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:45,380
next for the fields in the database we

00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:46,790
have a lot of customers so we have for

00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:48,920
instance a table with the type of vodka

00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:52,940
which one is Shayla and have this new

00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:55,550
field now so I need to should you define

00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:58,280
an you mix in and this mixing just

00:14:55,550 --> 00:15:00,950
redefines two methods from DB value so

00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:04,610
from the database we wrap the value and

00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:08,000
the pre save methods that unwraps the

00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:10,670
value from the field to the database we

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:15,260
also have a model mixing we just really

00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:16,490
find the set the new method set at to

00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:18,860
grab the value of fields that contain

00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:21,050
personal data so if I do consumer that

00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:23,180
name equals John Michell this is the

00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:25,820
method that's called and to help with

00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:27,770
all that to context decorators

00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:29,720
so it's both the decorator and the

00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:32,600
context manager at the same time Hyde

00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:35,720
personal data and show personal data and

00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:38,450
we can implicate them so remember we are

00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:40,100
deluxe at the beginning so very quick

00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:42,199
recap about logging have

00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:45,620
I said I have a level I give it to my

00:15:42,199 --> 00:15:48,110
Python object the lager and we had which

00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:50,540
has several handlers maybe the handle

00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:53,449
can be locked to a file or to the

00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:56,449
console or send an email whatever and I

00:15:53,449 --> 00:15:58,310
can add a formatter so what I do is when

00:15:56,449 --> 00:16:01,220
I don't want to show the personal data I

00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:03,230
just choose a decorator on the formatter

00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:05,050
if I for some reason want to show the

00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:08,720
personal dialog and uses the other

00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:12,920
decorator and this is how I can obtain

00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:15,050
this very nice redacted vlog so what are

00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:17,209
the next step obviously this is very

00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:19,579
very very simplified there's room for

00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:25,279
improvement and the next step is of

00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:28,959
course open sourcing I'll I still have

00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:33,529
one minute so as a bonus also we have

00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:36,290
custom template tags how do we do that

00:16:33,529 --> 00:16:38,810
in the template nodes we check a

00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:42,589
permission to see if we can if we should

00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:45,170
show a heart the value and this is

00:16:42,589 --> 00:16:48,139
template that can be used with filters

00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:51,259
so for instance I can I can do a hello

00:16:48,139 --> 00:16:54,740
with a customer name I just need to give

00:16:51,259 --> 00:16:56,029
it the guest of the variable with a

00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:58,360
filter in this case and upper case

00:16:56,029 --> 00:16:59,509
filter and give it the permission the

00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:02,779
condition

00:16:59,509 --> 00:17:06,679
I also works with a form and I can just

00:17:02,779 --> 00:17:09,140
add the bootstrap filter if I want to if

00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:12,740
you don't know what GDP is it's a little

00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:15,650
late but but there was an amazing talk

00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:17,329
last year I drunk when you up 2018 it

00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:18,770
was by will Hardy it was called

00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:22,130
protecting personal data with Django

00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:23,849
because it's the law and this is for me

00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:26,999
hopefully thank you

00:17:23,849 --> 00:17:26,999
[Applause]

00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:33,230
Thank You Francois bonus points for

00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:34,870
having a hyphen in someone's name I like

00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:38,270
it

00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:39,380
alright so if one has converted his

00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:41,600
entire streak and taught the entire

00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:43,190
street about this this simple message

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,540
about how to live your best life and it

00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:45,710
doesn't take long before when something

00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:49,100
like that happens that the government

00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:50,570
finds out and so the local the local

00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:52,040
city found out about it and they were

00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:53,360
interested in finding out that this

00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,530
message will find out a little bit more

00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,600
about that after Sasha romaine

00:17:54,530 --> 00:18:03,950
introduces us to a different secret

00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:05,420
take it away Sasha thank you so if

00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:07,910
you've seen me around or if you've been

00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:09,380
to more general Khan's you may have seen

00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:11,210
me hand out these delicious little

00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:13,880
cookies called straw baffles I bring

00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:16,940
them from Amsterdam they're like two

00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:18,650
waffles with some gooey sweet syrup in

00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:20,990
between very tasty

00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:23,150
I've been doing this for a long time I

00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:25,820
can bring them to general Khan for years

00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:28,850
at least so far I've been involved in

00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:32,900
handing out about 56 kilograms of these

00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:35,720
cookies of which 16 kilo of sugar so

00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:37,850
I've contributed about 255 million

00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:40,130
calories of straw pathol to open-source

00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:43,160
communities this is enough for an adult

00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:47,179
to live on for six months but you would

00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:49,760
not feel well and then there's also the

00:18:47,179 --> 00:18:53,630
secret society of the straw powerful

00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:55,640
which started some years ago and you can

00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:57,440
actually become a member there's a small

00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:00,830
initiation ritual and then you can get

00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:02,630
your hand stamped with our logo the

00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:03,830
secret is I don't actually know how many

00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:06,170
members there are because the stamp

00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:11,059
fades after day so I can't keep track I

00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:13,040
think we have about 300 and why am i

00:19:11,059 --> 00:19:14,630
doing all of this like when I meet new

00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:16,070
people here also they asked like you

00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:18,950
know what is the deal with the slow

00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:22,670
paths in the jungle community and I do

00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:24,920
it because it's just really fun because

00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:26,120
like you know when I meet people for the

00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,920
first time sometimes they're initially

00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:29,840
little where you like strange person

00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:31,790
from Amsterdam handing out some food

00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:35,240
I get asked a lot where there's weed in

00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:37,070
it and you know people who know me they

00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,480
sometimes get really enthusiastic like

00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:42,110
I've had people run down the hallway

00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:45,440
when they saw me again to ask with

00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:48,020
I brought any straw petals and so the

00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,630
fun is mainly in like how enthusiastic

00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:53,540
people get about this because these

00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:56,890
cookies cost me about six cents so you

00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:59,510
know it's not like a major effort and

00:19:56,890 --> 00:20:01,250
basically the reason is for me like it's

00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:03,080
not just about the cookie or I don't

00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:06,380
think it's just about the cookie for

00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:08,270
these people it is also bringing them a

00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:10,549
little bit of happiness it's a random

00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:14,150
gesture of kindness even though it's

00:20:10,549 --> 00:20:16,400
small and that matters to people so in a

00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:18,950
way the secret society of the straw

00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:22,190
powerful is actually the secret society

00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:24,890
of happiness and when we think about

00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:26,540
happiness we often talk about we say

00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:28,850
often think about very big things about

00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:31,160
your life partners about getting married

00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:33,860
about children about moving to a

00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:35,240
different country and if you recognize

00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:38,679
the colors on my shirt you'll know I

00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:41,360
know some things about big changes but

00:20:38,679 --> 00:20:44,720
we often tend to forget how it can also

00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:47,120
come from really tiny things that really

00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:49,580
small acts of kindness small gestures

00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:51,710
can make a really big difference they

00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:54,559
can make someone feel better after

00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:57,049
they've had a bad day or or something

00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:59,809
happened or it is not not feeling so

00:20:57,049 --> 00:21:05,780
well small things can add up for them

00:20:59,809 --> 00:21:07,460
and one of the ways in which you can

00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:09,740
contribute to this is a project Mikey

00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:11,900
mentioned earlier open-source happiness

00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:14,000
packets which is basically a platform

00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:16,520
where we try to get people mainly an

00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,280
open source to say nice things to each

00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:20,570
other so if you saw a talk from a

00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:23,000
speaker that you liked or you had a

00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:24,440
conversation with someone that that make

00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,840
you feel good or you learn something or

00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:29,570
cheered you up then you can send them

00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:31,460
happiness packets we've had 900 30 cents

00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:37,070
since we first launched this in Budapest

00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:39,530
and a lot of them are public also and so

00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:41,929
some of my favorites include it is

00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:43,790
people like you that make me truly happy

00:21:41,929 --> 00:21:47,270
to be involved in open-source these are

00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:49,070
public with permission and you all

00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:51,080
deserve way more praise and accolades

00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:55,870
then I can possibly give and there are

00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:58,850
another hundred public on the website so

00:21:55,870 --> 00:22:00,350
we've had 930 sent and there are enough

00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:04,370
people here that I'm sure we could get

00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:06,530
to a thousand I'm sure there are a lot

00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:07,940
of people here who've met someone that

00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:09,500
they appreciate that something that

00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:11,740
somebody did for them maybe those comers

00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:15,410
organizer maybe a speaker or volunteer

00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:17,540
anyone really but also like happiness

00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:21,500
packets are not the only way there are

00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:23,240
so many small acts that we can do that

00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:25,250
maybe we don't even think about so much

00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:28,370
ourselves that don't take so much effort

00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:30,590
but they can make a big difference to

00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:32,810
everyone else to someone else I don't

00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:35,150
all start bringing unhealthy foods

00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:38,570
because that doesn't skill but there are

00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:40,250
many ways so my name is Sasha I've been

00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:42,560
called the monarch of strong powerful

00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:44,820
based happiness please join the secret

00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:51,960
society of happiness

00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:55,030
[Applause]

00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:58,000
Thank You Sasha while our next speakers

00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:59,770
get set up so one has been been called

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,539
on by the state go by by these local

00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:03,130
city government they've invited him into

00:23:01,539 --> 00:23:04,900
a meeting one goes into this meeting so

00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:07,000
that he can help share this message

00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:09,100
about how he lives his best life that a

00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,659
message that he shared with his his

00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:12,610
neighbors and the and the rest of the

00:23:10,659 --> 00:23:14,020
people on his Street and the the

00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:15,010
government's really really interested

00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:16,990
about this and wants to expand the

00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:19,330
program we'll find out more about what

00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:21,580
they did after Karina and Jessica talk

00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:22,720
to us about pine and scholars good

00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:25,320
afternoon everyone

00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:28,150
[Applause]

00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:30,340
so my name is Jessica and I want to talk

00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:32,049
to you about when I'm skolas Panem

00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:36,039
scholars is a subgroup of the python a

00:23:32,049 --> 00:23:39,940
Mebius society and they are Python

00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:41,260
coding clubs in high schools okay so one

00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:43,030
of the things that we have always been

00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:44,770
struggling with is computer so this

00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:48,429
picture was taken at one of our Friday

00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:50,230
classes we have to our classes on every

00:23:48,429 --> 00:23:52,720
Friday except for when it school holiday

00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:54,100
or when the kids are going home so we

00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:57,340
have always struggled with computers I

00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:58,900
suggest sit and we have done plenty of

00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:03,870
things to overcome this or be able to

00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:06,789
practice even without computers so um

00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:08,230
what I want to say that I have not

00:24:06,789 --> 00:24:13,900
really said in a lot of talks that I

00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:15,520
have had is to think the Cardiff the

00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:17,740
Cardiff University because they have

00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,299
always when they have a representative

00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:21,280
coming to pack or Namibia they've always

00:24:19,299 --> 00:24:25,059
brought at least one computer that they

00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:27,010
are not using so that's one of the the

00:24:25,059 --> 00:24:29,169
computers that we are using there so we

00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:31,450
share them we have for now and we share

00:24:29,169 --> 00:24:33,429
them some break and so forth but

00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:37,590
currently we're four that are working so

00:24:33,429 --> 00:24:37,590
I want to send them a special thank you

00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:44,260
so one of the things that we do is what

00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:46,210
we call computer day I spoken a lot

00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:48,850
about this or extensively about this is

00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:51,280
it's jamoke on Europe 2018 so if you

00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:53,679
want to know how we do it and know in

00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:57,640
depth about it you can watch the video

00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:59,470
online on YouTube so what what we have

00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:01,539
been trying to do this year what we are

00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:02,810
trying to plan to do is that we extend

00:25:01,539 --> 00:25:06,410
it to be

00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:08,780
a six-day training instead of just a

00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:10,280
two-day conference because we have had

00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:11,930
schools from villages that join the

00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:14,270
society and we don't want them to come

00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:16,400
all the way just to come for a two-day

00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:18,770
conference so we want to change it and

00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:21,290
extend it for six days so if you want to

00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:24,080
be involved in terms of coming to be a

00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:25,640
mentor or a tutor or teach about

00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,650
something in Python we are more than

00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:32,690
happy to have you on their team and

00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:34,370
collaborate with you yeah so we have had

00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:36,530
six schools now this year that joined

00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:38,870
the Society so we are quite happy about

00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:41,510
that and that's one of the schools in

00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:43,520
the north and that's what happened after

00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:45,530
we drove 13 hours to go to that school

00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:48,230
so that's what we want to extend

00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:50,690
computer day to be a six days thing

00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:52,280
instead of just two days right so one of

00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:54,410
the things that happened this year is

00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:57,040
also that we had we do an or we

00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:58,670
finalized a partnership with NS do an

00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:01,730
ASB Hamburg

00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:05,540
so NS do is they may be a stand

00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:09,500
development organization so they give

00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:14,050
mattresses school desks used computers

00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:16,700
from that I donated by ASB Hamburg and I

00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:18,470
heard about them through a I've been a

00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:20,060
teacher for three years and I had about

00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:21,530
them through a parent because I was

00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:23,030
always complaining about the lack of

00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:24,590
computers at the school and things like

00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:27,350
that and then she introduced me to this

00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:29,660
guy so when I spoke to him he told me no

00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:31,220
we give computers to primary schools and

00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:32,990
we give computers to schools that are

00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:36,380
dominated by the son community because

00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:37,940
they are marginalised and so after a few

00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:39,860
meetings I convinced him to give

00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:41,620
computers to schools that are not

00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:44,750
dominated by the son community and

00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:46,820
secondary schools so this year we had

00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:51,470
our final meeting and we made the ASB

00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:53,240
Hamburg group and we are now going to

00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:56,450
receive computers from them so they are

00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:58,880
going to be let's say giving a full

00:26:56,450 --> 00:27:01,490
computer lab with like 20 computers to

00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:04,760
high school and then we give them like

00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:05,990
an amount of money to help them cover

00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:11,500
the costs that they incur when the

00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:14,630
computers come so Namibia has about

00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:16,550
1,000 they have more than 1,700 schools

00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:19,910
so we have a long way to go there

00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:22,190
not going to help so we have had a

00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:23,900
couple of things that we also tried to

00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:27,380
do that we've been doing to try and

00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:29,240
raise funds and Carina will be talking

00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:32,030
to you a little bit more about that I

00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:34,190
met her at yellow corn Europe 2018 and

00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:36,110
she has helped me especially with the

00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:38,090
emotional whirring of things and things

00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:44,570
like that so she's going to talk to you

00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:46,430
a little bit more about hay ideas hello

00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:52,340
I'm going to talk more about the ways

00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:58,820
that we could help to contribute well

00:27:52,340 --> 00:28:02,060
there is a patreon link problem we will

00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:05,750
post it this on slack also and you can

00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:10,970
donate directly and on the Left link but

00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:13,700
also you could could get more creative

00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:15,260
ways to find more creative ways to to do

00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:20,330
this for example

00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:23,390
well I myself I pledge to give a free

00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:29,810
one day beginner lesson for three people

00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:32,720
who in London good so you can but you

00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:34,580
you can also do this the same but me but

00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:38,620
something different like guitar lesson

00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:42,530
or you could make a pledge jangle cornea

00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:45,800
jungle pony or maybe you have some other

00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:51,410
ideas to give us rewards for other

00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:53,740
people who beneath to this project thank

00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:53,740
you very much

00:28:56,999 --> 00:29:02,649
okay so we have one last speaker this is

00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:04,210
the the local city government has found

00:29:02,649 --> 00:29:05,860
out about one they've they've met with

00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:07,389
one they've come up with a grand plan

00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:09,279
fact you know we can we can do this this

00:29:07,389 --> 00:29:11,350
is actually quite a simple thing to do

00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:13,210
and but unfortunately before they

00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:15,429
actually got to the point where they

00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:19,119
were able to deploy this this grand plan

00:29:15,429 --> 00:29:22,389
out one was abducted and they and the

00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:24,129
abductors took him out to a golf course

00:29:22,389 --> 00:29:26,619
and there in the middle of the golf

00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:29,019
course and there was they were trying to

00:29:26,619 --> 00:29:30,639
stop him because they didn't want the

00:29:29,019 --> 00:29:32,919
whole society to change they were like

00:29:30,639 --> 00:29:34,570
they like things the way they were and

00:29:32,919 --> 00:29:36,249
there was you know there was a it was

00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:38,080
tense they were there was a there was

00:29:36,249 --> 00:29:39,909
yelling was a very nice guy very calm

00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:42,909
guy obviously you know living his best

00:29:39,909 --> 00:29:44,619
Danish life and there was this there was

00:29:42,909 --> 00:29:46,960
a struggle and unfortunately one was

00:29:44,619 --> 00:29:48,820
shot and I will find out what happened

00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:56,799
after that after we have Christopher you

00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:59,649
know it's hi I'm Chris you can find me

00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:02,200
on github and Twitter with my handle at

00:29:59,649 --> 00:30:04,090
Pune which I'm currently working at

00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,799
black dough I'm a senior software

00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:07,240
developer and had to force her office

00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:11,049
and I'm going to talk you really quickly

00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:13,299
about keeping a request white state in

00:30:11,049 --> 00:30:15,460
Django and that's not to be confused

00:30:13,299 --> 00:30:16,360
with global state because global state

00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:20,080
is very bad

00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:21,970
it lacks isolation you can like pretty

00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:24,999
much anything to another request so for

00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:26,919
example user data and the Django try is

00:30:24,999 --> 00:30:29,789
really hard to get rid of pretty much

00:30:26,919 --> 00:30:33,399
all instances of global state that are

00:30:29,789 --> 00:30:37,450
still terror and we should be striving

00:30:33,399 --> 00:30:39,789
to do as well in our applications an

00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:42,100
example of frequency at state is for

00:30:39,789 --> 00:30:46,149
example internationalization in Django

00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:48,369
so whenever we use the I 18 and the

00:30:46,149 --> 00:30:51,129
framework which includes also the in the

00:30:48,369 --> 00:30:53,350
middle were were actually not passing

00:30:51,129 --> 00:30:57,159
around the language around we keep that

00:30:53,350 --> 00:31:01,149
in something that's called thread-local

00:30:57,159 --> 00:31:04,059
storage and as a matter of fact doesn't

00:31:01,149 --> 00:31:07,509
have any magic involved it's just using

00:31:04,059 --> 00:31:08,320
common patent construct in such a way

00:31:07,509 --> 00:31:10,870
that allows us

00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:13,120
to obtain and release the data from any

00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:18,399
point our application including library

00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:23,019
code at any point in in a request cycle

00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:26,820
so our really quick code example is we

00:31:23,019 --> 00:31:30,490
can have a state file which just uses

00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:36,370
one simple import and a pair of getter

00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:38,740
and setter and we can use that from from

00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:42,100
middleware to set the object at the

00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:43,600
beginning of a request and then reset it

00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:45,190
at the end of their the request that's

00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:52,269
fairly important because we don't want

00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:56,340
to lick the data to later request and at

00:31:52,269 --> 00:32:00,220
any point after this middleware runs and

00:31:56,340 --> 00:32:04,960
before it returns we can access the data

00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:08,909
so you can put anything you need in the

00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:12,240
application for example library code or

00:32:08,909 --> 00:32:14,909
some custom code related to location and

00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:17,470
geographical bindings for example or

00:32:14,909 --> 00:32:19,389
maybe you want to keep the request

00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:25,779
itself as as in this example for

00:32:19,389 --> 00:32:29,769
debugging purposes M and you need to use

00:32:25,779 --> 00:32:34,149
it with caution please don't don't abuse

00:32:29,769 --> 00:32:38,620
that you generally still want to pass

00:32:34,149 --> 00:32:40,450
variables around like in normal like any

00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:42,429
responsible programmer would do that is

00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:44,080
pretty much still a global state but

00:32:42,429 --> 00:32:46,269
it's bound to a one request

00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:50,649
so you just solve some issues with

00:32:46,269 --> 00:32:53,230
isolation but it's still a bit messy and

00:32:50,649 --> 00:32:54,730
indirect way it just helps resolve some

00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:56,649
issues okay so that's it

00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:59,399
I think we have two moments left it was

00:32:56,649 --> 00:32:59,399
