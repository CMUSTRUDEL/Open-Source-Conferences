	00:00:04,279 --> 00:00:08,790
to be honest I'm most anxious about this

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,769
microphone because I went to a

00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:12,809
conference and spoke and when I saw the

00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:15,000
video the headset was sticking out of

00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:16,440
the top of my head like that and it

00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,119
looked perfectly absurd so I'm hoping

00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:25,260
that you don't thank you very much so

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:26,789
yeah identity and nothingness in Python

00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,490
and Django but before I say anything

00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:31,349
else I would say thank you for for being

00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:34,020
here at Django con Europe is really a

00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:37,230
wonderful thing and I'm very happy to be

00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:39,600
part of it once again and thanks to

00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:41,700
everyone who's being a part of the team

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,770
that has put this together the

00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,860
discussions about this Chango con

00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:49,230
started in Heidelberg last year at the

00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:52,079
last django con where I met Benjamin and

00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:54,449
Emil and we first talked about the

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,360
possibility of a Danish Django con

00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:59,699
Europe so what you're what you've been

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,489
enjoying this week is the result of the

00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:05,189
year's work and so please have special

00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:06,750
thank you to Benjamin and Emil and all

00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:09,740
the team and we're very grateful for

00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,740
everything that you've done

00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:22,470
that's me that's my favorite photos you

00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:24,840
can get in contact with me by email I

00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:26,690
sometimes bother to look at Twitter but

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,700
honestly it's possibly the worst

00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:31,740
imaginable way of that human beings are

00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:39,060
found to communicate with each other so

00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:42,090
I don't use it very much I am a django

00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:44,820
core developer I should point out that I

00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:45,990
am an ex vice president of the Django

00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,729
Software Foundation I'm not doing that

00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:49,500
anymore I did it for three years it was

00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:50,880
very enjoyable but I'm afraid it's no

00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,960
longer my responsibility I should

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,840
mention that with so many people have

00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:57,950
talked to me about it today I work for

00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,700
Divya many of you know DVO we are

00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:02,940
sponsoring the conference we're

00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:07,049
sponsoring the speech-to-text as we've

00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:10,080
done for for several years which is a

00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:11,850
really nice part of this event thank you

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,360
Cheryl and junior back there for all

00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:14,360
your typing

00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:28,000
and at devio what we do is we have a

00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:30,100
cloud platform for Python and Django

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,140
hosting so the idea is that you're an

00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:34,720
application developer and that's what

00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:36,490
you like doing and so you give your

00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,170
applications to us to run so that you

00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:42,640
don't have to worry about them so it's

00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:46,030
like you sleep while we drive and I'm

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:48,670
doing a workshop tomorrow it should have

00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:52,270
been on Wednesday but for personal

00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:54,910
reasons I couldn't be here in time but I

00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:56,290
never wanted to do DevOps which is for

00:02:54,910 --> 00:03:00,880
application developers who are

00:02:56,290 --> 00:03:03,010
interested in exploring cloud deployment

00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:05,500
things like darker and containerization

00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:08,110
and questions of maybe code portability

00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:10,840
that haven't occurred before that will

00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:12,130
be on Saturday at 12 o'clock so it'll be

00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,990
quite an introductory thing but it's

00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:15,460
hands on I can hear a bit of noise as I

00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:16,750
move around so I'm sorry for this noise

00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:18,520
from the microphone is disturbing you

00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:20,110
but I thought suppose there's anything

00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:22,180
we can do about that oh and the other

00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:25,540
thing that's really important to me is

00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:29,320
my involvement in the african python

00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:32,560
communities and their events and at this

00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:37,420
changuk on we've got attendees from

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:38,800
Namibia Uganda Kenya Nigeria Ghana maybe

00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:41,440
there are others but I didn't meet them

00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:45,250
I've never met so many African attendees

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:48,250
before at a django con so take this

00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:49,840
opportunity to speak to them find out

00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:53,250
about Python and Django in their

00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:56,530
countries and perhaps visit one of those

00:03:53,250 --> 00:04:00,220
events too so wild horses wouldn't

00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:03,460
prevent me from going to the first

00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:07,060
African PyCon so please take a look at

00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:09,409
that right

00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:11,870
I'm so sorry about this noise I'm not

00:04:09,409 --> 00:04:21,769
sure what it's banging against make my

00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:24,229
skull I think the banging is coming from

00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:27,620
me but I'm not sure we can do so anyway

00:04:24,229 --> 00:04:30,470
this is a 16th century fresco in the

00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:32,990
Apostolic Palace in the Vatican and it

00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:36,139
depicts mainly thinkers and scholars

00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:40,400
scholars and thinkers mainly from

00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:44,620
antiquity it's by Raphael and if we zoom

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:46,460
into the centre here at the centre are

00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:48,380
by the way also at the centre of

00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:53,300
attention as you can see they are Plato

00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:55,250
and Aristotle Aristotle who was Plato's

00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:57,410
most famous pupil and like all good

00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:59,780
pupils felt obliged not just to learn

00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:03,530
from his teacher but to respond to him

00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:05,229
too and we have Plato pointing towards

00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:09,470
the heavens in reference to a world

00:05:05,229 --> 00:05:11,479
outside space and time one belonging to

00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:13,310
the pure forms that the things in our

00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:16,849
material world are just kinds of shadowy

00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:19,190
copies of and Aristotle is answering him

00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:21,320
and he's pointing down to the material

00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:25,300
world because he argues that form only

00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:28,010
exists as the form of substance and that

00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:30,800
knowledge and truth require us to

00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:32,810
generalize from the concrete in the

00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,500
particular so we abstract from the

00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:40,250
particular and these two directions of

00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:43,190
thought represent the most the single

00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:46,700
most important axis in Western

00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:50,900
philosophy which do we reach for or turn

00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:52,310
to first to universal truths and ideals

00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:55,280
that lie beyond the world of the senses

00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:57,200
or to the actual world that presents it

00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,770
to us it presents itself to us at our

00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,930
feet

00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:03,110
now you can't imagine that you can

00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:05,750
reduce Plato and Aristotle to such a a

00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:08,449
simple dichotomy it's much more subtle

00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:10,900
and complex than that but still this

00:06:08,449 --> 00:06:15,169
difference represents two different

00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:17,360
directions of thought and you don't need

00:06:15,169 --> 00:06:19,880
to be a student of philosophy to to

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,810
recognize them and people generally

00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,940
recognize

00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:24,710
themselves some of you will will do this

00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:26,690
you'll have intellectual sympathies

00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:29,510
already right now that generally

00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:32,210
resonate with Plato's and some will find

00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:38,150
themselves more by inclination inclined

00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:40,790
to the to the Aristotelian this doesn't

00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:42,560
mean that people are play tennis or

00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:44,180
Aristotelian Zoar that they do or don't

00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,430
believe in a world of universal pure

00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:49,760
forms but that generally speaking they

00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:53,229
find themselves inclined to prefer a

00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:56,030
certain direction or way of thinking and

00:06:53,229 --> 00:06:58,040
you can use the axis represented by

00:06:56,030 --> 00:07:00,050
these two different directions as a key

00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:02,270
to understanding the history of Western

00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:05,210
philosophy over the last 25 centuries

00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:07,070
and we're going to come back to this so

00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:08,900
when I started learning Python which was

00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:10,700
10 years ago this month I had a very

00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:12,620
memorable experience it was a five-day

00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:15,320
introduction to Python and Django and we

00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:16,700
were given a handbook and as you can see

00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,350
I lived in that handbook for years

00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,850
afterwards it was literally always open

00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:21,710
on my desk beside me and every page

00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:23,389
looked like that because that became the

00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:25,760
place where I put down my coffee cup and

00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:26,900
I took it at home one evening in that

00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,970
very first week and I showed it to my

00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:31,610
girlfriend Carol and she lived through

00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:35,060
it and then she exclaimed functions

00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:37,760
classes and attributes its Aristotle and

00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:39,470
in his ethics Aristotle is concerned

00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:42,979
with virtue he argues that the defining

00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:45,289
human function is rational activity and

00:07:42,979 --> 00:07:48,380
he's very interested in the relationship

00:07:45,289 --> 00:07:51,260
between what a being is and what a being

00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:52,760
does and I mentioned this to the person

00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:55,610
who's giving us at our training the next

00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:57,410
day his name was in Millington whom some

00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:59,539
of you may actually know and it turned

00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:01,039
out that as well as having a earned a

00:07:59,539 --> 00:08:03,919
doctorate in the field of artificial

00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:05,930
intelligence his first degree was in

00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:08,180
theology and so he was familiar with

00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:10,430
these ideas we had three of my

00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:12,020
colleagues in the room with us and Ian

00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:13,880
and I were animatedly discussing

00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:16,070
Aristotle and reason and Python

00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:18,470
functions and the human soul and after

00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:22,130
enduring a few minutes of this one of my

00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:24,410
colleagues announced I'm a creationist

00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:27,130
and this talk about functions and reason

00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:31,159
is making me feel very uncomfortable

00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:32,990
which I wasn't expecting him to say so I

00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:34,330
was completely puzzled and not entirely

00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:37,390
sure whether he was teasing

00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:41,050
the joke or if I'd misheard and I asked

00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:44,529
him I'm what about it made him feel

00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:46,300
uneasy and my colleague Ben said you

00:08:44,529 --> 00:08:49,000
needn't look so surprised I'm a

00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:50,140
creationist too at this point my mouth

00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,940
was hanging off in a minute I don't

00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:54,430
think I look very intelligence and then

00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:55,029
my third colleague said Daniella you're

00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:58,660
outnumbered

00:08:55,029 --> 00:09:00,370
I'm also creationist so I was a little

00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:03,190
bit stunned and there were so many

00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:06,220
things I wanted to ask like should we

00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:09,399
accept Aristotle's account of virtue as

00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:11,649
a disposition or what do you make of

00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:15,060
Aristotle's conception of function as

00:09:11,649 --> 00:09:17,529
defining activity rather than purpose or

00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:20,019
do you identify a contradiction between

00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:21,790
Aristotle's form substance dualism and a

00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:22,750
creationist account of the soul so all

00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:24,760
these things were going around in my

00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:27,220
head in quick succession but the only

00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:29,110
one that formulated itself into anything

00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:35,850
resembling an actual coherent sentence

00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:35,850
was what about the dinosaurs and

00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:42,399
fortunately fortunately I didn't

00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:44,079
actually blurt that out and if there's

00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,290
one thing I've learned in life it's to

00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:49,329
recognize when I'm outnumbered so I as

00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:51,220
intrigued as I was I didn't pursue the

00:09:49,329 --> 00:09:53,260
question but I've never forgotten that

00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:55,120
experience and I marveled at how quickly

00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:56,950
we got from basic concepts in

00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,230
programming to ideas and metaphysics in

00:09:56,950 --> 00:10:01,810
them and ontology that weren't only

00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:03,520
important to academic philosophers for

00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:05,290
example but also resonate with people

00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:07,930
who had not studied philosophy or

00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:11,709
theology and those ideas had the power

00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:13,029
to shake people and shaking people is

00:10:11,709 --> 00:10:15,510
exactly what important philosophical

00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:17,949
content concepts tend to do

00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:20,620
philosophical concepts are literally at

00:10:17,949 --> 00:10:22,930
work they literally expressed in program

00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:25,329
programming itself we find them

00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:27,490
expressed in code and we work with them

00:10:25,329 --> 00:10:31,149
when we think and talk about our code

00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:33,220
and this has become more obvious the

00:10:31,149 --> 00:10:35,740
more I see of it how deeply embedded in

00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:37,570
programming these ideas are obviously

00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:39,040
logic is a branch of philosophy and

00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:41,470
programming is putting together

00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,209
sequences of logical operations but as

00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:46,450
the experience with Aristotle and

00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:54,310
functions suggests maybe it's deeper and

00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:55,990
more interesting than that now for a

00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:59,410
programming beginner like me

00:10:55,990 --> 00:11:01,030
this connection gave me something quite

00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:02,980
useful to hold on to a way into

00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:04,690
understanding programming concepts

00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:07,330
through things I was already familiar

00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:09,010
with I already knew my way around things

00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:10,840
like attributes and ontology and

00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:13,960
identity and truth and nothingness and

00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:17,320
so on around types and instances and

00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:19,810
abstract classes not because I knew they

00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:21,370
were necessarily because these things

00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:22,990
are contested and troublesome in

00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:24,130
philosophy whereas in programming at

00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:26,950
least something's gone to the trouble of

00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:29,260
defining them very strictly for you but

00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:31,450
they were things that I was used to

00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:34,930
tangling with I was on familiar

00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:37,480
territory and another thing I really

00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:39,250
enjoyed with the declarations about

00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:42,210
programming which seemed often very

00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:44,590
mysterious and poetic my handbook said

00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:48,420
functions are first-class values

00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:50,730
it said values have type variables don't

00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:53,200
and it reminded me of Vic and Stein

00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:53,650
truth functions can be arranged in

00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,400
series

00:11:53,650 --> 00:12:00,040
what can't existence is not a predicate

00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:01,780
I really couldn't judge whether these

00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,910
declarations were true or what their

00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:05,500
implications were and I wasn't sure what

00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:07,570
kind of things they were were they

00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:09,820
axioms or necessary truths or

00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:11,560
discoveries but I could tell they seemed

00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:14,050
to be significant significant

00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:16,780
declarations about something important

00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:18,910
and reading statements like these about

00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:20,680
- reminding me or the feeling I had when

00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:22,510
I was first studying philosophy and

00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:24,010
encountering things like this in

00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:25,810
philosophy and I couldn't judge

00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:27,670
necessarily whether these statements

00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:30,550
were true or false but they seemed

00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:32,890
really strongly to lie upon a line of

00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:34,330
truth it seemed to matter whether they

00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:36,430
were going to turn out to be true or not

00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:38,320
and they were often things that I didn't

00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:40,390
understand the first time or the 20th

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,280
time I read them but I felt that they

00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:44,830
demanded that I come back to them again

00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:47,220
and again until I did and the same with

00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:49,630
the things like that that I read about

00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:52,510
Python and when you find an idea that

00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:54,010
seems to lie upon a line of truth you

00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:56,890
feel an obligation to follow it and

00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:59,740
explore it and find out more about it

00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:00,100
for yourself sometimes these statements

00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:03,610
had the bed

00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:06,040
if it of making me feel superior Python

00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:08,050
my handbook said correctly distinguishes

00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:11,740
between an initializer and a constructor

00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:13,630
many languages like Java conflate the

00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:16,810
two incorrectly calling this a

00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:18,370
constructor now you can only imagine the

00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:20,410
pity and scorn I felt for those who

00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:23,380
might conflate a constructor with an

00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:25,720
init and initializer and I had literally

00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:27,279
no idea what a constructor might be but

00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:33,759
I knew that I would never be so cautious

00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:35,560
to confuse it with an initializer and in

00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:36,940
just the same way I enjoyed a kind of

00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:40,120
superior feeling and philosophy

00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:41,709
sometimes here's Kent criticizing the

00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:44,410
resort to philosophers all arguments

00:13:41,709 --> 00:13:46,810
that appeal to common sense as a defiant

00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:51,519
were a convenient way of being defiant

00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:53,740
without any insight so I will take any

00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:56,139
opportunity to feel a bit superior even

00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:58,949
if it's on the basis of no more merit

00:13:56,139 --> 00:14:03,069
than having chosen a good side to be on

00:13:58,949 --> 00:14:04,689
now when I started my programming I kept

00:14:03,069 --> 00:14:06,370
running into surprises that were not

00:14:04,689 --> 00:14:08,470
unlike the problems that philosophers

00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:10,509
find themselves with when they start to

00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:13,750
do things with apparently simple

00:14:10,509 --> 00:14:16,000
concepts for example even a child learns

00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:21,339
to use the word nothing with confidence

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:23,740
very early on and we use the word and

00:14:21,339 --> 00:14:25,329
concept a dozen times a day not just in

00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:27,160
speech but in the thinking that

00:14:25,329 --> 00:14:27,670
represents and orders the world around

00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,740
us

00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:32,589
and we do it without without hesitation

00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:34,839
or doubt and just as in philosophy

00:14:32,589 --> 00:14:37,089
nothing starts look more troublesome

00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:38,709
when we peer at it more closely the

00:14:37,089 --> 00:14:42,430
programmer who has to deal with nothing

00:14:38,709 --> 00:14:44,439
runs into similar complications one of

00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:46,269
the first things I learned to do was how

00:14:44,439 --> 00:14:48,490
to check for nothingness as a programmer

00:14:46,269 --> 00:14:49,810
and all of a sudden it was a marvel how

00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:51,550
many different kinds of nothingness

00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:55,240
there were how many different kinds of

00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:57,430
absences or something could exist there

00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:59,079
was none and there was zero and there

00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:01,089
were empty lists and sets and other

00:14:59,079 --> 00:15:03,009
collections there was the empty string

00:15:01,089 --> 00:15:04,389
and then in Django model fields I

00:15:03,009 --> 00:15:05,920
discovered further kinds of nothing

00:15:04,389 --> 00:15:07,240
there was null for the database and

00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,170
blank for the forms and they were all

00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,750
not something and they were all

00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:13,340
different and in the Django applications

00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:16,130
I started building I needed to represent

00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:18,650
world to construct a picture not just of

00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:19,670
its material but of its logical form so

00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:21,410
let's say I needed to be able to

00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:24,520
represent actual people well yes I'd

00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:27,050
need a person model for that so we have

00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:29,600
actual persons in the world and I'd need

00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:31,910
to have an adequate account of actual

00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,950
persons in my own logical representation

00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:35,960
in my thinking that is in my Django

00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:38,750
models in the database in the forms in

00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:40,130
the output and all the different kinds

00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:42,560
of nothingness didn't merely make a

00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:44,000
difference they made a different kind of

00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:47,570
difference to it in all of these

00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,490
different representations so you just

00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:52,190
think about the names and parts of names

00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:54,440
that people have which ones of those can

00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:56,870
be non-existent or will you allow to be

00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:58,970
non existence and non existent - how do

00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:00,560
you code it what nothingness what

00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:04,280
combinations of nothingness will you

00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:06,050
allow how will these nothingness is that

00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:10,730
you allow affect the way you display

00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:11,930
them or order them and so on it turns

00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:14,180
out to be really complex because

00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:16,820
nothingness isn't a simple business and

00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:21,620
it effects everything it touches

00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:23,240
nothing really does matter and I found

00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:25,100
another abiding fascination on the other

00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:27,830
side of nothingness and negation in

00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:30,890
being so just as negation has its origin

00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:35,120
in nothingness so identity has its

00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:37,250
origin in being both identity and being

00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,100
belong to the verb to be and once again

00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:42,830
even a child learns very early on how to

00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:46,010
use simple words like is confidently and

00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:48,410
correctly and so does the Python

00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:53,390
beginner usually using these notions in

00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:55,130
simple successful ways so the new

00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:58,640
programmer will have rarely been told

00:16:55,130 --> 00:17:01,580
that is refers to identity while is

00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:03,710
equal to the double equal sign refers to

00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:09,310
equality but just as in ordinary

00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:12,740
language we can say 7 + 7 is 14 or 7 + 7

00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:20,600
because I got that wrong we can say 7 +

00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:22,310
7 is 14 or 7 plus 7 equals 14 there

00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:24,560
isn't too much pressing need to worry

00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:25,559
about it at first because they all seem

00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:28,279
to work

00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:32,370
expected ways like this until they don't

00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:33,659
because here although a and B evaluate

00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:37,559
to the same thing they are not the same

00:17:33,659 --> 00:17:39,120
object and the Python beginner will

00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:41,580
continue to run into puzzles in which

00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:44,309
their expectations built on apparently

00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:47,370
similar outcomes of apparently similar

00:17:44,309 --> 00:17:49,919
operations are confounded the two

00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:51,360
operations are only apparently similar

00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,039
you might say superficially similar but

00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,870
I think actually the similarity is at

00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:56,669
the deepest conceptual level that only a

00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:58,019
human being would recognize and that's

00:17:56,669 --> 00:17:59,610
why human beings get into so much

00:17:58,019 --> 00:18:02,879
trouble when they're programming because

00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:05,490
of their ability to handle deep concepts

00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:08,909
and the puzzles can catch them out in

00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:14,129
their code maybe you know what's going

00:18:08,909 --> 00:18:17,429
on here so we have a some and and here

00:18:14,129 --> 00:18:21,269
we have the another some and okay a is

00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:23,879
turns out not to be B but it's equal to

00:18:21,269 --> 00:18:25,289
it so and that's very puzzling until you

00:18:23,879 --> 00:18:27,480
understand what's happening and the

00:18:25,289 --> 00:18:28,919
Python beginner will start to explore to

00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:31,919
find out what are the hell is going on

00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:33,809
here they will learn more about is what

00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:35,759
is is and what equality is and what

00:18:33,809 --> 00:18:37,259
assignment assignment is and it'll be

00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:39,210
quite a while before they internalize

00:18:37,259 --> 00:18:40,860
all these rules and ideas and learn to

00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:42,840
ask the right kinds of questions and

00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:47,549
here it's because of an implementation

00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:51,360
in Python where numbers up to 256 are

00:18:47,549 --> 00:18:53,669
handled differently from larger ones so

00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,619
once again these are ideas that we use

00:18:53,669 --> 00:18:57,869
in everyday life without hesitation and

00:18:55,619 --> 00:19:00,269
get away with it while philosophy has

00:18:57,869 --> 00:19:01,769
spilt a vast amount of ink trying to

00:19:00,269 --> 00:19:03,029
understand these things and it might

00:19:01,769 --> 00:19:05,369
seem like an awful lot of trouble for

00:19:03,029 --> 00:19:06,779
such a small word like is and people

00:19:05,369 --> 00:19:09,809
lose patience when people make a lot of

00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:10,980
fuss about small things they think it

00:19:09,809 --> 00:19:12,929
might be the same kind of quibbling

00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:16,259
that's going on that Bill Clinton

00:19:12,929 --> 00:19:18,990
famously indulged in when he said before

00:19:16,259 --> 00:19:22,590
the grand jury it depends on what the

00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:24,059
meaning of the word is is and that

00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:26,009
wasn't a good look and it's also not a

00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:27,299
good look to be squirming and sweaty on

00:19:26,009 --> 00:19:30,029
television when you're being interviewed

00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:33,289
about your relations with a young intern

00:19:30,029 --> 00:19:33,289
who was less than half your age

00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:39,619
but the Python interpreter has more

00:19:36,659 --> 00:19:43,859
patience than a grand jury and

00:19:39,619 --> 00:19:45,119
importantly it has no powers of

00:19:43,859 --> 00:19:48,600
understanding so when we're dealing with

00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:51,119
it we'd better be sure that we agree

00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:53,369
with it on what the meaning of the word

00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:56,669
is is whenever we use it and we'd better

00:19:53,369 --> 00:19:59,190
understand pythons internal metaphysics

00:19:56,669 --> 00:20:01,700
of being so I want to return again to

00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:03,720
the question of Plato and Aristotle

00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,220
Carroll was delighted to read about

00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,320
functions and attributes in Python

00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:09,029
because it reminded her of Aristotle and

00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:11,669
indeed he certainly has a lot to say

00:20:09,029 --> 00:20:13,470
about them but since we've been

00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:15,629
contrasting Plato with Aristotle let's

00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:17,639
look more closely for Plato our

00:20:15,629 --> 00:20:20,669
attention should be directed towards the

00:20:17,639 --> 00:20:22,859
ideal forms of things because the actual

00:20:20,669 --> 00:20:25,799
things in our worlds of senses are

00:20:22,859 --> 00:20:28,289
merely shadows or imperfect copies for

00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:29,279
Harrison Aristotle on the other hand we

00:20:28,289 --> 00:20:31,230
have to start with the concrete

00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:34,049
particulars and abstract or generalized

00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:38,100
generalize from them form is found only

00:20:34,049 --> 00:20:39,570
in hearing in substances and to me this

00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:42,629
actually aligns quite nicely with

00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:44,489
another distinction the object-oriented

00:20:42,629 --> 00:20:46,499
programming we do in Python is class

00:20:44,489 --> 00:20:48,359
based and excuse me if this is old news

00:20:46,499 --> 00:20:51,619
to you but class-based programming is

00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:53,820
not the only object-oriented paradigm

00:20:51,619 --> 00:20:57,320
prototype based programming as used in

00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:59,940
JavaScript is another so in class-based

00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:01,999
programming we define abstract classes

00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:06,269
and from those classes we instantiate

00:21:01,999 --> 00:21:08,249
objects in prototype prototype based

00:21:06,269 --> 00:21:09,779
programming we create cron creaked

00:21:08,249 --> 00:21:12,090
objects so we start with the concrete

00:21:09,779 --> 00:21:13,590
and use those to create new ones they

00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:16,679
say we have never done this myself

00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:19,799
actually but it's funny isn't it that in

00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:22,529
Plato and class-based programming we

00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:24,299
start with the ideal form the idea of

00:21:22,529 --> 00:21:26,850
the object the blueprint the class that

00:21:24,299 --> 00:21:29,759
defines it that exists in and of itself

00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:33,049
whereas in prototype based programming

00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:36,029
the general form of a thing only exists

00:21:33,049 --> 00:21:37,529
through the concrete in other words it

00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:40,409
seems to me that Plato not Aristotle is

00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:42,359
a better model for Python so Plato is

00:21:40,409 --> 00:21:44,390
too Python as Aristotle is too

00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:46,080
javascript perhaps

00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:49,500
Carroll didn't know that but she's a

00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:52,440
philosopher not a programmer and here we

00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:53,940
are back again with Plato pointing

00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:55,650
upwards for the source to the source of

00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:57,750
truth the realm of ideas in the abstract

00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:59,010
and Aristotle referring to the concrete

00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,570
world around him at his feet

00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:03,210
and to say that one is right and one is

00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:06,150
wrong is not the point but I feel it's a

00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:09,600
difference that somehow asks us to take

00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:11,850
sides for example any debate now between

00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,500
a pragmatist and an idealist can be

00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:15,750
overlaid upon the encounter between

00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:18,539
potato pointing up and Aristotle

00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:22,679
pointing down not to say that idealists

00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:25,230
are platanus --tz-- or pragmatists are

00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:27,780
Aristotelian or that their positions are

00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:30,900
dependent on those of Plato or Aristotle

00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:33,929
just that we can see say that we see how

00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:37,049
these two approaches these different

00:22:33,929 --> 00:22:39,929
approaches align or fit so Plato and

00:22:37,049 --> 00:22:41,760
Aristotle lived 25 century 25 centuries

00:22:39,929 --> 00:22:43,890
ago but their ideas are still alive and

00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,840
at work and we can engage with them and

00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:48,419
I love that so let's go back to this

00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:50,520
question for the last time which is the

00:22:48,419 --> 00:22:52,860
one for us which speaks to us most

00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:54,870
deeply and I personally have two answers

00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:56,340
for this and sometimes I think this I

00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:58,890
don't have to choose is really the best

00:22:56,340 --> 00:23:02,680
answer but the other times I think the

00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:04,030
answer is Plato obviously

00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,930
[Applause]

00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:07,790
maybe there's a better way to look at

00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:09,560
this here from the last time our Plato

00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:11,360
and Aristotle on the walls of the

00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:13,310
Apostolic Palace all eyes on them

00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:16,040
the center around which everything else

00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:17,900
revolves pointing up and pointing down

00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:21,680
and here's John Travolta in Saturday

00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:23,780
Night Fever all eyes on him the center

00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:27,380
around which everything else revolves

00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:36,410
also pointing up and pointing down at

00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:39,320
the same time and those two directions

00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:41,000
give us a line it's a line of truth

00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:43,250
we can choose a direction on that line

00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,480
we don't have to but we can and the

00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:46,250
important thing is not to choose the

00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,410
direction but to be aware of the

00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:50,930
dimension it gives us John Travolta

00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:52,370
gives us both directions at once and as

00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:53,690
I mentioned before when you find

00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:56,300
something that seems to be a line of

00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:57,680
truth you feel obliged to follow it and

00:23:56,300 --> 00:24:00,620
explore it to work it out for yourself

00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:02,780
which direction is yours and this is the

00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:05,540
force of the demand I felt in philosophy

00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:08,270
to respond to those kinds of things and

00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:09,980
of all the people in the world that I've

00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:12,250
met the ones who respond to these

00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:14,630
questions most strongly are programmers

00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:16,910
maybe the people who become programmers

00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:17,600
are predisposed to being alive to these

00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:20,690
questions

00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:22,610
maybe programming itself seeds something

00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:24,620
in people and it's not just the way that

00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:27,470
they're alive to these questions it's

00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:30,380
also the way that programmers seem to be

00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:32,180
especially well equipped to tackle them

00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:34,250
I've never met any other population of

00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:36,770
people including actual academic

00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:38,360
philosophers who can think and talk

00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:40,520
about philosophical questions as

00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:42,620
intelligently and wisely as programmers

00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:44,900
that can and it's an experience I've had

00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:46,840
over and over again there is something

00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:49,430
in programming that gives people

00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:51,740
insights into certain kinds of

00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:54,350
philosophical questions and a clear

00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:56,780
grasp of certain important concepts

00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:58,550
logical ones yes you'd expect that but

00:24:56,780 --> 00:25:00,710
also those around ontology and the

00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:02,900
metaphysics of existence around identity

00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:04,370
and nothingness and the conversations

00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:06,140
I've had with programmers about these

00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:08,210
things have been consistently more

00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:09,980
enjoyable and rewarding than the ones

00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:12,650
I've had with my students for example

00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:14,899
all my colleagues or as we call him in

00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:18,059
academia opponents

00:25:14,899 --> 00:25:19,679
and I'm sure that if programmers became

00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:20,759
philosophers they have something to say

00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,200
that would be worth hearing

00:25:20,759 --> 00:25:24,090
so here's Kent's treatment of the

00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:26,009
concept of nothingness it's equal in

00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:28,080
technical rigor to anything you'd find

00:25:26,009 --> 00:25:30,149
in that a programmer could give you and

00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:34,159
I'd love to see a philosopher programmer

00:25:30,149 --> 00:25:36,419
get their teeth into that or into his

00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:39,029
analysis of judgment which he describes

00:25:36,419 --> 00:25:40,769
as logical functions of unity this that

00:25:39,029 --> 00:25:42,899
word functions again and I'm pretty sure

00:25:40,769 --> 00:25:44,909
that a programmer philosopher would have

00:25:42,899 --> 00:25:46,919
something too same more valuable about

00:25:44,909 --> 00:25:48,690
it than the reams of worthless rubbish

00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:50,580
that I've had to read on the subject of

00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:52,860
cancer table of judgments and I'm not

00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:54,659
I'm not talking by the way about essays

00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:57,480
by my undergraduates but actual books

00:25:54,659 --> 00:26:00,210
I've taken the trouble to buy and there

00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:02,070
are so many places to go and things to

00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:05,309
think about that are directly related to

00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:06,929
these concepts in programming there's so

00:26:05,309 --> 00:26:09,749
much that we could continue talking

00:26:06,929 --> 00:26:13,559
about and maybe it's much wider and

00:26:09,749 --> 00:26:15,269
further than you imagined I love this

00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:16,649
stuff and programmers are made for it

00:26:15,269 --> 00:26:20,519
and I find it nothing less than

00:26:16,649 --> 00:26:21,960
fascinating and I'm not really sure what

00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:24,749
to call cleavers I can't give any advice

00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:25,860
about this um programmers are made for

00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:29,669
this they seem to be generally good at

00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:31,289
good at it all I can say really is thank

00:26:29,669 --> 00:26:32,820
you for the conversations and I hope

00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:36,259
that there are going to be many more of

00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:36,259
them thank you

00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:43,880
we've got time for three questions oh

00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:43,880
yes please

00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:51,900
can I keep the slides up please just in

00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:57,760
case I need to go backwards and forwards

00:26:51,900 --> 00:27:04,600
yeah we do have credit we do have time

00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:07,450
for questions if there are any okay

00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:09,310
I'm stunned Russell is out of words can

00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:14,800
we please mark that in a calendar like

00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:18,330
thank you hello so you gave basically

00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:22,410
two examples of links between

00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:27,490
philosophers and programming languages

00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:29,830
can you give any more examples like for

00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:32,470
example some programming languages

00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:35,310
actually embody different concepts of

00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:40,720
what it means to be a program like

00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:43,480
logical programming or or dataflow

00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:45,070
programming these are basically

00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:49,170
different different definitions of the

00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:51,430
program and can you give any example of

00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:54,640
philosophical concepts that would be

00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:57,670
exemplified by this sort of thing and I

00:27:54,640 --> 00:28:01,960
know that it's like tackles

00:27:57,670 --> 00:28:04,210
kind of questions the only answer is yes

00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:05,710
I am sorry okay the slides up is out

00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:08,290
there I might want to flip something but

00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:09,970
um I probably could but now that you've

00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:12,010
asked me in front of everybody I'm not

00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:16,630
sure if I I can I know that for example

00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:19,410
that I read that when the Russians were

00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:22,930
developing their own programming

00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:27,820
archetypes and paradigms that they had

00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:32,620
computers that ran on they had they had

00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:34,930
computers that ran on not binary systems

00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:37,000
but they had three values in there at

00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:40,270
the very lowest level and it'd be very

00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,650
fascinated to know a little bit more

00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:43,930
about that and what it says about our

00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:45,670
understanding of logic and truth for

00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:47,770
example because our standing of logic

00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:51,580
and truth is directly connected to our

00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:52,960
understanding of binary so that's a kind

00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:54,520
of lame answer but as soon as I've left

00:28:52,960 --> 00:29:01,390
the stage I think of a really good one

00:28:54,520 --> 00:29:04,030
after thank you Danielle is always a

00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:06,490
huge pleasure to learn for you from you

00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:09,929
thank you for allowing us for that

00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:13,330
and these philosophically interview

00:29:09,929 --> 00:29:15,790
quite of slightly provocative question

00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:18,940
if you allow me in Python environment

00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:23,160
what would be the place for the alone

00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:23,160
allegory of the cave of Pato

00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:32,980
well the Plato's allegory of the cave is

00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:34,179
I think quite interesting because if I

00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:36,880
can try to explain this in a moment he

00:29:34,179 --> 00:29:38,800
he argues that what we see throughout

00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:41,230
our senses is it's just a kind of shadow

00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:42,429
of reality we don't see the true reality

00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:44,650
which is only attainable through the

00:29:42,429 --> 00:29:46,170
understanding and and through reasoning

00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:49,360
not through the senses which are kind of

00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:52,210
second-rate way of grasping the world so

00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,740
his thought his analogy is off that

00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:55,410
imagine that we are sitting in a cave

00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:57,160
and all we can see are shadowy

00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:59,020
representations on the wall and their

00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:02,130
shadows that are being cast by things

00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:06,280
that are outside the cave in the light

00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:08,320
so they're only poor copies so you know

00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:09,910
if we draw a triangle if we have a

00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,590
triangle we'll have a triangle somewhere

00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:13,650
it'll have three sides but it's not a

00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:15,940
perfect triangle because of course it's

00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:17,050
made of material stuff and even at the

00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:20,380
atomic level it will be a little bit

00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:23,800
Wiggly but it's a triangle because it

00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:26,920
derives somehow from the ideal class of

00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:30,070
the triangle that exists purely as a

00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:34,990
thing in itself beyond space and time

00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:36,760
and you know you can't overlay these

00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:39,179
things completely so the analogy starts

00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:42,160
to break down because every single

00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:43,929
object that I instantiate from my Python

00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:48,309
class is perfectly good

00:30:43,929 --> 00:30:52,179
unlike the shadowy imperfect copies that

00:30:48,309 --> 00:30:56,980
our material reality is so I don't think

00:30:52,179 --> 00:30:59,410
you can press this analogy further than

00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:01,690
it goes without starting to find out

00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:04,419
where it breaks down but that's also the

00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:06,250
point at which you are already deep

00:31:04,419 --> 00:31:07,810
enough that it's going to be hard to get

00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:09,160
out and that's why you should

00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:11,500
which used to actually start reading

00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:15,670
Plato for himself and and we'll get

00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:17,080
something out of that so it's a starting

00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:20,080
point to say the thick kind of things

00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:22,720
that I've said but it's you know don't

00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:38,200
take that as an authority on Plato or

00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:41,110
Aristotle Smith hi okay thank you very

00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:43,870
much for the talk I wanted to know what

00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:47,680
you thought about if programmers can

00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:55,780
define functions and define meaningless

00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:57,550
does that make programmers gods in the

00:31:55,780 --> 00:32:00,760
interest of time I removed a very large

00:31:57,550 --> 00:32:03,060
section on you know on being God and

00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:05,320
actually that is very much the

00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:07,450
experience they had when I started this

00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:09,330
programming in Python building objects

00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:12,730
and built constructing worlds and

00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:14,800
constructing the logic of the worlds and

00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:16,780
the things in the world and I think it

00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:18,430
you know I felt some sympathy for God

00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:20,440
after world here having to make it all

00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:23,350
yeah well in the beginning was the word

00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:24,910
right that's what the book says so yeah

00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:27,160
exactly had no one he had to go and lie

00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:31,840
down after a few days of it because yeah

00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:33,100
it's it's world building is a really

00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:36,490
fascinating thing and that's what we're

00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:41,760
doing with constructing objects in this

00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:45,970
kind of programming so yeah thank you

00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:47,020
yeah thank you also for the talk I'm not

00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:49,030
quite sure of

00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:53,110
I got everything right and maybe being a

00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:55,360
bit too serious about your talk but like

00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:59,950
after I talk you could think that like

00:32:55,360 --> 00:33:02,440
programmers compared to philosophers are

00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:04,690
like the elite of the society like

00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:06,880
creating so many things and defining

00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:11,920
things and knowing so much about things

00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:15,310
but yeah so like what do you think about

00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:19,600
that and like oh maybe phrases

00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:21,350
differently actually philosophers do not

00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,570
really have control of society right

00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:25,490
so they have a length of crazy ideas

00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:28,250
about society and about like defining

00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:29,929
everything quite into series few

00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:32,840
categories but in the end test does

00:33:29,929 --> 00:33:36,649
newly end up or add up with what happens

00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:41,240
in reality so do you also see simulation

00:33:36,649 --> 00:33:43,610
there as well I do actually and this

00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:48,169
morning's talk on arsenic was also

00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:51,110
connected to this because programmers we

00:33:48,169 --> 00:33:53,690
are who said us about being playing God

00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:56,990
and in the world of the our Python

00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:58,460
environment yes we are but some of the

00:33:56,990 --> 00:34:01,570
programmers there around are actually

00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:04,399
building tools that frame the way

00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:08,929
billions of people think billions of

00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:11,179
people use Facebook and their conception

00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:13,069
of friendship and relationships and so

00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:16,040
on are mediated through what has been

00:34:13,069 --> 00:34:18,579
given to them in effect by Mark

00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:23,619
Zuckerberg which is a pre frightening

00:34:18,579 --> 00:34:27,409
thought so he is providing the template

00:34:23,619 --> 00:34:30,399
for the way of thinking that literally

00:34:27,409 --> 00:34:36,649
billions of people have because it is

00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:38,329
used so much by them and is so become so

00:34:36,649 --> 00:34:41,260
deeply embedded in their thinking and

00:34:38,329 --> 00:34:43,730
that's quite um that's quite sinister

00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:46,040
when it comes out of this safe little

00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:50,119
environment Python environment into the

00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:52,639
real world and Plato

00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:54,980
I talk about philosopher programmers

00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:56,960
which was an allusion to Plato's idea of

00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:59,260
philosopher Kings he said you know there

00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:01,609
will never be a just society until

00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:04,220
things become philosophers or

00:35:01,609 --> 00:35:05,839
philosophers become kings well actually

00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:10,460
that history has not really borne out

00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:14,359
that idea and I think it would be lovely

00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:15,770
if programmers became philosophers but I

00:35:14,359 --> 00:35:24,720
don't think it would be a great idea if

00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:28,509
programmers became kings thank you

00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:32,339
and fortunately we are pretty much out

00:35:28,509 --> 00:35:32,339
