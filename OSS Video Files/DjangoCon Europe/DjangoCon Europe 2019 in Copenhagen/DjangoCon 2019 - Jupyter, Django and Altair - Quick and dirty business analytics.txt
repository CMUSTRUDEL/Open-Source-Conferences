it's working yes okay hello everyone my

00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,410
name is Chris Adams thank you very much

00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:10,230
for giving me your attention for the

00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:12,690
next 25 minutes if you've ever been to

00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,849
Django come before you may remember me

00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:16,890
from Django corn Europe in florence in

00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:18,869
2017 when I spoke about Django and

00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:20,640
climate change and if this interests you

00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:22,740
I'm running a workshop tomorrow to apply

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,550
the ideas in that talk to your own

00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:27,840
project called greeni or Django project

00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:31,380
you'll if you've heard the name Chris

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,780
Adams before in the jungle world there

00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,219
is a I this happened last night oh

00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:38,700
you're Chris Adams I use all your stuff

00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:39,600
I'm suddenly that was that guy not this

00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,550
guy right

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,379
I am the less famous less for known

00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:46,050
instance of Chris Adams in the django

00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:48,300
community and I now believe I am doomed

00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:50,129
to live in this man's shadow one day we

00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,260
might meet and I suspect if we touch

00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:53,940
women end up in aisle a ting each other

00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:57,449
in some kind of weird antimatter

00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:59,340
explosion but I digress today I'm here

00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:01,620
to talk to you about Jupiter outer and

00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,760
younger and I think I'm talking to you

00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:05,549
because there are three interesting

00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,560
projects and for the next 25 minutes or

00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:08,790
so I'm gonna split this talk into three

00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,310
main parts where I'll talk to you about

00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:13,470
notebooks share some useful theory about

00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:15,900
visualization and then show you how to

00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:19,340
apply this in a Django project so are

00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:21,900
you sitting comfortably then I'll begin

00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:23,640
okay so let's talk about notebooks first

00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,409
first of all though I feel compelled to

00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:29,189
congratulate you all on your life

00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:30,659
choices on choosing to learn Django you

00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:32,369
have chosen to learn what is very likely

00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:34,020
the most popular web framework for the

00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:35,640
most popular dynamic language in the

00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:39,450
world with the largest healthiest

00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:41,159
community ecosystem go you and this is

00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:42,509
about as close as winning a lottery gets

00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:44,670
when you're thinking about being a

00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:45,930
developer because if you can think of a

00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,729
problem the chances are that someone's

00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:50,820
actually working on it and they're doing

00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:52,640
so with a stable non shifting ecosystem

00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,869
and a well-maintained standard library

00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,990
but things are changing though and

00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:59,490
Daniel Daniel a policy decides something

00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:01,799
to me earlier on this year which kind of

00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:05,009
caught my eye he you mentioned this this

00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:06,509
survey from the Python that the PyCharm

00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:08,819
survey from 2018

00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:12,180
where they basically surveyed more than

00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:13,110
20,000 developers and from 152 countries

00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:17,310
to see how they're using

00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:18,960
- and this last year 2018 was the first

00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:21,210
year that people are using it for data

00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:24,030
analysis more than the web and I think

00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:25,980
it's fair to expect more of this and as

00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:29,180
people who work with data analysis first

00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:30,840
come to the web and as we as developers

00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:32,970
increasingly need to think more about

00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,020
data analysis ourselves I think it's

00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:35,670
worth looking at some of the tooling

00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:38,220
that they use because it might be useful

00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:39,959
for us and if you've worked with Python

00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,040
for data analysis the chances are very

00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:43,020
high that you will have come across

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,430
Jupiter or at least heard of it because

00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:46,560
it's basically the tool that everyone

00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:49,830
uses now let's look at these in more

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,330
detail so when we look at a notebook we

00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:53,310
see a few interesting things we can see

00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:55,530
some mixed-media there's like some

00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:57,900
markdown and some mathematical formula

00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:59,730
here we can also see some code snippets

00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,200
so there's input here and then there's

00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:02,790
some kind of output and there's all

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,080
these kind of slidy widgets which make

00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:06,060
which suggest that they're interactive

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,310
but when I look at this and this is the

00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:10,070
screenshot from their own home page it's

00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:13,680
not obvious to me what they're for yet

00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:15,510
so the term that is Jupiter Jupiter

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,620
project team use so they use narrative

00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:18,840
so like these are good for making

00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:21,390
narratives so what's a narrative right I

00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,769
mean let's unpack that the main thing

00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:24,709
about a narrative that you think about

00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:27,510
is that there are kind of four things

00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:29,340
that make it a narrative so narratives

00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:30,900
are collaborative in that you might

00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,790
write one with the expectation that

00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,709
others will run the same code as you or

00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:36,810
maybe tweak here and follow along with

00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:38,790
it they're shareable and then they exist

00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:39,810
primarily in a browser so that if you

00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:42,810
want to share with someone you just

00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:44,670
share a URL and they're publishable in

00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:47,100
that the notebook itself shows your

00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:49,200
commands and also shows the output like

00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:51,510
the return values from a function but it

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,040
also and it shows them together and it

00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:54,360
also serializes them into a kind of

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,239
notebook format that you can actually

00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:59,430
publish on say an s3 bucket or online

00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:01,320
and so on and they're reproducible in

00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:02,970
that once you've seen the results it's

00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,260
possible to kind of run the entire book

00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:05,400
all the way through to kind of see if

00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:07,380
you can get the results yourself which

00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,209
is why they're so popular in academic

00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:11,640
contexts because they help solve some of

00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:13,140
the kind of reproducibility crisis that

00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,239
people that we that we're struggling

00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:16,829
with so this might feel a bit academic

00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:19,620
so like what do we what are we using

00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:21,000
them for in the real world so I'm not

00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:24,090
sure if I can get over to this let's see

00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,250
where is it oh there it is yeah so

00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:28,310
The Economist uses these they have all

00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:30,090
these kind of cool visualizations and

00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:33,000
I'm not going to try and explain

00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:33,510
purchase power parity in five in in a

00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,980
minute

00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:37,230
personal life on my budget but basically

00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:39,090
they do with these cool vids and like

00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:40,889
what you're saying now is basically as

00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:42,270
an English person what's happened to our

00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:44,070
currency and how it's seeing how we've

00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:46,500
got poorer over the last few years right

00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:48,660
and you are think okay that's

00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,250
interesting but what they also do now is

00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:51,930
they share all the source code for

00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:53,520
things like this so they basically this

00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:54,690
is what's happening and here's the

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,370
actual source code so you can actually

00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:57,800
trust what we're talking about so this

00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:01,200
is quite common in data journalism now

00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:04,380
what you also see is oh right now who's

00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:06,000
a Riley as a non use like sign up for

00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:08,669
like the Riley Safari thing or anything

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,530
like that show hands okay if you if

00:05:08,669 --> 00:05:12,000
you're with the ACM it's like 100 euros

00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:14,520
a hundred years for the year told you

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,950
worth doing but what they do they've got

00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:18,930
some really cool stuff so they have a

00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:20,820
date they use their building on top of

00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:21,720
notebooks to build things like this so

00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,180
this is Peter Norvig

00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,979
who is a well-known pythonista and he is

00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:27,510
talking about how he codes and then

00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:29,460
he'll write like an example of him

00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:32,100
solving a problem and then you can jump

00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:34,020
in at any point to the code and try

00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:35,550
running the code yourself and like if

00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:37,110
you had sound you'd hear it saying but

00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:39,510
the honesty isn't that much that it's

00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:40,380
really useful here but because you can

00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:42,120
see what he's doing

00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:44,940
you can then kind of play around with

00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:46,710
this and then you can basically run

00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:49,340
arbitrary Python on some service

00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:52,590
somewhere which aren't yours which I

00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:54,510
used for some cheap gag like this but

00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:57,120
you could basically see that okay yep

00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:58,289
that's being run so if I wasn't actually

00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,639
just doing something here I could

00:05:58,289 --> 00:06:01,020
actually see what's happening here and

00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:03,150
he'll come up and then BOOM things come

00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:05,430
back so you can actually like interact

00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:07,139
and like experiment with stuff as you as

00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:07,590
you work through this if your work in

00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:09,330
DevOps

00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:10,950
or anything like that data dog

00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:12,870
incorporate this into their platform now

00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:14,820
so whenever there's an outage or if

00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:17,010
there's a run book you can actually say

00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:18,720
intersperse read Me's and write ups with

00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:21,060
what queries are doing and what's coming

00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,950
out of this to see what another so you

00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:24,810
can like see what so other people can

00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:26,370
see what you saw at the time and why you

00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:28,190
made a decision or why you might make

00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:30,900
another sit decision in future and

00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:33,539
Netflix are really really really big on

00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:35,050
it on notebooks so they've built all

00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:36,280
this tooling around it too

00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:38,080
point that like there is a kind of thing

00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:40,330
would interact now which is a really

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,220
easy to install kind of electron wrapper

00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:44,470
around Jupiter notebooks they use it for

00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:46,180
kind of ad hoc analysis and they

00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:47,949
connected to like all their big data

00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:49,360
pipelines but they do some other

00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:51,340
interesting things they've run them on

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,780
cron jobs so instead of having cron jobs

00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:55,000
they're on a notebook to do a load of

00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:56,169
work and then I'll basically show all

00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,900
the results of what they're doing like

00:06:56,169 --> 00:07:01,539
in context and they store everything in

00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:03,639
a massive like s3 bucket here now you

00:07:01,539 --> 00:07:05,050
can use all these things because pretty

00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:06,789
much every single thing that you see

00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:09,250
here is oh is open source and that's

00:07:06,789 --> 00:07:10,900
really really useful but they want

00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:12,340
something like 150,000 of these

00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:14,800
notebooks every day to do different

00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:17,050
kinds of analysis and thankfully we can

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,280
use some of that code it might be worth

00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:20,919
thinking like how how is any of this

00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:23,110
possible there's a clue in the name so

00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:25,360
Jupiter is a polyglot project and it

00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:28,060
came out of these that used to be called

00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,379
an ipython notebook basically jeux

00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:31,150
stands with Giulia like the

00:07:29,379 --> 00:07:33,250
high-performance programming language

00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:36,250
Python I don't need to explain that to

00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:38,740
this group here and Jupiter is for our

00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:40,090
stats which is the kind of previous very

00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:42,580
very well unknown tool for doing any

00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:43,960
kind of statistical analysis and the

00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:45,550
reason this is possible because we've

00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:47,500
got this kind of diagram here that might

00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:49,060
be asked using a browser here there's

00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:51,099
kind of a notebook in the middle and

00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:53,259
that doesn't do that much work itself

00:07:51,099 --> 00:07:55,509
but just for it just passes on work to a

00:07:53,259 --> 00:07:58,150
kernel that work that kind of executes

00:07:55,509 --> 00:08:00,490
the Python or R or Julia or whatever you

00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:02,110
want and then it keeps a note of what

00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:03,669
gets returned when you run a function

00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:05,259
and then it writes that into a notebook

00:08:03,669 --> 00:08:07,000
file that you could that can be shared

00:08:05,259 --> 00:08:08,650
and this means that the kernel can be

00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,879
written can be anywhere in the world and

00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:11,979
can be written in any language so you

00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:14,259
can be like a huge compute cluster on

00:08:11,979 --> 00:08:16,539
say Google's cloud or it can be a

00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:19,449
running Django shell process so you can

00:08:16,539 --> 00:08:20,529
interrogate your own at your own Python

00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:22,990
application of your own Django

00:08:20,529 --> 00:08:24,340
application and this means you can

00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:25,840
access something through a browser

00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:28,360
rather than just are using a terminal

00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,370
and that's the other thing so when we

00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,569
have a terminal we have all these things

00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:33,909
available to us that you don't

00:08:31,569 --> 00:08:38,079
necessarily have in it that in just text

00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:39,699
because like text can text is useful but

00:08:38,079 --> 00:08:41,110
it's useful but it does have limits when

00:08:39,699 --> 00:08:42,310
you're trying to convey meaning or kind

00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:44,550
of compress information into a

00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:47,440
particular space so there's an example

00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:48,820
you can do this but please don't write

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,320
if you were to kind of write

00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:53,110
so you can basically change like the

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,820
test remodel method to kind of return

00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:56,380
things back and because of working with

00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:58,750
height and three we can do stuff like

00:08:56,380 --> 00:09:00,490
this now now I'm saying you can do this

00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:02,290
not that you should do this because

00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:04,660
there's always all kinds of reasons why

00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:06,070
you wouldn't and if you did do this then

00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:07,900
like well this because this is actually

00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:09,460
a fairly dense way of communicating

00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,780
information about this plot this thing

00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:12,550
that you could actually take into

00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:13,930
account based on the model and so on so

00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:16,450
you could have a scenario where maybe

00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:19,120
you're working in the show and you might

00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:20,680
say okay I do this and then the output

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,480
might be something like this

00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:26,710
all right or if you try to do something

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:29,590
like I say on a list comprehension let's

00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:32,440
see would you want to get back something

00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:34,420
like this now don't do this all right

00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,850
it's only as I'm mainly sharing this

00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:38,590
with you as an idea of to kind of get

00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:40,540
this idea of having multiple ways to

00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:42,190
represent an existing data structure and

00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:44,410
some ways can be more information the

00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:47,050
dense than just having plain text all

00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:48,160
right and this is the kind of thing

00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:49,960
which is why don't--why want to talk to

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,070
you about the notebook parts because if

00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,330
you've got a whole browser you can do

00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:55,360
things that you couldn't do before and

00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:57,490
I'm gonna try and find my pointer again

00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,430
to move it over here yeah so if you've

00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:02,800
got data which lends itself to being say

00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:04,330
is that we're gonna work yeah if you've

00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,770
got data that lends itself to being kind

00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:07,840
of tabular rather than showing like an

00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:10,570
approximation my table we can show a

00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:13,030
real table right or if we've got say a

00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:17,530
bunch of dicks like this bit dictionary

00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:18,940
that is then yeah you can actually then

00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:21,070
try representing that in a kind of more

00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:23,440
kind of webby fashion so you can explore

00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:24,970
staff and see what it looks like so like

00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,100
there's all these things you can do when

00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:29,950
you've got a browser rather than just at

00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:31,540
a terminal and depending on like what

00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:33,430
the data is there are other things that

00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:35,500
kind of that allow you to kind of I

00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:36,640
guess represent something in a way

00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:39,070
that's more true to the underlying data

00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:41,290
so this is like a G this is what you

00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:42,940
might do a geo jason in a browser with

00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:45,160
with notebooks right because you know

00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:47,760
it's spatial you can show on a map and

00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:51,040
this animated gif is basically showing

00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:53,080
Jason on earth but also Jason on Mars

00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,150
we're using some kind of map tiles but

00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:57,400
the idea is that you're there there's

00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:59,020
more than one way to represent a data

00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:01,290
structure and I think this is actually a

00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:03,040
really useful idea to hold on to um

00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:04,389
another thing is

00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,699
when you start working with vision think

00:11:04,389 --> 00:11:08,079
oh wow there's all these things I can do

00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:10,420
it's very easy to get that if it's wrong

00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:12,430
and like for example when I think about

00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:14,560
pie charts I assume they add up to 100%

00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:16,810
and when I look at this I'm not sure

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,339
that it does right so this makes it

00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:20,649
harder for me to understand it and it's

00:11:18,339 --> 00:11:22,420
as pythoness this if our main job is

00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:23,560
like writing code it'd be nice if we

00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:25,180
could do something like a nickel tape

00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,680
install of his knowledge right

00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:27,759
and at this point here I'm going to talk

00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:30,009
to a little bit about some theory

00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:32,920
because I've been having to explore some

00:11:30,009 --> 00:11:34,720
of this weather-open work recently um if

00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:36,670
I if you had to just buy one book for

00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,290
the next 10 years to help you understand

00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:41,470
visualization better I suggest it's this

00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:42,959
one here by dr. Tamara moons now her

00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:45,610
book was the life-changing for me and

00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:47,079
it's common to think like you read a

00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:49,600
book and think oh that's cool and that's

00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:51,519
cool um this was the main thought I had

00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,230
when I was reading this talk I went when

00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,970
when I was reading this book and I've

00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:56,949
linked to a video which was an hour long

00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:58,779
which basic presents' all of her ideas

00:11:56,949 --> 00:12:01,480
or all the ideas in the book in a really

00:11:58,779 --> 00:12:02,949
really nice format and I seriously it's

00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,389
really really changes how you think

00:12:02,949 --> 00:12:06,339
about visualization and presenting

00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:07,810
things and the key things that the key

00:12:06,339 --> 00:12:10,180
takeaway from that talk which I'm going

00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:11,649
to kind of run over quickly is that we

00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:13,449
have way that data in the world of

00:12:11,649 --> 00:12:15,130
database we've got a lot so that lots of

00:12:13,449 --> 00:12:17,319
similar ideas that map really nicely to

00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:18,940
our concepts so we've got things like

00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:20,290
say in database you've got like data

00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:22,690
types which a bit like our data

00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:23,649
structures and then they might come in

00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:25,750
different shapes so you might have

00:12:23,649 --> 00:12:28,149
tabular ones you might have links and

00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:29,620
graphs or trees like this stuff

00:12:28,149 --> 00:12:30,819
shouldn't be that this should feel

00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:32,260
really comfortable to you

00:12:30,819 --> 00:12:35,260
if you used to working with data and

00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:36,850
then each of these data types have items

00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:39,220
inside them have attributes just like we

00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:40,720
do all right and these attributes can

00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:43,029
come in different flavors so we've got

00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,610
categorical things and then we got which

00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:47,139
are like a different kinds of things and

00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:48,939
then there's like ordered right maybe

00:12:47,139 --> 00:12:51,550
ordinal which is not necessarily a kind

00:12:48,939 --> 00:12:53,260
of discreet scale but is more it is

00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:54,370
discrete not continuous and like

00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:57,699
quantitive you see like there's

00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:59,800
different things like this and once

00:12:57,699 --> 00:13:01,300
you've got some items in a data

00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:04,029
structure with attribute you might

00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:06,100
represent them as a mark on a page or on

00:13:04,029 --> 00:13:07,509
a screen and these marks might come in

00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:11,319
different flavors so you might have like

00:13:07,509 --> 00:13:12,910
points and lines and areas but and then

00:13:11,319 --> 00:13:15,399
you will encode information about each

00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:16,510
of these marks to convey meaning using

00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:18,010
some of these channels

00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:19,480
so you had different different channels

00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:22,030
available to you so you might have

00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:23,860
things like position being one or you

00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:26,730
might have color being another or shape

00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:29,110
and you can use these in combination to

00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:31,960
basically can you convey a greater

00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:34,300
amount information in a small in a

00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:36,070
limited space and just to make this feel

00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:38,410
a bit more kind of comfortable I figured

00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:39,910
I'd share some examples of this so on

00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:41,920
the left hand side we have a mark which

00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:44,140
is a bar chart so we got a bar mark and

00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,550
we're encoding information in two parts

00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:48,580
we're using the exposition for this part

00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:50,410
here and the length but likewise we can

00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:52,750
do we can change the mark and convey the

00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:54,700
same information as dots but if you

00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:56,680
wanted to encode more variables in this

00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:59,080
you might choose to have color to show

00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:01,240
something else about this likewise if we

00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:03,100
wanted to encode size then we can once

00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,260
again in the same space encode more

00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:08,590
amounts of information in the same

00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:10,210
amount of space and at this point here

00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:13,660
you might think well okay this is cool

00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:14,860
but I don't know what if I how do I make

00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:16,330
how do I know that I'm doing this right

00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:18,310
how do I know them actually using the

00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:19,720
correct kind of channels to encode the

00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:21,160
correct kind of information the nice

00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,420
thing is is that people have been

00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,250
thinking about this for a really long

00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:26,530
time and they've actually been testing

00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:28,450
this kind of stuff with various tools

00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:30,130
and like there are helpful tables like

00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:32,020
this which you can kind of check and

00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:34,090
this helps us understand why bar charts

00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:36,070
are often so popular and so effective

00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:39,730
because they're basically positioning

00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:41,950
things on a common scale usually from in

00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:43,300
a series of unlike from left to right

00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:45,190
and we might use different colors to

00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:47,260
explain why they're different and like

00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:49,120
this is actually quite useful because it

00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:50,470
gives us a kind of cookbook or set of

00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,760
things that we can refer back to if

00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:53,320
we're trying to find a way to

00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,210
communicate a dense amount of

00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:58,300
information to people who will often

00:14:55,210 --> 00:15:00,700
either not either distracted or they're

00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:01,840
working on a number of other things or

00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,610
they just don't have that much time so

00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:05,170
we might think ok how do we use this

00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:07,540
this is nice but I'm just sharing like

00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:10,000
academic theory with you so the nice

00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:12,010
thing is is that all this kind of really

00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,930
all this thought like really solid

00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:16,720
foundational stuff is encoded into a

00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:18,250
library could Vega light and all these

00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,500
diagrams here basically use that

00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:22,270
vocabulary just shared with you now so

00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,920
you've got some really cool wizzy

00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:26,140
analysis and everything like that but

00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:28,510
there's basically a kind of JSON data

00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:29,470
structure to describe these that you can

00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:31,120
actually

00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:32,410
basically display and I'll just show you

00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,530
some example of it so you can see what

00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:37,300
it looks like so we've got a simple bar

00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:39,490
chart here which is showing rain in

00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:41,110
Seattle we've got a data set coming in

00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:43,030
and then we're choosing to kind of

00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:45,190
represent that using a bar mark that we

00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:47,260
had before and then we're encoding in X

00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:49,570
along here we're including kind of the

00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:51,790
time and then for the amount of rain

00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:53,590
we're using that precipitation which is

00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:54,940
inside this and we're showing that we're

00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:56,230
saying it's quantitative and that's how

00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:58,720
we can basically end up with a fairly

00:15:56,230 --> 00:16:01,060
simple diagram like this like this is

00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:03,760
cool but we can do more so we can have

00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:06,160
say two marks on the same chart to show

00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:08,410
us things like say the mean amount of

00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,760
our precipitation or more bases and

00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:11,440
stuff here right you can add more

00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:14,140
information into the same space and like

00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,580
this is cool but I'm now making you

00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:17,470
haven't you need to fight think about

00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:19,330
Jack about Jason and JavaScript and like

00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:21,820
I'm at a Django conference where we're

00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:24,370
more comfortable using Python thankfully

00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:26,440
this is actually basically done in

00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:27,580
Python this it'll be really nice if we

00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,650
could have something like this right we

00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:31,450
want to import a URL to show something

00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:33,640
and then we could just use all our

00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:36,100
Python library to say well I'd like that

00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:38,890
and I'd like that and this is basically

00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:41,230
outer is some people have taken the idea

00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:42,820
of vaguer and vaguer like with all the

00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:45,220
solid theoretical underpinnings and

00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:47,170
they've basically written a nice Python

00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:49,150
wrapper around this stuff so all the

00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:51,820
cool wheezy charts that I'm not showing

00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:54,700
you but on this page you can make using

00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:55,990
Python now and I'll explain what it's

00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,430
doing under the hood because that might

00:16:55,990 --> 00:17:00,160
help give you some kind of understanding

00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:02,080
here all right it's called outer and

00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,360
what outer is doing is basically working

00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:06,370
with we were using a DSL here which

00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:08,290
spits out some vague alight here vague

00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:10,390
and light then creates another another

00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:12,220
kind of more kind of dense version

00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:13,960
called Vega and then we start working

00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:16,240
with d3 who's in on if someone worked

00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:20,080
with d3 here ok how many of you enjoyed

00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:22,510
it yeah right and then that compan can

00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,860
buy down to SVG or for performance you

00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:25,480
might want to have canvas so this

00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:27,250
basically lets us play around and

00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:29,290
express information that we actually

00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:30,940
have available to us in a very very

00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:33,580
dense form without having to understand

00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:35,140
its entire stack but if we do need to

00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:37,260
get help working with the stack we're

00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:39,210
using common well known popular

00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:42,360
so it's possible to actually get help

00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:44,309
with it with this and I just want to say

00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,750
like thank you Jake I don't think I'm

00:17:44,309 --> 00:17:47,070
ever going to meet this man but he's

00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:49,830
worked been working on this more than

00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:51,210
anyone else and I think that people if

00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:53,010
you're working open source it's really

00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:54,960
really useful to actually acknowledge

00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:56,210
this stuff come up the Wi-Fi there

00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,679
Walker has been awesome today right

00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:59,940
anyway so now we're talking about

00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:02,010
applying this but what can we do with

00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:03,899
this so you remember how I was talking

00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:05,159
to you about this diagram here where

00:18:03,899 --> 00:18:06,750
we've got a browser here and then have

00:18:05,159 --> 00:18:09,269
no big server and a kernel doing some

00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:10,620
work well if we were to implement is

00:18:09,269 --> 00:18:12,570
tonight Wrangler applications it would

00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:14,340
look a bit like this so we've got a

00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:16,679
smiley face here speaking to a browser

00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:18,269
and then we'd be using our tear to

00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:20,130
generate some kind of Jason that we'd

00:18:18,269 --> 00:18:22,230
render in the browser and then we might

00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:23,429
have some ORM or something maybe SQL

00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:24,450
alchemy now that we've discovered it

00:18:23,429 --> 00:18:27,679
does all these of all these cool things

00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:31,409
and it might look a bit like this so

00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:33,360
we've got like some basic model here we

00:18:31,409 --> 00:18:34,799
might say to do a call like this and

00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,750
we'll convert things until get our

00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:38,490
values back rather than the objects cuz

00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:40,799
it's easy to work with and then we'll

00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:42,899
basically say well please take all the

00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:45,929
this this list of objects and put it

00:18:42,899 --> 00:18:47,309
into a query into a list of kind of

00:18:45,929 --> 00:18:49,110
dictionaries and we can work with that

00:18:47,309 --> 00:18:50,820
we pass that in and then we didn't code

00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:52,380
using the marks that we wanted and then

00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:54,720
we just return it as a JSON response and

00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:56,940
then in the in the actual page that we'd

00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,610
be showing we'd have what we'd ever euro

00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:01,740
our URL so gonna hook this up so the

00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:02,940
next page makes sense but we didn't it

00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:05,159
with something a bit like this so we

00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:06,899
fetched Vega Vega like these bits here

00:19:05,159 --> 00:19:08,880
and then we might have a div called the

00:19:06,899 --> 00:19:11,940
face that we will replace with it and

00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:15,210
then we just fetch our thing and then we

00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:17,789
say please please do the to string or to

00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:20,220
vis method on the JSON that we get back

00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:22,409
and then that's basically it that's how

00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:23,639
we can basically work in Python use

00:19:22,409 --> 00:19:26,250
tools we're comfortable with to explain

00:19:23,639 --> 00:19:28,049
ideas and explain things visually with

00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:30,659
people and actually make it available to

00:19:28,049 --> 00:19:32,130
people on the web and I'm going to try

00:19:30,659 --> 00:19:33,539
for a quick and dirty example now

00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:36,090
because I did use the word quick and

00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:37,789
dirty in the talk title all right has

00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:40,139
anyone heard of draw down here at all

00:19:37,789 --> 00:19:41,519
okay cool we've had two or three people

00:19:40,139 --> 00:19:43,740
put their hand up this is really really

00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:45,120
cool because okay climate change as a

00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:47,460
thing and we should probably be thinking

00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,289
about it more as professionals and these

00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:50,610
draw down is basically a project where

00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:53,429
people have looked at the

00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:55,049
100 most substantive solutions you could

00:19:53,429 --> 00:19:57,659
apply now there's all kinds of questions

00:19:55,049 --> 00:19:59,820
about like the assumptions made in this

00:19:57,659 --> 00:20:01,350
neoliberal kind of framing of this but

00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:03,179
there is a lot of interesting stuff

00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:05,519
inside this and they do have a kind of

00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:06,809
ranking of all the charts of all the

00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:08,159
things that might or the kind of

00:20:06,809 --> 00:20:10,380
interventions that we could actually do

00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:13,980
to well I don't know stay in a

00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:15,390
inhabitable world right and I'm gonna

00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,980
show you what some of this looks like

00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:18,500
with those cardiac code examples to kind

00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:21,059
of prove that it really does work and

00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:23,070
but before I do that though I'm gonna

00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:25,110
show a screenshot so in just in case'

00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:27,289
demonstrate the demo gods didn't smile

00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:30,750
upon me so let's see if we can go this

00:20:27,289 --> 00:20:32,700
and grab it now okay can you see

00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:35,399
swimming toning up yes you can cool

00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:36,870
right so what you're looking at here is

00:20:35,399 --> 00:20:39,720
basically the code that I showed you a

00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:41,190
minute ago right and if I can zoom am I

00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:43,500
able to like increase the size of this

00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:45,480
oh god what have I done there let's

00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:48,809
close that all right yeah there we are

00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:50,639
now yeah so this shows us all the things

00:20:48,809 --> 00:20:51,990
what you might want to do right and we

00:20:50,639 --> 00:20:53,700
might think of things like okay like

00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:55,440
electric cars are gonna be saving us or

00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,669
anything like that but when you look at

00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,279
this you can see that electric cars

00:20:56,669 --> 00:21:01,289
aren't actually that much of an

00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:03,000
intervention right the biggest single

00:21:01,289 --> 00:21:05,880
biggest thing that looks like it's going

00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,549
to actually bias time is actually fixing

00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:10,919
how fridges are disposed of because they

00:21:08,549 --> 00:21:13,529
release these CFC these these gases

00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:15,240
which are really really really bad news

00:21:13,529 --> 00:21:17,070
for therefore when you're in the

00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,929
atmosphere but you also see some other

00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:20,820
things like some really big things here

00:21:18,929 --> 00:21:22,830
food waste which what we were speaking

00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:25,049
about yesterday that's a massive lever

00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:26,970
so is actually diet which is which came

00:21:25,049 --> 00:21:29,010
up a few years ago but you can see down

00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:30,179
here like two of the biggest things

00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:31,620
actually if you combine and they're

00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:33,330
probably the biggest thing like treating

00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:35,370
women with dignity really really helps

00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:37,289
it turns out because it changes how

00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:38,760
families work and there's there's all

00:21:37,289 --> 00:21:39,840
this things like say if you have access

00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,519
to family planning and give people

00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,440
access to to choice and then though the

00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:44,880
way that families grow ends up being

00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,049
different as well but there's loads of

00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,490
interesting stuff which we wouldn't have

00:21:46,049 --> 00:21:50,760
seen if we just looked at like say a

00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:52,350
single kind of CSV file and you can

00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,730
explore this stuff yourself and there's

00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:55,440
loads of other ways of presenting this

00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:56,789
and it looks different many because I

00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,419
wasn't sure if you could actually see it

00:21:56,789 --> 00:21:59,730
on this

00:21:57,419 --> 00:22:01,100
on this on this screen so I'm just going

00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:05,029
to try and close this now

00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:07,460
and use the last of my time to say is

00:22:05,029 --> 00:22:09,350
that right yeah that worked is that if

00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:10,820
you do care about this stuff I'm working

00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:13,220
with a company who basically paid for us

00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:14,720
to work on and find out this kind of

00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:17,299
stuff they called spend Network they're

00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:19,250
hiring and they're looking to use these

00:22:17,299 --> 00:22:20,659
ideas or basically take the last ten

00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:22,759
years of open data to find out how

00:22:20,659 --> 00:22:24,620
public's money is being spent and

00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:25,940
basically see where the inter where the

00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:27,380
biggest libras are in terms of climate

00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:29,149
change so you can do something there too

00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:31,940
they're hiring so please do speak to me

00:22:29,149 --> 00:22:33,860
afterwards but I said I'd talk to you a

00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:35,269
bit about notebooks give you some theory

00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:36,860
and show you how you might apply this

00:22:35,269 --> 00:22:38,929
theory in your work so that you can

00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:40,730
actually present things in they're kind

00:22:38,929 --> 00:22:43,340
of visually arresting and interesting

00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:46,279
and if and dense way using these tools

00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:48,230
Jupiter outer and Jango and I think I

00:22:46,279 --> 00:22:51,610
did that so I'm going to say thank you

00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:51,610
everyone yeah

00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,919
by the way I have this opinion this

00:23:02,059 --> 00:23:05,179
weird opinion if we're professionals

00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,740
then we should think about the harm that

00:23:05,179 --> 00:23:08,240
what we do we think about the harm

00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:10,100
caused by how we work and we should try

00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,630
to minimize it and I think that if

00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,380
you're not doing that I would argue that

00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:14,289
you're not really being with that

00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:16,280
professional and I'm running this

00:23:14,289 --> 00:23:18,020
workshop tomorrow to kind of explore

00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:19,669
that with other people because yeah the

00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:21,559
biggest leave we have is the fact that

00:23:19,669 --> 00:23:23,480
pretty much everything we build runs on

00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:26,150
fossil fuels right now and like this is

00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:28,220
such an easy thing for us to fix so yeah

00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:29,770
if that interests you and like the hoenn

00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:32,179
of continued existence of humans

00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:34,429
interests you please speak to me or come

00:23:32,179 --> 00:23:36,169
to the workshop tomorrow and this deck

00:23:34,429 --> 00:23:38,000
is online and the code that I showed you

00:23:36,169 --> 00:23:39,830
the Django app that's awesome online so

00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,260
feel free to fork it and you can see how

00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:44,150
you can actually use a ipython to speak

00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:47,419
to a Jupiter notebook and have some fun

00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:51,049
with it okay that's it I think I've got

00:23:47,419 --> 00:23:53,390
type of questions yeah I don't know we

00:23:51,049 --> 00:23:55,880
have about four minutes for questions so

00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:56,450
we can do Gengo Khan hashtag jingle Khan

00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:01,270
QA

00:23:56,450 --> 00:24:01,270
online or you can line up for questions

00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:13,210
there's always a question thank you for

00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:15,409
your talk it was very very informative

00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:17,659
it's great to have a library that

00:24:15,409 --> 00:24:19,730
provides you with the means of doing

00:24:17,659 --> 00:24:22,730
very different kinds of data analyzation

00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:24,980
and visualization but do you have any

00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:28,490
resources on how to choose the correct

00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:31,250
type of visualization to provide because

00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:32,600
that's pretty tricky yes there is

00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:34,909
actually a really good resource from the

00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:37,220
Financial Times they do actually list

00:24:34,909 --> 00:24:38,840
this i'm typical finder right so

00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:41,870
financially so Financial Times have this

00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:45,049
basically list and it's also using the

00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:47,780
Vega and Altair tools right so basically

00:24:45,049 --> 00:24:49,190
this thing was produced by I think

00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:50,809
financial time saying this is how you

00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:52,010
should use our charts and they use it

00:24:50,809 --> 00:24:53,480
internally and they shared it because it

00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:54,799
makes them look cool and then someone

00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:56,240
has taken that idea oh that's kind of

00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:58,789
cool maybe I can implement that in Vega

00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,409
which means we get all of that so how

00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:03,620
cool is that that's my answer

00:25:00,409 --> 00:25:05,900
i'll feathering through thank you for a

00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:08,419
very interesting talk you've shown a

00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:10,610
picture of their Netflix architecture

00:25:08,419 --> 00:25:12,730
yes and you don't have to scroll back

00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:15,250
even though most of those things

00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:17,549
as I said open-source they are probably

00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:21,309
on a different scale so I'm wondering

00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:23,710
how can you use the coating to paterno

00:25:21,309 --> 00:25:25,840
books without like running a kernel

00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:28,240
because like I reuse it in Python

00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:30,640
without not the overhead of the kernel

00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,380
but like I don't I don't have one to

00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:35,200
colonel running on the servers and so on

00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:37,720
okay so the approach I take and the

00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:41,080
thing I've been using if I can share

00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:43,330
this because it's gonna work

00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:45,340
I'll check oh no it's not if now we've

00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:47,140
got we know we're at this conference so

00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:49,240
I was going to show you an example of

00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:51,070
some code in Jupiter so I'd be using in

00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:53,230
a kind of scratch session like I would

00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:54,820
be using an eye Python then I take those

00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:56,770
bits and put it into a class and then

00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:58,690
call methods that way that's the kind of

00:25:56,770 --> 00:26:00,280
like working in the rebel approach that

00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:02,410
I guess the closure community are known

00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:04,120
for and a few other ones are so you

00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:05,799
don't actually need to be running all

00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,850
this stuff you can just actually work

00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:08,740
out the bits of Python that you care

00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:09,760
about and then call those online I think

00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:12,250
pretty cool it on the server this

00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,840
function if you really wanted but now we

00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:15,309
know there's more to it than that so

00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,799
yeah that would be my op I'm happy to

00:26:15,309 --> 00:26:20,799
talk in more detail afterwards yes sir

00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:22,600
thank you what is the best way to make

00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:24,669
the notebooks available to other people

00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:28,059
because you said it's just a URL but

00:26:24,669 --> 00:26:30,610
like to make it not publicly available

00:26:28,059 --> 00:26:34,210
on the Internet ah there are a few ways

00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:36,220
so if you use vs code however you use

00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:37,419
kind of most IDs now they've realized

00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:40,330
that notebooks are really really handy

00:26:37,419 --> 00:26:42,850
and because most lots of the kind of

00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:44,950
cool new editors have a basic running on

00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:46,330
Chrome you can basically use that stuff

00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:49,840
internally so you can actually export

00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:51,640
things as as Python but also Google have

00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,590
a thing called collaboratory which is

00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:56,770
free to use and it just gives you some

00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:58,059
magic kernel somewhere that you can use

00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:59,110
but there's also a tool called binder

00:26:58,059 --> 00:27:01,240
which lets you run these things

00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:03,100
internally as well which basically spins

00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:04,690
up loaded rocket containers according to

00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:07,299
your requirements file and then you can

00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:09,700
have that on your own hardware or if you

00:27:07,299 --> 00:27:12,190
have if there's no reason to hide what

00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:13,510
you or no reason to not share it you can

00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:15,309
use it on public infrastructure as well

00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:16,450
there's also this massive European

00:27:15,309 --> 00:27:18,910
science cloud where they've just like

00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:21,370
provide kernels for you to plug into so

00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:23,080
yeah there's lot there's lots of options

00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:24,610
I don't I can have some links to this

00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,929
talk afterwards actually or file an

00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:29,289
issue and I'll add some more like that

00:27:25,929 --> 00:27:31,799
thank you yes sir hi we are all out of

00:27:29,289 --> 00:27:35,169
time and we have a great speaker next

00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:37,000
but I'm sure we can find you around

00:27:35,169 --> 00:27:41,890
awesome yay thank you everyone

00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,890
