really honored to be here thank you for

00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:36,810
having me I'm feeding the pony I'm gonna

00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:38,310
talk about feeding the pony who's the

00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:40,110
pony well danglers the pony

00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:45,810
it's the pony I'm so glad they've made

00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:47,099
this this is amazing the idea back in

00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:48,569
the day was that when you're asking for

00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:50,430
all these magical features like

00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:52,670
declarative models where you just you

00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:54,930
know sell them out and I don't know

00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:56,700
automatic form generation and

00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:57,750
invalidation all these things that while

00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,640
you're asking for all these magic

00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:04,319
features you might as well dance for a

00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:07,170
pony as well the thought of that then we

00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:11,190
needed the mascot and so well the Jagger

00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:13,319
pony was born before I go on I kind of

00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:14,670
think we don't do enough about this you

00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:16,590
know should have more t-shirts and more

00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:20,040
things like that so if you're if you're

00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:21,540
a swag making type person let's book

00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,030
afterwards so I make something more

00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:27,510
happen with the Django Pony

00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:29,250
anyway Who am I I'm Carlton Gibson so

00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:30,420
I'm a long time Jango you I've got a

00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:33,829
book on shelf that says something like

00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:38,099
updated 41.1 so it's around about then

00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:39,420
I've been contributing in the Django

00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:41,459
ecosystem for a number years of

00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:44,730
maintainer Django rest framework help

00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:46,169
help there I maintain Django filter J

00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:49,919
Chris reforms that helped out on other

00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:51,180
things and along with Marius for the

00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:56,340
last year or so I've been the general

00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:57,959
fellow what's the jaga fellow

00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:00,060
well we're contracted by the Django

00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:03,419
Software Foundation to do the sort of

00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:06,090
day-to-day tasks on Django we pre arge

00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:07,530
the tickets as they come in so you go on

00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:09,510
the easy track you create it we try and

00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:12,750
reproduce it we make sure it's a valid

00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:14,340
bug or not we handle the patch review so

00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:16,470
you submit a pull request we make sure

00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:18,750
that your pull request gets a review as

00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:22,560
quickly as we can

00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:26,180
we merged mostly poreless now we do

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:28,260
security work as a security issue really

00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:30,270
reportedly help there and

00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:34,200
with other contributors do the releases

00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:35,880
and its kind of stuff that on a project

00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:41,550
the size of Django it just wouldn't get

00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:42,660
on it just fall behind and I guess the

00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:43,980
point about the first ship program

00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,810
what's really good about it is it

00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:48,090
hopefully lets contributors that's you

00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:49,950
lot do the exciting stuff of

00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:52,590
contributing code while we do the more

00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:54,110
month and stuff to keep the project

00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:57,750
ticking over

00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:59,580
so the talk contributing back to dango

00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:01,680
and how to make that work for you

00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:05,370
why would you do contributing I tell you

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:07,710
well I it's fun it's fun doing open

00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:11,340
source it's fun working on the patch is

00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:12,630
it fun creating software right we like

00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:14,700
write paint off work but it's a great

00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:17,910
learning opportunity as well it's really

00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:23,360
it really lit up sure ability something

00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:23,360
that it just makes you better

00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:35,370
sorry and you can take on the ticket you

00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:37,020
don't know what it is you have to work

00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:39,150
out what the problem is first of all you

00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:41,070
don't have to create a test case all

00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:43,910
right you create a patch for it you'll

00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:47,310
get your patch reviewed by you know big

00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:48,960
spike contributors to Jango and they'll

00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:51,000
help you improve your code so it's a

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,110
great learning opportunity and if you do

00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,210
it right and that's what it's talking

00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:56,430
about it helps you helps you get a job

00:05:54,210 --> 00:06:02,010
or it helps you get a better job right

00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:03,330
but but how and that's what I'm going to

00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:07,710
talk about this day and the big problem

00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:09,680
is that Jango well its contributors it

00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:11,850
used to be called meat-grinder

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:17,910
people would say oh we need some fresh

00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:21,960
meat for the meat grinder and this and

00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:24,420
why well because expectations right is

00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:26,760
it there's bad expectations around open

00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:29,700
source one of those who comes to funding

00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:31,320
so it should do a strawpoll greatly I

00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:34,550
don't know everything do it who here

00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:37,800
uses Jango in their work in some way

00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:41,340
that's okay that's most of you keep your

00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:42,260
hands up who keep your hand up if you

00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:44,210
are in some way

00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:48,200
senior your work do you have an

00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:51,830
underling of any kind okay so that's not

00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:53,960
something I and keep your hand up if

00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:55,490
your company contributes to the Django

00:06:53,960 --> 00:07:01,990
Software Foundation or Django rest

00:06:55,490 --> 00:07:03,230
framework through firing code okay some

00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:06,230
right

00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:08,240
well done knows that you do companies

00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:10,940
don't funding it's not many right so all

00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,610
of you use it half of you have seen you

00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:15,680
in some respect and maybe 10% of funding

00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:19,400
why don't we fund why don't we fund it

00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:21,590
it's tax-deductible okay it's one of the

00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:24,830
best what ways you can do to approve

00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:29,150
your hiring process right both in reach

00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:31,130
to suitable candidates they hear about

00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:33,890
you because your logo appears in places

00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:36,350
but also in look incredible okay I'll

00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:37,580
call a qualification a comes you to your

00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,900
interview and you say oh yeah and we

00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:40,580
support the gyroscope for a foundation

00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:44,140
we support jangle its framework that

00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:44,140
makes your company much more appealing

00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:49,250
the expectation is we won't pay for it

00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:54,230
an expectation almost is that we mustn't

00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:56,480
pay for it every time a new model is

00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:58,580
tried there's a kind of outcry oh this

00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,900
isn't free and open source anymore so

00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:02,510
the example that comes to my mind is

00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:04,700
Redis radius have got the poor which is

00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:07,100
be a tea license and then they recently

00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:09,680
introduces the ability to create more

00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:11,360
modules that will bolt on extra

00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,310
functions to reduce labs whose the

00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,600
company be that funds most of Reds

00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:18,860
development they created a graph

00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:21,980
database module and they create the

00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:24,470
full-text search module and they put

00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:25,970
that under a license which is for me as

00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:27,680
a user it's totally up in sauce I can

00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:30,560
use those in any product I just can't

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:33,410
use them in if I want create another

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,450
database product so they've just tried

00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:37,400
to protect their position there and yet

00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:38,810
there was an outright there was Linux

00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:41,360
distributions threatening to stop

00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:43,700
packaging read it because it wasn't free

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,680
and open source anymore and now I don't

00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,970
the Redis example is just an example the

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,830
book the point is that kind of the

00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:50,960
action whenever people try and make any

00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:53,660
money out of open source or try and find

00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:55,020
a way of fun yet it's deeply toxic I

00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:58,210
think

00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:59,200
now in with DSF with Django we're really

00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:02,320
really lucky

00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,940
we're in fortunate position but if you

00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,320
didn't put a hand up or you didn't keep

00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:07,690
your hand up on the funding I'd like to

00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:09,910
think hard about that and whether your

00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:11,680
company can from the DSF for Django rest

00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:14,050
framework or any other projects that you

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,900
depend on but it's not just finally it's

00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:18,880
time right there is a there's the kind

00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:20,410
of expectation that once you start

00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,170
contributing to open source that you

00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:25,029
somehow oh the community something that

00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:27,520
when that you have to be there that you

00:09:25,029 --> 00:09:30,510
have to turn up no matter what the cost

00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:32,320
to you personally I think you have a

00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:35,050
responsibility that you're letting

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,480
people down now I I've been somewhat

00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:39,190
fortunate in that as I was getting

00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:41,170
involved in open source I saw people

00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:43,240
that were massively influential to me a

00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:45,790
massive have been massively influential

00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:48,630
to Django I saw them struggling and I

00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:51,400
saw their struggle and I was able to

00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:54,370
well just my own behavior and don't not

00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:56,080
fall into this trap but it's it's really

00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:57,490
toxic and again this is where we're

00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,070
lucky to have the fellowship program in

00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:02,950
the Django well because Maris and I are

00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:04,960
able to do the breathing the stuff would

00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:06,850
that really drives you to burn out but

00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,980
we're doing it on a paid basis so it's

00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:11,800
not so it's fine

00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:13,750
and there hopefully then again you can

00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,700
contribute to the good stuff the write

00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:17,680
in the code bit which is you know

00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:22,740
rewarding and a learning opportunity and

00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:25,720
obviously you know jobs and stuff so

00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:33,940
let's look at the step we're in let me

00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:37,209
just have a sip of water unpopular

00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:38,800
opinion technician contributing to open

00:10:37,209 --> 00:10:43,000
sources the privilege only few can

00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:45,940
afford no Tokra si ma you on a similar

00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:51,220
vein open sources the unpaid internship

00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:52,990
of computer programming right here's a

00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:56,050
graph I showed at Jango Khan last year

00:10:52,990 --> 00:11:00,279
it was it shows the commits per

00:10:56,050 --> 00:11:03,130
contributor between when 2.1 was

00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:04,660
released and Jago corn last year does

00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:07,180
the timeframe doesn't matter what

00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:08,170
matters is the shape of the path because

00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:10,360
there are 408

00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:14,080
when commits from 121 set of people

00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:17,470
there outside of the core group of the

00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:19,840
fellows and then half a dozen serious

00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:23,500
contributors there there aren't very

00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:25,420
many people now it's okay it's fine but

00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:27,510
the first problem with it is it's just

00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:31,450
not enough we need more contributors why

00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:33,820
because there are a hundred or 1300

00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:36,850
accepted open tickets on Django now it's

00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:41,410
okay jangling mature right it's a state

00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:42,730
it's Albert I think that's a bit too

00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:44,410
many for me I think we need to be a bit

00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:46,120
more dynamic and having look at this

00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:51,100
line shot over time right you see it

00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:52,930
never changes yeah well I think we need

00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,790
to be closing some of these and to do

00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:56,560
that we need more bandwidth we need more

00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:57,220
people we need more contributors to come

00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,100
and join us

00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:02,290
right we we managed to keep Django

00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:03,880
bowing do well we add new features we

00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:06,160
keep up with all the database updates

00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:07,540
but we had a few more contributors we

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:12,850
could take on that and we can have more

00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:15,220
features too but the bigger problem is

00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:17,440
it's just not representative right if

00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:19,600
you look at across the contributors

00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,250
Wells quite white a very male but if you

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,710
look at that core well it's all it's

00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:27,400
very very white in his all-male right

00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:33,100
and that's not representative of the the

00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:36,880
Django community as a whole as I say it

00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:38,740
could have been any home so there's

00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,870
other thing going on with Django which

00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:42,370
is about a single jangle call so

00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:44,020
historically if you contributed to

00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:46,450
Django and you made major contributions

00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:49,120
to jangling be invited to single django

00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:50,980
core and it is a list of people are in

00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:54,100
it and it makes it look as if the

00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:55,660
contributor base is 50 strong but it's

00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,670
not because most of those people are

00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:59,320
varieties they're retired they're not

00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:00,910
real they're not actively contributing

00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:03,010
to Django and so it's slightly

00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:05,020
misleading that this Django cool thing

00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:07,840
exists and it's still not represented

00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:10,780
because it's all the old white men that

00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:13,710
have contributed in the past so there's

00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:16,390
a Django Hans perm proposal to dissolve

00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:21,070
Django core that go through this year

00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:21,550
and that the governance of Django will

00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:24,399
probably be

00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:27,130
placed by members of the Django Software

00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:28,810
Foundation who are active on the Django

00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:30,640
developers if they will be the people

00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:32,950
who probably they will be the people who

00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:35,200
have the voting rights to if it the shoe

00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:40,200
comes up on Django so join this shadow

00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:42,790
software foundation and then you can be

00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,079
part of the governance of Chang and the

00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:48,940
running of a technical framework so

00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:52,300
that's half the story we're going to get

00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:54,070
rid of that Django core and then how do

00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:55,750
we want to look how can we can encourage

00:13:54,070 --> 00:14:00,519
more people to come in that would be the

00:13:55,750 --> 00:14:01,899
rest of this story right so I'm not

00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:03,880
going to talk about the funding problem

00:14:01,899 --> 00:14:05,730
we've got the Django Software Foundation

00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:08,350
we've got the fellowship program that's

00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:09,579
you know that it's not perfect there's

00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:10,930
more to say there but that's not gonna

00:14:09,579 --> 00:14:19,269
be my topic I'm going to talk about the

00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:24,940
time problem right so how can you find

00:14:19,269 --> 00:14:28,270
time to contribute to Django well can

00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:32,279
you work there's another straw pop who

00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:38,170
uses Django in our work come on

00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:40,810
right okay so who keep your hands up

00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:43,270
your hands up keep your hand up if at

00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:44,589
work you are singer in some way ie

00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:48,279
you've got an underling

00:14:44,589 --> 00:14:52,170
oh very kind who's got a promotion in

00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:56,020
five minutes but that's more of you oh

00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:58,720
hang on right so third question keep

00:14:56,020 --> 00:15:01,690
your hand up if in your company you

00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:08,040
encourage and allocate time for working

00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:10,480
on open source okay and when not popular

00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:13,180
that's not that right because that's

00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:16,510
what you need to be doing your program

00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:18,310
is your staff they will experiment right

00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:21,160
you can choose are they going to

00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:23,140
experiment on your codebase on your

00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,820
product or are they going to experiment

00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:26,529
on an open source package which gets

00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:30,670
community oversight from experienced

00:15:26,529 --> 00:15:33,640
contributors you can choose that right

00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:34,670
it's a great learning experience it

00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:37,100
makes you you

00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:39,200
or employees better programmers it

00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:41,330
allows you to keep up to date so you've

00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:43,250
got you've installed a third-party app a

00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:44,870
Django third-party app and it's not

00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:46,610
compatible with the latest version of

00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:49,040
Django because it's got some bug in it

00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:50,780
so you have an option you can either get

00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,820
stuck on the on the look-out

00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:54,770
you know the last long-term is a support

00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:56,090
that's just about to become and life and

00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:57,890
then you're running end of life software

00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:59,450
and every time you try and recruit a new

00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:04,580
program and what those thank you right

00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:06,590
now we're at one point 500 you can tell

00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:09,320
your programmers ya know let's fix that

00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:11,060
bug and let's fix out a couple of other

00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:13,220
issues on that repo let's get that

00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:15,140
third-party package that we depend on

00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:17,540
compatible with django 2.2 and it's

00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,920
update and then all of a sudden you're

00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:22,250
on the latest made version and that

00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:23,810
happy place to be only for your existing

00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:25,040
programmers but for your hiring team

00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:27,200
yeah what version of thing you run oh

00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,430
yeah we'll do it - yeah we'll be

00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,680
upgrading district when I win that's

00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:33,970
release ah that's an exciting company I

00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:36,620
want to work right

00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:38,030
it's virtuous circle it's a learning

00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:40,580
opportunity

00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:43,040
it makes your code better you get all

00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:44,680
new features you can hire more easily it

00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:48,170
becomes a learning opportunity

00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:50,810
Google supposed to the air allocates 20%

00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:55,010
time I don't know 20% time is too much

00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:57,380
to ask or a 10% time would one day every

00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:59,270
two weeks at working on open source well

00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:01,730
your dependencies on the dependi you use

00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:03,050
would that really kill you if your

00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,770
answer to that is yes then you've got

00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:07,670
big problems

00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:09,320
so allocate time from your work but

00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:10,670
worms of your work won't help you

00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,200
well what about finding time for

00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:13,130
yourself now I know it can be difficult

00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,650
but do why not

00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:19,340
aren't I exactly the demographic that

00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:20,870
will just talk be talking about right so

00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:24,590
what do I get well I know a thing or two

00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:28,700
cuz I got four children he's like I got

00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:30,920
mounting their children I know right and

00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:33,500
I've done all my contributing on the

00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:35,090
side all of it around working to support

00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:38,510
those was trying to ensure that I'm a

00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:40,130
present to parent so people have always

00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:42,410
asked me well how do you have time to

00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:44,360
contribute to open source and dancewear

00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:48,170
I've always given way as well some

00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:53,580
people play fortnight I updated it since

00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:54,840
uh-hum I play get up hey the point here

00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:58,350
is that I've made a choice

00:17:54,840 --> 00:18:00,690
okay I don't have Netflix I don't watch

00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:02,850
the new series on Terra television my

00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:05,400
wife thinks don't like novels I do like

00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:09,000
I just haven't read one in an agent

00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:11,910
attack right it's just you have to kind

00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,720
of choose what you're bad but you can't

00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:15,330
be good at everything

00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,980
so I'm bad Facebook I don't have it I'm

00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:20,250
bad at Twitter I do have it but I'm

00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:23,490
Robert I'm bad there's so many things I

00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:25,280
can't make the time for I can't make the

00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:27,810
time for it could I have four children

00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,650
because I want to improve my Spanish and

00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:31,200
my Catalan

00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:33,200
I'm because I like to cook I like to

00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:37,670
spend time doing all those other things

00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:41,580
and I want to contribute to open source

00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:43,370
right and it's not much time they leave

00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:47,070
I honestly don't have a lot of time to

00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:49,350
contribute so I did a fellow wrong and I

00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:52,350
work on January strain work as well on a

00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:58,080
paid basis and then have a little bit of

00:18:52,350 --> 00:19:00,420
time to do some open source okay but it

00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:03,210
doesn't matter how little so you find

00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:06,270
some time a little bit of time like be

00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:08,700
half an hour a week I mean it that would

00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:12,360
be enough an hour a week would be twice

00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:14,220
as much but enough right so find some

00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:16,980
time and then I want you to immediately

00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:19,560
limit it now I talked about this again

00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:21,480
last year but the important thing with

00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:24,450
contributing to open source is that you

00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:27,360
don't allow it to eat more time than you

00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:29,760
you have specified because it can and

00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,410
that's what leads to burnout and that's

00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,740
what leads to all the problems with

00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:37,980
contributing to open source is not

00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:41,810
limiting the commitment that you give so

00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:47,030
take one thing away take that right

00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:49,530
prati number one is still self-care okay

00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:51,900
yes you have to look after yourself

00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:55,140
there is this feeling oh I must fix that

00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:57,330
issue that I know caused an issue by fit

00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:59,130
merging it bargain that's brokenness and

00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:01,470
if I don't fix it now people won't be

00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:02,010
able to people people can go into their

00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:04,410
pit fire

00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:06,720
they can put to any cause an inversion

00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:09,510
number in and into whatever version you

00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:14,059
don't have to fix it that night yeah you

00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:17,700
can fix it but look after yourself first

00:20:14,059 --> 00:20:19,020
okay and then the other piece of advice

00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:21,870
I would give us don't stretch yourself

00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:24,809
too thin if you've only got a small

00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:26,640
amount of time focus on one thing it's

00:20:24,809 --> 00:20:28,290
better to focus on one package and do it

00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,900
well then sprinkle effort everywhere

00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:32,669
okay so it looks like I do a lot you

00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,660
know on pay barn a Django Fellow and

00:20:32,669 --> 00:20:36,110
contribute to Django rest framework

00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:39,270
Django filled jagger field runs itself

00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:42,360
right either were virtually no issues

00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:44,400
and you know a few hours every every

00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:47,540
major release of Django and it's not

00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:50,429
today okay

00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:55,980
the fellow roles separate hey Tom and

00:20:50,429 --> 00:20:57,809
DRF is separate okay back in the day I

00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:59,760
was working on Jang rest frame work in

00:20:57,809 --> 00:21:02,520
my spare time in the time that I had I

00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:04,919
was doing a little bit and then Django

00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:06,179
filter was unmaintained and imaging when

00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:07,770
I first started with Django reframe it

00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:10,049
was just Tom and I went and helped it

00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:11,429
and but by the time Django filled in he

00:21:10,049 --> 00:21:12,809
did someone took after it there were

00:21:11,429 --> 00:21:14,010
five people working on Django rest

00:21:12,809 --> 00:21:18,120
framework and I wasn't doing very much

00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:19,799
talk so I took on Django filter I was

00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:21,000
doing all my work on janga but I didn't

00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:23,460
do anything going arrest favorite for

00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,500
ages because I was busy and I didn't had

00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:27,210
a time and then I got Jagger field took

00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:29,549
off yeah that was fine and bang a crispy

00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:31,290
force was about to fall over so we took

00:21:29,549 --> 00:21:33,390
that and I spent my time fixing that and

00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:35,220
I'm doing that for ages and then those

00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:37,470
packages kind of run themselves Django

00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:39,780
Chris performance if anybody uses that

00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:41,610
and uses boot wrap for them please talk

00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:42,960
to me afterwards because I don't use

00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:44,700
boot up fall and there's a few they're

00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,679
not hard bugs but I haven't got the time

00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:48,299
to resolve them it needs help with

00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:51,059
templates for boot up for so have you

00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:52,620
used bootstrap and crispy forms please

00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:59,130
talk to him with you can help you fixed

00:21:52,620 --> 00:22:01,530
times if you want and now I've got those

00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:03,840
two packages they run themselves and so

00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:05,880
now I taught of taken on to work on

00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,799
channels so an you can step back from

00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:10,200
that and all I've got is a little bit of

00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:11,250
time no an hour a week so to work on it

00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,750
and I'm going to work on it at the

00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:14,700
sprints and I'm gonna you know get

00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:15,750
fixing bugs I've been looking at but the

00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,940
day to day will do

00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:19,560
handling incoming tickets is it new okay

00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:23,150
sis a new chick is it real one most of

00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:23,150
the mark most of my usage questions

00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:32,190
right the key point is that in my

00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:34,320
volunteer role bit of open source that I

00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:39,120
do for fun I've only ever really worked

00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:40,650
on one thing at a time and that's you've

00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:44,160
got to well you don't have to do that

00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:45,900
but I see some people contribute and

00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:47,400
they digis they're everywhere but

00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:51,660
they're not doing anything and it's like

00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:54,270
focus anyway and then the third thing is

00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:58,350
keep a log right because even if it's

00:22:54,270 --> 00:23:00,450
owned half an hour a week it adds up I

00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:02,190
talked about this last year about being

00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:06,270
prolific right it's it's not about being

00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:11,250
prolific in in this week it's about

00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:13,620
being prolific over time it adds up so

00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:15,540
the log is like an objective record of

00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:18,750
what you've done and it's something you

00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:20,190
that you could talk about so getting

00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:21,720
into open source really changed the

00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:24,270
dynamic for me when I was trying to get

00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:25,980
gigs because they always are oh yeah can

00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:28,710
you give us some cotton plus wall no cuz

00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:31,380
of everything of all my work is private

00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:34,140
nd under NDA but I open source up it's

00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:36,330
like yeah well you know I do this and it

00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:38,970
really changed the dynamic but keep a

00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:40,740
log of what you do and then you can use

00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:42,150
it and those silly interview questions

00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:43,950
do you get describe time when you've

00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:47,100
used Pony to solve pressing give an on

00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:49,800
table well okay see my log and I can

00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:52,010
fill in that application question and it

00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:56,660
I've got something concrete designer

00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:59,310
okay you can link to the actual ticket

00:23:56,660 --> 00:24:01,200
it's not just that I wrote in in the

00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:02,880
application that I use Django just holds

00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:06,240
some problem here's the ticket where I

00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:08,340
did it that's much more impressive than

00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:13,490
all the other candidates willing in the

00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:13,490
same question to keep the keep a lock

00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:21,210
and then you can also use it help get a

00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:22,500
reference come and help me on my package

00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:24,060
and then over a period of time I'm going

00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,980
to be ecstatic to give you a river

00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:27,420
especially if you can email me say yeah

00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:28,350
can't you remember that I've been

00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:29,020
tripping yeah I do

00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:31,510
look

00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:35,820
all things are done on bar I can have a

00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:41,980
reference of course of course

00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:43,690
okay and finally the reason to keep your

00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:46,420
log and as I get out of this matters

00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:48,220
more and more it's an aide memoire okay

00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:49,930
I've solved the problem I've learned

00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:52,780
something but I can never remember it

00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:55,750
wait later but I can just search for it

00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:58,180
and that comes why what did in the notes

00:24:55,750 --> 00:25:01,930
I took and then I've got that solution

00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:04,060
in my pocket for the future um your log

00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:05,740
doesn't have to be high tech just be

00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:08,740
plain text files in a folder your

00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:12,730
computer can search right don't build at

00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:15,160
all yourself anyway what did I say - I

00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:18,550
said limit your time might find some

00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:20,170
time they limit it focus on don't spread

00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:24,180
yourself too thin and keep a look there

00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:26,650
the three sort of tricks okay stop

00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:28,930
actually contributing I'm going to tell

00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:34,240
you how to get involved and how to get

00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:37,900
hold of us where it's not poking the

00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:39,190
contributing got you'd like contribute

00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:40,720
to Jagger but you don't know how this

00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:43,560
document will explain our process how to

00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:46,330
get involved well that sounds promising

00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:48,430
it's not the solution it's a starting

00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:49,990
point but have a read the loads of good

00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:51,460
stuff it tells you the co style it tells

00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:53,890
you how to build the docks it tells you

00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:55,840
how to run the tests when you tells you

00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:58,510
how to write a new test it tells you how

00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:00,790
to bisect the regression there's lots of

00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:03,040
good stuff in it do give it a read it's

00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:06,400
brilliant on there it says join Django

00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:07,750
developers okay well you busy you

00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,250
haven't got time for now the mailing

00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:11,590
list I know and a lot of its not

00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:14,620
relevant to you but that's fine join it

00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:17,470
anyway turn off the notifications it

00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:19,150
becomes as you get involved in Django it

00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:20,470
becomes more River so check it once a

00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:22,630
week go and have a browse and see if

00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:24,990
there's interesting topics much more

00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:27,460
important joining Django developers is

00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:30,850
Django comment there's another mailing

00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:32,920
list and this is like with this we need

00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:34,540
to advertise this more but it's place

00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:36,220
where experienced contributors have

00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:38,560
signed up to help you get a start

00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:40,180
contributing right they're rarely there

00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:41,440
waiting to answer your question don't

00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:43,650
email it hi

00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:47,260
Fred I'd like to katroo

00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:50,200
hi I'm Julia like to contribute hi

00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:51,610
I've tried to install the the test so if

00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:55,180
I can't get it going in here's the error

00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:57,250
yet give people a chance when you email

00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:59,590
the list but email us there's people

00:26:57,250 --> 00:27:06,550
there really going to help you get up

00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:08,440
and running so join that then you need

00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:10,090
to get set up with the code now in

00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:15,660
principle this is easy clone the repo

00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:17,890
okay get clock create a virtual name -

00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:20,950
none this allotted time install the

00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:23,380
requirements pip install - all right I'm

00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:27,460
run the test this run test run run test

00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:28,660
that's it a principle right sometimes it

00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:29,830
doesn't work because I don't know you

00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:31,180
haven't got the right library installed

00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:33,270
in the right place or something but if

00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:35,590
he doesn't work Django or mentorship

00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:37,270
I've got this error when I tried to run

00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:38,590
the test week if you can't get it

00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:40,960
running locally there's a virtual

00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:42,220
machine that will run the Django test

00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:46,030
suite for you with all the different

00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:47,860
databases there's a docker Det up now as

00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:50,080
well so get the doc approach or

00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:51,730
whichever whatever works for you but get

00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:55,060
the code installed on the test suite see

00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:56,380
what it looks like fine then once you've

00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:58,590
done that you've got to find a ticket

00:27:56,380 --> 00:28:02,380
and this compart

00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:07,050
remember there was 1300 open accepted

00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:09,970
tickets well where do I where do I begin

00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:12,250
the docs the contributing guide says to

00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:14,230
look for easy pickings ticket but this

00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:16,510
isn't going to cut it because there were

00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:21,040
1,300 accepted tickets of which

00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:23,560
approximately 13 attacked easy right now

00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:26,500
we're not using this right but it's

00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:31,180
not binary it's not like there are 30

00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:32,340
easy tickets and 1,300 phenomenally hard

00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:35,620
ones

00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:38,020
most of the tickets are no harder than

00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:41,770
the problems you already solve every

00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:43,960
single day in your use of danghang most

00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:46,120
of them yes they need a bit of time to

00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:49,000
work out what the issue is yes they need

00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:51,490
a bit of your love and your effort but

00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,160
they're not rocket science generally

00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:55,330
Sikhi okay why haven't they been solved

00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,770
well because there's only half a dozen

00:28:55,330 --> 00:29:01,170
people regularly computing on

00:28:56,770 --> 00:29:01,170
code base in this 1300 tickets so

00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:08,920
there's a lot of opportunities there

00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:09,460
right although if you do start one a

00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,860
ticket

00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:12,970
you'll get input like the tickets sit

00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:14,320
there which because there's no activity

00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:16,120
on them but if you just pick one and

00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:18,400
start working on it and comment or put

00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:20,020
opal regress or something then the

00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:22,059
regular contributors will come in and

00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:22,600
give you help so just pick one get

00:29:22,059 --> 00:29:24,070
started

00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:26,050
but you can narrow it out so by

00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:28,330
component is one good way you can go

00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:30,100
into the track you can look at the view

00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:32,050
tickets and you can put by component and

00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:33,880
you can choose now you can't see the

00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:35,800
numbers here be the graph is the

00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:38,679
important thing right most of the issues

00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:40,720
are in the ORM and the admin and then

00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:42,190
goes down but if you you know if you

00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,450
want to focus on error reporting well

00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:46,510
there's only ten tickets on error

00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:48,820
reporting so if you wouldn't if narrow

00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:50,140
your vote narrow by component it makes

00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:51,790
it much more approachable you're not

00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:56,020
faced with this wall of ticket you get

00:29:51,790 --> 00:30:00,910
half a page the third biggest area there

00:29:56,020 --> 00:30:02,710
this this one is documentation there are

00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:04,600
lots and lots of documentation ticket so

00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:06,520
these are super if you've you know if

00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:10,600
you've got strong written English which

00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:12,490
everyone you know most of you have you

00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:14,080
can find the documentation ticket and

00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:16,179
you can work on it and you can learn

00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:20,440
about Django and improve the

00:30:16,179 --> 00:30:23,080
documentation around hang on and really

00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:24,460
make a difference to the to the to the

00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:26,559
community because the documentation is

00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:28,300
one of Django biggest assets and it's

00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:31,059
one of our biggest areas to take

00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:33,490
improvements you can also filter tickets

00:30:31,059 --> 00:30:36,130
by patch needs patch needs improvement

00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:40,830
or patch needs test or patch needs

00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:43,450
documentation so all the all the open is

00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:45,160
there's lots of ticket to get started

00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:49,450
but they never get finished because

00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:51,460
dangos Django is quite good right so it

00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:53,860
can be quite difficult to get a ticket

00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:55,240
or patch to the level where it's ready

00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:59,410
to be merged because if it hasn't got

00:30:55,240 --> 00:31:01,390
box or tests they can't go in yet there

00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:03,190
is a massive opportunity to find tickets

00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:05,800
that just need some test cases added and

00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:07,780
I had two test cases and bring it

00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:10,240
forward and then we can edit you with a

00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:12,010
co-author and that's you contributing

00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,120
that's an easy that's a way to find

00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:14,559
thickets where you don't have to do the

00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,660
whole thing yourself because normally

00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:21,280
the solution is sort of if there's a

00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:25,660
pull request open the solution is half

00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:28,030
there we've got a start the other ways

00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:30,580
to look at open the ices like I know 180

00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:32,890
or 200 up and pr's on github most of

00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:35,470
those have been inactive for quite a

00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:38,290
while because it got opened they got

00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:39,730
some reviews they need improvement and

00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:41,740
the original author hasn't had the time

00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:44,020
to finish them so you can just look

00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:46,030
through the PRS and all they've got okay

00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:47,260
you have to read the comments work out

00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:49,540
what the review was but you can

00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:51,280
contribute there is going to be a single

00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:53,520
pull request author who doesn't want

00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:57,100
help with their stalled pull request

00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:58,900
don't be shy there how else might you

00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:00,340
find something work on well is there a

00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:03,460
bit of mango that you're using that

00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:06,570
isn't right so my first patch to tango

00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:10,240
was to do with the template system

00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:13,690
because there's piece of code in crispy

00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:17,980
forms where it's instantiates a template

00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:20,830
without specifying a back-end and in 1.8

00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:22,540
that wouldn't work because you needed to

00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:25,480
specify the backend but there was only

00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:26,980
one so it's the default and go back and

00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:28,870
say where there's only one can we just

00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:31,600
use that and yes we can and so I made a

00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:32,650
patch I fixed it why is it my issue or

00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:37,540
because I was the one who had the

00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:40,480
problem ok the other thing getting

00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:42,370
involved with these are other repos so

00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,860
third port third-party apps are django

00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:47,140
secret sauce I learnt on Jiang res

00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:49,300
framework and there were lots of people

00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:51,130
projects are out there they're all under

00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:52,510
maintained they all need a bit of help

00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:54,790
if you've got time especially if you use

00:32:52,510 --> 00:33:03,730
these akka geez I mean you don't use

00:32:54,790 --> 00:33:05,740
them don't help you just get involved

00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:07,570
and help on a packet you know a package

00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:09,070
that you use and that can be more

00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:11,530
approachable because the cold code base

00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:13,570
is smaller as I said I would love some

00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:15,460
help with boot boot straps for support

00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:17,920
on Krispies forms you want to help me

00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:20,850
with that you know I'm really I'd be

00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:20,850
mega grateful

00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:27,760
to find a ticket there can you help the

00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:29,200
triage that ticket is a valid issue

00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:31,690
what does triage mean well is it a valid

00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:34,330
issue can you reproduce it can you come

00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:36,640
up with the test case it shows the issue

00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:39,250
if you can that's often that's 90

00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:40,660
percent of the job hunt the hardest bit

00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:46,360
is reproducing it and coming up with

00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:47,860
this case often okay once you've helped

00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:50,980
the triage it well the other thing you

00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:55,690
do is submitted PR looks easy

00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:57,310
um this takes time okay you first of all

00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:58,450
you got to do the better can then you

00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:59,740
submit it and you get feedback and

00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:01,420
you'll get lots of feedback in a little

00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:04,300
bit of the formula all you reformatting

00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:06,130
this here oh you've got a blank line

00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:08,260
here you've got to you've got to reroute

00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:12,070
the comments to 79 character loads of

00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:13,660
comment like that pus other Co changes

00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:15,610
how about we restructure it this way and

00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:17,169
then you'll go back and you'll make some

00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:21,100
changes and you'll get more comments and

00:34:17,169 --> 00:34:22,960
this happens everybody gets the same the

00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:28,330
same feedback and it's all about quality

00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:30,640
but it can feel hard right but don't

00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:34,300
take it personally it's not meant to put

00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:37,179
you off it's not meant to be anything

00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:38,890
other than hey let's make patch really

00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:40,710
good because they're why we keep Jango

00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:43,840
at the standard which you all rely on

00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:46,150
okay if it gets if you get into problems

you thinking's yourself I've started to

00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:52,300
pull requests but no I you know can't

00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:55,419
finish it reach out Jango a call

00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:57,460
mentorship again okay it's send an email

00:34:55,419 --> 00:34:58,900
there on this PR I've got this review I

00:34:57,460 --> 00:35:02,260
don't know how to handle it can you have

00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:04,780
someone advice yeah no problem I'm here

00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:07,630
to help him Carlton Gibson on github

if you've not spent any amount of time

00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:21,760
looking at an issue googling it looking

00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:23,590
for solutions then right then right

00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:28,570

qualified for most of the issues that

00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:44,560
I have to open up the code-based read

00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:52,310

django is mature it's stable it's in a

00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:35,240
really good place right it's the web

00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:38,270
framework for perfectness with the

00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:40,910
deadline it's meant to solve the web

00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:44,030
creep problem quickly and for all its

00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:45,830
1,300 open accepted tickets it does that

00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:47,780
very well for the vast majority use

00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:49,460
cases out there and the bit doesn't do

00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:52,040
well we're kind of working on those we

00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:54,020
want to get those done right we have

00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:56,600

[Applause]

00:37:43,519 --> 00:37:46,979
listen I said I wasn't going to take

00:37:45,539 --> 00:37:49,199
questions but this died 10 minutes left

00:37:46,979 --> 00:37:55,229
so does anyone want to ask what I'm

00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:56,909
happy to or not so we have the question

00:37:55,229 --> 00:38:00,589
microphone right over there so if

anybody has any questions please line up

00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:08,970
no yes hey Daniel hey it's good to see

00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:11,609
you

00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:14,369
first of all I talked and there is

00:38:11,609 --> 00:38:17,099
something that I've always sort of

00:38:14,369 --> 00:38:18,480
stopped me from contributing to Django

00:38:17,099 --> 00:38:21,210
and it's this notion that Chang's

00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,540
feature complete that it doesn't need my

00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:23,970
help

00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:27,900
how do i how do I get around that how do

00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:34,980
I find out you know what needs to be

00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:37,230
done okay so you goodbye you

00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:38,849
contributors or protect contributors

00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:41,040
they often come along to the Django

00:38:38,849 --> 00:38:43,920
developers when they say hi I'm you know

00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:45,000
I'm Elizabeth I'm new I'm gonna I want

00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,210
to commit and I've got this great idea

00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,619
for a brand new feature it's like wow

00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:52,980
because it's not the danglers feature

00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:54,660
plate but most features now could be put

00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:56,880
third-party apps or if they can't

00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:58,470
there's room for features but it's

00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,359
difficult to find them but there are

00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:04,260
loads and loads of bucks to fix first of

00:39:00,359 --> 00:39:07,319
all right so first I what I personally

00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:08,970
would do if I didn't have an issue but

00:39:07,319 --> 00:39:09,720
the best way if I've got an issue that

00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:11,849
needs fixing

00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:15,390
I'm personally I'm hitting this problem

00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:17,700
but if failing at is filter by component

00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:19,920
finding component if you like and look

00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:21,809
through the existing issues and see if

00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:24,059
you can solve a bug or two they'll be

00:39:21,809 --> 00:39:27,329
the first place and once you've solved a

00:39:24,059 --> 00:39:28,619
bug or two then maybe your feature start

00:39:27,329 --> 00:39:30,480
to make more sense maybe you see a

00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:34,740
different way around it new doesn't need

00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:36,569
it or it's not the warranty new features

00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:39,690
it's fought the django switcher complete

00:39:36,569 --> 00:39:41,250
its just to come from no loan say I've

00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:43,589
got this new feature it's going to be

00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:45,390
this giant expansion to Django it's like

00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:48,450
that never it's never going to work and

00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:50,369
that often what happens so focus on bugs

00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:53,309
would be mine first and do a couple of

00:39:50,369 --> 00:39:54,109
smaller hatches to get your feet wet and

00:39:53,309 --> 00:39:57,260
get involved

00:39:54,109 --> 00:39:57,260
thank you

00:39:58,999 --> 00:40:05,209
okay I'm gonna lie down huh Russell do

00:40:02,459 --> 00:40:07,709
we have any questions from the internet

00:40:05,209 --> 00:40:09,209
fine okay it's too early the morning for

00:40:07,709 --> 00:40:10,529
the instant fine okay

00:40:09,209 --> 00:40:11,980
that's they'll do that cool thank you

00:40:10,529 --> 00:40:19,179

00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:19,179
