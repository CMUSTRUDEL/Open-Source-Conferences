so Amelia sorry

00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:12,150
first-timer I might get awkward and I'm

00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:14,370
here to tell you about algorithms so

00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:17,460
just a disclaimer I'm not a very big

00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:19,920
genius I'm not going to tell you how to

00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,720
solve a certain algorithm I'm just going

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:26,250
to let you know why I find them fun and

00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:28,260
what's been my experience with it so a

00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:31,769
little bit about me I'm a software

00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:37,440
developer I work with Python i whiten

00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:41,579
fangirl I'm trying to make my switch to

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:43,980
full stack I work in London so basically

00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:48,860
I think that's why I say sorry so often

00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:51,629
I have a casual relationship with

00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:53,750
mathematics meaning that I really love

00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:57,930
it but I'm not very committed to it and

00:00:53,750 --> 00:01:00,239
I am a daydreamer which means that I

00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:02,730
need to be very passionate about the

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:05,610
things that I'm doing so let me tell you

00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:08,450
a little story about myself I was born

00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:12,000
on Thursday no I'm kidding the year is

00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:15,750
2014 and I was just starting my second

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,259
university I was coming from a

00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:21,780
background of biology and physics and

00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:24,860
humanities so I did not know a lot of

00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:27,960
stuff about computer science so I just

00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:31,140
entered whatever group I could find and

00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:38,509
Here I am in an algorithmic support

00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:41,280
group and it just piqued my interest

00:01:38,509 --> 00:01:43,610
mostly because it was about math but

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:47,040
also because it had statements like this

00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:49,350
you're a king and you have 100 pearls of

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,090
wine and wine is poisonous how do you

00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:57,200
find which one is the poisoned one oh

00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:59,880
cool I mean a detective show so I

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:03,540
continue with it I starting entering

00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:05,490
contests my first one were not good this

00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,799
is one of my first contests on code

00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:11,580
forces can you see that drop basically

00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:12,930
everyone starts at 1400 and then you

00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:16,470
just go

00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:17,730
you're not very good at it um but I

00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:20,099
really really liked it and I found

00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:23,939
people who are also passionate about it

00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:27,900
I did notice something whenever I asked

00:02:23,939 --> 00:02:30,689
my work colleagues to join me they would

00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:33,299
say um what do you want me to join you

00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:36,689
for well you see it's not go rhythmic

00:02:33,299 --> 00:02:43,409
contest oh algorithmics do you mean

00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:45,810
bubblesort so I just realized that also

00:02:43,409 --> 00:02:47,609
while looking at the websites that was

00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:50,670
following that most of the audience were

00:02:47,609 --> 00:02:53,970
either students or people trying to get

00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:56,639
a job and the adults

00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:59,730
I mean past students the ones who

00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:02,790
already got the job did not pursue it

00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:05,010
and I could understand them I mean I'm

00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:05,700
an avid reader but if I have a book

00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:10,280
assignment

00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:13,530
I might probably not get that book so I

00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:15,840
find our girl rhythms fun and I'm not

00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:17,549
going to tell you why I find the fun

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,299
because whatever floats my boat might

00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:25,199
not float your boat but I am going to

00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:28,590
tell you how I found them useful and how

00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:34,889
it's I think changed the way I write

00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:38,250
code so the why ah first of all they're

00:03:34,889 --> 00:03:41,159
really good mental exercise you need to

00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:44,280
keep that skill sharp and you could do

00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:48,510
that by learning a new language or you

00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:53,940
can solve a problem it it's very very

00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:58,709
interesting also while studying for a

00:03:53,940 --> 00:04:00,419
problem like for example I really really

00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:04,620
don't understand dynamic programming yet

00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:07,440
and you start to read about that thing

00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:09,209
and you increase your knowledge base and

00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:14,489
you become better at better at what you

00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:18,150
do also I as I said I am a Python lovers

00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:20,870
so I sort of refused to write algorithms

00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:26,290
in C even though they are so much faster

00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:28,960
so basically this made me

00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:33,720
become a little more creative when

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:36,850
writing code because in order to get a

00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:38,260
Python an algorithm to work in fights

00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:40,900
and really really fast you have to be

00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:43,450
creative about how you write that

00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:48,280
certain piece of code also it breaks

00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:52,480
routine because everyday rewrite webs

00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:56,020
websites or I don't know functionalities

00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:57,580
we connected databases we do stuff that

00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:01,840
is important for the people out there

00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:03,610
but we sort of do it every day and the

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,880
most interesting thing we might come

00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:10,450
across is getting a new job and learning

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:12,820
that new project but doing algorithms

00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:16,510
from time to time just breaks that

00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:18,100
routine and makes you realize why you

00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:22,870
fell in love with programming in the

00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:26,260
first place also it helps sorry it helps

00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:28,660
you understand logic pattern and it's

00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:32,350
helps you see how certain things were

00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:34,690
implemented I mean I'm perfectly honest

00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:39,820
about the fact that not all of us need

00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:42,850
to know the stuff that the big guys out

00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:45,820
there who invented the Google or machine

00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:47,230
learning need to know but at the same

00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:49,390
time it's really nice to know how

00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:51,280
something's how a library that you're

00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:55,930
using for example when we're doing

00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:58,030
sorting we're not actually writing the

00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:02,530
sorting algorithms ourselves we just use

00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:04,960
dot sort it's fun but it's nice to see

00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:09,790
how it's implemented and why it's slow

00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:13,030
or fast let me give you an example so

00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:17,440
let's say that one operation is done in

00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:20,800
one microsecond and you have something

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:24,900
that takes an iterations and that n is

00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:30,330
100 if you do it in logarithmic time or

00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:32,740
linear time or even square time it's

00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:35,740
still less than seconds so it's pretty

00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:38,170
great but look at what happens when you

00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:39,820
do it at N to the power of six it's

00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:42,310
three minutes all three minutes

00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:44,650
go make a coffee in that time but hot

00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:48,850
what happens if you do it in to the

00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:51,610
power of n or 2n factorial I ain't got

00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:59,860
anybody time for that my bones will not

00:06:51,610 --> 00:07:02,770
be exist by that time and also it helps

00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:06,670
you improve the way you write code I'm

00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:10,330
going to give you two examples for one

00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:13,570
of them is this thing the dreaded time

00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:17,620
little time limit exceeded and on code

00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:20,890
forces it usually happens either because

00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:26,340
I'm using too many iterations or because

00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:29,350
I'm very stubborn with using Python so

00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:31,900
in order to get past that I'm going to

00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:34,720
have to look a bit at how I'm

00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:37,060
visualizing and solving the problem am I

00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:41,950
using too many sorts because those count

00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:44,380
am i using some sort of inner library

00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:48,790
that i don't know how it works because

00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:51,490
that one comes am I using am i accessing

00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:54,610
something in a list or I'm accessing

00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:56,590
something in a dictionary because those

00:07:54,610 --> 00:08:00,040
things count it helps you see these

00:07:56,590 --> 00:08:03,010
things and also it helped me write much

00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:04,660
prettier code this is a really really

00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:08,550
bad threesome that it's still not

00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:10,990
working and I have no idea why because I

00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:13,450
can't I can't even remember what I

00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:15,880
wanted to do here those wise and Vees

00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:18,130
and noms and di do I know it stands for

00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:24,130
dictionary but everything else like my

00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:27,100
god so since then I've managed to solve

00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:31,420
this problem but I can't fix this one

00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:34,120
implementation also it helps you see

00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:36,840
patterns you read a problem and in the

00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:39,820
back of your hats you feel like oh this

00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:43,599
sounds like buying a research I've done

00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:45,670
binary search or I don't know at one

00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:50,400
time when I was solving many many many

00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:52,340
problems I've realised that I managed to

00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:54,380
actually

00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:57,320
find the best solution for the best kind

00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:58,850
of problem almost instantly based just

00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:03,860
on the fact that I was having exposure

00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:06,890
to it so oh and one more thing almost

00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:09,100
forgot about this one we can think of

00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:12,710
learning algorithms as a social duty

00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:15,110
when we say algorithm we as programmers

00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:19,610
and computer scientists we think about

00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:20,960
maths steps input goes to output but

00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:24,640
when the general public thinks of

00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:27,529
algorithms they think about

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:30,620
recommendation algorithms they think

00:09:27,529 --> 00:09:36,020
about how that time Facebook influenced

00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:38,450
elections or how they are matching you

00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:42,020
on tinder with strangers I don't know

00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:45,230
but the basic thing is that in the

00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:49,220
recent years like since 2017 onwards

00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:53,029
there is starting to be pretty much lack

00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:55,370
of trust towards algorithms and this

00:09:53,029 --> 00:09:59,480
lack of trust is based on a lack of

00:09:55,370 --> 00:10:01,760
understanding I've read a really funny

00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:04,280
story the other day while preparing for

00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:09,350
this talk there is a guy who goes to the

00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:11,450
doctor and the doctor is telling him Oh

00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:15,730
everything is nice with you you just

00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:18,950
have a really rare disease called

00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:25,640
nervous feste itís because I'm nervous

00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:27,500
and he's feeling like what and yeah well

00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,030
you don't actually really have it but

00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:32,270
you have a really high risk for this

00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:35,000
disease and it's 100% fatal so you need

00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:39,920
to take this vaccine in order to help

00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:41,660
yourself so the patient most will

00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,540
probably not go and take the vaccine

00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:47,839
because he's like a machine is telling

00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:51,080
me to do this but if the doctor would

00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:52,520
tell him well in fact you have a high

00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:54,440
risk for the disease because you took

00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:57,670
blood tests and this blood tests have

00:10:54,440 --> 00:11:00,080
shown to have a correlation with other

00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:02,180
people who got the disease and because

00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:05,240
taking all the factors in constitutes

00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:07,610
Oteri's in your era era but because

00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:09,949
the people using the products that are

00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:12,350
based on algorithms to not understand

00:11:09,949 --> 00:11:14,600
them and if we have to as developers and

00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:20,600
understand them we're just creating this

00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:23,959
environment where it it could lead to a

00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:25,730
higher distrust in I don't know

00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:30,559
technology in the future I think it's

00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:33,619
really really bad so I'm going to tell

00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:38,480
you a little bit about how I'm doing it

00:11:33,619 --> 00:11:42,709
it's not the best way um it's just a

00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:45,439
scheme and suggestion so you start by

00:11:42,709 --> 00:11:49,879
finding your sources these sources could

00:11:45,439 --> 00:11:51,439
be anything you could think about do you

00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:54,589
want to study or do you want to practice

00:11:51,439 --> 00:11:58,429
do you want you have a community do you

00:11:54,589 --> 00:12:00,009
have want to have someone teach you or

00:11:58,429 --> 00:12:03,170
do you want to do it on your own and

00:12:00,009 --> 00:12:06,379
based on that you find those sources

00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:08,569
usually I use these websites

00:12:06,379 --> 00:12:12,079
my first favorite are the first three

00:12:08,569 --> 00:12:12,679
the first one mainly because I started

00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,779
with it

00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:19,519
hacker rank has a really really cool

00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:21,470
interface lit code is trying to focus on

00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:24,379
helping you get through the interviews

00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:27,290
but you have really cool paths and the

00:12:24,379 --> 00:12:29,629
last one daily coding problem sends you

00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:33,920
a problem each day for you to solve and

00:12:29,629 --> 00:12:35,360
it helps you get consistent and oh I

00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,189
have something nice to say about this

00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,779
fear online judge they don't show you

00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:41,869
the test so you don't know why you got

00:12:38,779 --> 00:12:45,589
it wrong and that hope makes you think

00:12:41,869 --> 00:12:47,540
about what you need to also do you

00:12:45,589 --> 00:12:51,379
remember this book because I do remember

00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:54,369
them from university days the second one

00:12:51,379 --> 00:12:57,410
is to give me nightmares at the point

00:12:54,369 --> 00:12:59,179
the first one is actually very nicely

00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:02,029
explained but it gets tedious after a

00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:03,889
while because no you read the title is

00:13:02,029 --> 00:13:06,379
crying the coke coating interview it's

00:13:03,889 --> 00:13:08,779
not saying anything for you as a

00:13:06,379 --> 00:13:10,519
hobbyist but if you paired it it

00:13:08,779 --> 00:13:12,819
together and there are many many many

00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:17,839
many books out there that could help you

00:13:12,819 --> 00:13:19,130
study then you go to the next level up

00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,950
solving is

00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:25,820
a concept that I've been introduced to

00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:29,060
by my partner in crimes in algorithmics

00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:32,380
it bakes simply means solving your way

00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:35,840
up and it goes in one or two directions

00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:39,710
first is the point system this is the

00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:41,840
website where which takes problems from

00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:45,620
a couple of other websites such as cold

00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:50,560
forces and puts them into lists and it

00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:53,240
has this concept of a ladder basically

00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:55,820
as you see there are based on ratings

00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:59,110
and in each step of the ladder there are

00:13:55,820 --> 00:14:02,690
100 problems some of those problems my

00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:05,570
my repeating cells but basically if you

00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:08,150
just take them one at a time and if you

00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:09,890
encountered a placate you try to redo it

00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:14,660
because the second time you might have a

00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:19,130
better idea you should find it easier to

00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:21,770
nail those contests also most of the

00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:24,110
websites have a difficulty system code

00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:28,130
force is now introduced system based on

00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:30,230
points but all the others have put them

00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:36,680
into categories like easy medium and

00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:41,860
hard yeah I think I might be rushing a

00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:41,860
bit along with my presentation sorry and

00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:51,020
so yeah that's it next is the topic

00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:53,330
system all the websites are trying to

00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:55,300
add tags to their problems so you know

00:14:53,330 --> 00:15:01,150
that you're solving something concerning

00:14:55,300 --> 00:15:03,740
arrays or greedy or dynamic programming

00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:06,500
basically in this approach what you do

00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:08,750
is you take all the problems that are

00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:13,310
about race and you try to solve all of

00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:18,890
them the advantage of this is that you

00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:20,750
get a more focused approach the

00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:24,020
disadvantage is the first one is that

00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:25,400
you might rush through them and you

00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:28,550
might get under the impression that

00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:31,280
you're doing it right because you're

00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:32,250
going up the ladder but actually you're

00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,960
just

00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:36,300
repeating a pattern because you've seen

00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:38,820
those problems and you got used to them

00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:40,980
and then you take a longer break as it

00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:42,600
happens like three months or more then

00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:44,220
you come back to it and you realize you

00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:47,880
didn't really understand them as well

00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:51,750
whereas this approach helps you get into

00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:55,800
the middle of the problem and sort of I

00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:58,290
don't know become an array guru most of

00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:01,590
the websites also have parts like top

00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:05,400
problems about arrays or something like

00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:06,980
that and that then it's really important

00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:12,570
that you keep track of your progress

00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:16,650
this is something each might just

00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:19,110
personalize it at some point I was

00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:22,050
trying to keep the numbers of problems

00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:25,680
that I was solving also to take a look

00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:29,340
at the ratings that I was having the

00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:31,320
ratings are a bit bad because you might

00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:35,460
have bad days or you might be a nervous

00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:39,060
person just as I am and if I have a time

00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:41,520
ticking near me think you have one and a

00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:44,700
half hours to solve all these problems I

00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:47,130
will do badly and I will have a bad

00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:48,000
score I will get discouraged and I will

00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:50,820
not continue

00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,890
so sometimes ratings are not very

00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:56,160
telling because I might be able to solve

00:16:52,890 --> 00:17:00,089
those I don't know C or D problems that

00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:02,280
means medium or higher if I were in a

00:17:00,089 --> 00:17:07,170
calmer environment but it's still

00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:10,079
something also the number of problems is

00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:12,240
not really telling a lot but it's

00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:16,350
telling you something at some point I

00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:19,020
was having a race with the set partner

00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:22,890
in crimes about which one the bus for

00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:26,910
the most problems and we just realized

00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:29,430
after a while that we just tried to

00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:31,470
outdo the other instead of focusing on

00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:34,620
the problems themselves which is not

00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:37,110
really particularly good but the point

00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:39,660
is you need a metric so whatever you

00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:44,220
choose choose something that suits you

00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:45,360
for me racing someone or competing with

00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:48,149
someone is good

00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:52,019
but taking part in competitions is

00:17:48,149 --> 00:17:55,169
stressful so I don't take ratings into

00:17:52,019 --> 00:18:00,659
consideration then don't forget to

00:17:55,169 --> 00:18:03,360
compete I am a really bad gamer I mostly

00:18:00,659 --> 00:18:05,850
play just for the fun so I do the same

00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:09,090
with competitive programming

00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:11,970
I don't really aim to be the best but I

00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:14,970
just aim to have the fun in it and this

00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:17,700
is what kept my algorithmics loved in

00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:21,899
check over the time there are many many

00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:25,080
many competitions out there code forces

00:18:21,899 --> 00:18:27,720
hacker rank and the others have weekly

00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:30,360
or monthly competitions but what I love

00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:33,090
the most are these ones the ones that

00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:36,899
happen once maybe twice a year my

00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:39,990
favorite one is the hash code the Google

00:18:36,899 --> 00:18:43,620
hash code have many np-complete well

00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:45,779
have only np-complete problems and what

00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:49,220
I really like about it is that they

00:18:45,779 --> 00:18:54,659
don't have a good answer you just try to

00:18:49,220 --> 00:19:00,059
get as many points to serve as many

00:18:54,659 --> 00:19:02,070
orders or to send a call to as many

00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:05,159
service as possible or whatever the

00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:07,830
statement of to that year is instead of

00:19:05,159 --> 00:19:09,990
just having a number of problems and

00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:12,779
trying to get the right answer which is

00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:16,500
fixed like all the others but cold

00:19:12,779 --> 00:19:21,120
catalysts had contests a couple of years

00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:23,789
back about astronomy and that's really

00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:27,590
really grinded my oh no grind my gears I

00:19:23,789 --> 00:19:33,750
think it's a bad thing I really loved it

00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:37,820
because I loved the subject and so that

00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:37,820
made me solve the problems more ardently

00:19:38,029 --> 00:19:46,679
then it's really important that you

00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:48,870
gamify everything I love badges not a

00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:53,220
lot of not a lot of a lot of websites

00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:55,350
have badges added to them these are from

00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:57,539
hacker rank Oh

00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:59,040
regarding algorithmics only the first

00:19:57,539 --> 00:20:02,450
one is important because

00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:07,200
it's really realized to problem-solving

00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:11,130
but you could try to make your own game

00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:15,000
out of it like I said I raise that one

00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:17,070
is me on a code forces contest last year

00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,410
I gained a lot of points and talking

00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:28,140
about shadow Friday my friend got

00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:32,430
downgraded and we come back to finding

00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:36,300
your sources so basically this whole

00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:39,360
scheme is not a cycle it looks something

00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:44,190
like this because finding your sources

00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:47,700
is related to competing and competing is

00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:51,420
related to gimme gimme fiying and

00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:55,940
keeping progress and up solving and all

00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:55,940
of them are tightly coupled together and

00:20:56,180 --> 00:21:06,440
you can't have one without the other I

00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:11,490
think so this is pretty much it

00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:14,100
algorithmics is fun I think we should

00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:17,280
all try to keep on going with it

00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:20,730
albeit not at really proficient level no

00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:22,820
one asks us to reinvent the wheel and

00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:26,940
[Music]

00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:30,000
that's it I think I rushed a bit please

00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:33,530
ask questions if you have any don't ask

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,530
me to explain algorithms please

00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:48,200
[Music]

00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:48,200
[Applause]

00:21:51,690 --> 00:22:13,960
okay how did you start so as I said I

00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:17,410
went to that University group but what

00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:21,190
really kept me going was competing with

00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:25,810
friends we were just ordered pizza and

00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:28,180
staying late at the office and brag

00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:31,500
about who got the most points which was

00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,500
actually really really cool

00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:40,900
that's quite inspiring thank you thanks

00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:42,670
Julia you mentioned that one of the

00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:45,700
advantages of doing this is that you

00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:48,790
start to see patterns from your

00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:51,100
experience solving these puzzles and

00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:55,840
problems but I wonder if you could give

00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:57,850
some examples of real-life problems that

00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:01,150
you've been able to solve better or

00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:05,170
faster or maybe at all as a result of

00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:07,290
having exposure to the problems through

00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:10,210
the in the problem solving exercises

00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:13,390
well I don't have much experience with

00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:16,900
it because what I've been working until

00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:23,200
now is not very high class but I do have

00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:27,250
one instance when a couple of years back

00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:30,130
at a previous job I managed to make some

00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:33,010
requests go a little bit faster just

00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:36,850
because I was I was looking at how the

00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:39,130
code was implemented and I was thinking

00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:42,790
about the time complexity and I was like

00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:45,160
oh this is done an ode add an to the

00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:50,710
power of three the wonder is working

00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:51,059
like that so I think seeing the time

00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:53,399
comes

00:23:51,059 --> 00:23:56,309
city you were bringing to the product

00:23:53,399 --> 00:24:01,499
when writing the code is a really really

00:23:56,309 --> 00:24:04,710
great help I had a question thanks for

00:24:01,499 --> 00:24:07,830
taking this up what do you do when you

00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:09,870
you know feel the fight a fifth time or

00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:13,080
sixth time because it is really

00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:15,240
intimidating you have thoughts to give

00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,980
up on the programming so what do you do

00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,590
then

00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:23,940
well I did take breaks from time to time

00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:26,129
but now what I realized helped me during

00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:28,499
those time is just take a step back

00:24:26,129 --> 00:24:30,929
usually I take pen and paper because

00:24:28,499 --> 00:24:34,740
sometimes it works best and just having

00:24:30,929 --> 00:24:37,730
my laptop in front of me and try to to

00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:43,679
solve it as a math problem instead of a

00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:45,990
computer problem what do you do when you

00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:48,330
face memory out-of-bounds error because

00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:51,299
I face them a lot I write the program

00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:54,659
like it is everything seems correct and

00:24:51,299 --> 00:24:57,149
the Ryan part but when it comes to the

00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:59,009
programming part it becomes a memory

00:24:57,149 --> 00:25:01,889
out-of-bounds error so what do you do

00:24:59,009 --> 00:25:03,629
then I only had that once during a

00:25:01,889 --> 00:25:07,259
contest and it was very weird because

00:25:03,629 --> 00:25:09,840
I've never seen it before but I usually

00:25:07,259 --> 00:25:13,379
try to use the to try to find the best

00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:16,529
data structure such I don't have to keep

00:25:13,379 --> 00:25:19,080
a lot of different states when solving a

00:25:16,529 --> 00:25:22,289
problem so if you choose the different

00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:25,440
data structure then you can apply all

00:25:22,289 --> 00:25:28,799
kinds of operations on it without having

00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:34,789
to get from a dictionary to a list to a

00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:34,789
Sat to whatever else thank you so much

00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:40,859
