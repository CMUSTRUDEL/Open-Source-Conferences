00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:20,820
Python Brazil came in it for you first I

00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:27,119

Brazil boy and all these pieces together

00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:58,020
it's kind of like me and well what I

00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,910
would say pilot will become the biggest

00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:04,680
pile a Brazil chapter in the word really

00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:08,729
means there there are somewhere here who

00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:12,420
never heard about Palace before no one

00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:15,420
what is fine ladies my ladies is an

00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:18,060
international group focus on help more

00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:21,720
women becoming active and participant

00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:24,860
and leaders in Pinal open-source

00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:27,720
community my ladies like a huge group

00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:31,740
with more than 100 chapters and more

00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:35,070
than we don't know the exactly number of

00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:41,450
super chapters but just Brazil had 32b

00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:45,000
chapters so it's very huge ok Brazil

00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:47,250
became the biggest pilotis in number of

00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,549
stupid chapters what are these really

00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:53,130
means but Brazil's very huge is favored

00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:57,390
largest and the mission today is tell

00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:59,369
you how we encourage people who live far

00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:03,540
away from the center's to start new

00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:05,399
replies illuminated chapters so a little

00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,759
bit how the growth of group eyes in

00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:11,039
Brazil or responsible to create a

00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:15,590
sedative warm and receptive environment

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,590
they create beautiful calm

00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:23,680
and this environment becomes very we

00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:27,580
built very before Pilate assaleh and

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:29,350
related residue creation and it started

00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:31,690
with the wheeled of sharing and

00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:36,910
knowledge interactive developers and

00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:40,900
find new projects and the spike on dates

00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:44,290
are just two years after the pike on

00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:46,360
Wales us and the desire of sharing

00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:49,840
knowledge is done a whole new movement

00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:53,440
and these start was definitely the

00:02:49,840 --> 00:03:00,280
creation of a pie be the pie on Brazil

00:02:53,440 --> 00:03:03,400
Association and palamazoo Association is

00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:06,489
a non-profit entity responsible for

00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:11,010
legal and accountable for the organizers

00:03:06,489 --> 00:03:14,440
of national radio to regional events and

00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:16,630
why am I being so important I don't know

00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:22,080
how many of you ever tried to organize a

00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:26,470
media or big event but looked like this

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:28,989
and we have to prevent the Piton - from

00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:32,470
Brazil - getting crazy with accounting

00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:38,560
in legal contract issues and a pie being

00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:41,650
started to solve this problem was not

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:47,040
perfect we will also have contract -

00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:52,000
issues and a culture issues but the

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:58,810
great Association and have so many event

00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:01,329

Brazil is a huge country if a very big

00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:22,930
socio-economic disparity so if you if we

00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:25,360
from violent brazil community want to

00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:27,260
make a national impact you have to talk

about

00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:34,280
defense are not just gender and humans

00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:21,250
those skills to know what needs to be

00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:23,920
done how do you recruit the people the

00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:25,870
right people into your organization to

00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,199
have those skills to let you do those

00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:28,199
things

00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:43,270
no and it's like the reverse way we

00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:47,080
recruit people with the wheel and teach

00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:51,460
them how to organize event as I collect

00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:56,100
that you don't actively look for someone

00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:58,180
who knows how to do account we contract

00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:02,220
lawyers

00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:12,839
I don't know saying accounting a culture

00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:15,970
and we contract them they pay for it and

00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:18,480
directly following from your answer how

00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:24,790
do you recruit people with the will to

00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:27,160
organize and surprisingly there are a

00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:32,050
lot of people with the will in Brazil

00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:34,480
and it is not a job world you don't have

00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:39,940
struggle to do that we'd say you will

00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:43,060
have a vent and happened one question

00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:45,160
for me I'm from Argentina so I'm always

00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:47,550
interested in the Django and the

00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:50,440
open-source community in South America

00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:54,880
do you think companies actually care

00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:56,350
about open source communities in Brazil

00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,510
for example do you think companies

00:17:56,350 --> 00:18:00,940
actually give employees time to

00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:03,430
contribute kind of going back to what

00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:05,890
Carlton was saying like take 10% of your

00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:09,400
pay time to contribute do you think

00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:12,490
that's a reality in Brazil yards so we

00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:14,800
have some some companies we pay for

00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:20,320
there you know as well like Eventbrite

00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:23,590
and started gdz starting now

00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:25,650
but this is happening for example is

00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:29,260
your company paying for your

00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:35,100
trip here I'm biting on my company so

00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:35,100
[Laughter]

00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:44,310
actually I wanted to answer the last

00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:47,970
question yeah so how we get people to

00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:51,750
organize events I came into the Python

00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:53,730
community from like I didn't know how to

00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:56,910
program I started programming from the

00:18:53,730 --> 00:19:01,590
Python community and I have always had

00:18:56,910 --> 00:19:03,390
such a warm welcoming that now I want to

00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:07,170
give back and now I'm organizing an

00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:11,190
event in my region so basically that's

00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:13,920
how the thing grows we get into the

00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:16,710
community community from that effort

00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:20,010
from those people that bring us there

00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:22,310
and now that we are there we just want

00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:27,770
to give back and then we start

00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:27,770
organizing new things so things go go on

00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:37,500
okay Thank You Tyson you did great and

00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:40,700
now the moment you've all been waiting

00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,700
