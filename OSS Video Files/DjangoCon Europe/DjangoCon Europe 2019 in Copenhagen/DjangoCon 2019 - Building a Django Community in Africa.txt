jungles of the foundation on Twitter

00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:09,319
plasmid Rey and github no allow any kind

gmail.com alright alright so let get

00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:20,239
started building a jungle community in

00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:23,060
Africa the beauty of community is that

00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:25,420
it connects people uni or gather here I

00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:29,120
here because of the love we have for

00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:31,819
jungle and jungle community brought us

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:35,690
all together the heart of every

00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:39,049
community is its members with all its

00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:42,980
members there is no community building

00:03:39,049 --> 00:03:44,780
together makes us stronger I would like

00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:48,290
to share a quick story about how it's

00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:50,030
all started and where we are now and

00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:54,410
there is this particular initiative

00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:56,690
called jungle girls and I hope all of

00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:57,980
you know about jungle girls I mean if

00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:01,569
you don't know about jungle girls

00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:04,459
alright so jungle girls workshop allows

00:04:01,569 --> 00:04:06,769
how allows people to learn how to

00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:11,299
program and instill it to work for

00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:13,310
ladies to learn how to code so I

00:04:11,299 --> 00:04:17,750
happened to attend my very first jungle

00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:21,829
girls in Ghana dice early 2017 in April

00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:23,930
and I was so excited about the ladies

00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:26,780
interested in linear learning how to

00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:29,120
code so in the course of the training I

00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:32,450
realized that there are different

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,220
categories of people and some like

00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:36,680
following and be able to build their

00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:39,680
block and some like these know our team

00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:41,330
and some are also looking for e on the

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,360
keyboard like the actually struggling

00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:46,700
and I was like how can I have solve the

00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:49,330
the ones that are not having access to

00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:52,250
dispatch or are not following the whole

00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:54,650
workshop so I decided to create a

00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:57,770
tutorial for them so that at their own

00:04:54,650 --> 00:05:01,270
pace they will be able to

00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:05,689
Judea block whenever they have time and

00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:10,009
then another workshop there's another

00:05:05,689 --> 00:05:12,319
call for coaches to mentor at another

00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:14,509
jungle girls event and this particular

00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:16,310
workshop is same in Canada is that

00:05:14,509 --> 00:05:19,999
actually the second workshop in Ghana

00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:22,909
and this workshop is hosted by Nigerians

00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:24,860
no not granny's and I was like why would

00:05:22,909 --> 00:05:26,960
someone travel from the integers coming

00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:28,460
was jungle girls with all this has been

00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:33,199
done because of the love of the

00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:34,729
community and we were like ok what can

00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,560
we do again there's another issue

00:05:34,729 --> 00:05:39,710
because all these vessels are being

00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:42,830
heard in the cities but not in the rural

00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:47,300
areas so I am a friend or colleague or

00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:49,400
money we decided to host our very first

00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:53,389
jungle girls workshop and I was heard in

00:05:49,400 --> 00:06:00,110
who in the Vitara Jean of Ghana during

00:05:53,389 --> 00:06:02,479
the Fatah workshop and we decided to we

00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:05,870
were discussing about how we can have a

00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:08,509
community that can see to all these

00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:10,789
things so that fact glad jungle girls

00:06:08,509 --> 00:06:12,830
workshop leads to the formation of

00:06:10,789 --> 00:06:15,949
titans of the community in Ghana and

00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:18,289
last year we hosted our very first bike

00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:21,460
on and this year we will host in Pike on

00:06:18,289 --> 00:06:26,210
Africa I'll talk about that later

00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:28,990
so looking at this but club map map of

00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:32,899
Africa this represent the coverage of

00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:36,979
workshop being hosted in in Africa

00:06:32,899 --> 00:06:40,089
jungle girls workshop what you are seen

00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:42,889
is in the in the years to come

00:06:40,089 --> 00:06:46,909
focusing this one year we should see

00:06:42,889 --> 00:06:51,710
that all this workshop of applicate over

00:06:46,909 --> 00:06:54,110
further whole Africa and what this map

00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:56,360
is also telling us is that we have

00:06:54,110 --> 00:07:01,879
developers in Africa that making use of

00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:03,649
the jungle framework and patent and the

00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:06,259
reason why the item in this workshop is

00:07:03,649 --> 00:07:10,490
to connect with other developers Len

00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:12,980
shared network and collaborate aside

00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:14,720
teaching their ladies do we have a

00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:19,460
community that brings all these

00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:22,190
developers together no this a pitcher of

00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:24,620
iron respondent Anza also a developer

00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:27,020
Django developer we went on a road trip

00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:29,210
with a motorcycle to attend one of the

00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:31,280
jungle girls workshop in the northern

00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:35,780
part of Ghana from Italy one point seven

00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:38,690
thousand kilometres and we went there we

00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:41,480
met a young lady 11 years ago so it's

00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:45,410
very rare in Africa to see kids couldn't

00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:48,260
actually so we had this encounter with

00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:50,420
the lady they're so excited that anytime

00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:52,700
people see me they were like a jungle

00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:55,940
lady or jungle or whatever they'd be

00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:58,010
calling me oh so these are this shows

00:07:55,940 --> 00:08:01,340
the love we have for the community or we

00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:05,060
want to give back to give back to our

00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:07,370
society my colleague Abigail and I

00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:10,160
conducted a survey recently and we asked

00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:14,000
if they would like to have a community

00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:17,800
in their cities and we had responses

00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,660
we've received responses from Ghana

00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:25,280
Mozambique Nigeria Rwanda South Africa

00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:28,070
Uganda Zimbabwe and the race and 96

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:31,420
percent i interested 96 percent says

00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:35,440
they are interested in having a city a

00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:39,590
community in their city and then we have

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:41,990
4.0 which are in 50/50 if you would like

00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:49,340
to have although they are no interested

00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:52,210
and we we had zero for no so what does

00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:56,510
that mean it means that having a

00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:58,910
community in Africa will edit will

00:08:56,510 --> 00:09:01,640
provide an opportunity for developers to

00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:03,710
contribute to that to the jungle

00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:06,050
framework we are not going to be just

00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:09,680
users of the framework but we also be

00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:12,230
contributing to the framework I said

00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:16,070
that jungles about ten languages for now

00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:18,830
and with the help of a community in

00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:22,340
Africa it will aid in the indigents

00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:24,000
contribute to the language to

00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:25,740
contributing to the

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,840
local and/or translating the

00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:31,020
documentation of jungle to the local

00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:33,690
languages tutorials will also be written

00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:36,600
in the local languages web I became

00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:40,290
developers in the patch play area based

00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:42,960
on our survey they were like the some of

00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:45,240
the African countries things like an OGG

00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:48,510
and the languages that they speak that

00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:50,520
mentation doesn't have the particular

00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:55,370
language for them so they find it very

00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:55,370
difficult to make use of the dis amazing

00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:06,150
this amazing framework so this will

00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:09,000
provide a platform for them to make

00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:11,520
tutorials in these I say that it's also

00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,590
having a community will provide us a

00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:16,050
like we will be able to host workshop

00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:18,930
and trainees to learn more about the

00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:21,480
jungle framework new new updates and

00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:24,540
everything contribute as well and this

00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:27,900
was so create an awareness for us to

00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:30,240
create an awareness with workshop as a

00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:33,720
lot of people heard about the jungle con

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:37,080
in Europe on Twitter as a trial having a

00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:39,360
workshop for instance in for instance we

00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:43,589
also were aiding promoting the jungle

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:45,480
framework in Africa aside that is going

00:10:43,589 --> 00:10:47,460
to also strengthen the relationship

00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:50,370
between Django developed ways to bring

00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:56,960
all develop or develop AIDS in Africa to

00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:56,960
meet and then network so what's nice

00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:05,089
later this year will be hosting a very

00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:10,050
fierce jungle summit or Congress and

00:11:05,089 --> 00:11:12,210
after the Congress in 2020 we are we are

00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:13,680

first time and we have a team dedicated

00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:36,280
working tirelessly to actually make this

00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:35,040
really excited to find out about Django

00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,400
in Africa I hope I manage to get there

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,520
one day

00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:41,040
I would like to know your thoughts about

00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:44,970
what you have done have any any advice

00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:48,810
you have about building a community you

00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:50,610
know an area as large as Africa you have

00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:52,860
I'm guessing language issues in some

00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:55,110
cases you know different different

00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:57,750
cultures different countries you're

00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:59,550
dealing with Australia is big and we

00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:01,980
have difficulty pulling together a

00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:04,290
national Python community and a national

00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:06,600
django community do you have any tips

00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:07,650
for how for how you have been able to

00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,780
pull it together even though you've got

00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:13,350
the additional barriers of languages and

00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:14,870
cultures and yeah alright so if I get

00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:18,420
you right

00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:19,920
we've regards to that what do we plan of

00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:22,440
doing is to have different different

00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:25,470
metals at different different countries

00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:29,280
and then later we all come together and

00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:40,530
who's they have a successful conference

00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:43,740

great and meeting you in person

00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:50,580
so my question is very similar to

00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:54,390
Russell's of with with bow with Pike on

00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:57,240
Africa coming up in August and things

00:13:54,390 --> 00:14:00,690
like that how what we sources are you

00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:03,390
are you usually utilising mostly and how

00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:05,550
can we help and participate and when

00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:06,380
call for proposals come out where should

00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:09,360
we be listening

00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:11,940
alright so we'll be creating to tie a

00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:15,000
channel and also be pushing on their

00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:16,650
mailing list yeah Melanie so you

00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,500
actually broadcast all those

00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:21,780
informations so if regards to the way

00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:27,360
they can possible ways of

00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:28,340
soon as we if you mean PyCon Africa all

00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,560
of the above

00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:34,950
alright so for PyCon Africa we've

00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:38,370
actually opened Co for proposal and you

00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:50,280

on Africa

00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:30,900
and we also if you want to sponsor us

00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:34,470
here is the link to see our sponsorship

00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:37,620
packages that we have and now if you

00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:40,920
want to connect with us yeah our handles

00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:42,420
onto topic on Africa Facebook back on

00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:44,400
Africa and you can join our slack

00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:46,680
channel to get to know people that are

00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:55,830
traveling to Ghana to experience the

00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:59,330
very face pack on Africa so yeah very

00:15:55,830 --> 00:16:04,640
inspiring I'd like to know more about

00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:07,860
those financial and structural needs

00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:10,410
like we I think we probably face the

00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:14,910
same problems in Brazil as you face

00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:17,580
there we have like huge territory and we

00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:20,010
make a huge effort to bring not only

00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:23,820
gender diversity but also social

00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:27,240
diversity and the main problem we have

00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:29,250
normally is financing all those events

00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:33,780
because you have to bring tutors you

00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:35,279
have all of structural things to like

00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:38,660
come up with

00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:42,680
how do you have a like special way of

00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:45,660
providing that or just like going to

00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:48,810
companies and asking for sponsors

00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:52,560
all right so if regards to funding of

00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:54,350
our event it's very difficult in to be

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:57,360
sincere it's very difficult to get

00:16:54,350 --> 00:17:00,089
sponsorship from our local companies so

00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,490
we rely on international organization so

00:17:00,089 --> 00:17:04,799
mostly when you take a look at all the

00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:08,329
jungle girls workshop heard in Ghana or

00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:11,280
other parts of Africa I realized that

00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:13,020
the majority goes to in like their

00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,750
funding or that we get her from

00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:17,159
international organizations without that

00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:21,059
much class of what I don't think we'll

00:17:17,159 --> 00:17:23,970
be able to make a hostess but flowers

00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:26,069
also we rely on international

00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:28,439
organization we hope the local companies

00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:33,630
who actually come on board to support us

00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:35,370
yeah thanks hi thanks for the talk I

00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:37,020
would like to ask was the most difficult

00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:38,730
thing that he faced in building a

00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:40,590
community because coding is not

00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:42,690
something that everything everyone is

00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:46,549
passionate about so how do you can do

00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:49,880
that interest in people all right so I

00:17:46,549 --> 00:17:53,850
forgot to say this so when we who said

00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:57,510
dispatch by jungle girls workshops we

00:17:53,850 --> 00:18:00,840
have midwives that got like when they

00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:03,990
deface and contact this particular code

00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:06,690
coding they were like wow I think I can

00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:09,000
do this part time and then yeah they

00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:11,789
actually learn how to code now and they

00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,650
are also giving back to a society we

00:18:11,789 --> 00:18:17,159
have necess chemical engineers who don't

00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:20,179
have anything to do with computing yet

00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:22,950
they able to experience this and also

00:18:20,179 --> 00:18:25,980
giving back to the society yeah

00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:28,679
so with people who don't have interest

00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:31,350
or people don't have the necessary min

00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:35,179
of length so we will have a meet-up that

00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:38,669
we can enlighten more people about

00:18:35,179 --> 00:18:40,860
coding what you can do with it so I

00:18:38,669 --> 00:18:46,470
think that's how we will be able to draw

00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:49,010
them to this particular community thank

00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:49,010
you yeah

00:18:50,389 --> 00:18:57,090
Thank You Noah I wonder if you could say

00:18:54,389 --> 00:19:00,179
something about for the potential

00:18:57,090 --> 00:19:03,720
travelers to app icon Africa or other

00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:06,570
events in in Africa because many of us

00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:09,720
we travel very happily within Europe or

00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:12,570
between Europe and and the US and we're

00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:15,899
in familiar territory speaking languages

00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:19,289
we know using currency we know in cities

00:19:15,899 --> 00:19:21,570
we are may be familiar with already but

00:19:19,289 --> 00:19:24,659
for many people traveling to Accra for

00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:27,330
example it'll be a brand new experience

00:19:24,659 --> 00:19:29,759
and I wanted firstly if you would have

00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:33,869
any advice for the potential traveler

00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:36,210
and secondly if you have any plans to

00:19:33,869 --> 00:19:37,980
help those travelers who are coming from

00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:39,929
very different places and cultures and

00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:44,639
countries when they when they arrive to

00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:47,879
orient them okay so Accra Ghana is very

00:19:44,639 --> 00:19:53,119
peaceful and very friendly for we
