so hi I'm Joey I'm again fell apart over

00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:11,389
scanner film studios in netherlands

00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:13,460
normally i talk about things like game

00:00:11,389 --> 00:00:15,620
engines and loading blend files and

00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:18,169
nobody cares about that it's now all

00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:20,570
about virtual reality so we have been

00:00:18,169 --> 00:00:23,599
contributing a project called open hmd

00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:25,070
and it's hardware agnostic

00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:29,169
multi-platform head mounted display

00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:32,210
driver so what we did if we took

00:00:29,169 --> 00:00:36,170
hardware like oculus rift like the fear

00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:37,670
fearful a totem like the HTC five

00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:40,039
basically everything we can get our

00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:42,050
hands on reverse engineer the entire

00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:44,329
protocol and build a hardware agnostic

00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:47,660
driver with a simple interface people to

00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:51,710
use so our idea is to be able to do

00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:54,679
stuff like this while not infringing on

00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:56,600
all guides of licenses and difficult ap

00:00:54,679 --> 00:01:01,489
ice it can match and all those facebook

00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:03,649
crap so so the project access for a

00:01:01,489 --> 00:01:06,080
couple of years now and everything is

00:01:03,649 --> 00:01:07,730
built-in see and we have C++ bindings we

00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,940
have Java bindings with python bindings

00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:15,080
and even pearl for two people still use

00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:17,600
plural and we starting to port to other

00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:19,340
kind of things like C sharp and unity

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:23,930
and create al-qaeda plug and stuff like

00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:25,460
that so it's basically a driver there

00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:27,440
are a couple of projects already using

00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:29,960
it our own engine massive engine is

00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:34,750
using it never ball never put like open

00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:37,430
source project even PMD which is a

00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:39,430
visual molecular dynamics which is a

00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:44,720
really big scientific library for the

00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:48,590
visualization of of molecules and we're

00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:50,780
currently looking into more supports for

00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:52,430
different kind of applications helping

00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:54,770
people out with integrating fee our

00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:57,070
support in der game engines and of

00:01:54,770 --> 00:02:00,800
course missing meeting other kinds of

00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:02,510
people who are working on HMDs and

00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:05,180
cameras and all kinds of things as to do

00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:08,239
it virtual reality so if people are

00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:10,610
interesting interested the project is

00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,499
called open hmd we're on github for cus

00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:13,350
its boost license you can do whatever

00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:19,280
you want with

00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:19,280
and I think that's about it okay

00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,340
