hello I'm Jacob immigrants I work for

00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:22,990
Culebra I currently have more slides

00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:27,300
than I have minutes so this is going to

00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:29,919
be very much click click click and yes

00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,500
so I'm gonna talk about excel and things

00:00:29,919 --> 00:00:34,809
like that and what is XR that's

00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:37,989
basically a common name for all of the

00:00:34,809 --> 00:00:39,640
but realities that they are coming up

00:00:37,989 --> 00:00:44,379
with nowadays so what you're ready I'm

00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:46,720
going to reality mixed reality and so if

00:00:44,379 --> 00:00:48,489
you want to do things like that like how

00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:51,070
do you do what your reality on Linux I

00:00:48,489 --> 00:00:54,010
think tonight you and you have optical

00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:56,440
in general you have the open source

00:00:54,010 --> 00:01:00,309
things up initially once we are I also

00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:02,559
have open VR or steamvr

00:01:00,309 --> 00:01:06,190
and you have oculus but there's a

00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:11,140
problem you know there are so plus tax

00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:13,690
and then there's Cossacks and and these

00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:18,729
are all different IPs and people don't

00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:21,310
really and they said people don't what

00:01:18,729 --> 00:01:23,680
right through the different api's so you

00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:25,509
have this situation where people are

00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,150
writing towards a whole bunch of

00:01:25,509 --> 00:01:30,909
different IPS as almost math very first

00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:32,650
have one API which is open X R and what

00:01:30,909 --> 00:01:35,799
you need to know is this is bad and this

00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:43,450
is good you should go for open X are

00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:44,740
analysts and open X R is a touch a API

00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:47,500
that the chromeless working group is

00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:49,720
working on and hopefully some time it

00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:52,090
will be released but we're also working

00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:55,240
on that inside of Clara we're both

00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:58,840
having up with a the specification but

00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:02,079
also working on a runtime for that and

00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:03,909
what is Chronos that's an industry group

00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:06,460
that does open GL Balkans we probably

00:02:03,909 --> 00:02:09,880
heard of it it's a very foreign thing

00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:11,590
unfortunately for most people except for

00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:17,640
maybe a few of us here that actually has

00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:19,900
gone to meetings so they just basically

00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,549
push out api's and then we implement

00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,110
them and then people can actually use

00:02:21,549 --> 00:02:25,109
some platforms because now there's a

00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:27,790
common thing that everybody can target

00:02:25,109 --> 00:02:29,600
so that's not really good but what we

00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:32,420
cloud brands especially me

00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,710
to build a community around poor Excel

00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,710
things like virtual reality and

00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:38,390
augmented reality a place where you can

00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:39,920
there can be all the code and lot of

00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:43,190
libraries and lot of share things that

00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:45,800
people can work with and build up both

00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:49,730
you know just hacking on you inside a

00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:53,480
garage where basically modern everyday

00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:55,910
they we all started out with but also

00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:58,160
you know making products or just playing

00:02:55,910 --> 00:03:01,610
around or think that becoming sort of a

00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:04,910
little bit of Mesa for X or what should

00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:11,630
our team until then we are hosting a

00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:14,240
