XR is exciting but the first thing we do when we find or create something we love is to share it. For that the web is and remains the platform. The web also brings unique properties like being able to see the source code of a page. As such an early stage of XR this means learning faster together. This talk will explore what is the current of XR on the web, what is the status of current specifications, the performance challenges and how to have an entire FLOSS pipeline to create and experience content on the web.
