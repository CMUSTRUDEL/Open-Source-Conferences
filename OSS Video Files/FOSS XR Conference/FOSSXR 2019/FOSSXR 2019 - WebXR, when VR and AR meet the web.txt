Title: FOSSXR 2019 - WebXR, when VR and AR meet the web
Publication date: 2019-11-27
Playlist: FOSSXR 2019
Description: 
	Fabien Benetou
Mozilla Tech Speaker
XR is exciting but the first thing we do when we find or create something we love is to share it. For that the web is and remains the platform. The web also brings unique properties like being able to see the source code of a page. As such an early stage of XR this means learning faster together. This talk will explore what is the current of XR on the web, what is the status of current specifications, the performance challenges and how to have an entire FLOSS pipeline to create and experience content on the web.

00:00:09,139 --> 00:00:17,910
so short so I don't start to say Who I

00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:19,680
am why do I care about XR what are some

00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:22,769
good open to us examples in term of

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,529
content understanding one example in

00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:27,359
what VR one in where they are that we

00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:27,840
might try life or maybe not depending on

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,050
time

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,759
what I think our exciting new workflows

00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:36,420
and why you should do what you should do

00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:39,420
or maybe not so well the web is a mess

00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:42,239
but in my opinion it's an exciting and

00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:45,090
creative mess because you let anybody do

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,770
anything so I am phenomena to utopia on

00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:49,860
Twitter I work for the European

00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:52,020
Parliament I think nobody knows about

00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:54,690
this but the European Parliament has an

00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,699
innovation service where basically I

00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:58,289
play with gadget so that's not the

00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:00,809
official mission the official mission is

00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:04,170
we do two things we challenge the

00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:06,020
workflow so for example maybe everybody

00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:08,729
is using an abacus instead of using

00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:11,010
proper calculator maybe that's not okay

00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:13,560
maybe architects only drawing on papers

00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:16,259
maybe they could use VR so they are

00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,570
basically try new building proof of

00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:20,909
concept building prototypes try new

00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:23,310
tools basically and yeah the thing is

00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:24,869
maybe those tools are actually scary or

00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,270
creepy so maybe there should be

00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:31,350
regulation around it so that those new

00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:33,600
technologies are used right so I do this

00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:35,850
three days a week and then also I work

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:39,329
for UNICEF I think anybody everybody

00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:41,549
knows UNICEF what I think nobody knows

00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:45,509
does anybody know actually that UNICEF

00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:47,880
has an Innovation Fund okay nobody knows

00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:51,329
so that's good the Innovation Fund is

00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,770
about 15 or 20 million dollars and the

00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:54,570
idea is that you have emerging

00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:56,579
technologies like if you're like they

00:01:54,570 --> 00:02:00,270
are that have a huge potential and that

00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:02,700
can help at scale children's in thousand

00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:04,229
or even millions so you need to find the

00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,759
intersection between those emerging

00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:08,340
technologies that can have a logical

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,840
impact and entrepreneurs who want to

00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:13,709
actually implement it

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:16,590
and then it's fun in schools for nurses

00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:18,690
anyway that can impact them it's too

00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:20,670
hard so that's why I don't do it myself

00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:22,950
and that's why UNICEF doesn't do it but

00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:26,819
that entrepreneurs so I was there in

00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:29,400
Ghana in March or April and in Nigeria

00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:31,950
where we've met Kabir o who has a

00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,480
startup called nubian VR and they want

00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:35,910
to use vo in education I mean they don't

00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:39,030
want to you're working on developing of

00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:42,600
your solution for schools in Ghana other

00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:44,010
ones that are using it for let's say you

00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,380
don't have a chemistry lab you should

00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:48,180
have a chemistry lab but you don't have

00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:50,550
all the tools you need to keep

00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:52,230
everything clean and neat and when you

00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:53,910
don't even have books that might be a

00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:55,650
little bit tricky so the idea is you can

00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:57,480
actually dematerialize it it's not as

00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:59,489
good as the actual physical lab which is

00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:02,670
only so much better than just talking

00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:04,739
about it on a blackboard so I help them

00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:07,500
in term of technical support and also to

00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:09,690
clarify before the break I do not work

00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:13,380
at Mozilla I'm a contributor I'm a most

00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:16,680
XP cur and basically I showcase and play

00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:20,250
with the technology so that's that's how

00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:22,380
do you say the fair warning there and

00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:24,900
still I have some goodies for questions

00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:30,630
at the ends so we'll have to have good

00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:32,040
questions so just out of curiosity quick

00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:34,010
show of hands so to make sure

00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:41,070
everybody's still awake in the morning

00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:43,890
who tried a web PR who tried web er who

00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:46,380
tried WebEx are who build anything in

00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:49,739
WebEx are I guess not if somebody tried

00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:52,470
it who build anything in web VR who

00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:54,480
build anything where they are I mean

00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:56,340
building something it's like having one

00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:06,329
page where you modify in one line of

00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:07,920
code I think that's okay so actually why

00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:10,410
do I care about it and why do I store

00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,239
all this so as you saw from the very

00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:16,169
beginning I have my brain dump on my

00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,519
wiki where I put a lot of stuff too much

00:04:16,169 --> 00:04:19,229
stuff you again you don't want to go

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,690
there but to me it's pretty precious I

00:04:19,229 --> 00:04:22,780
saw

00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:26,290
because I have paper notebooks where I

00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:28,030
write bunch of ideas concept when I'm

00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:30,940
doing inktober same you don't wanna know

00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:33,070
this okay and then sometimes I do

00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:35,080
presentations why I do this

00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:36,460
the problem is it's stuck there so if I

00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:39,460
want to share with you those visuals

00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:42,070
just doesn't get there and what I

00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:43,720
started to do is because when I share it

00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:46,270
I get feedback on it I can improve on it

00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,980
so I started to put it online I stopped

00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:49,840
actually with mind maps before I don't

00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:52,000
know if you tried my Maps works pretty

00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,400
well I like it helps me to summarize but

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,310
at least to me didn't scale I need like

00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,200
something bigger that made links and

00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:00,700
connection issue and then I started to

00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,860
play with weekends like wow this is what

00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:05,170
I need and I can even embed a mind map

00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:07,270
on my wiki so I started to have a wiki I

00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:10,030
could make links easily create new pages

00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:14,170
have embedding when I have a page in a

00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:16,450
page I can have multiple page in a page

00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:18,310
I can have sections of page in pages so

00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:21,310
I can have a lot of freedom in it the

00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:23,680
problem is as I added more ideas got

00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:25,330
frustrating because everything got stuck

00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,370
in these thin layers those three

00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:31,210
millimeters and when I think of my ideas

00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:32,890
I think a little bit like you see in the

00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:35,110
movies also maybe I was a little bit

00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:37,900
influenced but I think ideas are

00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:42,580
floating stuff all around me so I tried

00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:44,710
the dk1 four years ago I think I don't

00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:46,840
know when it was out and I was like well

00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:51,040
first first of all what this is amazing

00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:54,160
I'm somewhere else I was in the what is

00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:55,660
it to scan edmo was pretty cool but then

00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,210
the second thought was like whoa I can

00:05:55,660 --> 00:06:01,450
have my ideas all around me floating as

00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:06,010
posters infinite amount of space fully

00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:08,500
realizing in any other I want and and I

00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:10,390
thought it's exciting and it's good for

00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,860
me but I think it's also there is some

00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:14,320
cognitive basis for it

00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:18,430
I don't know if anybody tried the

00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:19,690
methods of the loci the memory palace so

00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:21,730
basically for those who are not familiar

00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:24,870
with it is you take a place you know

00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:28,120
well it's a your house and then on every

00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:29,740
either in each room or in every place

00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,420
you're very familiar with you put some

00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:34,450
of the items you need to remember

00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:36,700
and then you grow a story around and

00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:38,230
then you it's just a technique but

00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:40,450
you're going to remember you're going to

00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:42,340
somehow this unstructured list is going

00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:44,620
to stick in your mind I thought this is

00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:46,570
strange but it's probably because well

00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:50,710
you don't want to get lost you don't

00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:52,750
want to know where the tiger is not you

00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:55,150
don't want to miss your food you don't

00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:56,350
want to miss the energy for example if

00:06:55,150 --> 00:07:01,180
you're looking for something that

00:06:56,350 --> 00:07:03,060
doesn't so you need basically to

00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:08,680
remember where you went where you are

00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:10,120
and and I just techniques like this from

00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:12,700
underlying structure of the brain and I

00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:17,920
think you're any are can leverage quite

00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:20,020
efficient so I did this which is not

00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:21,550
much yet but which is super interesting

00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:23,230
and important for me which is the wiki

00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:25,930
you saw the web page you saw the very

00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:28,780
beginning but as a kind of little city

00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:31,510
so all the pages based on the length

00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:32,940
base of how many edits I have been done

00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:36,250
the different links they have or

00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:38,530
displayed on a directed forest layout

00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:40,900
and then I can navigate physically

00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:43,090
actually around my thoughts it's not

00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:45,040
that usable it's not there yet but at

00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:46,450
least so this is what I do here this is

00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:50,560
why I thought a couple of years ago to

00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:52,870
to go down that path and it's not just

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,420
for the mind so I had the chance a

00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:59,860
couple of two years ago I think to get

00:07:55,420 --> 00:08:01,420
some terrible neck pain and I had to do

00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:03,430
some exercise I don't know anybody oh if

00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:05,530
you had to do some physiotherapy

00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:08,530
exercise but it's I don't if I can swear

00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:13,900
it's quite boring you need to do things

00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:15,130
like this ten times like this anyway you

00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,900
don't want to have to go through it

00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:18,790
but if you do have to it could be found

00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:20,410
that you have one device I don't have a

00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:22,690
viewer headset around but that knows

00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:26,590
exactly your head position your

00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:28,360
orientation constantly so if you have TV

00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:30,700
series or something you found off like I

00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:32,290
say we can multi you can actually put it

00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:34,000
in there and then the cursor is going to

00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:36,670
let the video play on you when you're

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,700
looking at it so this is also like oh I

00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:41,170
started to play with the art for things

00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,820
that were important and precious to me

00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:45,100
and that I could also help others

00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:47,110
eventually so this is of course

00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:48,850
so if you have at some point you hit

00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:51,459
your therapy you didn't you know it's

00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:53,889
really boring well good let's say

00:08:51,459 --> 00:08:56,040
whatever took you have to watch after

00:08:53,889 --> 00:09:00,100
and then just do the exercise with it

00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:02,110
all this to say that yeah hope everybody

00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:05,110
gets it here but vo is not just for game

00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:05,589
okay entertainment is cool marketing why

00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:07,870
not

00:09:05,589 --> 00:09:12,610
but in practice not just for cooperating

00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:15,279
is whatever we hear make out and yeah

00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:16,889
you have guys in t-shirts that like to

00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:19,990
walk around people so a little bit of

00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:23,410
some of the challenges we might have

00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:26,769
ahead of us yeah I just for example in

00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:29,410
term of UX I think it's like I cannot

00:09:26,769 --> 00:09:32,889
help but recommend Iraklis quest but I

00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:35,079
will not buy it I'm somebody wanted to

00:09:32,889 --> 00:09:37,029
offer me one like no I cannot accept

00:09:35,079 --> 00:09:39,880
this into my few weeks you put the

00:09:37,029 --> 00:09:43,089
device no cable just shove it down six

00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:45,279
dog but then who is doing it for what

00:09:43,089 --> 00:09:46,360
purpose so what happen is so I don't

00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:49,060
have a Facebook account

00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:51,000
now Facebook tools know what's up nor

00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:54,639
whatever I don't have any Google account

00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,430
no drive or anything like this what what

00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:58,690
happens is well of course with open

00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:02,100
source and you a little bit how it was

00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:06,130
working but couple of months ago so

00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:08,889
generally a year ago I read this book

00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:10,779
the rage of civilians capitalism because

00:10:08,889 --> 00:10:13,149
I was like well this is very strange why

00:10:10,779 --> 00:10:14,769
is Facebook investing in the or is it

00:10:13,149 --> 00:10:16,360
just marketing to say oh we were state

00:10:14,769 --> 00:10:17,829
of the art in terms of Technology is

00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,839
there something else I would like okay

00:10:17,829 --> 00:10:22,899
to billions just to do marketing it's a

00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:26,410
bit more than they have deep pockets and

00:10:22,899 --> 00:10:27,310
if you start to think of Facebook also

00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:33,120
what is Facebook

00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:33,120
what is Facebook business model one word

00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:39,670
therefore what advertisement ads and ads

00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,350
is changing your behavior when it's ads

00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:42,730
just to sell you coca-cola it's annoying

00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:44,740
but okay

00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:47,949
why not when it ads to sell you new

00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:50,889
political candidates that's a change

00:10:47,949 --> 00:10:52,540
it's actually is destroying democracy so

00:10:50,889 --> 00:10:54,639
I think this is more than just a little

00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:56,380
bit dangerous I think it's up I

00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:57,510
don't know if I can swear but this is

00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:59,910
wrong

00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:02,220
and when you see vo it's just another

00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:04,290
another flow of data so that they can

00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:08,220
you know your behavior better to change

00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:10,380
it then it's really wrong so just in the

00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:14,160
context of advertisement modifying

00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:15,660
behavior for profit viewers the

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,970
technology remains exciting I have

00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:20,520
friends working at Facebook how you look

00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:22,590
at oc6 I see what they're shipping it is

00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:26,940
great but what is it for

00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:30,060
I don't think it's that great so what is

00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:33,450
great is so those are example of use

00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:36,080
cases from UNICEF so ideas this is a

00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:39,660
startup from Turkey and they are using

00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:41,910
VR for children with PTSD basically they

00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:43,410
get bitten by dogs and then they don't

00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:45,030
want to go out anymore and if you don't

00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:46,320
go out anymore you don't go to school if

00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:48,870
you don't go to school you don't get an

00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,640
education and then life is going to get

00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:52,980
hard so the use of your to basically

00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:55,650
gently with and without the support of

00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:59,100
AB psychologists help them to get back

00:11:55,650 --> 00:12:02,490
outside yes I always have little links

00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:03,960
so those little icons there because the

00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:07,170
open source project so you can actually

00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:11,100
go check the code maybe help them make

00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:13,590
suggestion use it so detail on the

00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:17,520
github how to do it they're using unity

00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:19,320
and or weather or switching to other

00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:21,420
considering switching to webview and

00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:24,480
where they saw and have better

00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:26,160
interaction for the physiotherapist so

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:32,550
that he or she can design their

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:35,010
experiments immediately Dean in Lagos in

00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:36,420
Nigeria the example I mentioned when you

00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:38,490
don't have a chemistry lab in the school

00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:41,970
but you want to build it so they're

00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:43,620
working on this what happened is what

00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:45,780
was it like a year and a half ago I

00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:47,580
discovered that UNICEF actually is

00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:50,250
promoting open source they're seeing it

00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:52,050
as a tool Australia's you cool tool so

00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:53,910
that well hopefully the startup works

00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:55,860
and that's great but then others can

00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:57,840
benefit from it and if it doesn't all

00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:00,480
the work that was invested all those

00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:03,990
code all the code written doesn't have

00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:06,630
to disappear so there were a bunch of

00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:08,420
rupees to ease using teleport me libyan

00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:10,880
that i mentioned before

00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:13,100
video maker from China they are doing a

00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:15,560
pure creation tools all that is on

00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:17,720
github and they're also some detail on

00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:19,370
the open source as a business model how

00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,980
those startups can not just benefit

00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:23,780
because you nice sa open source is good

00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:27,560
you should use it but how it is a

00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:31,370
strategical job some quick other

00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:35,780
examples so anybody who went to the cows

00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:37,430
computer Congress one person who has

00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:38,600
never been to the cows computer who

00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:41,810
doesn't know what the cows can be the

00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:44,240
Congress is ok you know it's cool it's

00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:47,150
it's like it's in what a month-to-month

00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:52,310
is now it is amazing it is it is a crazy

00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:55,460
place but I mean in terms of what is

00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:57,590
technology for and what are the more

00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:59,210
than grey areas there are areas where

00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:00,830
it's wrong I think it's a really

00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:02,720
interesting conference anyway some of

00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:04,760
one of the example was reading with your

00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,350
forum you have you two displays you have

00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:08,300
the upset and you can measure basically

00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:09,740
what is the offset where you're supposed

00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:11,660
to be and where your eyes are actually

00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:13,220
looking and then you can actually adjust

00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:15,380
because you can render the display with

00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:18,680
the expected offset or if somebody has

00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:20,830
some stratagem or any kind of problem

00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:25,720
like this then you can adjust for it

00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:25,720
also on the comb get lamb I think

00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:33,490
it's part of the presentation it's some

00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:36,189
special effects in the background one

00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:40,120
quick example so is Mozilla hub so who

00:14:36,189 --> 00:14:42,730
has been in VR in Mozilla hubs okay

00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:44,889
very few that's good every time you

00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:47,110
don't show up the hands is not up you

00:14:44,889 --> 00:14:48,639
discovering something I hope it's

00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:50,079
basically viewed that you don't have to

00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,730
be alone if you want to be alone in your

00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:53,439
room you can if you want to be alone in

00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:59,500
your room with other people you also can

00:14:53,439 --> 00:15:02,310
and as quick examples I was at I was

00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:06,430
it's funny that I just say this

00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:07,540
conference on you I last week we're

00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:10,420
basically the conference takes place

00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:17,589
physically I think intervals in in the

00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:20,170
u.s. forgot in the US but then you have

00:15:17,589 --> 00:15:21,699
fewer rooms so you have you can go with

00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:23,079
a headset or without headset and then

00:15:21,699 --> 00:15:24,310
you meet people in there you have the

00:15:23,079 --> 00:15:26,350
slides going on you can chat with

00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:28,480
persons you have Co do and then you can

00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:30,610
see on the left also you have the paper

00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,079
that's being discussed so you don't have

00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:35,350
to be physically there if you don't want

00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:37,209
to for whatever reason to

00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:39,100
state-of-the-art of your research and

00:15:37,209 --> 00:15:40,779
also you have I don't know if you're

00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:43,689
familiar with research your podcasts

00:15:40,779 --> 00:15:45,040
amazing podcast but you also have before

00:15:43,689 --> 00:15:47,980
I think it was in big screen you have

00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:51,459
discussions live during the podcast and

00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:53,589
it's being coded and then shared but you

00:15:51,459 --> 00:15:55,779
can't now there's considering at least

00:15:53,589 --> 00:15:57,519
Mozilla helps to host the event and go

00:15:55,779 --> 00:16:03,639
there so it's not just a hop podcast now

00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:05,529
an event in New York so I keep on

00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:07,209
mentioning the web I know most of you

00:16:05,529 --> 00:16:09,009
would come at a lower level than this

00:16:07,209 --> 00:16:12,670
and the argument I hear all the time is

00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:14,259
like well ok VR is great a or is great

00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:16,300
but it's all about performance if you

00:16:14,259 --> 00:16:19,750
don't have performance you'd only hit 60

00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:23,709
90 120 FPS so what what is that for

00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:26,439
well first I'll just do a little how do

00:16:23,709 --> 00:16:28,180
you see my challenge put a bet we go

00:16:26,439 --> 00:16:30,399
outside which we take a random stranger

00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:33,550
not that you need to expert not somebody

00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:36,490
who's writing shaders from 6:00 a.m. to

00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:37,480
3:00 p.m. but somebody who is just a

00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:39,399
normal person

00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:41,739
and then we ask him or her to compare a

00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:44,709
web viewer WebEx or experience with a

00:16:41,739 --> 00:16:46,389
native one and if he or she is able to

00:16:44,709 --> 00:16:49,089
distinguish the two the champagne is on

00:16:46,389 --> 00:16:52,509
me okay so we have until the end of the

00:16:49,089 --> 00:16:55,359
day I'm pretty confident very we can try

00:16:52,509 --> 00:16:57,189
this and then there is the whole

00:16:55,359 --> 00:16:58,389
workflow if you build an idea how you

00:16:57,189 --> 00:17:00,369
actually have to build it you can

00:16:58,389 --> 00:17:02,970
improve your workflow but basically it's

00:17:00,369 --> 00:17:06,039
a bunch of steps you did once it's okay

00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:08,049
but I'm not that smart so usually I do a

00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:09,880
bunch of mistakes which means cycle that

00:17:08,049 --> 00:17:14,230
I need to repeat and as I repeat the

00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:15,880
cycle the difference to Adam so because

00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:18,039
they do add up and because I don't know

00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:19,720
again vo is a new medium I always or

00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:21,730
it's a new medium so we need to explore

00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,500
and that takes a lot of time so the

00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:25,899
longer we need to get a feedback loop

00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:27,579
the longer we need to get some answer

00:17:25,899 --> 00:17:31,000
from the person who is actually using it

00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:32,320
trying it then the slower we go so

00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,059
anything that helps to make the work

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,460
flow faster makes such a big difference

00:17:34,059 --> 00:17:39,580
and also even if you don't care about

00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:43,029
the workflow as was mentioned during the

00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:44,980
interaction it's all about sharing you

00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:45,580
want to share the source and if you on

00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,320
the web

00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:49,899
well you have a fist occation techniques

00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:51,519
but if you were a normal nice person

00:17:49,899 --> 00:17:54,130
then you can just look at the code of a

00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:56,440
web page so in terms of learning quickly

00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:58,090
having the content you just inspect you

00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,679
wipe your page WebEx or page your

00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:05,169
webpage and then you can see how it's

00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:06,970
done if also so I really think vo is

00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:08,529
exciting but it's a black box like

00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:10,269
literally you put the quest you have a

00:18:08,529 --> 00:18:13,870
black box on your face I think that's

00:18:10,269 --> 00:18:15,850
creepy but if you can tear it apart I'll

00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:17,500
turn it up and then see a little bit at

00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:19,000
least how it's working there's a lot

00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,710
more exciting if you start to bring

00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,190
people who work shop let's do a viewer

00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:26,500
workshop and I have to download wanted

00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:28,480
to gigabytes even with a fast connection

00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,980
and then everybody has to install it at

00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,750
the same time basically you spend the

00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:33,580
less the first two how is installing it

00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:35,590
you can't tell people yeah install unity

00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:37,450
before nobody's going to do it so you

00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:38,799
spent the first half was who everybody

00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:40,419
is pumped up and exciting doing

00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:42,190
absolutely nothing interesting

00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:45,340
whereas if you just open a web page

00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:47,260
where all you there plus you need to

00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:49,570
publish it I mean once you have your app

00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:51,100
it's exciting you're going to put it in

00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:53,889
App Store well the top

00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:55,240
then apps is everything Facebook

00:18:53,889 --> 00:18:57,250
everything Google and I think snapchat

00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:59,139
was something of it so good luck I mean

00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:00,850
it's not going to work you're going to

00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:04,630
put more effort into marketing you think

00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:07,720
they're actually getting it used so yeah

00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:12,210
good luck on the App Store's so the

00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:18,179
first expression of your experience

00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:20,799
this is hubs again ignoring the warnings

00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:25,049
it loads a frame so who heard about a

00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:29,500
frame before a couple of fans okay half

00:19:25,049 --> 00:19:31,269
so it's HTML ish so it custom element so

00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:33,940
if you want to write a cube you write a

00:19:31,269 --> 00:19:36,340
cube just as simple as that though term

00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:39,820
of how quickly a newcomer can have a vo

00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:42,360
experience it is really amazing it using

00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:44,620
3GS so who is familiar with which yes

00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:46,059
it's basically it's really on the web if

00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:49,960
you do City on the web like I don't know

00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:52,629
I will say a number after of my hat 80%

00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:55,899
of 3d experience at least on the web

00:19:52,629 --> 00:19:58,210
we're using 3GS and now you have you

00:19:55,899 --> 00:19:59,889
thought to have with multi root you

00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:03,940
thought to have really good performance

00:19:59,889 --> 00:20:06,309
into another of your and it's really and

00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:09,009
WebGL so it's running on your GPU so

00:20:06,309 --> 00:20:11,590
it's not on par but I would say another

00:20:09,009 --> 00:20:12,820
number of out of my hat 80% performance

00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:14,710
again we can go outside

00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:16,649
check with a random stranger he or she

00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:22,149
you see the difference in performance

00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:23,980
how is reminder you got to I to be a to

00:20:22,149 --> 00:20:27,279
perspective a little bit of barrel

00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:29,889
distortion to counteract Lisa cancel the

00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:31,870
lenses can you go to your code and if

00:20:29,889 --> 00:20:34,450
you're the big difference let's say

00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:36,639
before you get posed so you need you

00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:40,299
browser to know what poses to bind into

00:20:36,639 --> 00:20:43,750
the camera just out of curiosity also

00:20:40,299 --> 00:20:44,950
this is the a frame inspector so the

00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:47,169
frame inspectors

00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:50,070
you just taught you a friend page you

00:20:47,169 --> 00:20:53,620
see them content you press ctrl alt I

00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:56,559
correctly and then you have unity or

00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:58,659
some kind of visual inspector so that

00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:00,519
you can grab an element the sphere the

00:20:58,659 --> 00:21:05,399
camera whatever and just move it around

00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:05,399
oh okay that was enough of that slide

00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:11,570
what you can do then well how it works

00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:14,840
and is getting post so that's the big

00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:17,030
novelty let's say of the web VR and now

00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:19,850
WebEx our specification is you get your

00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:21,950
booze again everybody will know but it's

00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:23,690
just the position in space and your

00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:25,130
annotation in space you need the browser

00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:28,700
to actually understand what that is and

00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:30,320
then bind it to your camera and then in

00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:32,690
the browser that can actually support it

00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,700
so there will be a presentation this

00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:37,100
afternoon also on my VR with a bit more

00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:41,540
detail on specification status of the

00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:43,100
specification long story short it's been

00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:46,040
so I started to play with webview about

00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:51,050
three or four years ago every year I've

00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:54,220
been saying okay this is the you fer but

00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:57,380
this is the you of web er specification

00:21:54,220 --> 00:22:00,550
yes I don't learn that that's okay the

00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:04,670
specifications the 1.0 or landing now

00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:10,520
there should be some release for firefox

00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:14,240
reality soon for chrome soon in the

00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:16,670
meantime for dr you can only use firefox

00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:20,150
so if I thought the photon desktop not

00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:24,290
only next just on Windows on Mac OS I

00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:25,970
think so behind flag yeah it is and then

00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:28,820
in Firefox ability which you have on the

00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:34,490
go on the quest and somewhere else and

00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:38,930
then execute who knows execute okay I'll

00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:42,670
clarify a bit after so same here I don't

00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:42,670
need to explain so much but in the end

00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:48,380
inside our tracking you find your few

00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:50,780
points you invert them to your position

00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:52,670
your intention and then it shipped back

00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:54,950
to the browser and then you get your

00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:56,780
pose you bind it to the camera and voila

00:22:54,950 --> 00:23:02,030
you have your web your experience your

00:22:56,780 --> 00:23:04,310
web experience in term of controllers I

00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:07,940
was briefly discussing around coffee I

00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:10,940
think VR NER

00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:12,860
we focus on the visuals it has to be

00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:15,440
done right and it has to be good but I

00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:16,590
think what's often underestimated is

00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,630
interaction

00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:20,040
like okay it's brilliant you put the vo

00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:23,730
headset you fill you somewhere else

00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:26,520
but I think you feel you really there

00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:27,450
when you push on something and it has it

00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:29,220
responds to it

00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:31,110
let's say physics for example somehow

00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:33,420
you put a very simple experience

00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:35,730
actually two cubes just by having

00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:37,350
physics it feels real even if it looks

00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:39,000
like the cube is gray which you've never

00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:41,310
seen in real life when you put some flat

00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,140
shading doesn't look realistic but just

00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:46,350
because it reacts the way you expect it

00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:49,770
feels real so I think interaction it

00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:51,330
matters at least as much as one ever

00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:53,010
mentioned photo realism because nobody

00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:55,800
knows how to do it even less in real

00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:58,440
time but in terms of the the visual the

00:23:55,800 --> 00:24:00,330
quality of the visuals I think there is

00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:04,620
too much on face as soon as it matters

00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:06,390
but interaction is key so inner to do

00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:09,590
interaction on the web simple you have

00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:11,970
the gamepad API the only difference is

00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:13,980
in order to have the little buttons and

00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:16,410
everything and you access you also have

00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:18,300
pause again so you know where your

00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:21,540
joystick is in space and then you can

00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:23,940
use it for whatever you want so is using

00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:29,370
this to do a little keyboard with the

00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:33,330
index yeah again very simple I just have

00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:35,370
upload the data from any of the buttons

00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:38,130
that have the axis I use the axis to

00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:39,630
switch the different layout of the

00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:42,240
keyboard so I have my controllers on

00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:44,850
this side and I can switch to it's a

00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,410
newly full keyboard with just those two

00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:51,510
controllers because on the index you

00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:53,130
have the finger tracking and then yes

00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:55,680
then you get in that natural interaction

00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:56,670
again if you are as lazy as I am you

00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,560
don't want to have something too

00:24:56,670 --> 00:25:01,140
complicated so you just have your

00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:03,000
controller and you have an object list

00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:05,430
ducks you want to make quack so you just

00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,790
measure the distance if the distance

00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:11,520
lower than a certain threshold so you

00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:14,340
measure world controller is where the

00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:16,650
duck which is symbolized by a box is or

00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:19,050
cuba's and if the distance is low enough

00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:21,759
whom you have your interaction it's

00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:24,190
really straightforward

00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:27,279
so the problem is if you know now how to

00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:29,079
do you have the pose for the headset you

00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:31,450
have the pose for the controllers you

00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:33,099
know the interactions the question now

00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:35,440
is how to do it right so that's an first

00:25:33,099 --> 00:25:38,070
this back on the set of quest and

00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,070
Facebook

00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:42,219
there are incredibly good sensors

00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:44,679
therefore from what we still hope for

00:25:42,219 --> 00:25:46,659
but it's working if you want to use it

00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:48,070
in the office kind of okay I guess

00:25:46,659 --> 00:25:51,249
depending on which contacts if you use

00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:52,599
it at home well that may be you care a

00:25:51,249 --> 00:25:54,969
little bit more about the privacy you

00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:56,979
get there so it's interesting to

00:25:54,969 --> 00:25:58,329
consider those experience to inform the

00:25:56,979 --> 00:26:00,070
user well enough so that there are

00:25:58,329 --> 00:26:02,889
actually conscious of what kind of data

00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:07,419
is leaking through is going through it

00:26:02,889 --> 00:26:10,779
so and yeah well you can go a little bit

00:26:07,419 --> 00:26:12,879
deeper I think we're still at the

00:26:10,779 --> 00:26:15,940
beginning of your like this this was a

00:26:12,879 --> 00:26:18,579
headphone mobile phone what ten years

00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:20,829
ago or something at this this is a

00:26:18,579 --> 00:26:23,619
mobile phone now I think your is a

00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:26,109
little bit at that stage I don't think

00:26:23,619 --> 00:26:29,259
that's a realistic scenario my basic

00:26:26,109 --> 00:26:31,749
understanding of physiology but yeah

00:26:29,259 --> 00:26:33,940
regardless of how we're getting there

00:26:31,749 --> 00:26:37,679
and how long it takes I think it's

00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:37,679
really important and now we get it right

00:26:38,399 --> 00:26:44,379
for so for ER I'll just take a huge

00:26:41,739 --> 00:26:47,379
shortcut say it's the same but harder

00:26:44,379 --> 00:26:49,419
you just see who but then what is the

00:26:47,379 --> 00:26:51,119
real challenge is getting contextual

00:26:49,419 --> 00:26:54,549
information about your environment

00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:56,200
because it means you don't just walk in

00:26:54,549 --> 00:26:58,119
space but you know that the floor is

00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:00,190
actually flat that the floor is a floor

00:26:58,119 --> 00:27:03,039
that the chair is the chair there's not

00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:05,889
just a flat surface but so all this as

00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:07,479
far as I understand is still quite a bit

00:27:05,889 --> 00:27:08,769
of a challenge but it's getting there so

00:27:07,479 --> 00:27:11,289
you have quite a few example you have

00:27:08,769 --> 00:27:13,799
the multi glass server which is an

00:27:11,289 --> 00:27:16,209
experimental Heuer browser on our us

00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:18,849
also on github

00:27:16,209 --> 00:27:22,119
same same kind of interface if you have

00:27:18,849 --> 00:27:29,349
if you get inside our tracking 4 vo it's

00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:31,509
about the same the thing is as I

00:27:29,349 --> 00:27:34,299
mentioned the WebEx are in 1.0 is

00:27:31,509 --> 00:27:36,099
already near the other but not fully

00:27:34,299 --> 00:27:39,099
you need to find tricks for it so you

00:27:36,099 --> 00:27:40,659
get polyfill and as good as the real

00:27:39,099 --> 00:27:43,570
thing but kind of work so you have the

00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:46,989
webview polyfill until recently and then

00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:48,279
the WebEx for all all on github and then

00:27:46,989 --> 00:27:51,969
you have something that just doesn't

00:27:48,279 --> 00:27:55,469
care about the specs which is GS so when

00:27:51,969 --> 00:27:58,209
you start to see air on the web without

00:27:55,469 --> 00:28:00,609
anything but you have more chrome

00:27:58,209 --> 00:28:04,029
Occulus that's pretty useful framework

00:28:00,609 --> 00:28:05,859
same for workshop different people to

00:28:04,029 --> 00:28:08,079
discover what is a aura and they don't

00:28:05,859 --> 00:28:09,639
have to install anything to be great way

00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:13,320
to use it you have a little tracker

00:28:09,639 --> 00:28:19,419
behind it or you also have more coulis

00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:23,139
that's the latest iteration of it there

00:28:19,419 --> 00:28:27,009
was a little bit of github drama on the

00:28:23,139 --> 00:28:29,200
passing over the repository but now what

00:28:27,009 --> 00:28:32,440
matters is active to be positive is or

00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:34,389
active again the pure going through and

00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:38,320
this is an example of markoulis using

00:28:34,389 --> 00:28:40,959
geospatial data to put again as you can

00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:45,609
see on the top in the browser some

00:28:40,959 --> 00:28:48,249
diverse geospatial information the XO

00:28:45,609 --> 00:28:50,669
viewer I briefly mentioned before so on

00:28:48,249 --> 00:28:50,669
github

00:28:56,060 --> 00:29:01,340
little bit of suspense so this is more

00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:04,340
or less you just put your mesh you'd say

00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:06,230
your gltf file in there and then you can

00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:08,660
interact with it based on distance but

00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:20,000
what touch on the screen whatever you

00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:22,160
want and then you can little little

00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,930
tricks because you can register a

00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:27,020
protocol then if you had your right

00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:29,300
protocol on it and app is installed you

00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:30,590
can directly use it as if it was a

00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:34,370
normal browser yet so it's still

00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:38,990
experimental but the flow the stream of

00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:41,870
interaction is rather straightforward so

00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:44,210
the beauty of the web as I mentioned is

00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:45,650
it's a mess and it means for example

00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:46,820
when you have an ecosystem like

00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:50,660
JavaScript where you have a new

00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:53,860
framework like now another one now I get

00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:55,940
another one now literally the pace of

00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:59,270
creation of framework and our tool is

00:29:55,940 --> 00:30:01,670
it's both scary and impressive so that

00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:03,770
was a little silly test but basically I

00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:05,300
used D 3GS so that's a library for

00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:07,100
visualization if you went on the New

00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:09,590
York time website you probably saw these

00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:12,500
three for interactive graphics to

00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:14,840
discover about a complex topic so I just

00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:16,400
have a very complex data set like test

00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:18,410
one two three four five and then I

00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:22,070
display a mesh and based on its size

00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:27,650
it's just in New York can just to do

00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:31,760
four constant so I'm on my slide and on

00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:35,770
my presentation and I have this little

00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:40,550
game it's actually the portfolio of

00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:43,280
Simon just to show that one of the

00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:46,250
beauty of javascript is that you have

00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:47,720
libraries like physics okay I'm very bad

00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:50,970
at building so I'm going to stop there

00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:52,710
and you have little tutorial

00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:56,940
have to do it but you can just use

00:30:52,710 --> 00:31:00,780
component to add like d3 or a component

00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:03,240
to add physics so it means you again you

00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:04,920
came a lot more realistic so I briefly

00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:07,200
mention exact it so that's the new

00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:09,900
challenger in browser if you want to use

00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:12,540
now you don't have Linux support for

00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:16,230
Firefox but if you want to use so I

00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:19,440
stopped that's my sad story I stopped

00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:22,560
using Linux well four years ago when I

00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:24,120
started to play with dr and then couple

00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:26,040
of years ago i think one or two years

00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:27,690
ago I started to use Linux again because

00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:29,340
I could because I cannot spend my time

00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:31,410
going back and forth between Windows and

00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:33,420
Linux and now that we start to have

00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:35,640
proper support but I want to stick to

00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:36,840
webviewer because that's what I know and

00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,920
that's what I think will have the

00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:40,680
biggest impact

00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:42,750
then I new browser foot so only next now

00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:46,470
you can use X circuit exactly it's kind

00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:51,210
of a strange thing so it's a browser

00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:53,640
kind of let's see it's a brother that

00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:55,980
says well what's exciting and term of

00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:58,560
content now it's not just 2d that's the

00:31:55,980 --> 00:32:01,470
past but it's 3d it's vo it's here and

00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:03,540
then everything to these legacy it's too

00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:05,700
heavy it's too complicated you still can

00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:08,400
have your browser with your super

00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:10,440
complicated CSS engine which is a

00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:11,880
mansion proper and using shadow

00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:15,720
everything behind so you actually is

00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:17,880
complicated but if you want 3d first why

00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:19,590
have all this code for it you can have

00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:22,380
it optionally but design have to suite

00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:24,720
spinning it's turning the browser on its

00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:27,810
head to say 3d first poni or first and

00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:29,280
the rest is optional it means you can

00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:34,200
actually wrap your head around the

00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:35,760
codebase as one person so yeah it's on

00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:38,340
github I invite you to try it works on

00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,730
Linux and they're pretty innovative and

00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:41,040
creative

00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:43,050
I was also mentioning before they have a

00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:45,300
bunch of events like once a week at

00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:49,040
least Arizona hubs some discussion about

00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:52,800
the medicine or the crazy possibility so

00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:55,650
does anybody know what this is so

00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:58,140
execute web is basically saying well you

00:32:55,650 --> 00:33:00,270
can have one web page that has your

00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:02,730
content let's say modular hubs but

00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:03,670
imagine that someone else that's a page

00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:09,730
that

00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:11,320
I don't know like a library of 3d meshes

00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:13,240
that are relevant to your topic

00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:14,800
that's architecture well you could

00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:16,990
actually the same way you have iframes

00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:19,480
you can have two of your content

00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:22,060
overlapping so you have like one origin

00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:25,780
coordinates and then you bring the two

00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:27,310
other 3d pages or viewer pages next to

00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:29,260
each other and you can put them in

00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:31,630
different position if so here you have

00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:34,150
multiple pages that are special though

00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:36,010
they are in viewer and they were merging

00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:37,300
the content according to one coordinate

00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:42,010
system and their own respective

00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:46,030
coordinate systems so an old guys and

00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:48,100
stuff about all great abort and stuff so

00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:49,420
I think the beauty of it is also having

00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:51,610
new workflows so you have for example

00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:52,870
the weather sorry emulator you don't

00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:54,580
have the device right now you're in the

00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:59,620
Train you want to work on it you'll just

00:33:54,580 --> 00:34:01,990
use the emulator and what becomes you

00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:04,090
also is so I don't know how many of you

00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:05,980
had the blender conference yesterday but

00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:07,540
you need you don't have your experience

00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:09,820
when our experience without assets you

00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:12,550
need something that looks good feels

00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:13,990
good I'm definitely not an artist as you

00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:17,290
can see from some of the inktober

00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:19,870
drawings I've done but I think being

00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:21,790
able to use blender so for example the

00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:23,770
beauty of fine food blender is you do

00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:26,409
right-click on a function but actually

00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:28,060
you don't right click on an icon then

00:34:26,409 --> 00:34:30,370
you can have edit the code right there

00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:32,710
in the application and you can change it

00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:34,210
you want to you can also look how it's

00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:36,700
working and do your own script in

00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:39,030
blender so it is made to be part of the

00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:43,899
workflow it is meant to be integrated so

00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:45,460
r32 on Twitter is a Spanish technical

00:34:43,899 --> 00:34:47,649
artist and he's explaining his entire

00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:50,409
workshop how you can go from you 3d

00:34:47,649 --> 00:34:56,020
creation you're doing to some usable on

00:34:50,409 --> 00:34:57,550
the web 3d asset goes to PBR and goes

00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:59,710
also from rigging and animation you

00:34:57,550 --> 00:35:02,980
start just a cube can be a cube with

00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:08,230
peor and arms flagging based on your

00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:10,950
interaction this cube and you can have

00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:13,570
entirely new workflow so for exact it

00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:16,710
executes rentals on the magic heap term

00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:18,960
of augmented reality so what I did was

00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:20,940
instead of using anything from their

00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,500
framework MLD be anything like this that

00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:25,350
would be too complicated for newcomers

00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:27,570
you can have one laptop that will be

00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:29,910
lets say the workshop lead and then

00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:32,310
anybody is going to submit their link on

00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:33,900
the page of the workshop is going to be

00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:35,490
sent directly to the device they don't

00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:38,040
have to install anything they can just

00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:41,640
use the web for instead of the art or

00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:43,860
technology so new ways basically to

00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:48,390
discover this I mentioned before

00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:50,280
learning the ore in VR painting in PR so

00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:52,260
again in webview you can have the

00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:55,440
content you paint in it so if you try to

00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:57,510
a painter it just like teal brush but on

00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:00,870
github and you can modify it add your

00:35:57,510 --> 00:36:02,430
brushes made some like sound reactive

00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:04,620
brushes and then you can show the

00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:06,420
content straight away to anybody and

00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:09,750
invite him or her in your drawing

00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:12,780
without anything installed you can also

00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:16,530
have this is actually if you want to try

00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:19,380
after this can be converted to SVG have

00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:20,790
like a special pen that writes to that

00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:23,610
we call the position of the different

00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:25,560
spots and I have to be SVG and then SVG

00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:31,980
I can extrude it and have my physical

00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:33,720
drawing straight to web your pages you

00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:37,170
can use gltf so who is familiar with

00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:40,140
gltf i didn't ask that before okay so

00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:42,300
it's it's to make it sure it's the new

00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:43,740
format that is going to conquer all 3d

00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:46,740
formats you know like the one spec

00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:49,290
that's going to be placed demo and it's

00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:51,750
basically using everything you would

00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:53,430
want to with a focus on the web so for

00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:55,730
example you can have level of details

00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:58,680
and streaming of high resolution texture

00:36:55,730 --> 00:37:00,390
streaming of high resolution geometries

00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:03,150
based on let's say distance to the

00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:05,580
object and you can also hit directly

00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:10,050
inside the format to say well this part

00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:11,910
of the exported model that the art is

00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:13,380
done I want to touch this one directly

00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:15,300
you can like write the name of a

00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:18,980
property and access it directly from the

00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:22,590
web and again in terms of the workflow

00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:24,390
as you can see not an artist but I made

00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:27,000
my little VR scene

00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:29,730
of course Suzanne there and webviewer I

00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,640
made a little plug in or I don't script

00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:36,980
and what's the right name for it I

00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:40,200
loaded it package is my seen as a gltf

00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:42,180
and then it sends the gltf file to the

00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:44,849
server wrap it inside an iframe page

00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:48,180
which i forgot and then voila you

00:37:44,849 --> 00:37:49,829
directly from blender i can publish 3d

00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:54,900
and view content on the web working in

00:37:49,829 --> 00:37:57,630
the headset and then again in term of

00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:59,069
new workflow so I mean the magic lip the

00:37:57,630 --> 00:38:02,910
augmented reality device I'm using

00:37:59,069 --> 00:38:05,269
glitch glitch is a way to have 3d or any

00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:08,250
kind of web content actually we mix it

00:38:05,269 --> 00:38:12,809
collaboratively edit the code and then I

00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:14,970
use my full P or my full physical

00:38:12,809 --> 00:38:16,589
keyboard to change the code and then the

00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:18,930
code is it's not live we loaded I had to

00:38:16,589 --> 00:38:20,309
press refresh to be lightly loaded and

00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:23,420
then in the headset I have the new

00:38:20,309 --> 00:38:26,130
content so let's play a game

00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:29,579
so this is the stack in web view it

00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:33,569
simply face amplified those are a bunch

00:38:29,579 --> 00:38:36,269
of actors a bunch of also companies

00:38:33,569 --> 00:38:41,309
behind it and their product that's kind

00:38:36,269 --> 00:38:43,829
of the stack at the higher level so you

00:38:41,309 --> 00:38:46,230
don't have to be to you can say it a lot

00:38:43,829 --> 00:38:50,250
if you want to but the idea I think this

00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:52,650
is something I thought Kronos six months

00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:55,500
ago basically where they try to identify

00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:57,660
in the stack where are the gaps in the

00:38:55,500 --> 00:39:00,299
pipeline the workflow what is actually

00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:02,970
missing what community tools are not

00:39:00,299 --> 00:39:05,339
there yet compared to non open source

00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:07,970
and free alternatives so what do you

00:39:05,339 --> 00:39:10,470
think are the gaps what do you think is

00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:14,750
what is missing right now either in what

00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:17,250
VR or how to connect web your WebEx are

00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:19,519
it's an actual question yes I know a

00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:22,109
system faces like a bit super like we do

00:39:19,519 --> 00:39:23,640
we can also discuss it about Caffey I

00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:25,200
don't have to put everybody on the spot

00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:27,359
but I think it's something important

00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:29,250
like if we want actually a lively an

00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:30,930
efficient ecosystem then we need to be

00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:33,289
honest about like what is actually

00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:33,289
missing

00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:43,200
yeah first of all thanks for the great

00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:43,890
presentation it was a good over flem

00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,260
finished yet

00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:49,860
oh yeah until now of course looking

00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:51,810
forward for the rest but it was great to

00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:55,380
see what you can actually achieve in a

00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:57,710
simple way with with the web with just a

00:39:55,380 --> 00:40:00,600
couple of lines of JavaScript and

00:39:57,710 --> 00:40:03,150
unfortunately I couldn't dive into its

00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:05,610
deeply yet mostly because of the Linux

00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:07,760
support so of course I could try it out

00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:12,480
on other operating systems but I'm

00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:15,810
really like to have it on my setup so I

00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:17,670
saw execute like I knew execute but I

00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:20,910
wasn't aware that they already had Linux

00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:24,120
support so I will try it I think that

00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:27,210
it's currently running on open VR I

00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:29,880
guess and steam er but it would be four

00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:33,600
so one thing for me and I would really

00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:37,710
also like to tinker with it to have

00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:40,830
execute or even maybe Firefox reality

00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:43,380
running on open XR so it can be on a

00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:45,300
full open source stack and I guess this

00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:47,310
full open source stack from from the

00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:49,200
ground up from the drivers up to the

00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:51,410
browser fully open source will bring

00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:54,600
many people and many enthusiasts to this

00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:57,600
and for me this is one one things

00:40:54,600 --> 00:41:00,480
missing it's important it's great that

00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:02,880
to have like this solid runtimes where

00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:05,280
this stuff can be developed on a high

00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:07,500
level but yeah I'm really just looking

00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:10,290
forward to the open source stack and for

00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:13,230
me the small gap is to bring like open

00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:17,250
XR support to execute or something or

00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:23,790
Firefox reality so I will like to play

00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:27,720
with that so exactly it also is really

00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:30,690
active and so it's not a on post project

00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:32,970
it's it's not an anything-goes project

00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:35,580
but it's a we keep it extremely small

00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:37,830
and tight to be able to explore so it is

00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:40,320
also not the same kind of constraint as

00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:42,390
firefox not even firefox VT but firefox

00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:44,070
proper would have its map shipping to

00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:45,150
millions of users so it means it's

00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:47,849
really able to go create

00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:49,619
see and yeah that was my that's how I

00:41:47,849 --> 00:41:51,180
was able to switch back to Linux and

00:41:49,619 --> 00:41:54,770
start using Windows it's because

00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:54,770
actually actually even my content there

00:41:55,789 --> 00:42:00,450
it was basically I might not the same I

00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:07,230
think the gaps are in the lower end like

00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:10,559
theirs it feels like this not much open

00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:13,700
hardware or drivers basically one out of

00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:17,609
fits in I feels like it's only us and

00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:19,650
people like above in the clouds in the

00:42:17,609 --> 00:42:22,770
vamp who don't seem to really care about

00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:26,490
the platform that they are we're doing

00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:29,730
all this fun stuff in sources yeah it's

00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:33,359
open and and we run on quest yes and

00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:35,279
then talked to be honest than you

00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:38,730
everything you do with pings onto

00:42:35,279 --> 00:42:42,150
Facebook no no it's it's definitely true

00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:45,270
that a lot of there is a kind of how do

00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:47,069
you say an excuse of separation of

00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:50,160
concern to say we were high up the stack

00:42:47,069 --> 00:42:52,740
so we we don't want to care about how

00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:58,130
it's done and the hood or lower down the

00:42:52,740 --> 00:43:03,599
stack I do think it's a concern but that

00:42:58,130 --> 00:43:05,339
it's not really there is a hope it's

00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:07,079
going to be magically source who it

00:43:05,339 --> 00:43:08,640
honestly wanting to be involved but oh

00:43:07,079 --> 00:43:16,160
yeah again that think that's why we're

00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:18,859
here any anything else otherwise again

00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:22,049
around go feat that's going to hold on

00:43:18,859 --> 00:43:25,049
so I'll finish then why you should not

00:43:22,049 --> 00:43:26,849
try WebEx or I mean if you need to

00:43:25,049 --> 00:43:30,210
deploy tomorrow it's really too morose

00:43:26,849 --> 00:43:30,930
and they to any something across all

00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:32,250
platforms

00:43:30,930 --> 00:43:34,559
so that's the other hope there's still

00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:37,319
the target that's all but we want in

00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:39,569
practice it's not there yet what I

00:43:37,319 --> 00:43:42,750
didn't mention also doing who I am i I

00:43:39,569 --> 00:43:45,690
was a co-founder of web your startup

00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:48,510
last year two years ago and after one

00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:52,740
year I had to give up because in term of

00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:55,970
adoption and in term of testing with

00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:58,280
users and specifications me too

00:43:55,970 --> 00:44:00,140
being implemented even though this year

00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:01,790
is the year this year is different we're

00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:05,120
not there yet so I think if you really

00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:07,250
need to deploy tomorrow you need to be a

00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:09,290
little bit cautious if you don't care

00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:12,290
about video new interactions why would

00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:13,730
you bother I mean I think it's most

00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:15,230
exciting thing out there but not

00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:17,540
everybody has the same focus which is

00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:20,270
fine and again if you need a stable tool

00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:23,390
chain I mean you work in a nuclear power

00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:24,770
plant probably not a good idea right now

00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:28,940
everything is they're moving pieces

00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:31,730
everything is shifting yeah maybe wait a

00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:34,940
little bit more play with it on the side

00:44:31,730 --> 00:44:37,250
definitely worth it lot of fun but not

00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:38,510
stable in term of toolchain why you

00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:41,210
should still invest time and learning

00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:43,610
web we saw two more morning

00:44:41,210 --> 00:44:49,910
well because everything's pretty easy

00:44:43,610 --> 00:44:51,050
you put the headset actually now if we

00:44:49,910 --> 00:44:53,240
mentioned the question and oh I don't

00:44:51,050 --> 00:44:55,730
want to it has the oculus browser which

00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:58,190
works out of the box you buy so it means

00:44:55,730 --> 00:45:00,350
you buy the most probably popular with

00:44:58,190 --> 00:45:02,210
your headset for Christmas don't do it

00:45:00,350 --> 00:45:03,800
because evil and stuff but in the end it

00:45:02,210 --> 00:45:06,080
has a local espresso in it that does

00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:10,610
support web view and will support WebEx

00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:13,460
are very soon it's a new friend here

00:45:10,610 --> 00:45:16,430
it's pretty exciting and again to go

00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:19,310
back to the previous points I mean if we

00:45:16,430 --> 00:45:21,500
if you don't shape a new medium who will

00:45:19,310 --> 00:45:24,980
there's so many ways to use it for

00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:27,290
boring or anything to just wrong

00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:28,820
purposes so just shape the medium

00:45:27,290 --> 00:45:31,250
building the content you want to so I

00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:33,680
think just a little bit back on the

00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:35,060
higher up the stack not being so

00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:37,100
concerned with the lower end of the

00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:38,780
stack some people who also produce web

00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:41,180
your content or web we saw condom down

00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:42,980
11 developers so in term of knowledge of

00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:45,830
how it's done that honestly care they

00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:48,080
would rather like given discussion

00:45:45,830 --> 00:45:49,790
yesterday at the blender colorful you're

00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:51,140
an artist you want the medium to be who

00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:53,000
you want to shave it any way you want

00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:54,410
but they don't have the technical

00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,660
understanding of how it's done

00:45:54,410 --> 00:46:01,160
what still matters though is the kind of

00:45:56,660 --> 00:46:05,380
content you can produce with the long

00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:08,710
sentence point for is basically I think

00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:10,799
okay maybe in 5 10 50 years everybody

00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:13,869
will use the Pixar in one way or another

00:46:10,799 --> 00:46:16,089
I'm pretty convinced of it otherwise I

00:46:13,869 --> 00:46:18,160
wouldn't spend my weekend like you a

00:46:16,089 --> 00:46:20,410
Saturday morning here so I'm pretty sure

00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:22,390
it's the prison that will be much more

00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:23,890
popular feature then it's freaky

00:46:22,390 --> 00:46:25,869
important to know how it's working you

00:46:23,890 --> 00:46:27,339
don't need to know everything no no

00:46:25,869 --> 00:46:32,619
first actually understand entirely the

00:46:27,339 --> 00:46:34,029
stack it's just too many pieces but to

00:46:32,619 --> 00:46:35,680
get an understanding of where the

00:46:34,029 --> 00:46:38,229
information flow where it goes I think

00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:40,239
it's really really important and urgent

00:46:38,229 --> 00:46:43,660
because it's happening now like even if

00:46:40,239 --> 00:46:45,249
you don't use V or a or a or and someone

00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:46,960
else uses it basically you are

00:46:45,249 --> 00:46:48,579
represented in it and shipped to

00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:50,049
whatever commercial system is using it

00:46:48,579 --> 00:46:51,789
and I mean if you have a cognitive

00:46:50,049 --> 00:46:55,299
science degree you can also put it to

00:46:51,789 --> 00:46:58,749
good use today a little public community

00:46:55,299 --> 00:47:00,549
announcement this is the first time if

00:46:58,749 --> 00:47:04,920
you are in Toulouse there is the open

00:47:00,549 --> 00:47:07,479
Geospatial consortium event mid November

00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:09,609
and there is the capital G label which

00:47:07,479 --> 00:47:12,400
is like for stem but in France an

00:47:09,609 --> 00:47:15,670
opensource event and I'm organizing a

00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:19,180
hackathon they're focusing on geospatial

00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:22,660
data and web er yes it's happening in

00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:23,890
about a month if you have any suggestion

00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:27,670
ideas whatever

00:47:23,890 --> 00:47:30,210
well first come but even if you cannot

00:47:27,670 --> 00:47:34,299
come feel free to get in touch

00:47:30,210 --> 00:47:39,329
it's all there why do I care again about

00:47:34,299 --> 00:47:41,979
WebEx or to be open because I need it

00:47:39,329 --> 00:47:44,349
because otherwise I'm going crazy I have

00:47:41,979 --> 00:47:47,890
those notes everywhere I have my posters

00:47:44,349 --> 00:47:52,029
everywhere I need a way to dump those

00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:54,039
ideas and tools on a medium that kids

00:47:52,029 --> 00:47:55,869
let's me be more free let me like I walk

00:47:54,039 --> 00:47:57,759
I'm not Italian but I use my hands to

00:47:55,869 --> 00:48:00,430
talk I like to walk around I like to

00:47:57,759 --> 00:48:02,440
have a discussion when we go outside so

00:48:00,430 --> 00:48:04,210
I need to I do not like this this is not

00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:06,400
a natural posture for me I want to be

00:48:04,210 --> 00:48:09,160
able to move around with the idea and

00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:12,849
information so I need it this is why I

00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:14,710
am here but why should you care for EXO

00:48:12,849 --> 00:48:18,339
and webbing so to be open

00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:18,870
well because I was whining once again on

00:48:18,339 --> 00:48:21,270
Twitter

00:48:18,870 --> 00:48:23,610
Facebook and Google and them being just

00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:25,800
advertising company with a technical

00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:27,030
side in the end advertisement and I

00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:30,270
think what we get used to is

00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:32,130
helplessness we get used to tools that

00:48:30,270 --> 00:48:33,030
tell us no you cannot do this and you're

00:48:32,130 --> 00:48:35,040
like okay that's it

00:48:33,030 --> 00:48:36,870
they don't even reply if you ask a

00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:38,280
question or complain about it and I

00:48:36,870 --> 00:48:40,260
think reg would you talk okay that's how

00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:42,180
it is like a man middle in my little box

00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:45,630
and then I stopped getting ideas I

00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:47,790
stopped being creative so I'm a

00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:50,000
prototype is I do proof of concept if I

00:48:47,790 --> 00:48:52,770
cannot get ideas if I cannot be creative

00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:56,970
my life is pointless basically so I

00:48:52,770 --> 00:49:00,450
cannot accept it and and as it goes you

00:48:56,970 --> 00:49:01,980
just have to give up or you do freely

00:49:00,450 --> 00:49:03,840
poppin through software we said I don't

00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:05,400
necessarily know how to do it I don't

00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:07,080
know if it's feasible but at least I

00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:08,310
know I can try I know that if I did icky

00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:10,740
at the time if I asked the right person

00:49:08,310 --> 00:49:13,680
if I go to the right conference then

00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:15,800
maybe I'll find a way I cannot promise I

00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:19,740
will but I know at least I can try

00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:22,260
that's my cue so you gain agency again

00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:27,270
you're not just like being used by the

00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:29,640
software but you can get active again so

00:49:27,270 --> 00:49:32,280
in the end why should care for where the

00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:34,500
X R and X are to be open because I think

00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:38,250
X R is really a novel tool for thinking

00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:42,330
I haven't did philosophy talk on it so

00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:43,780
we must keep it free and open and that's

00:49:42,330 --> 00:49:46,650
it thank you

00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:50,919
[Laughter]

00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:50,919
[Applause]

00:49:52,489 --> 00:50:02,059
well I will I will take questions and

00:49:57,390 --> 00:50:02,059
give duties yep

00:50:03,739 --> 00:50:08,670
so you use an example where you said

00:50:07,319 --> 00:50:13,589
that they use they won't be able to tell

00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:17,130
the difference I do say sorry I cannot

00:50:13,589 --> 00:50:18,569
under formance so you said that is

00:50:17,130 --> 00:50:21,420
usable payables a little difference but

00:50:18,569 --> 00:50:23,519
I do think they will in the end like

00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:26,519
battery matters especially on mobile

00:50:23,519 --> 00:50:30,829
devices so yeah you have a lot of

00:50:26,519 --> 00:50:33,239
optimizing to do all in your stack so

00:50:30,829 --> 00:50:36,269
okay I'm being a little bit provocative

00:50:33,239 --> 00:50:37,829
yeah I just I'm saying that of course

00:50:36,269 --> 00:50:40,109
you need performance of course you need

00:50:37,829 --> 00:50:45,569
at least 60 fps

00:50:40,109 --> 00:50:48,690
but if if you focus only on on

00:50:45,569 --> 00:50:52,519
performance and not on content and even

00:50:48,690 --> 00:50:55,200
on interaction just let's say on display

00:50:52,519 --> 00:50:59,970
it's it's just not enough and I think

00:50:55,200 --> 00:51:01,319
because so one of the a lot of the

00:50:59,970 --> 00:51:02,730
argument I hear is like oh I don't want

00:51:01,319 --> 00:51:05,819
to touch the web because the web is not

00:51:02,730 --> 00:51:08,089
performant so it's not true the web is

00:51:05,819 --> 00:51:11,549
there is a there is overhead of course

00:51:08,089 --> 00:51:15,480
so I'm not going to deny this but the

00:51:11,549 --> 00:51:17,400
overhead is against let's say how

00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:18,720
efficiently you can share and how we

00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:21,170
keep saying efficient you get feedback

00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:23,880
and I have a gift efficient you can edit

00:51:21,170 --> 00:51:25,349
so it's a trade-off and I think the

00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:27,989
trade-off because the other head is

00:51:25,349 --> 00:51:30,989
actually not as high as most people

00:51:27,989 --> 00:51:34,980
think it is it's not significant enough

00:51:30,989 --> 00:51:36,779
to forget how all the benefits from it

00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:38,849
let's say so yes of course performance

00:51:36,779 --> 00:51:41,940
matters and of course it has to be it

00:51:38,849 --> 00:51:44,779
should always be better but in the

00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:48,210
performance itself of sticking to native

00:51:44,779 --> 00:51:50,989
is in most cases in my opinion and

00:51:48,210 --> 00:51:56,940
founded that make sense yeah

00:51:50,989 --> 00:52:00,600
yeah so just to add to this the

00:51:56,940 --> 00:52:03,570
performance is mostly

00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:06,900
the problem of graphics usually and

00:52:03,570 --> 00:52:08,520
WebGL and native jail is pretty much the

00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:10,500
same speed because once you have the

00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:12,300
stuff on the graphic card once you have

00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:14,310
the shader on the graphics card it

00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:15,840
doesn't matter if the web loaded it to

00:52:14,310 --> 00:52:20,910
the graphics card or something else

00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:23,220
loaded it to it the slight difference is

00:52:20,910 --> 00:52:29,940
of course that you using GL and not

00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:32,190
Vulcan but you're pretty close and the

00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:35,130
web doesn't make the big difference in

00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:37,470
in that regard because the graphics is

00:52:35,130 --> 00:52:39,810
usually limited limiting factor for the

00:52:37,470 --> 00:52:43,770
for the VR stuff or for the XR stuff

00:52:39,810 --> 00:52:47,460
from what I've seen and as I said once

00:52:43,770 --> 00:52:51,480
well once it's on the card it's it's

00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:54,210
pretty much the same but you forgot one

00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:58,230
one piece of why you should not wear it

00:52:54,210 --> 00:53:03,480
use WebEx R and that's if you want to

00:52:58,230 --> 00:53:05,250
push one app store then WebEx R is not

00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:08,700
for you because WebEx R doesn't need App

00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:12,350
Store's and if you want to push one app

00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:14,850
strike ecosystem then that's not for you

00:53:12,350 --> 00:53:17,520
for example if you go back to exec it

00:53:14,850 --> 00:53:20,190
within the magic like so viewer you can

00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:21,720
wrap your WebEx or content as an app I

00:53:20,190 --> 00:53:23,520
don't think you should I think the web

00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:25,740
is the platform I think is wrong but

00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:28,140
it's technically feasible so I mean

00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:33,300
we're the group here who doesn't want to

00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:34,710
be bound by app stores but yes that was

00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:41,790
not a question so you do not get a

00:53:34,710 --> 00:53:44,820
sticker so this is great and and

00:53:41,790 --> 00:53:47,370
obviously I'm a big proponent of open XR

00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:50,400
as you know have a standard back-end for

00:53:47,370 --> 00:53:54,390
web XR I focus on the committee it's

00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:58,620
it's very nice I also have a collection

00:53:54,390 --> 00:54:00,840
of can you say abandon platforms I've

00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:03,630
got a gear VR I recently just got a

00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:07,800
daydream view is there yeah I know

00:54:03,630 --> 00:54:11,070
ironic is is there sort of any do you

00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:13,260
know if they're like how how what the

00:54:11,070 --> 00:54:15,080
balance is there between dedication to

00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:18,240
platforms that people already have

00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:21,420
versus the platforms that people will be

00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:22,800
using from now on how many months do I

00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:25,560
have before my daydream view stops

00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:27,960
working yeah so daydream is unlike

00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:29,520
Firefox reality for instance because I

00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:34,050
just checked and it looks like it should

00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:36,300
work so one of the challenges of the

00:54:34,050 --> 00:54:38,460
webview and then WebEx for specification

00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:40,830
was that one of the principal and the

00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:44,160
constant example was one of the certain

00:54:40,830 --> 00:54:47,130
websites still running what was it like

00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:49,070
30 used after something like this so

00:54:47,130 --> 00:54:52,830
that you want the web to be able to

00:54:49,070 --> 00:54:55,650
continuously run your content regardless

00:54:52,830 --> 00:54:58,290
of how old the platform is so that's a

00:54:55,650 --> 00:55:00,930
huge challenge though and especially

00:54:58,290 --> 00:55:06,810
based on how quickly those devices are

00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:09,120
changing so I do not want to promise

00:55:06,810 --> 00:55:10,530
that the web is a way but compared to

00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:12,060
most platform like you don't have a

00:55:10,530 --> 00:55:12,540
vendor that so we don't support this

00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:15,450
anymore

00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:18,450
as long as you have an app that is a

00:55:15,450 --> 00:55:21,870
browser that runs on it and that keeps

00:55:18,450 --> 00:55:23,250
on supporting those specifications so

00:55:21,870 --> 00:55:26,630
that's why what I actually didn't

00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:31,620
mention even is the specifications or

00:55:26,630 --> 00:55:35,670
done within the framework of w3c and

00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:39,300
within w3c so the first workshop was in

00:55:35,670 --> 00:55:44,310
2016 in Santa Clara attacks Samsung HQ

00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:45,720
and so Facebook was there chrome google

00:55:44,310 --> 00:55:49,680
was there five

00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:52,210
Mozilla of course was there I was there

00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:56,050
spitless important Samsung was there

00:55:52,210 --> 00:55:59,050
Kronos was there so in term of adoption

00:55:56,050 --> 00:56:00,730
it was pretty good since then apple also

00:55:59,050 --> 00:56:03,190
joined without announcing anything

00:56:00,730 --> 00:56:06,610
because they do whatever they want

00:56:03,190 --> 00:56:08,290
that's movie magic clip also joined

00:56:06,610 --> 00:56:13,480
scene so in term of adoption from

00:56:08,290 --> 00:56:15,520
vendors it I will again be a little bit

00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:18,280
provocative might be more widely adapted

00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:22,090
than appendix R at this point I'm sure

00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:23,860
yes so I think it's a rather safe bet in

00:56:22,090 --> 00:56:25,540
the end though it's like I mentioned a

00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:28,570
bit in the way you should not adapt it

00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:30,970
it's all moving this is all in motion so

00:56:28,570 --> 00:56:33,640
if you want to be sure that it's going

00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:36,400
to be still running in 20 years or 50

00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:39,220
years I mean there's also a big part of

00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:41,440
let's say the web archive is how you can

00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:42,880
keep on maintaining that condom that is

00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:44,680
always in flux and that one of the

00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:46,170
beauty of the web for exam I also did

00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:49,630
not mention it but one of the

00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:51,760
competitive advantage to say is you can

00:56:49,630 --> 00:56:54,400
do link traversal so if you have a WebEx

00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:56,110
 page you can jump to another WebEx

00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:58,060
our page without going back to a home

00:56:56,110 --> 00:56:59,680
screen or something like this which is

00:56:58,060 --> 00:57:01,120
otherwise not as far as I know not

00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:06,070
possible because otherwise you go

00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:08,680
through the home platform again so click

00:57:06,070 --> 00:57:10,990
means it's all dynamic interlink content

00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:12,640
so how this is going to keep in been

00:57:10,990 --> 00:57:14,200
maintained over your so yeah my

00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:16,900
suggestion would be you actually stick

00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:18,940
to the specification maybe you do if you

00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:20,680
had publish already whether your content

00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:26,860
you make sure it's both webview and what

00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:28,900
eggs are compatible and then within w3c

00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:30,160
specification and the respect of the

00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:33,850
implementation from the different

00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:36,480
browser vendors should be fine that's

00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:36,480
great thanks

00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:46,030
okay everything else was super clear

00:57:53,110 --> 00:57:58,420
and if you want to try stuff em around

00:57:55,770 --> 00:58:00,970
if you want to start a glitch and play

00:57:58,420 --> 00:58:04,000
with stuff in there in WebEx are not

00:58:00,970 --> 00:58:07,840
sure if I'll be able to but I'm happy to

00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:11,300
try recordist thank you

00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:11,300
[Applause]

00:58:11,470 --> 00:58:19,099
