Title: FOSSXR 2019 - Blender OpenXR
Publication date: 2019-12-04
Playlist: FOSSXR 2019
Description: 
	Since 2016, there have been multiple attempts for a VR implementation in Blender. But with the release of OpenXR and the Blender 2.8 rewrite, all the components were available for a fully supported VR integration in Blender. This presentation will show the current implementation of OpenXR into Blender, which is in Master and will be shipped in the 2.81 release, with all the hurdles and implementations required to make this work. The initial work was done on a GSOC of long time Blender developer Julian Eisel.

00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:13,170
okay a couple of excuses like of course

00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:15,450
my voice is dying and I'm just coming

00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:17,550
from the teleconference and of course we

00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:19,380
are having three days of fun and

00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,880
everything is awesome I love going to

00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:25,140
the conference but it's exhausting

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:27,300
yourself so yeah I'm just gonna do a

00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,920
this presentation and then I have to run

00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:33,090
back again because I have meetings there

00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:36,059
and everything so yeah we can do some

00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:38,160
questions or whatever I did pretty much

00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:40,170
the same presentation yesterday at the

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,200
blender conference although I guess I

00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,550
will change it a little bit before you

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,950
don't have to do like an introduction to

00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:48,539
opening so I guess everybody knows how

00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,710
it's roughly works and everything so I

00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:54,079
guess I could skip that

00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:56,940
I did want to do some demos

00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,680
unfortunately I would have to setup a

00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,120
machine where I can actually mirror the

00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,550
we are a few and everything and my

00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,439
laptop doesn't allow me to do this and

00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:06,240
also manaro

00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:09,390
unfortunately doesn't run on my laptop

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:12,360
because it's using the integrated intro

00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:14,939
thingy and I have to do where primers

00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,830
run op to run and everything and there's

00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:18,869
a park and Intel which I as far as I

00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:26,790
know monado is trying to get it to rest

00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:30,259
um but yeah first off I guess you are

00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:33,509
all aware were planners by now I think

00:01:30,259 --> 00:01:35,400
it's fair to say that everybody was sort

00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:38,520
of doing stuff with computers regularly

00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:40,740
and especially in the open source world

00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,030
has heard about planners or ideas I

00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:46,380
don't have to do an introduction about

00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:51,420
that either um are any people using

00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:58,860
planned irregularly or is yeah yeah

00:01:51,420 --> 00:02:00,590
that's good so I guess I can just jump

00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:02,880
right into it and don't have to give an

00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:07,020
blender introduction and I will skip

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,670
this point then the big thing is I was

00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:11,190
doing it with some of course project for

00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:13,640
blender I'm basically bringing openings

00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,640
are to it

00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:18,660
Joey wrote the abstract for my talk

00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,430
which is under schedule and there's a

00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:22,590
little mistake and it's just a tiny

00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:25,790
little mistake and it says it's in

00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:29,160
master which isn't the case actually

00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:31,580
we're preparing it for planar 2.82 which

00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:35,070
is supposed to be released about around

00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:36,780
January February but yeah and

00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:40,050
technically it's not even in there yet

00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:40,350
so but I'm pretty optimistic we can get

00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:43,800
it

00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:46,550
get it in and I learned to not be too

00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,630
optimistic with that kind of stuff so

00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:50,850
then I'm gonna talk a bit about the

00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:52,680
blender XR team this is a totally of

00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:55,020
unofficial team but there are a couple

00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,480
of really great artists and developers

00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,770
in which sort of trying to join forces

00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:04,020
and try to get a really decent

00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:06,470
experience into blender oh my god I'm

00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:11,340
sorry I can't do presentation now

00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:13,470
Thank You Joey this is the first good

00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:18,800
thing you've ever done to me everything

00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:18,800
else was just work thank you thank you

00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:30,889
so if you're wondering why I got into we

00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:32,349
are or it's all his fault I'm not sure

00:03:30,889 --> 00:03:36,170
if I'm happy about that though

00:03:32,349 --> 00:03:38,030
no I enjoy doing it actually um okay

00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:40,730
last point we are going to do some of

00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:44,269
you in further work I have some thoughts

00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:46,040
about how we want to develop or all the

00:03:44,269 --> 00:03:49,489
VR experiences for Penn and all the

00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:52,370
workflows for that but I'm gonna start

00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:54,799
with me um I'm doing planar development

00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:59,389
for five and a half years now yeah fine

00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:01,040
for around five nine years um I'm

00:03:59,389 --> 00:04:03,230
currently working at the Panda Institute

00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:07,819
in Reggie and Amsterdam so and I'm

00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:10,099
sitting north doing that I'm living here

00:04:07,819 --> 00:04:13,129
in Amsterdam since one month about one

00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:15,019
month now um worked for the front asian

00:04:13,129 --> 00:04:17,599
or for the Institute now for two months

00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:19,370
but I've always added various

00:04:17,599 --> 00:04:21,470
collaborations with the Institute and

00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:27,070
always did contract contract work with

00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:29,479
them and everything um okay that point

00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:34,130
makes sense on the teleconference not so

00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:36,110
much here if there's anybody using panda

00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:39,800
you've all seen and used my work it's

00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:42,259
pretty awful stuff many because I focus

00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:46,940
on usability um there is always sort of

00:04:42,259 --> 00:04:49,729
my my playground or I have something

00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:52,849
that I take very serious and I'm

00:04:49,729 --> 00:04:55,130
actually sort of the only UI develop our

00:04:52,849 --> 00:04:59,389
full-time you're a developer working on

00:04:55,130 --> 00:05:04,759
blender currently so that means I have

00:04:59,389 --> 00:05:06,949
lots of stuff on my plate and I only

00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:08,840
have so much time for the VR stuff I'm

00:05:06,949 --> 00:05:12,289
currently trying to do more like two

00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:14,479
days a week I spent on we are but as I

00:05:12,289 --> 00:05:18,590
said we are going to talk about the XR

00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:20,719
team that we sort of got together and I

00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:24,050
think they are going to be really

00:05:20,719 --> 00:05:26,870
helpful um yeah yeah we're just gonna

00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:30,289
continue with that my personal interest

00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:32,930
in VR is like cereal like I don't have

00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:34,920
presently I don't use we I don't watch

00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:36,870
VR movies I don't play Wii

00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:39,390
games I've never watched a millisecond

00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:43,320
of we are porn believe me and like I

00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:45,660
just don't care for we are really at for

00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:47,970
myself but I don't still think like this

00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:52,380
isn't as I'm interested in usability

00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:55,230
aspects I'm interested in this kind of

00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:57,690
technology it opens a lot of lots of new

00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:59,850
doors for for the workflow and if you

00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:02,760
speak to the artists that have done

00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:04,650
experiments with we are they are so

00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:06,930
enthusiastic about heaven we are in

00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:11,060
blender like there's so much you can do

00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:13,200
I think we can talk about that in a bit

00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:16,350
okay this is the opening sign

00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:20,310
introduction there's not much new for

00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:22,560
you guys here just a bit of you know

00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:28,440
this this graphics I guess and

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:30,390
everything nothing new for you the last

00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:34,350
point is maybe a bit important like

00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:36,210
lenders GPL 2 or later so for us it was

00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:40,830
never really the option to use like the

00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:43,620
proprietary runtimes and this allows us

00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:45,240
now to actually use the best run terms

00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:47,310
or the run times people have installed

00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,590
on their system and it's just plug and

00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:56,220
go and this is of course what kinda

00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:57,660
users want to have yeah those are the

00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:00,090
two proprietary ones that are out there

00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:01,920
for things are I guess your own all

00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:06,000
about that and of course there's manaro

00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:08,880
um I am personally sort of free software

00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,830
than fuse yes it's like I do believe in

00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:15,990
the values of free software free as in

00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:18,510
freedom of course but yeah so I really

00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:20,400
hope monado is going to to have a really

00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:22,200
great future of course right now it's

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,600
not there yet like it does have issues

00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:27,330
and I wouldn't i never suggest people to

00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:29,220
try amanada because it's a hassle to set

00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:30,930
up like for hard for our users

00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:32,640
especially like for developers it's fine

00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:34,500
if they want to test it but yeah it's

00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:36,290
just a hassle to set up and it misses so

00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:39,330
many if it's missing so many features

00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:45,060
but I am I really a low Panaro is going

00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:47,949
to do well in the future so yeah

00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:49,180
basically too long didn't read for

00:07:47,949 --> 00:07:51,220
planar this is the way to get

00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:53,889
state-of-the-art we are for XR

00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:56,199
technology in wise in a device software

00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:59,099
and platform independent way but of

00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:59,099
course you own all that

00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:04,479
so let's talk about my ji-suk project

00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:06,460
could be some off course um the name of

00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:08,289
it was core support for virtual reality

00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:10,990
headsets the openings are and it's

00:08:08,289 --> 00:08:11,560
really core support like I mean two

00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,930
things

00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:15,909
it's in the source code of blend of

00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:17,469
course it's C code not some Python I

00:08:15,909 --> 00:08:20,319
don't people have been doing Python I

00:08:17,469 --> 00:08:22,960
don't for that stuff um but this is in

00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,639
the source code but it's also really

00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:29,560
limited on the core fundamentals

00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:31,210
fundamentals of xr4 now um we are going

00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:35,740
to go into a little bit more detail

00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:38,469
right now the idea was from the gate

00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:41,110
code from the get-go to focus on solid

00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:43,360
and well performing we are a few pouring

00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:47,940
support that means we didn't want to

00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:51,160
well we want but we ignored stuff like

00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:54,670
like controllers and everything we

00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:56,470
didn't start to think about how tools

00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:57,970
kind of work and we are how are you

00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:59,589
going to navigate and we are how do you

00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:00,910
set up all your settings how do you set

00:08:59,589 --> 00:09:03,760
up the reference pairs and all the kind

00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:05,620
of stuff we put that aside and focused

00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,959
on right for this project for the

00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:11,520
microcosm of core project I focused on

00:09:07,959 --> 00:09:16,959
the viewport rendering part of it

00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:19,230
intentionally so I didn't want to do

00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:23,529
much work on the blender viewport itself

00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:26,380
because that is a big project to with

00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:28,240
the 2.8 project there are so many things

00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:31,089
that have been proof in the viewport and

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:34,329
with our architecture which made my life

00:09:31,089 --> 00:09:36,430
so much more easy and there are some

00:09:34,329 --> 00:09:38,770
extra abstractions in place which should

00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:41,260
have which should really help us further

00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:43,149
develop stuff and to really performs

00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:46,449
improvements like single pass drawing

00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:48,220
and everything so yeah and we all know

00:09:46,449 --> 00:09:51,220
good two-strike there too I'm happy

00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:55,779
about that this does have some

00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:58,360
implications of course I have to start

00:09:55,779 --> 00:10:01,390
developed like initial in the

00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:05,410
she took architecture for all the

00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:07,450
openings our stove and blender this is a

00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:09,370
topic that I do care about architecture

00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:11,610
in general so this had to work

00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:17,290
sorry I put a lot of effort into that

00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:20,560
also error handling um I don't want or

00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:23,410
if there's some error happening on the

00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:28,720
VRS alright like say open exit doesn't

00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:30,820
find the device or there's some okay but

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,500
there's every wrong API use because

00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:34,300
that's a buck and that's not something

00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:38,709
that we should expose as an error but

00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:41,740
anyway if anything bad happens I really

00:10:38,709 --> 00:10:43,690
want that we fake gracefully we just

00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:46,060
exit the VR session we don't try to

00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:47,260
restore anything or so we just exit to

00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:49,390
be our session and leave the rest of

00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:53,050
blender untouched and make sure it keeps

00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:55,560
working of course this has limits like

00:10:53,050 --> 00:11:00,279
we can't deal with if the driver crashes

00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:03,010
we can't do anything about that and I

00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:05,380
was really trying to avoid anyway are

00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:08,230
specifics roaring overhead um I can show

00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:13,589
you what we could get a bit more into

00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:16,690
that in a second or actually now we have

00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:20,170
what we have now I think is pretty well

00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:22,600
performing via rendering of course this

00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:25,930
is always like it is not a really

00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:27,550
scientific statement or so but if I am

00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:29,649
personally quite happy with it now we

00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:32,890
have reasonably complex scenes with a

00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:37,510
few million triangles and they run ads

00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:40,870
around 16 through 60 to 100 FPS easily

00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:44,550
on decent machine sorts I think that's

00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:46,410
pretty fine of course we still have the

00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:48,339
openings our runtime

00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:51,160
throttling the speed for the device

00:11:48,339 --> 00:11:53,800
refresh rate and all that stuff but in

00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:56,079
theory we could do reasonably complex we

00:11:53,800 --> 00:12:01,300
can do really complex scenes with it

00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:04,560
around hundred FFP RS fps I'm sorry

00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:07,750
and yeah I'm quite satisfied with that

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:09,460
of course there we are using the open XR

00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:15,270
SDK loader to

00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:15,270
to the open a stick open XR SDK runtime

00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:26,080
that's better so I think this is

00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:29,830
actually a useful thing because it

00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:32,950
really is a No s wide way to set an

00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:35,880
active runtime so I think this is

00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:40,750
actually not such an unimportant

00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:45,640
deliverable deliverable and then for the

00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:47,320
initial patch I'm a edit an add-on so we

00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:50,080
can hide that we are stuff from the UI

00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:52,060
for now because it is really limited and

00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:54,610
really focused on getting the viewport

00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:57,339
rendering to work and it's just gonna be

00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:59,350
sort of disappointing if users find out

00:12:57,339 --> 00:13:01,510
that or find that we are button and they

00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:03,490
click it and it's not doing that much

00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:04,029
other than just showing the View button

00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:07,000
we are

00:13:04,029 --> 00:13:10,690
if the openings asked over set up on the

00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,800
system so yeah we want to develop things

00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:15,370
a bit further before we actually

00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:16,450
activate this stuff by default and

00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:19,209
that's pretty much what I said earlier

00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:21,730
about the error handling strategy we

00:13:19,209 --> 00:13:24,490
want to fake gracefully with the useful

00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:26,260
error message message actually it's not

00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:30,700
an important thing the important thing

00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:32,980
and yeah no side effects of course here

00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:34,690
I'm on a first conference so you

00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:38,430
probably don't care too much about that

00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:41,110
but we want blended or we want

00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:43,709
capability or support for the windows

00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:47,800
mixed reality portal to of course and

00:13:43,709 --> 00:13:50,529
this one only supports DirectX it was

00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:55,360
also my main development platform for

00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:59,709
this project because I had a Windows

00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:02,350
mixed reality hmd so yeah I had to work

00:13:59,709 --> 00:14:07,450
on getting tired exporting this is using

00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:10,209
some wgl extensions and I was having

00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:12,310
some issues but turns out that oh as VRS

00:14:10,209 --> 00:14:15,810
is actually doing the exact same thing

00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:19,870
and I can just still quote from them

00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:21,850
this is cool of course I did all kinds

00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:27,040
of debugging utilities like unable to

00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:31,660
it's our extension for debugging and

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:34,019
it's kind of some command line comments

00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:39,660
for comments for plan and everything

00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:42,069
um well of course the architecture stuff

00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:43,779
so I added this those initial

00:14:42,069 --> 00:14:46,440
abstractions maybe if we have time we

00:14:43,779 --> 00:14:49,089
can look at the code briefly at the end

00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:52,300
all in all i'm current satisfied with

00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:53,560
the project outcome of course there are

00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:56,170
always things that you want to address

00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:58,630
and that you want to improve and I'm

00:14:56,170 --> 00:15:00,790
also pretty picky about many things but

00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:05,139
all in all I'm actually quite happy with

00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:06,910
how it came out so I'm looking forward

00:15:05,139 --> 00:15:09,870
to seeing it and playing a monster and

00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:12,250
seeing people actually starting using it

00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:14,980
puzzles those are some screenshots the

00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:17,829
mixed reality portal which is I guess

00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:18,190
the most major openings are for right

00:15:17,829 --> 00:15:20,980
now

00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:23,680
I know you do you guys don't care too

00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:26,079
much for it but that's what Pranay users

00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:29,110
want to see that kind of stuff and the

00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:30,779
oculus wrench ends working - I don't

00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:34,029
have a screenshot of monado

00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:37,110
unfortunately because I got it to run on

00:15:34,029 --> 00:15:39,329
my machine in the planner Institute and

00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:41,589
I made some screenshot actually

00:15:39,329 --> 00:15:43,600
screenshots actually for the meeting

00:15:41,589 --> 00:15:46,360
stand the weekly stare but I only had

00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,430
them in the network there and now I came

00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:51,130
I was actually traveling last week and

00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:53,079
came to the to the office and my screen

00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:54,490
was stolen because they had to bring

00:15:53,079 --> 00:15:56,800
them to the blender conference and

00:15:54,490 --> 00:16:02,290
everything so I did manage to get a

00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:05,380
screenshot of it I'm just kind of sad so

00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:11,920
we can have a that's really go through

00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:19,100
the approach connect to the internet we

00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:23,450
go that's my sandwich drink something

00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:26,380
oh by the way excuse me for using

00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:30,200
windows I was just trying to

00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:32,060
I always only used the nodes except for

00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:35,150
if I have to develop something for

00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:37,850
Windows and I had to unfortunately it

00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:40,190
didn't detect other displays or I had no

00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:43,640
choice right now - other than selling

00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:47,450
Windows but I am I'm using LibreOffice

00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:49,430
as elf offers at least so I'm not going

00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:53,330
totally crazy here so basically this is

00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:55,030
the pageant has some information and if

00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:59,150
somebody's interested in checking it out

00:16:55,030 --> 00:17:05,180
is actually here there you are

00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:08,170
still have to respond to your post um so

00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:10,699
this is the patch what else do we have

00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:14,870
this is my final google Summer of Code

00:17:10,699 --> 00:17:17,060
report there's quite a lot of

00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:21,170
information on there with a little

00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:22,520
overview and then some more in-depth

00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:27,320
information about all the features and

00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:29,540
everything and of course the demo video

00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:31,700
and again it's using the Windows mixed

00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:38,750
reality platform because that's what

00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:41,060
worked for me actually it's pretty

00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:44,300
simple or you just have to enable the

00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:45,860
add-on of course that hides the button

00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:49,850
from the UI then you toggle the VR

00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:52,820
session and the tours um I mean this

00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:55,970
isn't too fancy for you guys I think you

00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:58,040
are used to this but you can see this is

00:17:55,970 --> 00:18:00,140
a scene with almost three million

00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:03,800
triangles and it's pretty smooth and of

00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:06,740
course there's like time wrapping going

00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:09,620
on and free protection but still it's

00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:14,300
doing pretty well actually I'm quite

00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:16,400
happy with that you can find it on my

00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,900
Twitter account if you want to watch it

00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,610
again

00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:22,370
let's preview talk about the XR team um

00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:24,620
again this is totally unofficial and

00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:26,360
this is not like super close team

00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:29,420
assault like you're just a couple of

00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:33,040
people and we try to connect and get

00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:33,040
stuff done for blender

00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:36,800
I'm calling it X our team here and VR

00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:40,760
team here

00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:44,080
well done that I fell into is sort of

00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:47,030
the project are one of the main managers

00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,350
in blender for the blender development

00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:49,880
team

00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:54,980
he's been doing lots of work with we are

00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:56,870
his day job used to be lots of we are

00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:59,020
work and I think he's still doing like

00:18:56,870 --> 00:19:02,750
one day a week on we are projects

00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:05,120
Danny Martinez lava he is a super

00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:13,280
awesome guy this is supposed to be a

00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:18,170
link actually so let me Google stuff for

00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:20,930
dr. Kostov of course this project MPX

00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:23,150
which is by Daniel Martinez lava and

00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:27,650
he's just a super awesome guy he does

00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:30,430
lots of 2d drawing in blender so this is

00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:32,750
something that people really loved about

00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:35,510
the newer versions of planner that you

00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:38,030
can basically use the 3d world and paint

00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:40,070
to the paintings in it and use the depth

00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:44,420
and everything to get those awesome

00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:49,910
results and this is kind of the work he

00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:52,000
does in there and of course there's some

00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:54,950
we ourself and he has been doing lots of

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,890
experiments with we are together with

00:19:54,950 --> 00:20:00,650
his own little team and this is just

00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:05,150
super awesome stuff I think this is this

00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:07,520
runs room through net oh my sir but he's

00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:09,500
really enthusiastic about having we are

00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,450
implanted because you can do so much

00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:14,360
more stuff in this it's such a different

00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:17,240
way of working which is not to say that

00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:20,300
or we don't expect that people are just

00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:22,670
gonna use we are all the time like

00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:26,140
there's still issues with heavy HMDs and

00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:29,390
everything but it's something that

00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:31,160
really complements people's workflows

00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:35,120
and you can just switch back and forth

00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:38,000
between mice and keyboards and and pen

00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:42,470
like drawing pens and the we are

00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,760
displays so this is he's doing amazing

00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:45,000
stuff

00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:47,790
there's also Jam

00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:51,060
who was supposed to be at the conference

00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:55,080
today he was a bit late so I didn't get

00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:58,610
to see him yet and I never met him he's

00:20:55,080 --> 00:21:02,900
being doing concept arts for huge

00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:05,370
productions like Jurassic world or

00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:08,310
Avengers guardians of the galaxy and

00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:10,860
he's been recently trying to use blender

00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:12,480
more more and more in that I think all

00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:14,820
this block in Jurassic world was

00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:22,080
actually done under the concept art and

00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:25,470
so it's his name up girl and he's also

00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,970
really really into the idea of doing

00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:29,550
this kind of stuff in we are it's kind

00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:33,360
of painting and drawing so yeah those

00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:35,250
are some projects supportin yeah so

00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:41,640
that's another cool guy to have on the

00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:45,170
team okay that one that's just me max

00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:47,700
equation written power heated also maybe

00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:51,210
you might actually know him he's been

00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:56,760
doing some plugins for Maya and Max I

00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:59,760
think and he's also been it's not him

00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:04,140
it's his team he's working for or he's

00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:08,760
the CEO of a company called Murray

00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:15,000
plugin and they've been doing a project

00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:16,320
called blender XR okay and I think you

00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,610
can see in the background a source I

00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:25,050
don't have to yeah so it's basically

00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:27,360
also um actually as C implement C and

00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:29,370
C++ implementation to have VR

00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,620
capabilities and we are tools inside

00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:34,830
blender and this is a really cool

00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:38,340
project we are probably not trying to do

00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:42,690
this the same kind of workflow that they

00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:44,940
went for but I'm we happy to have him

00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:49,560
and the company abroad to help us

00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:51,900
develop tools I'm sorry yeah they're

00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:54,030
doing cool stuff and imagine like this

00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:57,180
kind of set dressing or layout stuff

00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:58,210
that's so easy to do we are and one of

00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:01,420
the main use case

00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:04,120
in tours say you're working an animation

00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:06,610
movie and the director comes in and they

00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:08,620
just want to work through the set

00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:11,380
basically and we rearrange stuff on the

00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:13,210
fly and for them this is going to be

00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:16,780
totally useful like just put on the

00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:19,450
classes and rearrange stuff and maybe we

00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:21,970
can add some AR capabilities through it

00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:24,760
and they can actually talk to the

00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:26,260
colleagues and everything like there's

00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:29,230
lots of potential in there I'm Sebastian

00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:31,750
Koenig German Gaya

00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:33,070
and I went for a long time and he's been

00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,640
around in the planner community ever

00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:36,670
since forever

00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:40,030
and she's also doing with this company

00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:43,360
plant affects lots of commercial we are

00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:49,030
work or lots of professional industry we

00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:51,100
are work so for him of what them it's a

00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:53,140
lot about the pipeline so you can for

00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:55,810
them they need a preview of their work

00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:58,810
in blender then they are gonna export it

00:23:55,810 --> 00:24:00,460
to unity usually and for them the

00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:02,380
transition between the packages has to

00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:04,900
be really smooth so the whole pipeline

00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:15,240
thing is a huge topic in the animation

00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:15,240
industry so this also matters for we are

00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:27,160
um as I said this is an unofficial team

00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:29,380
so there might still be some people

00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:31,480
joining and this is everybody can help

00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:35,500
out of course it's open source that's

00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:37,780
how we develop stuff and all this stuff

00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:39,580
is where most of the stuff is public we

00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:41,950
have some private email threats that I

00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:47,410
want to copy over under the public

00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:49,570
threats I'm going to just assume if we

00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:52,860
look at further work for we aren't and I

00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:55,300
have some thoughts on this on this

00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:58,240
because we don't just want to sort of

00:24:55,300 --> 00:25:02,950
take the existing blender UI and throw

00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:05,550
it into VR in one way or another we have

00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:09,040
sort of the lead designer for 2 million

00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:12,460
2.5 he's one set

00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:14,530
that if we do this we are just gonna be

00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:16,780
a more difficult way of using blender

00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:20,140
and we don't want that to happen that we

00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:22,720
really want to get the potential of we

00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:27,340
aren't get all those new work for us to

00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:30,400
work in blender so we're kind of

00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:33,040
thinking about designing a XR UI from

00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:35,410
scratch and not taking what's already

00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:39,640
there in blender and really thinking

00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:44,860
about the fresh ways of of implementing

00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:47,110
interaction modes but this one is a

00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:49,600
really important one for me this should

00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:51,310
be used case focus like we don't just

00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:53,500
start adding all kinds of tools and

00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:57,010
don't think about how people gonna use

00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:58,960
this we actually do want to start with

00:25:57,010 --> 00:26:02,200
okay what are the use cases for we

00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:04,090
aren't blender sculpting said stressing

00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:06,700
or the director that works around and

00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:08,740
just tell everybody where he wants to

00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:13,000
have his stuff and adds annotations and

00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:14,920
the 3d space and everything so we are we

00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:19,750
already started a meeting today on we

00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:21,490
are just like a few hours ago and we

00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:23,560
came up with the first use cases that we

00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:26,740
want to work on and that's probably

00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:30,250
where the next steps are going to be

00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:31,930
focused on what they are still this

00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:35,250
thing about consistency and

00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:37,720
interoperability like I said earlier you

00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:41,080
users want to be able to take off the

00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:43,240
hmd and start using their pen tablet or

00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:45,640
start using keyboard and mouse and then

00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:49,710
go back to the hmd and back and forth so

00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:52,240
there has to be this consistency and

00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:54,670
interoperability for this kind of stuff

00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:57,420
to work and this is a bit of a challenge

00:26:54,670 --> 00:27:01,330
to get everything combined like this

00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:04,600
consistency and then don't just take the

00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:08,260
UI and put it in who we are but actually

00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:09,370
think this is an interesting this that's

00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:12,220
interesting

00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:16,350
borders for the project and I think

00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:16,350
that's a good path to go

00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:26,529
this is sort of the main task the main

00:27:24,519 --> 00:27:28,450
design task for everything which will

00:27:26,529 --> 00:27:32,080
reality read it's like the highest level

00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:35,489
task on developer Network which is

00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:39,730
obviously our development platform and

00:27:35,489 --> 00:27:41,259
there are the subtasks linked to it this

00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:44,100
one is probably the most interesting one

00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:47,289
because it has all the open questions

00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:48,639
some of the more important open

00:27:47,289 --> 00:27:51,429
questions that we have to figure out

00:27:48,639 --> 00:27:53,619
early enough before we get into more

00:27:51,429 --> 00:27:55,239
details and yet it has all that's

00:27:53,619 --> 00:27:57,249
interesting stuff so if you want to

00:27:55,239 --> 00:28:00,759
learn more about the actual development

00:27:57,249 --> 00:28:03,190
process or how we actually working on we

00:28:00,759 --> 00:28:07,379
are in blender that's sort of the place

00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:10,179
you would probably want to go that's

00:28:07,379 --> 00:28:16,539
this for the that's it for the

00:28:10,179 --> 00:28:21,489
presentation part of this okay we have

00:28:16,539 --> 00:28:25,450
like no minutes left likes negative 17

00:28:21,489 --> 00:28:28,330
minutes left no I think we can do one or

00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:29,739
two questions then I have to run back to

00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:33,100
the conference and have my meetings

00:28:29,739 --> 00:28:36,100
there all right yeah well you guys have

00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:39,450
time but I don't have time anyway um so

00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:39,450
yeah it's just one or two questions

00:28:50,010 --> 00:29:02,910
extended score I do have idea how new

00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:10,150
xru I should be or coul be look how

00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:12,220
creepy or should people like from the

00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:15,100
design side or from the implementation

00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:19,480
side of it no looks the design like did

00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:22,030
you see the some game or some VR

00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:23,799
application yes for you

00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:26,230
yeah of course we looked at reference

00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:28,570
and it's not like we had sort of totally

00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:30,280
I'm trying to come up with stuff without

00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:32,590
any idea of what other apps do and

00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:37,740
everything and especially the other guys

00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:41,440
have a good idea of this stuff yeah so I

00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:43,600
guess for me I don't see my role in the

00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:45,820
extra design part of the tools and

00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:47,380
everything I'm more focused on getting

00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:51,400
the foundations and the frameworks in

00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:53,650
place to develop tools to to make sure

00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:57,070
that everything is extendable right at

00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:59,740
the Python API we were just talking part

00:29:57,070 --> 00:30:01,570
of the meeting where - part of the

00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:04,030
meeting we just had where two developers

00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:07,090
from Ubisoft and they're partially

00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:08,650
switching to blender and they are also

00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:11,200
really interested in having the VR staff

00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:14,830
work well and they really want to have

00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:16,630
like an extensible Python eye or really

00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:21,490
useful Python API to build their own

00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:26,919
workflows and we are so yeah this is one

00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:29,679
of the things that's important yeah but

00:30:26,919 --> 00:30:33,100
I would I think my role will kind of

00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:34,780
fade away as things go on I hope to put

00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:37,090
the framework in place and make sure

00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:38,890
that everything sort of goes into a

00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:41,650
right direction at the start and that we

00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:42,940
do actually rock and figure out the use

00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:46,270
cases first and don't just start

00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:47,799
implementing random stuff but then as

00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:50,230
all the foundations are in place I think

00:30:47,799 --> 00:30:54,790
my role will fade away and other people

00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:56,980
are the especially part of the team can

00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:58,660
implement the tools and to all the

00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:00,609
useful stuff the fancy eye candy stuff

00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:03,440
and everything

00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:05,029
so I had the kind of hate love

00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,249
relationship with the blen divinity or

00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:09,109
like I started the or and I work Wow I

00:31:07,249 --> 00:31:10,820
need to do everything in VR and then I

00:31:09,109 --> 00:31:12,739
did workshops in blender and was like

00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:14,779
wow I can do everything in blender and

00:31:12,739 --> 00:31:16,820
there are so many menus menus and

00:31:14,779 --> 00:31:19,729
everything that would make no sense to

00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:21,649
bring that to you're just too many so

00:31:19,729 --> 00:31:24,109
I'm wondering what's the best strategy

00:31:21,649 --> 00:31:27,379
for this like you mentioned focusing on

00:31:24,109 --> 00:31:29,320
specific workflows we should it be

00:31:27,379 --> 00:31:33,169
sculpting first like what would be the

00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:36,259
easier faster biggest impact to start

00:31:33,169 --> 00:31:37,339
with you're in blender as a workflow and

00:31:36,259 --> 00:31:40,369
one of the things that I'm always afraid

00:31:37,339 --> 00:31:43,459
of his in planner development or UI

00:31:40,369 --> 00:31:46,039
development in general but it's also

00:31:43,459 --> 00:31:48,320
especially for the VR stuff there's the

00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:49,909
saying the check of all trades put the

00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:53,059
master of none like I don't really want

00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:55,129
to go there so especially for the VR

00:31:53,059 --> 00:31:57,769
stuff I think this use case stuff is

00:31:55,129 --> 00:32:00,499
really important and of course um some

00:31:57,769 --> 00:32:02,899
of the first ones is to look at is scrap

00:32:00,499 --> 00:32:04,820
thing because that's sort of alloying in

00:32:02,899 --> 00:32:06,049
fruit we just need to control us to work

00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:08,299
we need to picking to work and

00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:10,609
everything but then we don't need

00:32:08,299 --> 00:32:12,799
anymore and you need to select the tools

00:32:10,609 --> 00:32:15,289
but then you can just interact with the

00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:17,659
object directly but then there are other

00:32:15,289 --> 00:32:19,789
stuff where you need like those free DQ

00:32:17,659 --> 00:32:21,409
s'mores and which is however you want to

00:32:19,789 --> 00:32:26,269
call them in 3d space and you really

00:32:21,409 --> 00:32:29,269
want to use that kind of stuff so to

00:32:26,269 --> 00:32:31,190
develop some of those gizmos there's I

00:32:29,269 --> 00:32:33,409
guess for the use case where the

00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:35,509
director wants to walk in and arrange

00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:36,859
the set and everything that's also one

00:32:35,509 --> 00:32:38,889
of the first ones we were going to look

00:32:36,859 --> 00:32:43,759
at and we need the gizmos for that and

00:32:38,889 --> 00:32:47,299
some other special tools so those are

00:32:43,759 --> 00:32:49,969
two of the of the used cases then of

00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:54,700
course another one is painting in 3d the

00:32:49,969 --> 00:32:57,950
stuff that Daniel Martinez Lara does so

00:32:54,700 --> 00:33:00,200
yeah we I think we have two more use

00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:02,059
case that we settled on to start with

00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:04,339
but yeah this is just stuff we discussed

00:33:02,059 --> 00:33:06,679
today and we just have to put it online

00:33:04,339 --> 00:33:08,690
and it starts working them out into

00:33:06,679 --> 00:33:10,129
flesh mode so yeah those are the kind of

00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:11,390
things that things that we want to start

00:33:10,129 --> 00:33:15,060
on

00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:17,850
all right I think it's time to rub it up

00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:21,230
I have to run thank you very much and

00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:25,470
have a good rest of the day see you

00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:33,099
[Applause]

00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:33,099
