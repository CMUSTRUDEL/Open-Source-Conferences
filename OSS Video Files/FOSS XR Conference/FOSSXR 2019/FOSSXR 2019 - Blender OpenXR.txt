Publication date: 2019-12-04
Playlist: FOSSXR 2019
Description: 
	Since 2016, there have been multiple attempts for a VR implementation in Blender. But with the release of OpenXR and the Blender 2.8 rewrite, all the components were available for a fully supported VR integration in Blender. This presentation will show the current implementation of OpenXR into Blender, which is in Master and will be shipped in the 2.81 release, with all the hurdles and implementations required to make this work. The initial work was done on a GSOC of long time Blender developer Julian Eisel.
