[Music]

00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:11,130
we're ahead of schedule so this would be

00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:13,200
the written kill or we can do something

00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:15,630
that traditionally has been done quite a

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,369
bit open princess is there someone who

00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,289
wants to do a lightning talk because

00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:21,060
it's the perfect moment to do a random

00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:23,820
lightning thought you get five minutes

00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:26,400
no slides you can use a browser if you

00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:28,439
want to and one wants to do a lightning

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,359
talk yeah Chris okay lightning talk

00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:36,300
perfect we have a lightning talk from

00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:40,649
Chris I have been rocking on Gordo

00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:49,250
plugin that integrates open XR into a

00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:54,199
DeCoteau engine and yeah with this

00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:58,350
plug-in they can run again on monado

00:00:54,199 --> 00:01:02,820
with our positional tracking that Jacob

00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:11,490
mentioned before so yes I was - you

00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:15,439
I from one ATO and in the background on

00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:22,530
the right you can see our control us I

00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:25,950
think I need to restart this I think the

00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:27,509
camera doesn't reliably rock right it

00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:29,869
says please stop this and then at very

00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:29,869
dark

00:01:35,409 --> 00:01:38,409
hopefully

00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:10,020
more or less oh the camera does not work

00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:12,320
that's annoying let me try it one last

00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,320
time

00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:43,830
this looks good

00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:50,030
the stocks

00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:58,290
yes

00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:03,709
unfortunately there are some Karlovac

00:03:01,099 --> 00:03:05,480
that throttles my laptop to 400

00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:07,670
megahertz but that should not matter

00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:13,010
it's just a little bit laggy because of

00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:22,389
that so let's just plug in you can drag

00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:22,389
the controllers and this is the right on

00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:32,410
yeah it works better if my laptop is not

00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:35,290
throttle to 400 megahertz but as you can

00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:39,640
see the controllers are positional

00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:43,630
tracked in go to engine and I can use

00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:54,160
the buttons to tell it what around about

00:03:43,630 --> 00:04:06,160
the tracking is very slow this is

00:03:54,160 --> 00:04:08,290
running open source tech not the

00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:13,299
tracking works a lot better if your CPU

00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:17,200
is not rotted to 400 megahertz yes I can

00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:20,400
see my CPU speed is 400 megahertz I

00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,400
can't hide it

00:04:20,669 --> 00:04:28,570
ask AMD or others I guess

00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:41,260
very have stability of iOS update that

00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:44,760
fixes it I don't know not really no but

00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:48,370
yeah you have know the ability to

00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:52,479
develop your VR application with

00:04:48,370 --> 00:05:00,610
position you try to control us that's

00:04:52,479 --> 00:05:02,229
basically my like let me let me

00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:03,640
introduce you to the other project that

00:05:02,229 --> 00:05:06,700
project that I'm talking about at the

00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:09,880
GStreamer conferences next week which is

00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:11,710
another side project that I have had

00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:15,190
running for a couple of years I call it

00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:18,520
arena and it's a home entertainment

00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:20,440
system like a sonar system where I have

00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:23,760
multiple computers based around the

00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:27,190
house and they use the network to share

00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:29,260
clock and they can synchronize a clock

00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:31,210
across the network to millisecond

00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:33,910
precision which is tight enough that you

00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:36,820
can now get every device in the house to

00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:39,070
play a single piece of audio according

00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:40,120
to a precise schedule so when that one

00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:41,800
plays it out that's

00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:44,380
that one blaze it out that speaker it

00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:46,240
sounds like a single unified stereo but

00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:48,699
I don't have to run cables everywhere it

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,880
uses the Wi-Fi for surround sound so

00:05:48,699 --> 00:05:54,190
that was a Rainer in 2015

00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,690
2012 there was the original arena but

00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:58,750
then I had this other idea that I can

00:05:55,690 --> 00:06:01,090
use it as a home automation system so I

00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:02,590
put microphones on every node and now I

00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:04,560
can synchronize the capture of

00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:06,850
microphones across every node and

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,650
there's this thing you can do where if

00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:11,199
you have an array of microphones you can

00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:13,419
use the arrival time of the sound at

00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:17,169
each microphone to do directional

00:06:13,419 --> 00:06:19,030
detection and by spacing them around a

00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:21,220
house I can do triangulation of the

00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:23,650
sound so I can locate the position that

00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:25,660
a person is standing in or in theory

00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:28,720
it's still in progress and starting to

00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:31,780
work but it's a bit tricky so then you

00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,190
ask the Hat you say hey my house turn on

00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:34,389
the lights and it knows exactly where

00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:36,460
you're standing in the house it knows

00:06:34,389 --> 00:06:37,930
which light is closest to you you ask it

00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:40,150
to stop the music where you are I'll

00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:41,500
turn the volume down it can do that so

00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:43,180
the idea is to make your house more

00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,680
aware of where you are when you ask it

00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:47,620
to do things and give it that extra

00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:50,940
piece of context there's also another

00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:53,350
piece of this project that is very

00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:55,419
nascent and hardly works at all which is

00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:58,410
you can only do this trick if you know

00:06:55,419 --> 00:07:01,840
where the nodes are in the house so

00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:03,610
similar to the rift calibration step it

00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,530
is figure out where the cameras are

00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:07,870
there is a piece of this where they play

00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:10,030
sounds at each other and encode little

00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:12,310
bits of messages in ultrasonics and then

00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:13,960
listen and they because they know they

00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:15,849
have this clock already on the network

00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,289
they can know when that one sent it when

00:07:15,849 --> 00:07:19,240
this one received it they can measure

00:07:17,289 --> 00:07:20,620
the distance to each other and the

00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,840
direction to each other and they can

00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:25,510
form a little map of where they are and

00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:28,570
use that for their triangulation so that

00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:31,450
is the arena home automation system that

00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:33,870
I have is a another side project under

00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,870
development

00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:41,380
[Applause]

00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:43,150
okay so you know a lady who I am

00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:45,580
this is a little sketch I've done on my

00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:50,620
paper not bad I think I showed you

00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:53,110
before this the idea is so a little bit

00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:55,300
of quote fine man reacted with

00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:57,820
unexpected genres actually did the work

00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:59,830
on the paper he said well when I said

00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:02,020
the work has done was not in your head

00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:03,520
but the record of it is still there no

00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:05,290
it's not a record not really it's

00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:08,260
working you have to work on the paper

00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:11,139
and this is the paper okay so the area

00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:12,340
is you think you the paper is useless

00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:14,530
you think just writing on the computer

00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:16,120
is nothing because it's transparent you

00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:18,190
forget about it but it really changes

00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,990
the way you think so that's why I do

00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:21,250
those little sketches on paper I don't

00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:24,430
know if I can put this in full screen

00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:27,130
but anyway I use the render best browser

00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:28,990
out there of course and what I do after

00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:31,630
I sketch my little things on just paper

00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:34,570
I export it and I have an SVG when I

00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:36,820
have an SVG then I can display of course

00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:38,440
on the web and because SVG is sequential

00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:40,390
the first stroke is the first line of

00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:43,000
the file I can display it line by line

00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:45,700
so my complex drawing that looks like a

00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,560
poster at the end is actually sequential

00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,910
so I can use this in presentation or

00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:51,430
wherever I want who explain a

00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:52,390
complicated topic like for example what

00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:55,300
is the difference between the position

00:08:52,390 --> 00:09:00,220
of a controller and it's a 3d object in

00:08:55,300 --> 00:09:02,740
space good thing about it is I can be in

00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:04,330
a cafe and if I have my brilliant have

00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:05,920
you seen perfectly working laptop then

00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:07,930
I'll get notifications I'll get

00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,550
distracted emails and whatnot when I'm

00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:11,320
on the paper piece of paper no

00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:13,480
distraction I have to think I have to go

00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:15,100
through it so that really helps me and

00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:17,740
actually I noticed that

00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:19,209
so Mollison remarkable even the

00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,620
Microsoft's we face a lot of those

00:09:19,209 --> 00:09:22,990
device that lead you free hand drawing

00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:25,089
actually can export to SVG so it can

00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:27,220
scale they change the color flip it if

00:09:25,089 --> 00:09:29,589
you want to go like dog mode because it

00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:33,339
the trend right now or of course just

00:09:29,589 --> 00:09:35,470
inks gave on tablet how to use it well

00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:38,589
you just put the SVG online anywhere you

00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:40,240
get your HTTP but applaud or SVG you

00:09:38,589 --> 00:09:42,459
read it in the little player that I've

00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,260
done and just erased in the iframe so

00:09:42,459 --> 00:09:46,300
it's in your presentation and then you

00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:49,030
can customize it like I said invert

00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:50,889
because it's dark mode and customize it

00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:52,149
so that's the result

00:09:50,889 --> 00:09:54,189
I just explained blah blah blah

00:09:52,149 --> 00:09:56,079
controller is positioned above that tap

00:09:54,189 --> 00:09:58,569
on the screen until it's the next step

00:09:56,079 --> 00:10:00,399
oh it's very complicated and then I

00:09:58,569 --> 00:10:13,239
compare the two values and voila

00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:15,489
I do something that's fine that's fine

00:10:13,239 --> 00:10:18,579
to any of them so like I said just how

00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:20,319
does it work is easy just text and it

00:10:18,579 --> 00:10:22,389
looks magic but it's just X so you can

00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:24,759
practically modify it even though it's

00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:27,279
visual content and the old magic is you

00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:30,009
can actually use Donal functions on it

00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:33,509
so you can just the attribute and the

00:10:30,009 --> 00:10:36,189
side just like to modify normal webpage

00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:38,529
so actually a little bit meta so I

00:10:36,189 --> 00:10:41,679
explained the tool as an SVG as a

00:10:38,529 --> 00:10:43,660
drawing and then okay I took complicated

00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:46,629
is my poster but then I can sequence it

00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:51,189
step by step I go from the paper version

00:10:46,629 --> 00:10:54,309
to the digital version got my SVG put it

00:10:51,189 --> 00:10:57,100
online got my proper URL and just embed

00:10:54,309 --> 00:11:02,799
it on any web page like for example this

00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:04,209
very slide but of course you can go

00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:05,889
further you can have like a timeline

00:11:04,209 --> 00:11:07,959
editor so you can switch the different

00:11:05,889 --> 00:11:10,629
part of the elements you can display

00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:12,910
them in whatever order you want so yeah

00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:16,119

00:11:16,119 --> 00:11:19,660
on his face you can draw your own slide

00:11:17,829 --> 00:11:21,940
