Netta separated from the apps that did

00:00:56,819 --> 00:01:04,140
she use and and we want to make this a

00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:06,540
little bit more personal so we consider

00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:09,780
your personal data as a digital

00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:12,450
expression of your yourself and the apps

00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,850
and services that you use those are a

00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:19,469
digital expression of the brand or the

00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:22,110
company behind these these apps and that

00:01:19,469 --> 00:01:24,030
brings us to our vision or mission

00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:25,799
statement and that is that we want to

00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:28,110
enable people to take back their online

00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:32,189
autonomy by creating balanced

00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:34,469
relationships I underlined autonomy that

00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:37,079
basically means that we want to give

00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:40,590
people back control of their data and

00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:42,719
balance is that if you connect with the

00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:44,880
brand there are two entities that

00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:48,859
connect and they all should they brought

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:52,950
you to the FSA in in this relationship

00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:54,539
if we consider a relation and not just a

00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:57,539
connection there are several things we

00:01:54,539 --> 00:01:59,579
can consider first of all is when you

00:01:57,539 --> 00:02:02,869
enter a relationship the other entity

00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:05,369
becomes part of your own identity and

00:02:02,869 --> 00:02:08,490
the second thing is that a relationship

00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:12,330
goes through different phases you get to

00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:15,780
know each other or the brand you go the

00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:18,680
relation gets deeper and and sometimes

00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:21,049
it will end as well

00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:25,310
and the last thing about relations is

00:02:21,049 --> 00:02:28,459
that each relationship is unique that's

00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:30,860
because of two things one is that you

00:02:28,459 --> 00:02:32,720
and I can both look at the same brand or

00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:37,700
the same person but see something

00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:41,510
different but also it's when the context

00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:43,090
change the way we interact in a

00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:47,030
relationship will also change

00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:49,670
so with Luke we try to use these

00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:52,459
different aspects of a relation and try

00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:56,030
to translate that into a product that

00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:59,900
you that a user can use in e-commerce

00:02:56,030 --> 00:03:03,680
and and I would like to show you some

00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:06,139
examples that we made and hopefully it

00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:10,689
gives you an idea of like what we wanted

00:03:06,139 --> 00:03:13,700
to do so the first concept is the defeat

00:03:10,689 --> 00:03:16,099
basically the feed is that you can

00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:18,950
connect a brand to your own personal

00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:21,500
data account so at this point you don't

00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:25,250
have a relationship yet you don't have

00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:29,090
bought anything else but you can add the

00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:31,220
brand to your personal identity if you

00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:34,340
do this the brand doesn't know anything

00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:39,409
about you yet you don't share data with

00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:42,019
brand yes and another thing is that if

00:03:39,409 --> 00:03:46,159
you shop with different brands you can

00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:48,290
all collect them in in your personal

00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,949
account you can have an overview of all

00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:55,220
the brand's you connected with the

00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:58,400
purchases you made and and also you can

00:03:55,220 --> 00:04:00,409
go into the details of each brand and

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,900
see how you are connected with them you

00:04:00,409 --> 00:04:07,400
can adjust these connections or you can

00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:11,659
even remove the brand altogether and

00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:15,470
last thing I want to show you is the

00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:18,349
Express Checkout so with your data in

00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:22,070
your own account you instead of filling

00:04:18,349 --> 00:04:23,139
out a form you can just have all your

00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:28,539
settings ready

00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:28,539
wherever you go and just do the purchase

00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:36,980
so this is almost done you can make some

00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:42,050
quick attachment adjustments and just

00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:43,250
quickly go to payment and so these are

00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:46,690
just a few

00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:48,980
I think basic things based on the

00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:51,770
customer journey in e-commerce as it is

00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:56,770
today but we see many new opportunities

00:04:51,770 --> 00:05:01,790
that we can do if we will approach the

00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:04,430
way we if we approach it in this way so

00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:06,380
hope it's the best clear thank you for

00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:10,630
your attention and interest any

00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:10,630
questions please let me know

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,300
