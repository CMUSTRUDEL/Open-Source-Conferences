Carrefour started the journey of digital transformation 6 years ago, transforming the e-commerce business into an omnichannel business using an “all in one” e-commerce platform where Search was one more piece of the puzzle.

In time, Carrefour technical team realized that through an open and flexible Search solution, the e-commerce platform could be constructed around it, making Search (and Navigation) the core as opposed to an add-on or an element on the periphery.

This approach, at first, implied several challenges, from strategic to technical ones:

What options do we have? Use a SaaS solution, build a search from scratch, Base our search in an existing solution, Look for a partner to help us to build it… 

How can we keep the intellectual property and the know-how inside the company?
 
What experience do we want to offer to our customers?
 
How can we deal with a huge assortment of products from different natures and stores? 

What insights do we expect to take form the search to help our business?
 
How do we know whether the search is performing well?
 
What strategy do we have to follow for replacement the old search engine keeping, at the same time, the rest of the “all in one” e-commerce platform?
 
How do we develop it and deploy it into production?
 
How do we evolve it?
