Title: Berlin Buzzwords 2017: Alvaro Videla - Metaphors We Compute By #bbuzz
Publication date: 2017-06-15
Playlist: Berlin Buzzwords 2017
Description: 
	We think in words, we talk with words, we understand the world thanks to words. Metaphors take words to the next level explaining concepts that were escaping our understanding before. In 1980 George Lakoff revolutionised the Linguistic and Philosophic worlds when he studied how metaphors affect our thinking, how they influence our actions and even shape who we are. What happens with the metaphors that we use in the Software Industry?

In this talk we are going to review the importance that metaphors have in our code quality, in the algorithms we choose, and the products we ship. 

As a practical example we are going to see why Microservices and Containers have been so successful in the past couple of years. We'll try to understand why they have redefined how we package and ship products in our industry.

	00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:10,350
so thanks for the intern welcome

00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,930
everyone I honestly wasn't expecting

00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:15,990
people that thought with that title like

00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:18,270
metaphors we compute by my name is

00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:20,699
alvaro as he said I come from all the

00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:23,009
way I lived like three years in China

00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:25,769
where we used to make one of the biggest

00:00:23,009 --> 00:00:27,390
dating sites from Germany I cannot say

00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:32,160
the word because I pretty sure it

00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:35,700
violated across conduct later I moved to

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:38,610
Switzerland for a living in Zurich until

00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:42,930
today I mean I still live there I'm not

00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:45,330
quitting suit and ya used to work at

00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:47,310
RabbitMQ I was called developer did a

00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:50,670
lot of things there then moved to Apple

00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:53,760
and now I'm working at a Swiss company

00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:55,800
called Negros Oh me grow as the Swiss

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,140
like to call it and it's like a big

00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,460
supermarket chain and everything the

00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,710
candy machine that happens in

00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:07,049
Switzerland one way or another is touch

00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:10,470
by me grow anyway this talk metaphors we

00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:16,350
compute why it's hard to explain but

00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:18,630
let's get into it the year were let's

00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:22,740
say the literature linguistics

00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:26,760
philosophic philosophy world change was

00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:28,950
when George Lakoff and Marty Johnson

00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,520
they published book metaphors we live

00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,710
dying

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,810
anybody here has read the book show your

00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:38,760
hands you did it the whole room why I am

00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:44,659
amazed nobody knows this book roof the

00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:48,299
main thesis of all Lakoff is that

00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:50,670
metaphors they are not just like matter

00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:53,460
of poetry or rhetorical flourish like

00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:55,979
you use them to explain things and or to

00:01:53,460 --> 00:02:00,180
make your points more beautiful or your

00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:02,790
prose better no that's not the the main

00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:07,610
thing why we have metaphors they say

00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:13,080
they permeate all of language and

00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:17,040
furthermore they dictate in a way how we

00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,730
live how we see the world based outcomes

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,330
from the

00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:26,379
metaphors so they say how we think how

00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:29,440
we behave how we perceive reality how

00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:33,940
our conceptual system is built all these

00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:35,980
things is what they say is affected by

00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:38,260
metaphors and you can say I don't

00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:40,780
believe you or show me an example

00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:43,810
because I am really already thinking

00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:46,269
about going to the next talk and they

00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:49,390
give the first example is argument is

00:02:46,269 --> 00:02:52,540
war we understand argument using a war

00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:55,450
metaphor and just to name some ways we

00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:58,980
speak about arguments if your claims are

00:02:55,450 --> 00:03:02,200
indefensible the italics is a metaphor

00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:05,319
he attached every weak point in my

00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:08,560
argument I demolished his argument I

00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:10,510
never won an argument with him his

00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,239
criticisms were right on target

00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:16,180
bla bla bla la la what's the point here

00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:18,069
it's like because we see argument as war

00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:20,230
this is how we understand argument and

00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:22,720
this is how we argue with each other but

00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:25,090
they say oh they asked what will happen

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,099
if I go meant was dance like we have to

00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:29,470
collaborate with each other we have to

00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:32,739
try to give you some steps I do some

00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:35,139
other steps then this thing evolves in a

00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:37,000
beautiful way what if we think that way

00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:40,389
instead of this trying to destroy the

00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:44,260
other person we try to to actually work

00:03:40,389 --> 00:03:47,530
together to to find pieces of truth

00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:51,130
because if you claim you have the whole

00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:54,910
truth I mean who are you just talk to me

00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:57,760
after because you're a special person so

00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:59,440
you could say I'm not convinced okay

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:03,910
let's talk about what everybody likes to

00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:07,810
talk politics I know it's a very hot

00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:10,750
topic but just think about in in Europe

00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:16,209
if you think about the metaphor of the

00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:18,789
himat land and all what makes me I don't

00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:21,160
know German Italian Spanish Swiss or

00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:23,110
whatever and all these metaphors around

00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:26,979
that country then you see all the flu

00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:30,789
killing or or was a word for flu

00:04:26,979 --> 00:04:32,240
cleaning is the refugees and you don't

00:04:30,789 --> 00:04:34,130
want them in your country that

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,479
we one way of thing metaphors are

00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:37,039
telling me what I need to think about

00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:38,740
these people or I don't like them or

00:04:37,039 --> 00:04:42,050
whatever

00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:44,210
I'm South American let's think about how

00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:46,789
the Europeans thought about the native

00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:49,190
people there all these salaries that we

00:04:46,789 --> 00:04:53,479
can kill enslave and do whatever we want

00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:57,319
with them because we don't think them as

00:04:53,479 --> 00:05:00,229
people and that is in history in the

00:04:57,319 --> 00:05:02,569
world all over the place one different

00:05:00,229 --> 00:05:05,090
metaphor and then we see something in a

00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:06,800
complete different way disabled person

00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:09,500
versus a person with different abilities

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:15,440
or however you want to call it all these

00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:18,470
wars matter in one way or another you

00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:22,789
still not convinced maybe human resource

00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:26,270
management if you think that people are

00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:27,770
resources you will just think as a

00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:29,720
manager that you can just replace

00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:31,280
developers bring somebody else because

00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,349
it's just a resource I need to optimize

00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,900
the resource usage all these resources

00:05:33,349 --> 00:05:37,520
are not giving me the output I need so

00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:41,060
if you work around this metaphor of

00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:44,690
resources then what are you doing with

00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:46,820
your humans and we are not resources we

00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:50,120
are people and we have many things that

00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:53,840
make our lives and our jobs happier or

00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:56,060
or not happy but don't treat developers

00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,880
like their shows resources but that's

00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:06,319
just another metaphor the getting to

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:08,210
your thoughts then to your warning there

00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,340
has been lot of discussions about a

00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:14,210
conference in the functional programming

00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:17,569
world where people are telling that this

00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:23,360
conference is giving a platform to

00:06:17,569 --> 00:06:25,370
racist people to go and speak they

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,620
publish a blog post explaining their

00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:30,740
view this conference about why they were

00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:34,580
inviting this racism to their stage our

00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:37,219
mission is even here and the key here is

00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:39,199
the word wrestling if you are wrestling

00:06:37,219 --> 00:06:41,060
with inclusion are you sure you are

00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,310
trying to get together with that that's

00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:46,639
how you see these things I don't know

00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:49,879
think about it i that word came

00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:53,659
jump to me when I saw in that particular

00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:59,060
blog post but anyway let's talk about

00:06:53,659 --> 00:07:00,469
computers computers another metaphor you

00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:02,689
probably have seen the movie read the

00:07:00,469 --> 00:07:07,189
book I don't know have you seen the

00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:11,960
hidden figures same yeah go these women

00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:16,580
they were the actual computers so even

00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:19,849
our industry started from a big metaphor

00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:22,159
we had these people usually women that

00:07:19,849 --> 00:07:24,710
they were all doing all these very fast

00:07:22,159 --> 00:07:26,870
calculations for for for the engineers

00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:28,310
and because we had this machine that

00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:30,139
kinda could do the same thing but

00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:33,680
automatically how do we call them

00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:36,050
computers because we have no other word

00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:39,710
and metaphors are always used to explain

00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:41,870
things from one area of knowledge into

00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:46,759
another one we try to use them to

00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:50,719
transfer knowledge because the metaphors

00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:52,639
they enable understanding we have a word

00:07:50,719 --> 00:07:55,339
to name something versus having nothing

00:07:52,639 --> 00:08:00,500
and having to plain everything from

00:07:55,339 --> 00:08:04,069
scratch but we have to be careful of

00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:06,860
what we understand as a metaphor or what

00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:09,289
we expect from the metaphor one of the

00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:12,279
probably most famous one in literature

00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:15,949
is the Shakespeare's when he says or

00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:18,949
Romeo says that Juliet is like the Sun I

00:08:15,949 --> 00:08:21,560
guess you probably understand that he

00:08:18,949 --> 00:08:23,569
saying that without Juliet his life has

00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:26,029
no meaning or he will die because this

00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:30,740
the energy of his life his life is all

00:08:26,029 --> 00:08:33,519
going around Juliet and everything that

00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:37,370
probably the sentiment to a 16th century

00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:40,070
person but you cannot say that a

00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:42,860
metaphor is a one-to-one mapping between

00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:46,519
concepts because Jack still never said

00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:50,209
that Juliet gave me a skin cancer it's

00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:54,800
not what Romeo is thinking about this

00:08:50,209 --> 00:08:57,529
lover he has so we have to be careful

00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,420
because sometimes people is the problem

00:08:57,529 --> 00:09:02,120
with metaphors it's like when you use

00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:05,660
it just you saying this thing I'm sorry

00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:07,280
I don't have an example right now people

00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:08,510
like to argue in the Internet and they

00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,340
would say yeah but that's not real

00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:12,050
because these people is not doing this

00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:13,790
under London and then destroy the whole

00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:16,220
metaphor because there is no not a

00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:18,290
one-to-one mapping here for sure that's

00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:22,070
the whole point you see some patterns

00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:25,340
and you put them together so there is

00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:28,360
another book by a researcher from the

00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:31,250
Netherlands I think Viktor garden force

00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:34,100
which is called the geometry of meaning

00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:35,840
semantics based on conceptual spaces if

00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:37,490
you don't have a weird title I think you

00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:42,530
are not an academic I'm not sure how it

00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:46,240
works but in a place they mention Lakoff

00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:48,890
and they say that metaphorical mappings

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:52,310
preserve the cognitive topology of the

00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:54,110
source domain in a way consistent with

00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:56,960
the inherent structure of the target

00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:59,270
domain you see things that are together

00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:02,620
that are like they match and then you

00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:06,620
use a metaphor to explain that other

00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:08,510
concept this a computer is not a woman

00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:10,660
just sorry if I use the word woman for

00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:14,210
the early computers like in the movie

00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:16,970
hidden figures the computer is not this

00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:20,270
person just doing calculations it's just

00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:22,070
the calculation part that I want take as

00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:24,320
an example to explain what this machine

00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:25,970
that I just built that is full of cables

00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,210
and nobody understand what is it's doing

00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:31,250
that we should spend a lot of budget

00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:33,380
building it let's say government 1950s

00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:34,520
and I need to explain you what is doing

00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:36,500
okay you see all this room full of

00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:39,410
computers we just replace it with this

00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:43,550
thing here are cool here's your check

00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:44,840
that's easier to explain but it doesn't

00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:46,730
mean that the computer are you telling

00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:49,250
me that the computer has to go to the

00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:52,070
toilet and run all across campus no I'm

00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:55,280
not saying that so again we need to know

00:10:52,070 --> 00:11:00,110
what to transfer from one place to

00:10:55,280 --> 00:11:02,180
another so they say metaphors transfer

00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:04,850
information from one conceptual domain

00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:07,030
to another and what is transfer is a

00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:09,080
pattern rather than domain-specific

00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:11,200
information again is not the computer

00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:14,560
going to the toilet

00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:17,200
a metaphor then they say can thus be

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,210
used to identify a structure in a domain

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,520
that would not have been discovered

00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:25,360
otherwise and I will have plenty of

00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:27,310
examples with this and they say this is

00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:31,420
how metaphors create new knowledge when

00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:32,980
you maybe are very confused about trying

00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:35,170
to explain something then you have the

00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:38,050
right metaphor you have the you

00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:40,660
understand what that problem is but

00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:43,660
another problem is that metaphors also

00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:47,860
obscure understanding a good example is

00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:54,730
the Telegraph Telegraph means far

00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:56,740
writing right so but in the 19th century

00:11:54,730 --> 00:12:01,960
when it's they were inventing the

00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:04,750
Telegraph these are writing machine they

00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:08,320
didn't understand that they didn't have

00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:09,970
to really write at a distance so so

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,860
machines they were trying to build they

00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:14,140
were actually going to have a thing kind

00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:17,590
of right at somewhere like some

00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:21,850
prototypes they they grow up and do

00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:24,700
that's not going to work it's just we

00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:28,770
had also the arrival of Brian the system

00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:31,570
for for blind people's of Zurich and

00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:36,150
then they say okay but maybe we can

00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:38,680
encode the way we transfer language and

00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:40,990
then this other guy came and say oh but

00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:42,730
he also is like I have this code with

00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:45,280
Morse code then okay let's try to

00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:47,650
optimize the things you have here we can

00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:49,720
also use language in color like Bryleigh

00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:51,940
so then we don't need to really write at

00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:53,740
a distance we can do it but not really

00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:56,440
do it and then you have the modern

00:12:53,740 --> 00:13:01,740
Telegraph but if you just get attached

00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:06,700
to that metaphor is not going to work so

00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:08,230
again careful there's a really good good

00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:11,020
book by Nicholas Carr called the

00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:13,000
shallows was the influence the Internet

00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:14,410
is swinging to our minds he said

00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,880
basically that we are becoming shallow

00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:21,220
people and they say sometimes our tools

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,950
do what we tell them to other times we

00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:24,460
adapt ourselves to our tools

00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:27,640
requirements

00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:29,980
and we can say that metaphors are the

00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:32,590
tools of thought so we are always

00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:35,230
adapting to whatever metaphor we have if

00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:37,420
just try to go through history hope we

00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:39,820
explain the functioning of the working

00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:42,010
of the mind in the early or the body in

00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:44,680
the times I think of the Greeks it was

00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:47,170
like fluids and things then it was more

00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:49,240
like this clock that they developed in

00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:51,820
Europe and you have everything is like a

00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:54,130
clockwork a machine working and all

00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:56,470
these pieces putting together and then

00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:58,360
we got the computers which actually the

00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:00,370
original value were people then we have

00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:02,560
the actual machines and our brain is

00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:05,110
like a computer computing information so

00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:09,400
depending on the top tech of the time is

00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:14,040
what we used to parse or interpret or

00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:18,100
ring so then we have metaphors and

00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:22,150
actual code have you ever heard about

00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:26,200
this paper what a parameters yes

00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:29,050
everybody in the room call this paper if

00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:31,420
from the archive of Donald Knuth at some

00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:33,670
point it was a project to scan the

00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:35,290
papers that he has in the library so you

00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:39,700
can find from letters he wrote to

00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:45,160
Dijkstra to this thing to like a manual

00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:47,800
written by Corey the guy the cool guy on

00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:49,870
how to program for the army the whole

00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,550
manual in the 40s

00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:53,890
he was already teaching them to program

00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:56,500
secret stuff then we was reclassified

00:14:53,890 --> 00:15:00,970
and this on the notes archive there's a

00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:06,720
lot of stuff this I will say is the best

00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:10,780
unknown paper is from 56 I think and

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:14,320
it's full of pearls on how to be a good

00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:15,790
programmer how to manage a team in a way

00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,500
and a lot of things that are really

00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:19,170
interesting what problem they were

00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:25,810
having back then that are completely

00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:27,640
happening today and I don't know what's

00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:29,500
the name of this person because Newt

00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:31,180
doesn't know it the person that gave the

00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,620
paper to new chosen knowledge so it's

00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:36,070
new doesn't know something is really

00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:39,430
unknown I guess it's news I don't know

00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:41,740
and they say they say to program is to

00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:45,340
write to another programmer about our

00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:47,350
solution to a problem so when we program

00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:49,240
we yeah we are solving a problem that

00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:51,010
somebody's paying us to do but at the

00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,900
same time either disordered programming

00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:54,670
is asked in the future or some colleague

00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:57,280
we are telling them look for that thing

00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:59,050
that happened this is how we solved it

00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:00,520
we use this data structure this

00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:05,050
algorithm bla bla bla and that's our

00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:08,410
solution that's or metaphor of what that

00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:11,160
thing up there is this thing here stands

00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:14,950
for the solution to that other thing and

00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:17,320
this sentence is a bit mixed but they

00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:19,570
say no one has seen a program which the

00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:28,240
machine could not comprehend but which

00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:30,670
humans did if we try to parse it we if

00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,390
we have a program which they think that

00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:32,890
is correct

00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:34,510
doesn't matter what you wrote the

00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:39,220
computer will be able to parse it

00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:42,430
compile it and run it the thing is who

00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:45,190
is the actual target of that code who

00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:47,260
for who are we writing code if you work

00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:48,850
in a team you're writing for your future

00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:51,070
self and your colleagues you are not

00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:52,690
writing so the computers compile it and

00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:54,760
run it and yeah that's for sure will

00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:56,950
happen sooner or later when when the

00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:59,230
text editor you use shows you that there

00:16:56,950 --> 00:17:01,420
are no syntax error that will wouldn't

00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:02,940
be a problem for a computer but we need

00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:05,640
to understand that there is a

00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:06,760
programming is a human activity between

00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:09,640
humans

00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:11,740
besides the computers that happen to be

00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:13,660
the tools that today we have to run

00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:17,530
those programs in a fast way but that's

00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:23,620
just a tool there so when we write

00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:25,660
programs we can say that types are the

00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:30,520
characters that tell the story of our

00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:32,950
programs and in this case I'm not

00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:35,800
talking about let's have a religious

00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:38,650
site of a scale versus closure or I

00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:40,570
don't care what we all know that Allah

00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:44,710
is better anyway

00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:48,700
and you see max did say space is not

00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:52,630
that gay new clinics not gene you

00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:55,180
linoleic anyway the types of me I mean

00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:58,300
is the actual from this paper while

00:17:55,180 --> 00:18:00,000
Barbara Liskov called program iam with

00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:06,430
abstract data types

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:10,630
back in the 70s if I'm not mistaken she

00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:12,850
had to actually convince people that you

00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:16,510
cool or you should write using

00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:18,460
attraction because the function the

00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:20,710
wrapping calling a function and calling

00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:25,690
that procedure that was like their

00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:27,220
revolution in that time so she had to

00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:29,290
ride you like gear but this thing you

00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:31,330
are doing is a stack call it a stand

00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:33,610
write an API for it and is fine or you

00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:36,910
are just pushing putting stuff into a

00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:39,790
queue or whatever but use a data

00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:41,530
structure and she wrote here she has his

00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:43,360
paper and then she has an actual book

00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:46,000
where she's playing the whole theory and

00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:49,540
by the way she also teaches unit testing

00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:56,500
in that book from the 70s so all these

00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:59,950
all stuffs new stuff anyway one thing to

00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:02,860
understand is that without types we just

00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:05,170
have operations on stream of light who

00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:08,110
I'll give or what is giving meaning to

00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:10,450
the program just whatever type you you

00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:15,880
name that thing but otherwise is just

00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:18,670
bite and just ramming bite like von

00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:22,390
Neumann used to say if you really need

00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:23,860
this machine code like assembler what

00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:27,660
are you're not a real programmer that

00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:30,790
was a von Neumann way of seeing running

00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:34,750
like you should need to you bite the

00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:39,490
things you know download those lumps on

00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:42,190
and off and one thing that we have to be

00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:44,950
clear is that choosing the right data

00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:48,280
structure is very important and you can

00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:50,590
say yeah whatever but just think about

00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:53,290
this you want to keep data let's say

00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:54,340
you're the users in your app use an

00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:57,610
array an array

00:19:54,340 --> 00:20:00,970
perfectly fine to put stuff into it but

00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:04,240
I tell you in the requirement that you

00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:07,059
cannot have duplicated users then why

00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:09,580
don't you use a set because when I use a

00:20:07,059 --> 00:20:12,190
set data structure I'm telling the order

00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:14,650
Paramus I mean forget about all the

00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:16,779
obvious thing that we know said whatever

00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:18,820
is the fastest implementation in Java I

00:20:16,779 --> 00:20:21,429
don't care which language but the set

00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:23,440
idea if you know a bit about math from

00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:25,390
secondary school you know what it

00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:28,120
involves to be a set and to have a set

00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:29,770
so when I read your code and this thing

00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:32,080
storing users it's a set

00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:34,539
I also matically know even if I don't

00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:38,620
read the original spec document that the

00:20:34,539 --> 00:20:42,190
users cannot be duplicated that's one

00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:45,190
bit of information he'll there or if I

00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:48,640
use a linked list I know how the data

00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:50,409
can be accessed or if I use a cue I know

00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:56,289
the order in which items could be

00:20:50,409 --> 00:20:59,620
retrieved or stuck so I say that a

00:20:56,289 --> 00:21:03,520
program explanatory power is a measure

00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:06,130
of its own elegance if you don't it is

00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:08,649
hard to explain your program you have

00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:12,909
all the fancy tricks cool it's fast cool

00:21:08,649 --> 00:21:14,770
not sure it's easy for other people to

00:21:12,909 --> 00:21:16,120
understand what you try to do what was

00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:19,000
the solution you are trying to

00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:22,270
communicate I don't know if even talks

00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:26,620
from Martin Thomson like the performance

00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:29,830
expert in Java mostly less and he said

00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:31,690
that well refactor code is a code that

00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:34,179
usually is easier to observe or

00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:36,309
compilers so it's not an excuse that I

00:21:34,179 --> 00:21:39,730
yeah but I did all these little tricks

00:21:36,309 --> 00:21:42,730
here because I wanted to write fast code

00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:45,580
did you really benchmark it to know that

00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:48,809
single quotes are affecting your users

00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:52,240
versus double quote or I don't care one

00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:54,279
may be nice a programmer Trivium right

00:21:52,240 --> 00:22:00,159
there Lee just proposed a book to

00:21:54,279 --> 00:22:02,649
O'Reilly oh no this parameter trivia so

00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:04,870
as I said all these data structures they

00:22:02,649 --> 00:22:07,090
have explanatory power and there is a

00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:08,750
reason why we should use some versus the

00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:11,850
others

00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:13,950
besides that when we use the right

00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:19,070
metaphors we can have chronic cognitive

00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:22,590
leap just think about task scheduling

00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:25,020
where I want let's say to write the to

00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:27,420
execute tasks based on the order they

00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:29,280
arriving to the system so the first task

00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:30,180
to arrive has to be the first one being

00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,180
executed

00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:35,160
they all have to wait shut up it's just

00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:37,290
queueing theory I mean what you're

00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:38,850
trying to do is to use a queue yeah it's

00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:40,620
very obvious but when you have a queue

00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:42,720
you have queueing theory you have all

00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:44,910
the stories all the theory from along

00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:48,150
the telco guy not they learn the

00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:49,740
language the Danish guy and you have all

00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:51,750
the mathematical power of queueing

00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:53,340
theory to analyze the performance of

00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:56,160
your application or whatever you did a

00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:58,110
cognitive leap and you were using or we

00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:00,750
were using all these words to say in

00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:02,670
order in this thing that we need a queue

00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:03,540
and the story everybody understand what

00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:07,410
is a queue you've been at the

00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:11,390
supermarket airport post office whatever

00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:15,060
so you know what that is

00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:17,580
yeah when I get there if possible with

00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:20,910
not so much traffic and have a nice view

00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:21,780
and bla bla bla bla' graph theory graph

00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:23,970
theory okay

00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:25,560
and when you wince or once you

00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:27,570
understand that your problem is a graph

00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:29,760
problem that does the metaphor that

00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:32,100
explains your power your problem you

00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:34,890
have the whole power for a theory for

00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:36,210
you right there you will know even if

00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:38,010
it's a problem that has a solution

00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:40,460
doesn't have a solution maybe I don't

00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:44,310
know in that theory you will have the

00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:46,920
explanation then on the database

00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:48,780
replication community this is really I

00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:55,040
think the most interesting of all of

00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:58,860
them there was a paper talking about

00:23:55,040 --> 00:24:01,410
rumor mongering basically spreading

00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:03,240
rumors and they wanted to replicate data

00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:06,000
but spreading rumors they call that

00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:07,830
gossip and gossip this and I tell my

00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,750
information to these two nodes and these

00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:14,520
two nodes to three other nodes and bla

00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:15,900
bla bla bla bla very nice but then while

00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:18,510
they were writing the paper they

00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:21,000
realized that data was actually being

00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:21,330
replicated in the same way that an

00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,520
appeal

00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:26,130
Amyx is doing they have a different

00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:27,870
metaphor which was epidemics and then

00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:31,140
they found this paper the mathematical

00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:32,820
theory of epidemics from the 50s all the

00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:36,690
mathematics you need to know on how to

00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:38,310
stop an epidemic an epidemic but they

00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:40,800
say we need the opposite we need to

00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:42,420
spread it faster that's what they want

00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:48,030
to do with data replication and they

00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:50,400
have all this math for free so we can

00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:53,010
say that we can have a problem if we

00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:55,680
find the right way to explain it it's

00:24:53,010 --> 00:25:02,550
cognitive leap that will take us further

00:24:55,680 --> 00:25:08,220
further away so everything is a metaphor

00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:09,920
I don't believe you you might say the

00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:14,820
tribute assistant metaphors

00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:17,400
whenever nodes need to agree on a common

00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:19,560
value we start consensus algorithms to

00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:21,930
decide on a value there's usually a

00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:24,210
leader process that takes care of making

00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:28,550
the final decision based on vote

00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:31,140
received from peers bla bla bla bla bla

00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:36,180
all these books about metaphors you can

00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:38,610
find a political speech by whoever in

00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:41,250
the United States full of metaphors the

00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:44,120
weather reporting the UK full of

00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:47,460
metaphors the political landscape

00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:51,150
landscape actually reflected us weather

00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:55,080
metaphors a storm is coming for the

00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:57,660
whatever party and blah blah blah I

00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:59,420
don't know critics rained on them after

00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:02,280
the I don't care

00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:09,270
just pick a book do that exercise you

00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:12,150
will see they're everywhere so I don't

00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:15,060
know why I have yeah I have more

00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:18,150
metaphor sorry not communicate sending

00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:20,460
messages over a channel which might get

00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:22,950
congested due to too much traffic there

00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:25,140
is a disco create and information

00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:27,600
bottleneck with queues at each end of

00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:29,820
the channels breaking up all metaphors I

00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:32,070
assume some of them I didn't even put it

00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:33,750
on italics you say yeah but this is mega

00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:34,800
obvious everybody's talking like this

00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:37,500
today yeah but

00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:39,810
do you know that when messages were

00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,650
trying to be sent by the early

00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:42,690
Telegraph's

00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:44,970
people were worried that the package

00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:48,090
they bring to the post to the telegraph

00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:50,600
place was not so or like the letter sent

00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:53,190
this letter to my nephew in Zurich and

00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:54,960
and then but the letter is still there

00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:56,880
in your desk what are you doing people

00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,470
were complaining Sinclair that because

00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,180
they didn't understand the metaphor of

00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:06,330
what was being used in the actual

00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:08,790
telegraph some buzz kills so it is not

00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:12,690
so easy sometimes to see what they mean

00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:14,670
by exactly what finally last one this

00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:17,010
bottlenecks might render one or more

00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:18,960
nodes and responsive causing network

00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:21,090
partitions is the process that taking

00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:23,720
too long to respond ed we won't know

00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:32,640
unless we set a timeout whatever

00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:38,760
so metaphors everywhere Intermezzo this

00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:40,350
part may sound random probably but this

00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:44,570
talk was given as a package in

00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:54,210
conference so I had to talk about text

00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:58,290
and besides go ahead ten minutes one

00:27:54,210 --> 00:28:00,990
question is like don't be the seesaw

00:27:58,290 --> 00:28:03,060
seller that is trying to sell the next

00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:06,120
package where I need a scissor to to

00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:08,400
open it and you can understand that for

00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:10,320
example GHC the Haskell compiler if you

00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:14,970
don't ask chef Haskell you can compile

00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:17,550
Haskell so what GLC is required to build

00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:21,330
GHC because plc itself is written blood

00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:23,760
I don't care so but why are we here now

00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:27,930
this because I think the whole packaging

00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:29,730
and container metaphor is was or has

00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:32,280
been has proven to be very successful

00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:35,070
because everybody wherever you go is

00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:37,070
talking about containers and they are

00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:39,780
very easy to explain you can do your

00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:42,450
elevator pitch in about talking about

00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:45,150
containers and because we understand

00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:47,670
these things we see them crossing with

00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:49,980
trains trucks ships whatever

00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:55,130
they have like a standard way of being

00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:57,750
built they can be shipped anywhere

00:28:55,130 --> 00:29:02,490
trying ships trucks whatever they are

00:28:57,750 --> 00:29:04,740
stackable reusable but do we wait till a

00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:07,200
ship is full of containers until the

00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:10,230
ship is actually ship somewhere else no

00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:12,780
we don't we took the best part of the

00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:14,880
container metaphor we use it we throw it

00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:16,770
there and we have startups around it and

00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,770
if you want your next million-dollar

00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:24,900
idea do you know what is that they

00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:28,380
highly di diving bell Holly the guy that

00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:31,170
from the comment he had a startup where

00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:33,050
he was recovering with this bill where

00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:36,210
he could go and dive down in the ocean

00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:38,610
recovering wreckage from containers so

00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:41,100
once all this container industries are

00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:44,190
crashing up maybe we need a highly kind

00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:46,440
of diving bell company trying to migrate

00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:48,780
people away from whatever container

00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:50,460
thing we are using today I don't know

00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:52,380
might happen and probably will happen

00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:56,630
because that what the industry is always

00:29:52,380 --> 00:30:01,350
recycling itself so heady come here

00:29:56,630 --> 00:30:02,720
similar is with micro services we got we

00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:04,350
have all these things thrown up there

00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,420
decentralized governance

00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:09,270
monalee we see this thing that we don't

00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:09,930
like versus micro services small I can

00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:12,990
handle it

00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:15,300
isolation collaboration small is better

00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:17,310
bigger is cumbersome that means vessels

00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:19,230
goliad which I understand those things I

00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:21,450
want to be the small guy between the big

00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:26,820
guy da la la all these metaphor that

00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:28,890
people use to sell us micro services all

00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:30,690
the things like bring this power to the

00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:33,270
developer with micro services and they

00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:35,970
will make you a king and if you read all

00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:39,240
the blog posts from the original micro

00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:42,420
services blog post my question was as an

00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:45,150
Ellen developer this is just LR and the

00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:48,150
last literally last footnote on the blog

00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:49,500
watt says in another direction one color

00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:50,880
you that micro servers are the same

00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,740
thing as the Yellow Emperor amine model

00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:55,860
but applied to an enterprise application

00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:58,140
context so you can say yeah okay yeah

00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:59,670
Lanka I complaining about Alana being

00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:01,210
successful micro services being

00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:04,840
successful that's not the point

00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:07,750
my question is what a long elevator

00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:10,720
pitch killing children like baby like

00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:14,020
these commands in a leg and I don't care

00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:16,059
what how do you explain a lung on an

00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:18,220
elevator to a manager you had a person

00:31:16,059 --> 00:31:20,350
selling things how do you go and sell a

00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:22,390
line there are no metaphor that you can

00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:23,860
employ while if you are selling

00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:28,000
micro-services you have all these other

00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:29,710
things that I should mention so you

00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,539
think we shouldn't care about language

00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:36,309
you think we is not important to learn

00:31:31,539 --> 00:31:40,899
what we do so to finish master the art

00:31:36,309 --> 00:31:44,980
of metaphor selection first get people

00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:47,770
to understand things then we can explai

00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:50,020
how things actually work an example I

00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:52,809
was given or used to give lots of talk

00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:55,029
about rabbitmq and people always ask me

00:31:52,809 --> 00:31:56,350
is rabbit a job server and say no it's

00:31:55,029 --> 00:31:57,940
not a job server because you had

00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:59,440
messages and a message is a better

00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:01,210
abstraction that the job because a

00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:04,140
message could be a job but the message

00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:09,220
will be an alert an event bla bla bla

00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:11,620
chillax man and this job server is a

00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:13,750
perfectly understandable metaphor for

00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:15,940
many developers okay you understand

00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:18,220
already yeah you wanna use it cool once

00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:21,250
you get there and are doing it then

00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:24,399
let's get into the finer details but

00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:28,590
sometimes this metaphor is more than

00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:31,919
enough sadly it is a new with back then

00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:34,450
so master the art of meaning

00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:36,130
amplification again we are programming

00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:39,760
for people we are not programming for

00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:44,529
for ourselves maybe your holy project at

00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:47,440
home I don't know and our program is a

00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:49,720
metaphor for the solution we found if

00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:52,890
people can understand that was a great

00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:55,840
program otherwise I'm not so sure

00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:59,860
references those are some of the books I

00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:03,170
read and 8% whatever credit for the

00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:04,520
images and thank you very much

00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:07,670
[Applause]

00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:07,670
[Music]

00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:15,890
thanks Oliver we have plenty of time for

00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:15,890
questions does anyone have a question

00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:36,180
one question you forgot dropping packets

00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:49,800
on the floor as a metaphor yes any other

00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:52,770
metaphor or questions and I saw I think

00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:55,440
it was mailing list about from Drupal or

00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:58,440
someone was asking let's change the

00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:00,750
terminology in our software because it

00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:04,410
talks about masters and slaves and it's

00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:08,490
very uncomfortable giving history of

00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:11,250
slavery and well this turned into a very

00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:13,470
big discussion and in the end they

00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:15,840
decided we're not going to change it

00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:18,870
because even though the suggestion to

00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:22,350
change it into primary replicas makes

00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:25,040
sense and it's nicer and everybody

00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:29,310
already knows what the master slave and

00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:31,710
database system is and people don't have

00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:34,110
this conversation anymore because it's

00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:36,630
clear right master and slave and if you

00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:38,550
change it then people have to learn new

00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:41,240
things and that's why we stick to what

00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:46,140
we already know and does it make sense

00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:48,840
just to say because yeah we keep the

00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:52,710
terminology that we know and the meaning

00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:54,270
will change as we use it for me in this

00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:56,430
particular example it doesn't make sense

00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:58,860
to keep the master slave terminology

00:34:56,430 --> 00:35:00,300
because if for some people they have

00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:02,520
this past where they were actually

00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:04,350
slaves or maybe it is just a mother or

00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:08,190
the grandfather in the United States for

00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:10,830
example and I'm not I'm not I'm not sure

00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:12,330
they're slaves even today they're people

00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:14,760
we've involved brought as slaves in

00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:17,040
Europe my wife actually is helping a

00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:18,910
charity in Switzerland where I think if

00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:21,609
I'm not mistaken with a hundred bucks

00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:23,170
you can buy five people in the north of

00:35:21,609 --> 00:35:25,299
Africa I'm not sure if it's Libya or

00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:29,289
whatever and they managed to free these

00:35:25,299 --> 00:35:31,150
five persons doing that so I'm not sure

00:35:29,289 --> 00:35:33,640
it's something that is from the past and

00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:36,130
I personally have no problem with

00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:38,020
whatever new terminology somebody

00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:40,750
chooses to use I don't have a really

00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:46,839
good example that came to mind right now

00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:49,660
but I don't think I think we have been

00:35:46,839 --> 00:35:52,240
wrong in the way we spoke and different

00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:56,109
places different words across history

00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:58,710
and there is no reason to not change

00:35:56,109 --> 00:36:01,390
that I don't see why not

00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:03,520
so do you think it's possible to replace

00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:07,390
one terminology with another one and get

00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:11,170
everyone changing too many words for the

00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:15,069
same thing about the particular flame

00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:18,430
work I don't know and I'm not part of

00:36:15,069 --> 00:36:23,430
the Drupal community to say something if

00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:28,020
it comes up I have no problem with that

00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:28,020
but I mean with the change

00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:45,339
so the problem in that particular

00:36:42,029 --> 00:36:47,259
example was that a white man said that

00:36:45,339 --> 00:36:53,469
we should keep the terminology for

00:36:47,259 --> 00:36:55,119
backwards accountability here for people

00:36:53,469 --> 00:36:56,829
that is backwards probably they need to

00:36:55,119 --> 00:37:05,069
be compatible to that kind of

00:36:56,829 --> 00:37:08,140
terminology I guess but I don't know so

00:37:05,069 --> 00:37:09,700
everything is a metaphor so I suppose

00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:13,359
the standard library is also a metaphor

00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:15,579
and a few years ago there was a pretty

00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:17,440
heated discussion in the scholar

00:37:15,579 --> 00:37:20,140
community about what should be included

00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:26,259
in the standard library and that became

00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:28,690
pretty crazy I think it was specifically

00:37:26,259 --> 00:37:30,219
should the JSON serialization bit should

00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:33,450
be part of the standard library and then

00:37:30,219 --> 00:37:37,449
it was a argument about semantics

00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:38,859
basically so we have a suggestion for a

00:37:37,449 --> 00:37:40,509
better name for the standard library or

00:37:38,859 --> 00:37:42,579
something like that and I have no idea I

00:37:40,509 --> 00:37:50,079
haven't told about it I don't know

00:37:42,579 --> 00:37:53,769
honestly I don't know thank you for the

00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:57,130
great talk first of all and that's one

00:37:53,769 --> 00:37:59,289
metaphor that is haunting the whole

00:37:57,130 --> 00:38:02,619
water right now and comes from the

00:37:59,289 --> 00:38:05,049
hunting yeah and it's coming from the

00:38:02,619 --> 00:38:08,309
software world and it's everything that

00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:11,499
is related to machine learning and

00:38:08,309 --> 00:38:15,489
intelligence and neural networks that

00:38:11,499 --> 00:38:18,219
for historical reason bring some awesome

00:38:15,489 --> 00:38:21,459
similarities to our brain but when the

00:38:18,219 --> 00:38:25,239
media took our metaphors away from our

00:38:21,459 --> 00:38:27,309
context and you know much machine

00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:32,289
learning of search in the 50s and 70s

00:38:27,309 --> 00:38:34,410
and this metaphor became quite dangerous

00:38:32,289 --> 00:38:38,890
because people began to believe that

00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:43,209
these systems these algorithms could

00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:45,489
take life and conscience and attack us

00:38:43,209 --> 00:38:46,600
and destroy the world and this is the

00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:49,630
current narrative

00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:51,550
in most of the mainstream media or at

00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:54,300
least part of it it depends on the mood

00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:57,700
of the journalist at that moment and

00:38:54,300 --> 00:39:00,190
there's a small movement advocating

00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:04,420
against the use of these metaphors at

00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:08,170
least in our tech environment I don't

00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:10,660
know have you ever told to including

00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:13,030
you're told something about what happens

00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:16,630
when these metaphors leak in the oil

00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:19,390
water and non-techies take them up and

00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:23,380
you I don't know they panic or whatever

00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:25,870
I think the problem happens in all areas

00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:27,580
not just in from tech to we take

00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:32,530
metaphor from other places and and

00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:35,200
misuse them I guess another concept that

00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:37,450
for me could be next talk I was

00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:40,450
yesterday discussing with a frenemies

00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:43,990
here in in at the conference Umberto Eco

00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:47,140
talks about the has a book called Lecter

00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:50,320
in Sabula which is basically how they

00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:52,150
also builds the reader in a way and how

00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:54,600
they also never can Excel what the

00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:57,130
reader is and he has a concept of the

00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:59,050
encyclopedia which is what you have in

00:39:57,130 --> 00:40:00,730
your mind based on what you read what

00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:02,860
are your experiences where you come from

00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:06,810
whatever that whenever you read the book

00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:08,760
you bring life to all these words so

00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:10,990
what are these other people

00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:13,690
encyclopedias and whatnot probably not

00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:15,340
the same as ours or developers let's say

00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:17,350
programmers techies geek I don't know

00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:19,510
and it's really hard it's a bring that

00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:22,030
once you write something that thing is

00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:24,640
out there whether it's documentation for

00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:28,180
code or or a book on a novel let's say

00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:31,210
so that's why we have to be very careful

00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:33,190
on on all these things because at some

00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:40,540
point somebody misinterpret something

00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:43,780
and it scales let's say so yeah I don't
