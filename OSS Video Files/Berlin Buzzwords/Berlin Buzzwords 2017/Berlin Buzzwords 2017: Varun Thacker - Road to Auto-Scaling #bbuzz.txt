Title: Berlin Buzzwords 2017: Varun Thacker - Road to Auto-Scaling #bbuzz
Publication date: 2017-06-15
Playlist: Berlin Buzzwords 2017
Description: 
	Solr exposes low level internal metrics which applications may consume in their monitoring tools. The talk describes various key metrics which a user should monitor carefully to maintain SLAs, both in terms of ingestion rates and query latency.

The second part of the talk presents a cookbook of recipes for admins to use by acting on the metrics. The recipes utilize a set of Solr APIs that will help expand your collection(s) to more nodes, re-shard, add more replicas etc.

The third part of this talk covers the work being done in Solr to help users scale their cluster in an automated fashion. Ultimately, upon completion of the talk, the user should be able to define a set of rules and provide recipes on which Solr may take action when thresholds are hit.
