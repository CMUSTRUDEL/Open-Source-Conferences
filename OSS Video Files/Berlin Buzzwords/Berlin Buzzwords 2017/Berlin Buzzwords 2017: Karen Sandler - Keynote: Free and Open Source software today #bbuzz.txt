Title: Berlin Buzzwords 2017: Karen Sandler - Keynote: Free and Open Source software today #bbuzz
Publication date: 2017-06-15
Playlist: Berlin Buzzwords 2017
Description: 
	Viewed in a broader social construct, is free software a movement or should it be? Using free software means making a political and social choice. However, that is not always a choice that is available for everyone. Karen analyses the role of free software and questions if it is just a convenience for the privileged or an essentiality.

hi everyone my name is Karen Sandler I

00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,350
am the executive director of the

00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,170
software freedom Conservancy which I

00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:19,949
will talk about in a little bit I'm a

00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:23,640
lawyer but I usually only give legal

00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:25,740
advice for free mostly to charity and I

00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,500
am super into free and open source

00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:30,030
software and I've been thinking about

00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,480
the role of free and open source

00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:36,059
software for a while and it's been a

00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:38,360
very interesting year which has caused

00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:40,380
me to do a lot of self-reflection about

00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:43,200
the role of free and open source

00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:45,510
software in society and I'm going to

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,680
take you through sort of my my journey

00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,829
over the last year

00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:52,230
these are my twitter handles so if you

00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:54,480
are looking at your phone or other

00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:57,570
device I know it's because you're

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,620
tweeting so keep it up thank you I know

00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:04,860
you're going to say this talk was so

00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:06,570
awesome oh so so I feel like you need to

00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:10,770
know a little bit more about me before

00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:14,039
you can get where I'm coming from in my

00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:16,619
analysis about open source and free

00:01:14,039 --> 00:01:18,630
software this is a picture of where I

00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:20,459
went to university it's called the

00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:24,179
Cooper Union raise your hand if you've

00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:27,060
heard of the Cooper Union nobody oh one

00:01:24,179 --> 00:01:29,670
person two people great

00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,569
if the Cooper Union is a University in

00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,029
the United States

00:01:30,569 --> 00:01:36,270
it's a tiny school it's about a thousand

00:01:33,029 --> 00:01:37,829
people including grad students and it

00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:40,829
was founded on the principle that

00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:42,810
education should be free which in the

00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:45,810
United States was a really revolutionary

00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:48,240
concept so for a long time the Cooper

00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:50,759
Union was the only free University in

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,439
the United States and it only had

00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:55,139
degrees and art architecture and

00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:56,939
engineering and I went there for

00:01:55,139 --> 00:01:58,709
engineering I effectively split

00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:01,799
Electrical and Mechanical Engineering

00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:03,659
but the most there were quite a lot of

00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:08,720
formative things about going there one

00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:12,569
was a in a growing up in a country where

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:14,910
we're going to university had a lot of

00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:16,800
the trappings as being very wealthy the

00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:18,720
fact that there was a school where it

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,820
was full scholarship for anyone who

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:24,510
was a completely different model and

00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:28,440
pretty cool and I showed up on my first

00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:30,300
day and sat in my C and Fortran class up

00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:34,860
until that time I had only programmed in

00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:36,780
basic and I show up to my C and Fortran

00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:38,550
class and they say you know because I'm

00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,930
old they say you got to go to the

00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:42,420
computer center to get your account

00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:44,970
because nobody had their own computer so

00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:49,860
I go into the computer center to get the

00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:52,950
account and there were no women in the

00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,910
computer center it was full but there

00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:56,730
were no women and I went with a friend

00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:58,320
who I had just made in the class and we

00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:04,680
looked around and it was really weird

00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:08,370
because it was a very uncomfortable

00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:12,570
culture for us there was even a guy who

00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:17,100
had ASCII porn on his screen which was

00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:20,220
very innovative at the time so but but

00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:22,200
she just left my friend and she said

00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:25,350
I'll just come back later right and I

00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:27,330
was at the time sort of thought well

00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:29,610
this is such old news that there would

00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:32,070
be any kind of sexism in a technical

00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:34,260
environment please were so beyond that

00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:36,300
now so I went and marched into the head

00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:38,370
of the computer centers office and I

00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:40,260
said you got to do something about the

00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:43,200
situation here because there are no

00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:46,290
women hanging out and it feels weird and

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:50,040
he said what's her name and I told him

00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:52,049
and he said you're hired and I said what

00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,690
do you mean and so what they did is they

00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:56,730
had they had this people called computer

00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:59,100
center operators who were white lab

00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:02,610
coats and walked around the room and

00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:04,830
helped people with their work and so I

00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:08,070
became one of those people and he tapped

00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:10,500
that the most you know the the most

00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:12,780
advanced people in the computer center

00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:15,930
to help me and he said get her root as

00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:17,729
soon as possible and and so that was

00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:19,410
sort of like a crash course for me and

00:04:17,729 --> 00:04:20,790
that was my first introduction to free

00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:22,650
and open source software I mean instead

00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:24,720
of in addition to using some of the

00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:26,040
stuff that you know GCC is like a lot of

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,950
the software that you would have used

00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:31,700
anyway in that academic program we

00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:34,370
installed a new Linux lab

00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:37,040
I remember thinking boy this free

00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:39,020
software idea this Linux thing is pretty

00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,410
cool it's too bad it won't last

00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:46,450
and so I went off and went to law school

00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:49,550
and didn't really think about much about

00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:51,350
about technology and ethics again I

00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:53,090
didn't think about free and open source

00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:56,060
software for sure these are pictures

00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:58,310
that I actually took from my my law

00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:03,320
office in New York so these are views

00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:09,260
from my desk of my my paperwork and text

00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:11,060
that's a deal book and my my suit jacket

00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:14,120
and the view from my office which is at

00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:17,270
the Chrysler Building which was and I

00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:21,440
totally immersed myself entirely in

00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:26,870
financial law in like debt and like

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:31,460
doing bonds and and I even did some some

00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:33,500
IPO work and I I just I did that for a

00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:36,050
while and it was it was really

00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:39,230
interesting but I was so far away from

00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:41,210
technology and and then I started

00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:45,320
getting involved in it's a much longer

00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:50,330
story oh no I just got an error message

00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:54,200
leave our office I love you but you

00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:56,030
crash during my presentation but as a

00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:59,630
former executive director of the kinome

00:05:56,030 --> 00:06:02,080
foundation it may it's tough to know

00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:02,080
what the

00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:17,870
uh-huh this is very exciting

00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:20,120
okay here we go okay whew sorry if it

00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:21,590
happens again when I was executive

00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,140
director of the genome Foundation this

00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:26,000
was always my my biggest nightmare was

00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:28,430
economic I was going to have some issue

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,610
during a presentation and I was always

00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:35,060
super smug when all the people using you

00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:37,670
know windows and and Apple like MacBooks

00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:39,020
and and Apple products would present and

00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:40,340
they would have problems and I would say

00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:42,220
to have a private Airy software it's

00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:45,620
just so unreliable

00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:49,520
so luckily this and it didn't happen is

00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:52,220
it so so I for a long story short I want

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,260
to doing pro bono legal work for doing

00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:56,090
legal work for free and open source

00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:59,150
software project and using that

00:06:56,090 --> 00:07:03,980
corporate financial background in order

00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:06,560
to help them with their help them with

00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:08,780
with their challenges plot the poem

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,570
foundation for example was one of my

00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:12,980
first clients and I help them get their

00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:16,600
tax exemption status in the United

00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:19,430
States and part of that was describing

00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:21,080
why free and open-source software should

00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:23,120
be charitable because we had to accept

00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:26,180
the German charitable system is quite

00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:29,630
similar I've been through it with some

00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:31,850
of the German organizations not as a

00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:34,190
lawyer since I'm only admitted in the

00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:36,320
United States but as just a general

00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:39,950
participant and you explain why it

00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:41,600
should be treated charitably and so I

00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:43,820
was doing that for for free and open

00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:46,550
source software projects I was I thought

00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:49,520
that open source was cool I thought that

00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:51,530
that it was really useful and I had kind

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,690
of a culture clash when I came in coming

00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:57,160
from the securities law world wondering

00:07:53,690 --> 00:08:00,280
sort of like are these people for real

00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:02,120
my clients were passionate about

00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,920
software freedom they're passionate

00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:07,100
about free and open source software and

00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:09,680
explaining why it should be charitable

00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:12,370
you know why should be treated like you

00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:15,490
know life like an organization that that

00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:18,710
helps people recover from disasters or

00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:21,260
helps children that helps people that

00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:22,730
are destitute and and I sort of it took

00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:25,880
me a little while to sort of figure out

00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:27,680
like you know how to explain that and

00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:30,410
how to believe it it was interesting is

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:35,780
that my the clients I was representing

00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:37,280
were just so passionate and I didn't you

00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:40,940
know and it was interesting also because

00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:43,310
some of my clients were really copyleft

00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:45,560
people and like you know like the free

00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:50,000
software foundation and people who were

00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:52,870
really GPL Pro GPL and then some of my

00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,340
clients were like the BSD s who were

00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:57,140
ideologically opposed to copyleft and

00:08:55,340 --> 00:09:03,200
thought that it was a different idea of

00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:03,950
freedom and over time I sort of I came

00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,140
on board

00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:07,670
you know I they convinced me through

00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:09,680
their work that what they were doing was

00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:12,350
important and I started to see the

00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:14,810
broader societal impact of it but still

00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:17,420
I really just was someone who thought

00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:22,130
that open-source was cool I thought it

00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:25,820
was useful but I was on the fence really

00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:28,400
about whether or not you know how

00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:31,480
fundamental this issue was was it you

00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:35,090
know is was all this talk about freedom

00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:36,860
like an overstatement right people who

00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:38,360
are worrying about software freedom are

00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:39,980
often people who aren't worrying about

00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:43,130
where their next meal is coming from and

00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:45,850
so you know where where is the

00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:49,700
perspective and where is the line and

00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:53,960
and then I discovered that I had a

00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:57,650
medical condition so I literally have a

00:09:53,960 --> 00:10:00,530
big heart my heart is the three times

00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:04,490
the size of a normal person's heart and

00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:07,280
I'm asymptomatic but or mostly

00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:11,150
asymptomatic but I'm at a very high risk

00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:13,970
of suddenly dying the doctors actually

00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:18,850
call it sudden death is a technical

00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:22,460
medical phrase which is really weird but

00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:27,140
the doctor the cardiologist sort of told

00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:28,370
me you know you're fine as long as you

00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:30,800
know you're at a high risk of sudden

00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:31,520
suddenly dying it's 2 to 3% for your

00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,000
compounding

00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:38,690
and I was 31 when I found out that I had

00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,399
a condition so the chances of dying in

00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:43,940
the next decade were extremely high and

00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:45,709
they said that that it was okay because

00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:49,760
all I would need to do was to get this

00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:51,890
defibrillator implanted in my body and

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,529
if I got that then if I went into sudden

00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:55,760
death the device would be there any

00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:56,390
which shocked me and everything would be

00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,560
okay

00:10:56,390 --> 00:11:01,399
uh-huh and when you go to the

00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,970
electrophysiologist office for something

00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:04,520
like this

00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:07,580
they keep sample devices in their desks

00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:09,080
so there are extremely expensive devices

00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:10,970
I know because in the United States of

00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:14,930
course our health insurance our health

00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:18,380
care system is really crazy and so you

00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:20,120
get a bill for for everything even if

00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:21,890
you have good insurance you get the bill

00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:24,620
a report for what your insurance is

00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:27,200
covered and my defibrillator was so

00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:30,380
expensive there actually I think are a

00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,580
little cheaper in Europe but because

00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:34,870
it's what the you know there's it's

00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:36,770
market driven but so in the

00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:38,570
electrophysiologist office they have the

00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:41,750
little devices and they have them in

00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:43,520
their desk drawers and so when you need

00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:45,560
one what they do is they let you hold

00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:47,329
them there's like they say the guy but

00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:49,160
electrophysiologist slipped my device

00:11:47,329 --> 00:11:50,690
across the desk and he was sort of

00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:53,089
looking at me expectantly my mother was

00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:54,529
there you know for support and they both

00:11:53,089 --> 00:11:56,029
like kind of look at me as I hold this

00:11:54,529 --> 00:11:58,250
little device and then he's looking at

00:11:56,029 --> 00:12:01,310
me like see it's not so scary it's a

00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:06,800
small device and and I look at him and I

00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:09,529
say what does it run and he said run and

00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,520
I said yeah run my this device has

00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:12,589
software on it

00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:15,140
software is vulnerable this is very

00:12:12,589 --> 00:12:16,550
close to what I do I spent a lot of time

00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:18,200
thinking about the ethics of software

00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:23,600
and can you tell me anything about it

00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:25,820
and he said software the guy implanted

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,860
sometimes multiple devices in a day

00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:29,480
thousands of devices and it had never

00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:31,459
occurred to him that there was software

00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:33,770
on these devices that he was putting in

00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:36,950
people's bodies and he said but he was a

00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:39,170
good guy he said no worries don't worry

00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:43,370
about this because you're in luck today

00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:44,870
in the in the office right now is the

00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:46,940
representative

00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:48,740
was Medtronic and so he'll know

00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:50,930
everything that you need to know and so

00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:53,420
and so he calls in Tom and Tom comes in

00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:54,740
and he looks at Tom and he says this

00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:56,690
woman is asked really interesting

00:12:54,740 --> 00:13:00,110
questions about the defibrillator she's

00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:03,560
asking what does it run and Tom says run

00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:04,400
and I say yeah there's software on the

00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:08,390
device yada yada

00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:10,580
he says software and then he said don't

00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:13,279
worry about it because you couldn't call

00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:14,330
the this hotline this technical hotline

00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:16,910
and they'll tell you everything you need

00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:21,640
to know so I called the hotline and I

00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:26,240
was put in a phone tree abyss and I

00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:28,070
eventually realized that that I was

00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,990
going to need to get the device and I

00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:32,420
couldn't put it off so I got the device

00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:33,860
but I launched a research project oh so

00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:36,020
I got the device I forgot this this

00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:40,310
front slide of how I became a cyborg

00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:41,900
with proprietary software literally sewn

00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:47,630
into my body and screwed into my heart

00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:50,060
and suddenly the issues that I was

00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:52,220
researching and thinking about in the

00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:54,940
context of free and open source software

00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:57,980
and charitable activities became

00:13:54,940 --> 00:14:00,380
significantly less abstract and much

00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:03,260
more real suddenly my life relied on

00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:05,570
this and it seemed really important and

00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:08,510
like once I got over the whole idea of

00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:11,089
becoming a cyborg and having you know

00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:13,070
medical implants and things like that I

00:14:11,089 --> 00:14:16,610
started to embrace the fact that I was

00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:18,770
unique and that I would have a really

00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:21,350
different perspective on these issues so

00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:23,209
I launched a research program into the

00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:26,150
safety and efficacy of these devices and

00:14:23,209 --> 00:14:27,800
what I found will not surprise most of

00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:31,000
you in the room which is that the

00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:33,440
devices are totally vulnerable there's

00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,380
most of them almost all of them are

00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,360
broadcasting wirelessly via radio

00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:40,400
telemetry and there is no real security

00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:42,410
on them at all we have the worst of both

00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:45,350
worlds we have closed and proprietary

00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:46,820
software that can't be reviewed when we

00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:50,720
know that free and open source software

00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:53,870
is safer over time not all free software

00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,430
is better or safer but it stands a

00:14:53,870 --> 00:15:00,220
chance we can fix problems when they

00:14:55,430 --> 00:15:00,220
happen etc so

00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:04,700
launching this this program I also did

00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:06,470
research into the Food and Drug

00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:08,150
Administration in the United States and

00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:11,720
most of the other countries that I

00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:14,390
researched are the same where where the

00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:16,040
the agency that's approving these

00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:20,470
devices is also not reviewing the

00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:22,610
software so not only is the software

00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:24,470
vulnerable to attack and has been shown

00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:26,810
to be exploitable in the cases of many

00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:29,510
medical implanted medical devices but

00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:31,340
because we're not the our governmental

00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:33,080
agencies they're not even asking for

00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:35,810
copies of the source code there's no

00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:38,840
public repository there's there's no

00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:41,180
recourse in the instance that that my

00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:42,740
device starts to fail ER has a really

00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:46,730
fundamental problem if there's

00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:48,230
catastrophic failure at Medtronic or at

00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:50,090
any of the other made of major medical

00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:51,650
devices all the patients who have those

00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:56,600
devices have to get them removed

00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:59,900
basically so if the device manufacturer

00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:01,460
is not so inclined to fix it so that's

00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:02,870
sort of how I became passionate about

00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:05,180
free and open source software the first

00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:08,360
time and I became really involved

00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:11,540
because when it's your life it suddenly

00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:15,020
becomes a much bigger deal it the issues

00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:18,950
became stark reality for me it was it

00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:21,320
was so clear that that that this was a

00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:24,860
problem that that needed to be addressed

00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:27,260
and and while it's quite dramatic to

00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:29,990
talk about my heart condition in this

00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:32,810
way it's a metaphor for all the software

00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:34,910
we rely on right while we have an

00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:36,590
Internet of Things where all of our

00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:38,890
software is talking to everything else

00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:41,600
we're only as safe as our weakest link

00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:44,090
when researchers want to show that cars

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,830
are vulnerable to attack they don't go

00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:48,020
right to the ignition system or the

00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:49,580
brake system they usually get in through

00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:53,000
the entertainment system or the wheel

00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:55,700
maintenance system so all of our

00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,770
software that we are all of our critical

00:16:55,700 --> 00:17:01,280
software that we rely on for our lives

00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:02,600
in our society need to be free and

00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:05,660
open-source software we need to know

00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:09,890
that if if there is a big fundamental

00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:11,780
problem that we can fix it but but we

00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:12,380
don't even know which of our software is

00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,510
going to be

00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:16,600
life and society critical so it's very

00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:19,940
difficult to know where to draw a line

00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:21,890
and so I co-founded the software freedom

00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:24,850
Conservancy we are an umbrella

00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:26,930
organization to help prepare to help

00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:28,610
free software projects that are

00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:31,870
alternatives to proprietary software to

00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:34,340
succeed this is a list of all of our

00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:36,770
it's a recent most of our member

00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:40,940
projects but we've added coreboot since

00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:44,600
then and closure community but but as

00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:46,990
you can see we have git and sambal

00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:51,500
whining scape we've got over 40 projects

00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:53,150
and including outreach e which is a

00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:56,240
diversity program for women and people

00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:58,580
of color were underrepresented in tech

00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:02,420
in the u.s. although the rest of the

00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:05,090
program is is global and and so I've

00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:09,020
been plugging away at this for a long

00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:11,740
time and working on this we also are

00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:15,110
known for for being the home of the

00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:18,170
coalition of of Linux kernel developers

00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:20,030
who want to have their their license

00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:22,190
enforce their copyrights so we funded

00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:24,470
the lawsuit that Christophe Hal was

00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:26,780
brought against VMware some people are

00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:28,490
nodding so we're known for defending the

00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:31,580
GPL and I've been plugging along like

00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:35,450
this very righteously self-righteously

00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:38,570
very confident in my choices very

00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:40,220
confident in my in my preaching about

00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:42,080
the importance of free and open-source

00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:44,000
software and how fundamental it is the

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,350
the research all points to free and

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,420
open-source software being better and

00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:50,240
safer over time we all know the utility

00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:51,920
for a commercial enterprise it was just

00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,510
a matter of getting the word out and

00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:57,410
being the right kind of evangelistic

00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:58,910
about it right but then the world sort

00:18:57,410 --> 00:19:02,030
of started to change in ways that

00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:05,480
surprised me I thought I knew what was

00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:08,810
happening in the world I thought that I

00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:13,690
had a good idea of where things were

00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:17,930
going I think a lot of people did but we

00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:21,620
I realized that I was kind of living in

00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:23,780
a bubble and that I didn't necessarily

00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:24,830
see the full red eye like many others

00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:27,950
this is from the

00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:30,370
near times but it's interesting how how

00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:33,350
comparable a lot of the brexit and the

00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:37,370
u.s. election themes were kind of

00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:39,500
similar so in addition to starting to

00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:41,390
read Fox News every day in addition to

00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:44,450
the New York Times which I've done since

00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:47,510
then leading up to the u.s. election

00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:51,890
I've just sort of realized that that

00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:54,140
there are that that I needed to revisit

00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:56,960
a lot of my basic assumptions about what

00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:59,450
I thought was obviously true and what I

00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:02,059
thought was clearly going to happen and

00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:05,929
any idea that you're passionate about

00:20:02,059 --> 00:20:09,019
anything that you think is so important

00:20:05,929 --> 00:20:11,750
and so right should be able to survive a

00:20:09,019 --> 00:20:14,419
really strict criticism and analysis and

00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:16,399
so I decided that I had to start from

00:20:14,419 --> 00:20:19,399
first principles again and so when I

00:20:16,399 --> 00:20:24,340
spoke to the buzz words organizers about

00:20:19,399 --> 00:20:27,559
this about this talk it was we started

00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:31,730
we started talking about speaking on the

00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:34,880
phone in I think even October or

00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:38,120
November before the u.s. election post

00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:41,120
brexit and and then when we actually

00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:43,990
spoke on the phone it was right after

00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:46,220
the US election and I was sort of like I

00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:50,120
don't know what I'm going to talk about

00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:51,649
because I don't know if I'm even going

00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:55,669
to think that free software is so

00:20:51,649 --> 00:20:59,029
important come June that's a long ways

00:20:55,669 --> 00:21:02,179
away and I really you know a lot of my

00:20:59,029 --> 00:21:04,190
friends in who were real free and open

00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:08,480
source software activists we're saying

00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:10,639
you know actually I really realized that

00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,409
that I only want to work on encryption

00:21:10,639 --> 00:21:14,630
or realize that I only want to work on

00:21:12,409 --> 00:21:18,710
things that relate to the current

00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:22,190
political climate and and similarly a

00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:26,120
lot of donations that people were making

00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:28,399
to the small free software charities we

00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:30,529
were all getting emails saying actually

00:21:28,399 --> 00:21:33,950
we're going to donate to the ACLU this

00:21:30,529 --> 00:21:35,570
year instead of your free software

00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:36,980
charities because we think this II you

00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:38,630
know I want my money to have the most

00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:41,810
impact and I think these issues

00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:45,800
are really important and and I thought

00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:47,630
you know fair enough like it is it

00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:49,460
really so important am i spending my

00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:51,560
time in the right place to be talking

00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:53,090
about free and open source software when

00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,730
in order to get to the point to even

00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:57,320
care about free and open source software

00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:59,300
so many things have to go right already

00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:01,550
you know there are so many causes that

00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:04,550
are so fundamental that need a lot of

00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:06,500
attention should anyone even care at all

00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:09,170
about free open source software and it

00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:11,690
was the talk was talking about what I

00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:16,220
would say at a conference like this that

00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:19,130
caused me to go through this really full

00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:22,640
analysis of whether or not what I had

00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:25,430
previously saw it was in fact right and

00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:29,540
so I started by coming up with sort of

00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:30,860
some basic principles as to why I cared

00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:32,420
about freedom on source software and

00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:33,800
what we were doing a Conservancy that I

00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:35,330
thought was so important that I would

00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:37,790
ask people to open their wallets to

00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:39,650
something that they might not think was

00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:42,260
the particular cause for them at the

00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:46,130
time and and I should hasten to note

00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:47,810
that that I I didn't have a political

00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:51,590
agenda with this it's just that the

00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:53,780
shift of conversation globally from the

00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:56,960
shift of conversation within Technology

00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:59,060
communities away from from a lot of the

00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,650
the basic presumptions and the basic

00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:03,260
conversation that we had been having in

00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:09,250
the past moved regardless of where on

00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:13,100
the political spectrum you are it was a

00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:14,960
you know time time to reevaluate and so

00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:19,130
one of the things that was clear about

00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:20,840
what what Conservancy and software

00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:23,360
freedom has to offer is the defense of

00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:25,300
our core technology a lot of our

00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:27,770
remember projects of Conservancy are

00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:29,120
infrastructure projects like it you know

00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:33,650
like they're things that people are

00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:36,590
using tools and other basic basic pieces

00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:38,600
of technology and if we don't if we

00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:40,550
don't safeguard that if we don't make

00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:43,730
sure that if there are problems we can

00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:47,480
fix them then we're going to be in

00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:49,340
trouble in the long run I I kept

00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:51,300
thinking about the Volkswagen situation

00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:54,260
where Volkswagen

00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:56,660
with hiding its it's the missions

00:23:54,260 --> 00:24:00,090
information from its cars deliberately

00:23:56,660 --> 00:24:03,300
and I kept thinking about the engineers

00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:05,670
who were working there who knew that

00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:08,670
they were is anybody here working at

00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:10,650
Volkswagen just using AC people laughing

00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:12,240
over there so that's what we do have a

00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:14,460
Volkswagen employee or former employee

00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,200
in the audience oh and I saw an ability

00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:18,150
I thought about you I thought about the

00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,740
engineers who or the technical

00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:21,330
technological like technologists who

00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:23,210
were working there who may have known

00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:26,580
that this was happening and couldn't

00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:28,350
couldn't you know raise it like raise

00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:30,840
the attention level and how terrible

00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:33,090
that must have felt you know and and how

00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:36,060
well meaning that we as technologists

00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:37,710
are generally or how we assume that or

00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:42,990
how we hope that our technology we use

00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:45,090
for good now I this is a statue of an

00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:48,660
iron ring because I had forgotten all

00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:51,390
about this but the very guy who who I

00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:54,180
spoke to the very man who ran the

00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:59,150
computer center at the Cooper Union who

00:24:54,180 --> 00:25:02,760
started me off entirely on seriously on

00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:06,690
programming and on computers computing

00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:07,920
in general he had been have been

00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:10,350
familiar with this thing called the

00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:11,700
order of the engineer raise your hand if

00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:14,790
you know what the order of the engineer

00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:16,650
is nobody okay

00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:17,940
it's a Canadian focusing so it's not

00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:21,030
that surprising but I thought someone

00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:23,880
would have heard of it it is a it is a

00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:27,690
like a an ethical Society of Engineers

00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:30,000
and so when I was in college and it's

00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:32,280
it's a very big deal in Canada but only

00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:36,390
a few universities in the United States

00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:40,020
and and Europe subscribe to it or have

00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:41,700
brought it over to them and so you can

00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:44,100
tell that someone's in the order of the

00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:49,920
engineer because you they have an iron

00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:52,710
ring on the they're the pinky finger of

00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:55,320
their working hand so if you see someone

00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:56,460
with a with a very simple ring on their

00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,020
pinky finger you know that they're

00:25:56,460 --> 00:26:00,120
probably in the order of the engineer

00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:01,740
and the order is Anja near that the

00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:05,090
metal that the rings were originally

00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:09,230
made from were from a bridge in Canada

00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:11,870
that had collapsed and it was a reminder

00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:13,430
that the technology that we work on as

00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:16,850
engineers and I was an engineering

00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:18,860
school can fail and that we should

00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:22,550
always remember that we have a

00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:24,890
responsibility to society because the

00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:27,230
choices we make as engineers and as

00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:30,260
technologists have far-flung

00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:31,790
applications they have they could they

00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:36,770
could impact a lot of people so this is

00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:38,540
the this is the oath I took that I and I

00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:41,750
totally forgot all about it

00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:44,540
I did it when I was you know 2021 and I

00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:47,240
never thought about it again until I

00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:50,000
started thinking about these issues for

00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:52,880
Berlin buzzwords actually and I suddenly

00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,950
remembered that I took an oath that

00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,930
actually I had pledged to practice

00:26:54,950 --> 00:27:00,170
integrity fair dealing tolerance and

00:26:56,930 --> 00:27:02,570
respect and that my skill carries with

00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:05,180
it an obligation to serve humanity and

00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:08,120
it's so interesting it recognizes the

00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:10,610
idea that we as engineers and

00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:13,040
technologists have special knowledge we

00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:15,350
have superpowers and we have to use

00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:16,970
those superpowers for good because we

00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:19,970
have information that other people don't

00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:22,250
and if we are not cognizant of the ways

00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:23,510
in which our technology can fail we're

00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:26,270
going to be in trouble now this is a

00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:28,850
huge deal in Canada which is really cool

00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:30,500
because everybody goes to engineering

00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:33,860
school gets sworn into the order of the

00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:34,400
engineer and the night before they do

00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:36,830
that

00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:40,400
it's like prank night because it's the

00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:41,930
very last time that you can ethically do

00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,370
a prank because otherwise once your

00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:45,590
joint and I join the order of the

00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:47,840
engineer at you've sworn not to and so

00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:50,780
this is like a bunch of engineering

00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:53,330
schools in quite a few of them in in

00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:55,130
Canada have sculptures of the iron of

00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:57,560
the Ring and the order of the engineer

00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:59,840
and this is one where they took that

00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:02,810
statue as part of the prank and made it

00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:04,310
an occupy mortar statue because there

00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:07,220
should be one ranked why not rule them

00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:10,100
all here's what this the small Sciences

00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:12,710
and it's so like you know if you're if

00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:14,870
you hear of like a lot of of pranks that

00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:16,130
sometimes engineering people do or they

00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:18,140
put cows down the rooms and things like

00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:20,000
that sometimes there before the square

00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:22,490
the order of the engineer because after

00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,790
that you can't conduct pranks because

00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:27,230
you are sworn to behave ethically and so

00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:29,540
I was thinking about this and how this

00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:31,190
influenced my my thoughts about freeing

00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:34,010
up and source software and I thought

00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:35,750
that that's a very idea of tying in the

00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:37,520
responsibilities of engineers and

00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:39,290
technologists to technology is not

00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:42,370
something that I have heard in any other

00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:44,390
context and with the world that we're

00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:46,370
with the world that we're in right now

00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:49,040
technology is underlying everything

00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:50,870
technology is you know software it

00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:52,309
touches everything that we do it touches

00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:53,660
the way we communicate with people it

00:28:52,309 --> 00:28:58,400
touches the way we create anything it

00:28:53,660 --> 00:29:01,010
touches our the way that we you know the

00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:03,799
way that we create anything and the way

00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:05,660
we solve problems and we are entrusting

00:29:03,799 --> 00:29:08,299
most of that technology to single

00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:11,630
companies that may or may not have our

00:29:08,299 --> 00:29:16,730
interests at heart an example of this is

00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:20,410
that my my defibrillator shocked me

00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:20,410
twice when I was pregnant

00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:25,640
my heart was doing what normal pregnant

00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:28,630
woman's heart hearts do about more than

00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:31,040
25% of women who are pregnant have

00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:33,080
palpitations and my heart was

00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:35,750
palpitating in a way that it would

00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:37,790
normally do for some pregnant women but

00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:40,640
because I had a defibrillator I got

00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:42,290
shots twice and now I promise you that I

00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,450
had a Medtronic device at the time I

00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:45,830
promise you that Medtronic did not want

00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:49,250
pregnant patients to get shocked

00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:50,600
literally the last thing that Medtronic

00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:51,919
would want would be for pregnant women

00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:55,340
to get shocked

00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:58,820
but nonetheless I wasn't a use case that

00:29:55,340 --> 00:30:02,600
they were attuned to only 4% for less

00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:06,020
than 4% of pacemaker defibrillators go

00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:08,210
to patients younger than 65 so the

00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:10,130
number of n there are many more men with

00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:11,590
these devices and women for a variety of

00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:16,220
reasons that could be a whole other talk

00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:18,950
but but the chances the set the sample

00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:21,140
set of pregnant women who have

00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:22,280
defibrillators is quite small so it's

00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:23,780
just not a use case that they were

00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:27,100
focused on and I can't I can't blame

00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:29,870
them for it but I had no access to the

00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:32,000
software in my body I couldn't ask

00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:32,300
Medtronic I asked the tronic for the

00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,950
source

00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:34,910
but they wouldn't give it to me nor

00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:38,360
would any of the other major

00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:40,250
manufacturers and I couldn't even look

00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:42,860
at it to see if I could you know submit

00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:45,110
a patch for my own situation and so the

00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:48,290
way that we solved it was by giving me

00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:51,620
medication to slow my heart rate down so

00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:52,820
that so that I wouldn't be shocked not

00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:54,770
because my heart rate needed to be

00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:58,070
slowed down I couldn't even walk up a

00:30:54,770 --> 00:31:00,440
flight of stairs it was so intense but

00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:03,470
only to prevent my device from giving me

00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:05,600
unnecessary treatment and this stood for

00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:09,640
the proposition that we might not the

00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:15,020
companies that are entrusted with these

00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:17,390
roles may be very well intentioned they

00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:19,400
may have the best intentions they may be

00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:21,920
the most ethically run company ever

00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:24,020
there might be plenty of executives who

00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:26,090
would walk out if the company did

00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:28,400
anything the slightest bit untoward but

00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:31,580
they can't anticipate every situation

00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:34,220
and so we can't rely on single companies

00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:36,320
in order to to protect ourselves this is

00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:39,200
just a picture of a cat protecting a

00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:41,140
fish store sort of like you know who do

00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:43,400
we want in charge of our technology

00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:45,890
probably people whose incentives are

00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:50,510
aligned with the public's and where

00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:52,490
these lines are tough transparency is a

00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:53,900
huge part of bringing open source

00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:56,050
software and one of the main things that

00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:58,670
I argue for when it comes to my own

00:31:56,050 --> 00:32:01,850
medical condition but all software that

00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:04,730
we rely on we need to make sure that we

00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:06,350
have the ability to to take a look at

00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:09,200
our software and find out what's going

00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:12,620
on with it and to determine if we're

00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:14,960
being surveilled you know run run tests

00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:17,360
make it open to scrutiny but most

00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,980
importantly of having the source code in

00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,630
the event of catastrophic failure and

00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:26,740
being able to fix those problems when

00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:30,500
they arise looking at the looking at the

00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:32,630
the state of global politics and

00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:36,560
particularly in my own country I can say

00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:40,840
that that after the u.s. election I got

00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:44,330
my first personally targeted hate tweet

00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:45,750
which was interesting most of my threats

00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:49,019
previously has been

00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:53,909
had been either in in comments or in

00:32:49,019 --> 00:32:56,039
private email not publicly and so and so

00:32:53,909 --> 00:32:58,110
what I was what I've seen is in what

00:32:56,039 --> 00:33:01,440
what a lot of articles are written is

00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:05,000
that there there's a little bit more

00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:07,169
hate that's visible in our society and

00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,960
making sure that we have inclusive

00:33:07,169 --> 00:33:12,389
communities is really important and

00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:13,769
that's one thing that that Conservancy

00:33:12,389 --> 00:33:15,720
is working on through our outreach the

00:33:13,769 --> 00:33:18,929
internship program but it's one thing

00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:20,940
that is should be totally fundamental to

00:33:18,929 --> 00:33:22,049
software freedom right something that

00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:24,929
should be a part of free and open-source

00:33:22,049 --> 00:33:26,309
software should be the the access that

00:33:24,929 --> 00:33:27,720
it gives to everyone when we have

00:33:26,309 --> 00:33:31,740
software freedom we make this first code

00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:34,289
available anyone can see it and so I you

00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:38,059
know I think once people have access to

00:33:34,289 --> 00:33:40,649
their to their technology it's

00:33:38,059 --> 00:33:43,080
empowering and democratizing and it

00:33:40,649 --> 00:33:44,460
means that that anyone can pick it up

00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:46,710
and run with it they can translate it to

00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:48,029
their own languages they can they can

00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:50,820
they can do what they want with it and

00:33:48,029 --> 00:33:53,309
so even though we're we're failing a

00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:56,850
little bit in terms of making sure our

00:33:53,309 --> 00:33:58,350
communities are are diverse and and we

00:33:56,850 --> 00:34:00,419
can see that just when we look around it

00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:04,710
almost any of our conferences they look

00:34:00,419 --> 00:34:06,120
pretty homogeneous the fundamental ideas

00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:11,099
behind software freedom are ones that

00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:13,679
are about inclusiveness and about making

00:34:11,099 --> 00:34:15,240
sure that that anyone can have access to

00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:17,730
their technology and make a difference

00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:20,579
with it and I think that's that's really

00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:23,520
important and I think the the main thing

00:34:20,579 --> 00:34:25,280
is that what I really I have to tell you

00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:28,109
I'm going to be honest with you

00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:31,649
it was really touch and go for me for a

00:34:28,109 --> 00:34:35,879
long time with ally devoting my life to

00:34:31,649 --> 00:34:38,990
the right cause am I wasting my time I

00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:42,329
mean I'm working for a non-profit and

00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:47,520
struggling right it's so hard to make a

00:34:42,329 --> 00:34:48,899
charity go you know I mean um raise your

00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:51,720
hand if you give if you donate to a

00:34:48,899 --> 00:34:55,050
charity somewhere any of them so that's

00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:57,140
like like half of the audience raise

00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:59,340
your hand if you donate to more than two

00:34:57,140 --> 00:35:01,020
so that's only that's

00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:03,720
it could work that's a lot of people

00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:06,330
it's like 1/8 of the audience much more

00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:09,210
than I expected it to be but but most of

00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:13,170
us pick a charity at most and donate to

00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:14,880
that and we don't you know and it's so

00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:17,220
so running a charity that is maybe not

00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:19,770
the biggest name on the on the block for

00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:22,650
a Cause that is less immediate is sort

00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:24,770
of like you know it's such hard work

00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:28,410
it's such a struggle we run

00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:31,110
conservancies for people and and we run

00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:33,690
the nonprofit for over 40 free software

00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:35,310
projects we do GPL enforcement we have a

00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:37,410
tremendous amount of bookkeeping

00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:39,090
administrative work and we're also we

00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:40,470
have no marketers on staff we're the

00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:42,660
ones who have to explain why this is

00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:44,220
important we're the ones doing a blog

00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:46,440
post where the runtime I'm the one

00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:47,970
packing t-shirts when we have people

00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:49,140
sign up as supporter so if anyone here

00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:53,220
is waiting for their t-shirt I'm really

00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:55,380
sorry but but it's so much so much hard

00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:59,100
work and I'm not a lawyer and an

00:35:55,380 --> 00:36:01,440
engineer and making an non profit salary

00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:04,080
and working all the time on this cause

00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:06,390
is it the right thing to do does it make

00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:10,830
sense and for a little while there I

00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:12,000
really wasn't so sure but but in working

00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:16,470
through it and thinking about it over

00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:19,020
the last the last six months or so I've

00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:22,410
realized that that this is a long-term

00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:27,480
issue right the the state of our basic

00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:29,670
infrastructure is it's critical and it's

00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:32,340
not necessarily something that's going

00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:35,010
to formulate today but today we're

00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:37,350
making choices that will affect us for a

00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:40,980
very long time today we're building

00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:44,130
products in corporations and together

00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:46,830
generally where we're relying on

00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:49,590
commercial clothes proprietary software

00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:51,870
for fundamental things and that's going

00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:53,850
to come bite us and I think it's looking

00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:54,870
at the study is it seems pretty pretty

00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:57,270
clear that we're going to have some

00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:58,410
major disasters we have major disasters

00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:59,760
if all the software were free and

00:36:58,410 --> 00:37:01,260
open-source but at least when those

00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,100
disasters happened we'd have something

00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:04,800
to do about it

00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:07,290
right with with proprietary software

00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:09,330
we're just relying on a company to first

00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:11,100
admit there's a problem and then do

00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:13,290
something about it we're relying on them

00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:15,000
to be able to get enough money

00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:17,160
through through their business model

00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,140
through financing through VC through

00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:20,370
whatever means that they have to make

00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:22,470
sure that they care about our situation

00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:24,210
and they may not even be attuned to it

00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:26,580
like in the case of my defibrillator and

00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:28,560
we can't simply be scrambling when

00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:31,890
things go wrong we have to make good

00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:33,720
sound infrastructure decisions now and

00:37:31,890 --> 00:37:36,930
so last night I was talking to Christian

00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:39,840
and and he said with big data comes big

00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:43,800
responsibility and I think that's a

00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:45,870
hundred percent right especially in data

00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:47,790
where you know there are a lot of issues

00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:49,770
I'm not saying that free and open source

00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:52,290
software is the only issue we could talk

00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:54,210
a long time about open data we could

00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:56,130
talk about a whole variety of ethical

00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:57,840
issues around it but making sure that

00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:59,910
our software is free and open-source is

00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:02,550
a cornerstone it's an essential first

00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:04,380
step what we know from free and open

00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:06,960
source software and this is the thing

00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:10,200
that that has pulled me around entirely

00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:12,420
is that the entire ethos of it being

00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:14,340
free and open-source software is that we

00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:16,320
acknowledge that we haven't quite gotten

00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:18,150
it right yet that we know we can always

00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:21,540
improve what we're doing and that we

00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:23,370
know that our basic sub positions and

00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:26,490
assumptions can always be questioned and

00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:28,230
that is the fundamental idea what it is

00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:30,480
to participate in a free and open-source

00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:32,490
software community and we should apply

00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:35,430
that to everything because we can't take

00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:37,590
fundamental things for granted we know

00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:39,960
that we won't be perfect we know that we

00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:42,330
can always improve and for me that's

00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:45,030
quite personal but it should be for you

00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:47,250
too because about three million people

00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:48,690
in the world have medical have

00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:50,520
pacemakers that's not even including

00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:53,640
insulin pumps or all the other implanted

00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:56,790
devices and every year 600,000 are

00:38:53,640 --> 00:39:00,420
implanted so if we're all lucky enough

00:38:56,790 --> 00:39:01,980
we'll all become cyborgs we don't even

00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:03,540
know what kind of technology that's

00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:05,640
going to be and how it will interface

00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:07,530
with everything else that we're using we

00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:09,780
won't know what the critical

00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:11,100
infrastructure is for our own bodies and

00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:14,970
for the fundamental things of our

00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:16,800
society and so I encourage you to think

00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:18,450
about using free and open source

00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:21,480
software for all of your fundamental

00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:24,660
choices because it is about the future

00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:26,700
that we're going to build so concerned

00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:28,589
with is charity I

00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:30,060
I don't want to be socially is to say if

00:39:28,589 --> 00:39:33,150
you donate to a charity it should be

00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:35,220
conservative but but think about if you

00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:37,410
have any disposable income think about

00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:39,450
donating to some of the charities in our

00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:42,570
space we're working on the issues that

00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:45,780
are going to be really a big deal in 10

00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:49,260
20 years and so we need people with the

00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:51,630
technical knowledge and the

00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:53,369
responsibility and the foresight to help

00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:55,010
these initiatives get going so that we

00:39:53,369 --> 00:40:05,730
know that we're looking after our future

00:39:55,010 --> 00:40:09,990
thank you it's time for questions so we

00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:11,490
have some time for questions you can ask

00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:18,690
about anything you can ask oh there's

00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:23,670
one other ah do I update the firmware on

00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:26,579
my defibrillator yeah if I wanted to

00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:28,980
patch it so right now the the way that

00:40:26,579 --> 00:40:30,420
the that these defibrillators work is

00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:33,270
almost all of them have a wireless

00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:35,250
component and you get them the

00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:38,940
terminology in this field is so

00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:41,700
hilarious so when you have a device the

00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:43,020
medical companies have they're like have

00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:45,720
their computers that they use to

00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:49,290
interface with the devices and those are

00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:51,810
called programmers and they interrogate

00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:53,970
the device I feel like I would have

00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:57,450
picked a different term but okay so they

00:40:53,970 --> 00:41:00,150
interrogated so so I was lucky enough to

00:40:57,450 --> 00:41:04,020
get my first defibrillator was an old

00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:05,550
device and and I found I finally found a

00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:08,730
lecture physiologist who got what I was

00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:11,480
talking about and he he found one of the

00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:14,700
last sterile defibrillators that had no

00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:17,520
had didn't have the radio telemetry in

00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:20,300
it and so the device that I had before

00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:23,670
you could only talk to you with magnetic

00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:26,400
you know it says magnetic coupling and

00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:29,910
so and so my device had been updated

00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:31,859
many times using the using the so called

00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:33,450
programmer but in order for someone to

00:41:31,859 --> 00:41:34,980
use that they have to be right on your

00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:37,770
chest like it's right has to be right

00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:39,540
next to the device and I recently less

00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:41,010
than three weeks ago got a new device so

00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:43,290
I'm a little a little

00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:45,090
still recovering from but but and this

00:41:43,290 --> 00:41:48,000
is the only device available in the

00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:49,530
United States that can have the radio

00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:53,430
telemetry switched off there was only

00:41:49,530 --> 00:41:55,590
one device I could find so I want the

00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:57,810
ability to patch my device but I want to

00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:59,670
be able to control who accesses my

00:41:57,810 --> 00:42:02,010
device right now these devices have no

00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:04,920
real security on them not even password

00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:07,740
protection on them and they are

00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:09,600
broadcasting the programmers are

00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:12,650
designed to interact with them

00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:15,660
wirelessly from when I go to the

00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:17,190
electrophysiologist they tell me that

00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:18,480
that they can still see the

00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:20,280
defibrillators of the people who have

00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,590
been in their offices they can still see

00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:26,460
them until they're completely out of a

00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:28,800
building so you can and and there have

00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:31,740
been researchers who white hat hackers

00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:33,810
who have shown that you can control a

00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:36,869
tick you know exploited defibrillator

00:42:33,810 --> 00:42:41,130
and deliver a fatal shock or an insulin

00:42:36,869 --> 00:42:44,280
pump a lethal dose using an iPhone in a

00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:46,320
public place so I want the ability to

00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:48,000
update my software I wanted the ability

00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:50,100
to patch it but I also want to be able

00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:54,030
to control who accesses this technology

00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:55,560
right I want real security I want real

00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,950
security and free and open source

00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,630
software

00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:59,100
I don't want not just anyone to be able

00:42:57,630 --> 00:43:01,380
to patch my device I want to be able to

00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:03,570
hire medical professionals I want to be

00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:04,980
able to organize all of the pregnant

00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:08,480
women with defibrillators to get

00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:10,920
together to fund the you know

00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,390
development on a patch so that all of

00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:13,650
the pregnant women that have palpitating

00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:15,600
hearts don't get shots in the future

00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:16,830
right and I don't I don't know how I

00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:18,630
don't have access to the source code so

00:43:16,830 --> 00:43:20,160
I can't determine that for myself right

00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:21,869
now but whether that's for even feasible

00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:23,609
but I would like to be able to know and

00:43:21,869 --> 00:43:26,369
right now that's simply not the case

00:43:23,609 --> 00:43:28,080
so there it's funny because I think

00:43:26,369 --> 00:43:30,540
people are often put off by my argument

00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:35,100
because they're saying you're you know

00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:39,270
your your your your loss all perspective

00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:41,400
if you think that that that we should be

00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:43,200
giving patients access to their devices

00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:45,090
and I'm saying I want access to the

00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:51,180
source code but I want real encryption

00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:54,890
real security on my device I as compared

00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:58,309
to open source software do Co

00:43:54,890 --> 00:44:00,619
benefit or radio see free software is

00:43:58,309 --> 00:44:02,480
there difference or do you prefer one of

00:44:00,619 --> 00:44:04,339
them over the other a free software

00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:05,809
versus open source software sure I think

00:44:04,339 --> 00:44:08,180
as long as we're talking about freedom I

00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:11,119
don't mind so much I have to admit you

00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:13,250
that so when I was new to the field I

00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:16,279
got taken in quickly by people who

00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:17,990
insisted that we needed to say free

00:44:16,279 --> 00:44:22,339
software and never open source software

00:44:17,990 --> 00:44:24,380
because we were somehow I might say

00:44:22,339 --> 00:44:27,260
taken it but I was convinced really fast

00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:29,539
that the that I needed to only say free

00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:32,779
software if I wanted to signal to people

00:44:29,539 --> 00:44:34,640
that I cared about freedom and then over

00:44:32,779 --> 00:44:36,170
the years I felt like more people knew

00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:38,750
the term open source and I felt like I

00:44:36,170 --> 00:44:41,029
was losing people by just saying free

00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:43,069
software and so then I became quite

00:44:41,029 --> 00:44:44,480
adamant and I don't think I'm

00:44:43,069 --> 00:44:46,519
overstepping here to say that I argued

00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:48,529
with Richard Stallman many times over

00:44:46,519 --> 00:44:50,990
over when I would say free and open

00:44:48,529 --> 00:44:53,779
source software and he would say just

00:44:50,990 --> 00:44:54,890
use free software and and then I would

00:44:53,779 --> 00:45:00,650
explain why I felt like that was

00:44:54,890 --> 00:45:02,599
inadequate and and then now like then

00:45:00,650 --> 00:45:04,849
over the course of the years I realized

00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:09,319
that I was kind of I was kind of

00:45:04,849 --> 00:45:11,259
suckered by the by the the

00:45:09,319 --> 00:45:13,519
business-friendly open source

00:45:11,259 --> 00:45:15,500
enthusiasts who made a lot of the

00:45:13,519 --> 00:45:18,079
freedom advocates feel like talking

00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:20,660
about freedom at all was alienating to

00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:25,279
business and what difference did it make

00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:26,210
how we refer to it and so so for a

00:45:25,279 --> 00:45:28,130
little while there I was contemplating

00:45:26,210 --> 00:45:29,569
using only the term open source because

00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:32,690
that's what people talk about and people

00:45:29,569 --> 00:45:34,730
you know the word open source words open

00:45:32,690 --> 00:45:36,079
source had one but if you said open

00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:38,269
source you knew that you would have the

00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:39,890
right to modify and distribute those

00:45:38,269 --> 00:45:41,750
modifications right it like there's

00:45:39,890 --> 00:45:43,670
there it wouldn't really be open source

00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:45,589
if you if it was just you know both

00:45:43,670 --> 00:45:47,210
terms free and open or inadequate or a

00:45:45,589 --> 00:45:50,480
free base it sound like it's free as in

00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:51,920
price and and open just makes it sound

00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,210
like you can look at it but it doesn't

00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:56,450
mean that you could do anything with it

00:45:53,210 --> 00:45:57,890
when you see it so but now I have to say

00:45:56,450 --> 00:45:59,809
that so then I sort of started feeling

00:45:57,890 --> 00:46:01,190
like you know actually I've been a

00:45:59,809 --> 00:46:05,329
little bit tricked because it was true

00:46:01,190 --> 00:46:07,670
that we had we had accommodated the

00:46:05,329 --> 00:46:08,720
commercial sale of free and open source

00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:10,490
software such that

00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:12,170
lot of developers felt for a while like

00:46:10,490 --> 00:46:13,670
they couldn't even suggest copyleft as a

00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:17,119
license without being left out of the

00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:20,420
room but all the things had changed HP e

00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:21,890
ela Packard enterprises like a year and

00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:25,190
a half ago maybe two years ago had an

00:46:21,890 --> 00:46:27,050
announcement like a that the gplv3 was

00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:29,900
their preferred license and martin sink

00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:32,119
their CTO got up on stage and talked

00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:33,650
about why the GPL was so much better for

00:46:32,119 --> 00:46:35,990
business and how we'll be paying for the

00:46:33,650 --> 00:46:37,369
same permissive infrastructure over and

00:46:35,990 --> 00:46:40,130
over again all the same governance

00:46:37,369 --> 00:46:41,599
around permissively license or lacks

00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:43,310
license or dismissive lis license

00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:45,950
depending on how you want to call it

00:46:43,310 --> 00:46:48,349
licenses if if we don't start going back

00:46:45,950 --> 00:46:49,609
to copy left a little bit so I think as

00:46:48,349 --> 00:46:51,170
long as we're talking about the same

00:46:49,609 --> 00:46:54,230
thing I don't mind it so much but I

00:46:51,170 --> 00:46:56,840
would say that that free and open source

00:46:54,230 --> 00:46:59,240
software is is something where we have

00:46:56,840 --> 00:47:00,560
to keep the ideology closed no matter

00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:02,930
how we talk about it we have to think

00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:05,090
about the society societal implications

00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:06,140
the balance of power that we have with

00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:08,270
free and open source software is

00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:11,270
delicate and especially in the areas

00:47:08,270 --> 00:47:14,690
that all of you are active in that would

00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:16,160
bring you here companies have gone away

00:47:14,690 --> 00:47:19,760
from copyleft

00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:22,190
and and that means that it's a lot

00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:24,530
harder to keep control keep keep your

00:47:22,190 --> 00:47:25,970
software fully in the public and make

00:47:24,530 --> 00:47:27,859
sure that we can protect against some of

00:47:25,970 --> 00:47:31,160
the you know copyleft is just one

00:47:27,859 --> 00:47:32,900
strategy for dealing with Isis I don't

00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:35,599
care what licenses my software is under

00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:37,640
if as long as I have active as long as I

00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:39,800
have the freedoms connected to it and

00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:43,280
licensing is just one way to accomplish

00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:46,849
that there are other ways but but copy

00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:48,640
less did keep the balance of power and

00:47:46,849 --> 00:47:50,780
martin fink described it is like

00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:52,339
swinging the pendulum back in the other

00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:53,780
direction and I think we've seen we've

00:47:52,339 --> 00:47:56,510
seen some of that and it'll be

00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:58,520
interesting to see where it goes do you

00:47:56,510 --> 00:47:59,390
get access to the data that comes off

00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:01,700
with a fib relator

00:47:59,390 --> 00:48:03,560
and do you know who else gets it oh my

00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:04,790
gosh so this is a huge issue that and

00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:06,380
and what's funny is so I started

00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:09,200
speaking about this and then there was a

00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:11,119
I knew about learning about a man who is

00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:13,670
just a few years older than me who had

00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:15,200
the very same condition as me and we

00:48:13,670 --> 00:48:18,950
found out about each other because I was

00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:21,020
I was interviewed by NPR the same week

00:48:18,950 --> 00:48:22,400
that he gave a TED talk and people were

00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:23,829
like and we both

00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:26,960
had the same hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

00:48:23,829 --> 00:48:28,849
our dispute and we both have

00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:30,619
defibrillators and where we were talking

00:48:28,849 --> 00:48:32,270
about two sides of the same coin so his

00:48:30,619 --> 00:48:34,910
name is Chico campus and he's working on

00:48:32,270 --> 00:48:37,369
getting access to all of his data and

00:48:34,910 --> 00:48:39,020
this is incredibly important and

00:48:37,369 --> 00:48:44,299
something that's really really difficult

00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:47,150
to do so the device manufacturers do

00:48:44,299 --> 00:48:49,220
collect a lot of data about it and I

00:48:47,150 --> 00:48:53,390
worry a lot about when I recently got my

00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:54,470
defibrillator out I requested to keep it

00:48:53,390 --> 00:48:56,000
I should have brought it actually

00:48:54,470 --> 00:48:58,329
because now I have like I could hold it

00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:02,599
out of me like this thing was in my body

00:48:58,329 --> 00:49:04,390
but I also was able to get the data file

00:49:02,599 --> 00:49:08,180
off of it

00:49:04,390 --> 00:49:12,430
so I'm curious to see what I can what I

00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:14,690
can find from that but but the the the

00:49:12,430 --> 00:49:16,400
it's very hard to know to answer the

00:49:14,690 --> 00:49:17,869
second part of your question who is

00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,940
getting access to the data because

00:49:17,869 --> 00:49:21,260
theoretically it's simply the medical

00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:25,520
device manufacturer in your doctor's

00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:27,890
office and there are strict laws in most

00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:30,650
countries that I'm aware of for handling

00:49:27,890 --> 00:49:32,900
that but there was a recent study that

00:49:30,650 --> 00:49:34,970
was published where researchers were

00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:38,480
able to by the programmers in the

00:49:34,970 --> 00:49:41,000
aftermarket off of ebay and one of the

00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:42,920
devices had like thousands of patients

00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:45,049
data like patients worth of data on it

00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:46,910
had like their condition and their

00:49:45,049 --> 00:49:49,819
doctor's name and they're like all of

00:49:46,910 --> 00:49:52,339
their their history and information from

00:49:49,819 --> 00:49:54,619
their devices and there are procedures

00:49:52,339 --> 00:49:56,240
and hospitals for for dealing with

00:49:54,619 --> 00:49:56,720
wiping these devices before they get rid

00:49:56,240 --> 00:50:00,559
of them

00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:02,779
and so I I think that the controlling

00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:04,339
this data says that it's only held by

00:50:02,779 --> 00:50:06,349
people who should have it while at the

00:50:04,339 --> 00:50:10,069
same time giving rights to patients is a

00:50:06,349 --> 00:50:11,569
huge problem there's a new really

00:50:10,069 --> 00:50:15,619
there's like a whole movement around

00:50:11,569 --> 00:50:18,200
patient empowerment and I'm really been

00:50:15,619 --> 00:50:20,630
happy to to get apart to become a part

00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:23,779
of that because as these devices become

00:50:20,630 --> 00:50:25,430
cheaper and more people have them more

00:50:23,779 --> 00:50:27,200
technologically savvy people have access

00:50:25,430 --> 00:50:28,760
to them and then we can we can really

00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:30,410
get access to them this is especially

00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:32,059
relevant the insulin pump space there's

00:50:30,410 --> 00:50:33,920
like a nice Scout Foundation or that

00:50:32,059 --> 00:50:35,240
we're not waiting movement where people

00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:35,990
have reverse-engineered their insulin

00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:38,930
pumps so they can

00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:40,580
more precisely deliver their own insulin

00:50:38,930 --> 00:50:43,849
so they make themselves artificial

00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:46,820
pancreas and having access to your data

00:50:43,849 --> 00:50:50,260
is totally critical to this and and it's

00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:50,260
a really important piece of the puzzle I

00:50:52,030 --> 00:50:55,849
can't see if we're out of those someone

00:50:54,530 --> 00:50:57,619
has a question down here I don't know

00:50:55,849 --> 00:50:59,599
we're out of time we're totally out of

00:50:57,619 --> 00:51:01,099
time I'll be around all day so feel free

00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:02,330
to find me thank you so much and enjoy

00:51:01,099 --> 00:51:03,710
the rest of your conference and thank

00:51:02,330 --> 00:51:06,160
the organizers if you see them maybe

00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:13,880
even give them a high-five thanks

00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:13,880
