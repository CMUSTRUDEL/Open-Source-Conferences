Title: Berlin Buzzwords 2014: Michael Kaisser - Geospatial Analysis of Social Media posts w  ElasticSearch
Publication date: 2014-05-28
Playlist: Berlin Buzzwords 2014 #bbuzz
Description: 
	In this talk I describe how ElasticSearch can be used to store, search and analyze large volumes of Social Media data (Twitter, Instagram, Foursquare, Blogs, etc.), paying special attention to the spatial aspect of the data. The primary aim of this talk is to give an overview about what can be done with ElasticSearch when it comes to spatial search and analysis. Social Media APIs are a good data source here, because they are openly available, and thus suitable to fill ElasticSearch quickly with real time data. Many of the techniques I show are reproducible with not too much effort.

hello all right there seems to be

00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:13,480
working so

00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:13,710
talk it's called to spatial and license

00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,270
of

00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:20,270
social media posts with elastic search

00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:22,619
and I'm Michael Kaiser I work in a small

00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:25,349
natural language processing consulting

00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:27,060
company called text data we are based

00:00:25,349 --> 00:00:30,150
here in Berlin just a few hundred meters

00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:31,410
from away so basically the background

00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:33,590
for this talk is this was a little fun

00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:36,510
project that I worked on for a while and

00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:37,739
I put the code now on github so you can

00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:39,660
actually look at all the coated I'm

00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:41,040
going to show you today and maybe some

00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,280
of you feel even inspire to add

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:47,879
something to it I would be very glad and

00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:49,859
hopefully you learned something today so

00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:51,420
what do we want to do you want to use

00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:53,280
elastic search to browse and discover

00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,920
what's happening on social media and

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,719
we're paying a special aspect to the

00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,269
spatial nature of the data so we want to

00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:02,370
see what's happening around like you for

00:01:00,269 --> 00:01:05,220
example right now or anywhere else in

00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:07,650
Berlin and we also want to perform some

00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:11,100
more advanced analytics to take ten

00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:13,260
trend transcendence activity hotspots

00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:16,409
and so we want to see what's interesting

00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:18,509
right now at a certain point and this

00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:20,729
talk is a fairly on introductory level

00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:22,619
so I think even if you have never heard

00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:24,960
about elasticsearch before you probably

00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:27,420
can follow this and everything else I

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:31,130
explained I hopefully explain a way that

00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,130
it should be understandable to everybody

00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:35,700
ok we're going to talk a bit about

00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:37,320
social data twitter instagram Foursquare

00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,899
what can you get there how does the data

00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,570
look like how do you fetch it store it

00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:43,950
and search with it with elastic search

00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:47,100
and we talk about specifically about

00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,810
geospatial analysis Soccio hashes and

00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:52,860
some custom build analyzes that i'm

00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:54,899
going to show you and we have an outlook

00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:56,609
so what could be done better because by

00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:59,369
no way what I'm presenting to use the

00:01:56,609 --> 00:02:01,890
final answer the Java code is on github

00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:03,990
right it's really the maxim here is to

00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:05,789
keep it simple before I loaded it up I

00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:07,500
think two days ago I just removed

00:02:05,789 --> 00:02:10,350
everything that was was clutter and

00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:13,860
didn't really add much and there is lots

00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:17,790
of space for improvements all right

00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:19,290
social data so social data is fairly new

00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:21,180
and it's interesting because it

00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:23,430
continuously creates massive amounts of

00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,470
data so that's four for tech people like

00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:26,490
like us here in this room this is very

00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:28,140
nice

00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:31,170
have a constant stream of data coming in

00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:32,910
and you can do amazing things with it it

00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:36,270
can be fetched in real time the api's

00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:38,010
are for low value a low volume

00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:40,890
non-commercial use their free so you can

00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:43,050
easily start something at home and just

00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:45,150
see how it works if then you want to go

00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:48,720
commercial you usually have sometimes

00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:50,850
you have to pay this data contains text

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,010
it contains images it contains geo

00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:56,910
coordinates so there's lots of stuff to

00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:58,380
play with yeah but on the other hand I

00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:00,120
mean it's lots of noises there as well

00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:02,790
as we will see so creating real insight

00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:05,160
isn't an easy problem and it's worked a

00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:07,770
lot on in industry and research at the

00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:10,230
moment so for example we have 500

00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:12,840
million tweets a day we have 600 million

00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:15,180
Instagram photos a day and six million

00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,980
for foursquare check-ins these are the

00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:19,470
the data sources we're going to work

00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:21,210
with and if you then take a closer look

00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:23,220
you find out at about five percent of

00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:24,930
the tweets have geo coordinates one

00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:26,760
hundred percent of the Instagram photos

00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:30,600
of geo coordinates there's a little star

00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:32,460
there in order to tell you that although

00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,650
a hundred percent of the Instagram

00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:36,030
photos have geo coordinates

00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:38,550
unfortunately the geo coordinates are

00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:40,020
not always where the photo was taken so

00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:41,490
sometimes we get geo coordinates in the

00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:43,050
middle of Berlin and it's a touch mahal

00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:45,090
from India I mean you get these cases

00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:46,980
and it's just somebody took a photo in

00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:48,840
India of the touch Mahal and hasn't

00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:50,190
uploaded it until he was in Berlin and

00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,510
kind of like checked it in his host to

00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:54,330
host Earl and then hit an internet

00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:56,190
connection uploaded it which is just

00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:59,100
which adds to the noise that you that

00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:00,990
you have and the fort red Foursquare

00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:04,230
check-ins of course our FTO coordinates

00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:07,290
as well so here's something we get from

00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:08,940
fitter there's just a text looking

00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:11,970
forward to Berlin password so that was

00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:13,860
me posting that last Wednesday at that

00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:15,780
point because I hated I took it directly

00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:20,520
after it was posted it wasn't retweeted

00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:22,650
it wasn't favorited by anyone and so on

00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:27,000
so forth but you can see there has a

00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:29,010
unique ID it has a time stamp it as I

00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,600
the user is basically given and you have

00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:33,330
the coordinates so that's important for

00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:35,370
us we will come back to this Instagram

00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:36,780
gives you something like this it's

00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:39,419
pretty much the same thing as you can

00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:40,320
see you also have location you have time

00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:43,800
stamps you have

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:46,940
these you have the user but of course

00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:50,820
the chasing structure is different and

00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:53,340
this is what you get from foursquare so

00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:55,920
this is a trending place on foursquare

00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:58,470
which is the local market at Winterfell

00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:00,510
plots which is invest in Berlin has

00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:02,430
coordinates here and you can get some

00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:05,010
statistics about how many check-ins they

00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:07,230
have how many from how many users these

00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:09,360
chickens are how many users have given

00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:11,280
how many tips there are so users telling

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,610
you you know the best coffees here and

00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,530
that sort of stuff and yeah you get a

00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:19,140
URL for the web page and also a number

00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:22,320
about how many people are there at the

00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:24,030
point when we retrieved it so this is

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,830
all nice and as you can see this is all

00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:27,420
chasing data so if you use elasticsearch

00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:29,340
it's pretty easy to just put this into

00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:31,680
elasticsearch actually we could just

00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:33,230
take it from the from the api's and

00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,000
directly save it into elasticsearch

00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:37,530
however the problem is that it's

00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,670
difficult for us then to search and it

00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:40,800
because like all the fields have

00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:43,050
different names so what we need is

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,180
basically we need in a more complicated

00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:46,890
structure you have the little hierarchy

00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:49,170
class hierarchy with an abstract post

00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:51,510
which just says you know the text and

00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:53,940
kind of like coordinates and index date

00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:57,090
all in the same field and I'm kind of

00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:58,560
like we have the three types of posts

00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:00,420
that have seen you which all have their

00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:04,530
special properties that are not covered

00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:06,570
in up there so what that would mean is

00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:08,880
basically that we transform the Twitter

00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:10,530
Jason into that and if you look at the

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,030
code is online on github about like

00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:13,980
thirty percent or just about that

00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:15,480
basically right you just need to take

00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:17,310
every feeling kind of transform it into

00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:19,830
something else but then you end up

00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:21,480
something that you have here on the on

00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:24,660
the right side from your point of view

00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:29,240
and we can easily search on that because

00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:29,240
it's the same for all of those posts

00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:36,210
elasticsearch is usually um you don't

00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:37,680
have to do much to start start working

00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:39,270
with elasticsearch right you just show

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,010
you chasing in and elastic search is

00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:42,920
pretty good at figuring out you know

00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:45,540
this is a text field this is a double

00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:47,610
this is an integer value and so on and

00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:48,870
so forth it doesn't however really work

00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:50,669
with the coordinates and that is

00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:51,500
something that we really want to work

00:06:50,669 --> 00:06:54,140
with

00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:56,600
so what we're basically doing here is we

00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:58,550
need to set up a mapping that is what we

00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,900
see on the right again and we just need

00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:02,690
to tell elasticsearch that that

00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:07,370
coordinate field their coordinates field

00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:09,500
that is of type geopoint that means it

00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:10,940
will set up spatial index so we can

00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,650
easily search and do distance

00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:14,390
calculation on that otherwise

00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:15,980
elasticsearch would assume that these

00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:17,420
are just double numbers lat and long

00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:19,910
would just be double numbers and you

00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:23,960
couldn't really do much nice things with

00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:30,860
it other than that we do a it works with

00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:32,300
elastic search out of the box so by now

00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:34,790
we just have all these things in an

00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:37,820
elastic search basically and we can

00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:40,550
already think about carrying it and so

00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:42,740
the only thing you basically the two

00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:44,300
things you have to do you set up a query

00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:46,400
and you said have a filter for the query

00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:49,940
and you see the Java code on top and

00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,560
then like further for the field query on

00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:54,320
the chase and structure down there as

00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:59,270
well so basically what we do we run on

00:07:54,320 --> 00:08:00,860
we pick the field coordinates we give

00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:03,169
him the latitude and longitude that we

00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:05,240
want to search for we say we have a

00:08:03,169 --> 00:08:07,910
certain distance in meter we want to do

00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:09,919
this computation in memory just because

00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:12,950
it's faster and because we are on a

00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:15,380
planet Earth Lanier's is not flat we use

00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:18,800
this Ark calculation methods to compute

00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:20,840
the distance and then the search

00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:24,500
response here that is basically the

00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:28,190
query so we tell it which index we find

00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:29,600
the data we use the match all query that

00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:31,310
is basically first of all turning you

00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:34,520
take everything that is there and then

00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:37,610
filter it and it's basically filtered by

00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:38,960
cheer distance as you can see down there

00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:44,930
so a thousand meter from a specific

00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:48,110
point and if you would want to restrict

00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:51,620
your search to not just everything but

00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:53,390
to a specific type of text query just

00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:56,660
say we want everything that has bar in

00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:57,830
it or or food so we just want to want to

00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:59,990
see where all the places are where

00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:02,240
people you know post something about

00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:04,250
food and we could just simply go there

00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,089
and give it a query string and just you

00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:07,189
know here we have

00:09:05,089 --> 00:09:09,620
that and us we will just put their you

00:09:07,189 --> 00:09:13,420
know food or whatever and then kind of

00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:18,259
like search for the for the Geo distance

00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:22,249
all right so i can quickly show you what

00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:27,829
if so we have the fetch you see I'm just

00:09:22,249 --> 00:09:32,319
running it I hope the internet

00:09:27,829 --> 00:09:34,459
connection is good enough uh-huh of

00:09:32,319 --> 00:09:38,199
course we should start elasticsearch

00:09:34,459 --> 00:09:38,199
before this that will be good idea

00:09:39,009 --> 00:09:44,329
that's elasticsearch and here we have a

00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:49,309
little web server just so they can see

00:09:44,329 --> 00:10:01,660
the results usually quickly pretty fast

00:09:49,309 --> 00:10:01,660
at starting up okay we restart

00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:21,480
and what you can see here for example is

00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,090
this is a streaming streaming Thatcher

00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:26,310
from Twitter so the code is online i'm

00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:27,750
not going into details here right now so

00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:29,460
what you see is that whenever a new

00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,870
tweet is issued so if you would treat

00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:34,380
something now is geo coordinates it

00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:36,230
should show up here so every new tweet

00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:40,470
that is issued if it's in a certain

00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:42,240
bounding box will be will be fetched and

00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:46,710
will we will arrive here and we put it

00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:48,840
in the database so and once we have that

00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:52,560
and because with the web server running

00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:55,440
as well I can just run the query that I

00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:58,170
showed you before and we would see

00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,910
something like this right so this is a

00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:01,230
little weapon to wear face that just

00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:03,390
runs the query that I showed you before

00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:05,220
and we can see that there is trending

00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:07,200
right now and Foursquare is Berlin

00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:09,420
buzzwords right that's around here

00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,030
though some people are are not happy

00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:14,160
with their batch apparently that's a

00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:16,470
group photo of some guys you know and

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,450
people commenting on talks that sort of

00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:20,730
stuff of course this is not the only

00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:22,200
thing that's happening around here so we

00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:26,340
have like other stuff in there as well

00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:28,010
and so on and so forth there you know a

00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:31,080
lot of it is about building buzz words

00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:34,260
unsurprisingly somewhat so we could see

00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:35,640
here that is indeed lug around us so the

00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,290
little dot here is where we are and this

00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:40,380
is like the Twitter post the Instagram

00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:42,870
posts and so on so forth and we could go

00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:44,160
to another point to another place just

00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:46,440
click on the map and then it would do

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:49,590
the query with that coordinates and go

00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:51,000
back and I don't know what that is you

00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:53,660
can see this is somewhere in Kreuzberg

00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,820
and it's quite a different scene right

00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:59,100
this is very nice this is a auto ship so

00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:05,430
it's sunny day so people are having fun

00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:10,170
at the beach and you know it's it's it's

00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:12,810
generally yeah it's generally it's it's

00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:14,670
a very nice tool to find food right if

00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:15,840
you're usually somewhere you can just

00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:17,730
like take it out and scroll through

00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:20,850
because so many people are taking images

00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:22,440
of their food it's not that much here

00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:26,550
also in the evening it's nice to find

00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:27,690
where the next parties okay I mean this

00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:29,940
is basically what we've done

00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:31,320
far and it was really pretty simple that

00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:34,110
was just like with a with a query that I

00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:38,670
showed you and setting up the index to

00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:40,230
run properly ok but so far we really

00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:42,780
haven't done much we have taken the data

00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:45,860
in we have put it in the index and we

00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:48,360
can search on it which is which is nice

00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:50,790
but we want to do a bit more than that

00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:53,340
so we want to do some analyzes on top of

00:12:50,790 --> 00:13:03,510
this and so one thing that we're going

00:12:53,340 --> 00:13:07,200
to use our cheat we were was that ok so

00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:08,970
we're going to use chia hashes which

00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,400
essentially is a geocode system it was

00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:13,650
invented by a guava niemeyer and what it

00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:16,470
does it subdivide space into buckets of

00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:18,960
arbitrary precision and so in the end

00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:21,000
each location has a unique ash and the

00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:23,550
location itself can be derived from the

00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,770
hash it's in a public domain as well if

00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:28,080
you haven't understood it now that's

00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:31,890
very good because i'm going to- spend

00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:33,810
the next 10 minutes explaining it how it

00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:35,820
works precisely so this is the map of

00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:41,100
the world that little marker is where we

00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:43,590
are and what what is happening now with

00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:45,990
gu hashes is that the world is divided

00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:47,850
like vertically horizontally and then

00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:52,110
vertically again and more horizontally

00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:56,550
and each after each division we assign

00:13:52,110 --> 00:14:01,140
like 0 0 1 to 1 part of the of the field

00:13:56,550 --> 00:14:03,840
so I you know I mean like America would

00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:07,130
have 0 here and the most part of the

00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:09,330
rest of the world like one then we do a

00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:13,620
horizontal division along the equator

00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:15,330
and we have 0 1 for north america 11 is

00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:19,820
basically Europe in Asia and so on so

00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:27,690
forth and we can continue doing that and

00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:30,930
as they already see by now the the field

00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:34,170
we are in the square we are in is 1 1 0

00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:36,300
1 0 so and as you divide further you're

00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:40,120
getting two smaller and smaller areas

00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:42,730
and each of these has its unique ash

00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:44,980
but because the father is binary if we

00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:49,120
really go down a local level our gf's

00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:50,680
will become very long and therefore what

00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:54,730
we're doing is we're switching from a

00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:57,130
binary representation of the data to a

00:14:54,730 --> 00:15:00,670
base 32 representation of the data by

00:14:57,130 --> 00:15:02,350
using that table here and what then

00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:05,320
happens is basically this we have seen

00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:10,900
already is that each one of these fields

00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:14,310
um just gets a letter or a number

00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:17,050
assigned a digit and as I said we

00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:19,060
subdivide is further and what then

00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:21,790
happens is we can zoom in and I'm going

00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:23,800
to show you how that works so again here

00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:25,630
is like you this is the slice of the

00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:28,660
world of represents use in to you has

00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:32,470
this is you three so its eastern germany

00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:36,960
and poland largely berlin and a bit of

00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:36,960
brandenburg north of berlin is you 33

00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:46,470
south east berlin you 333 d we have like

00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:49,270
this is basically pencil / q 33 DC

00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:53,350
castalian alley area of brands low bro

00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:57,940
q3 3d CH here we have the cultural pro I

00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:59,740
which is you three 3d CH x and this is

00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:01,990
already then pretty fine grained this is

00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:05,470
roughly where we are at the moment and

00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:08,680
now we have seven digits this is roughly

00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:12,310
how GRS works work the question is now

00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:14,110
what is it good for so if we index all

00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:16,150
the coordinates that we have if you use

00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:19,420
the chi-you halves of each of this post

00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:21,100
to use it as to index it then we can

00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:23,350
easily check like whether there are any

00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:24,850
buckets there that have liked more posts

00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:26,500
in it than others then we can so we

00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:29,200
could say maybe there's this is kind of

00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:34,150
like a trending area in town at the

00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:37,000
moment and that's what we want to do but

00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:39,279
before we can do that we need to do one

00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,260
thing we need to change the mapping in

00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:42,790
elastic search so that's what I showed

00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:44,740
you before we set up the field

00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:46,060
coordinates as a geo point to tell

00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:48,550
elasticsearch we want to do Chi you

00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:50,980
search on it and what we do now is

00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:54,200
basically we say ok but also create

00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:57,800
achieve a hash for each point and

00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:59,990
since it says use the length 10 so far

00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,820
we have been at seven that's what is

00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:02,960
basically this room here roughly so

00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,579
we're good even further which is

00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:07,430
probably too much but we want to keep

00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:10,670
their flexibility and then if you want

00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:12,230
to search for it there is I think a

00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:13,640
newer syntax out there but I like this

00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:16,610
one better because it explains for

00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:18,350
nicely what's done we set up an

00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:21,709
aggregation we give it a name it's

00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:24,500
called chill hash we run it on the field

00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:26,390
coordinates geo hash which we set up up

00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:29,270
there and then we have a regular

00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:34,100
expression here which just tells us use

00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:39,500
the first seven digits so we do that and

00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:41,150
then we get from the aggregation we get

00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:45,640
a list of terms back and in these terms

00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:48,290
their buckets and this will tell us

00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:50,120
basically which of the Chi has that we

00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:51,830
have at the moment has the most posts in

00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:54,820
it and I can also show you that

00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:54,820
precisely

00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:08,180
alright so this this part is this

00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:09,800
interesting card for now now we can see

00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:12,560
I mean we set it up to deal with seven

00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:14,240
digits and we have like a bunch of gos

00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:16,490
here that are trending so they're 15

00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:19,010
posts in this geo hash in the last two

00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:21,530
hours they're like 11 post in that

00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:23,270
geocache unfortunately with Gio has you

00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:24,800
really can't you know the geocache alone

00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:26,150
doesn't tell you much you don't really I

00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:32,090
mean at least as a human you can't

00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:39,920
really put this on a map um okay so much

00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:42,080
for that the question is just are we

00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:43,370
done now now we have some buckets and we

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,280
know there's a lot of stuff happening

00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:50,390
here and is this enough for our purpose

00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:51,860
to really find out where you know where

00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:53,600
the hotspots in the city are at the

00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:55,700
moment and it's unfortunately not the

00:18:53,600 --> 00:19:00,860
case really and one of the issues here

00:18:55,700 --> 00:19:02,330
is monologues just meaning that that's

00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:04,100
just you know I mean they're just users

00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:06,500
on Twitter and they may be in one hour

00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:07,760
they put out 50 tweets and that's just

00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,960
one person it doesn't really tell us

00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,700
there is something happening at this

00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,760
beta at this place it's just one person

00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:15,830
and generally some areas are more active

00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,390
than other and rough rather we would

00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:19,490
actually what we like is we would like

00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:21,710
to know whether one area is more active

00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:23,570
at this point and it usually was rather

00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:27,890
than you know in the center of Berlin is

00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:29,480
also always more MORE they're always

00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:32,540
more posts than somewhere out there in

00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:34,070
Brandenburg in the wildness so what

00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:35,240
we've done so far we found Z we found

00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:36,830
these cheap edges but they're more or

00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,570
less just hit by hypothesis that need to

00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:42,350
be verified and that's what we're trying

00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:47,330
to do now and so what we're going to do

00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:50,360
here is so let's say we found that one

00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:52,130
of these squares that is rectangles

00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:53,360
actually they're not really squares one

00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:54,980
of these rectangles that is really

00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,390
trending at the moon has a lot of posts

00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:59,860
coming from one is kind of like this

00:19:56,390 --> 00:20:02,960
room or general equal to a power i right

00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:04,340
then what we would do is we would we

00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,950
have the hypothesis that something is

00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:09,680
happening here we would again like to do

00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:12,110
23 searches with elastic search one of

00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:14,240
them with a radius of 100 meter another

00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:16,550
one with the radius 200 meter and I

00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:19,070
thought with a radius of 300 meters

00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:21,020
and would compute some scores on this

00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:23,210
and what we're interested now is kind of

00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:25,700
like the unique users that post in them

00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:28,100
in the inn in a small circle in a medium

00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:31,970
circle in a big circle and then we can

00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:34,280
compute some very easy scores so the

00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:35,950
Assumption here is that as well and

00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:38,090
sometimes you have events which are

00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:40,130
small and sometimes you have a wench

00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:41,860
which are a bit bigger but usually what

00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:46,340
we want to have is we're going to have a

00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:49,760
certain area where there's more activity

00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:52,460
than the surrounding area so what we do

00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:55,910
is at one point we just take the amount

00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:58,100
of unique posters in the blue area and

00:20:55,910 --> 00:21:00,170
divided by the yellow area and the other

00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:02,990
one we take the yellow area and divide

00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:04,340
it by the right warrier area so one is

00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:06,230
for smaller than the other one would be

00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:08,570
for bigger event and we want to see

00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:09,920
actually that in that in the center of

00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:12,410
the spot there is more activity than

00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:14,600
around it and we also this is the

00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:18,050
relative score basically we also have an

00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:20,090
absolute score which it's just about how

00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:22,010
many people how many posts are actually

00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:24,410
coming from this location and we can

00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:25,640
then combine them actually the formulas

00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:30,050
missing here but we just throw it

00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:34,400
together by adding it up and ensure that

00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:37,820
as well actually was the part below here

00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:40,370
so we're ended already and here can you

00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:42,740
can see now that there was a hot spot

00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:46,280
around a certain place around this

00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:50,960
coordinates and we can see that within

00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:52,850
hundred meters these are the the posts

00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,460
they're mostly from Instagram all of

00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:58,280
them within 200 meters we have those and

00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:59,990
then within 300 meters if you look at

00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:02,810
this string that basically would tell

00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:05,030
you we have seven unique posters in 100

00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:08,660
metre radios 15 unique posters within

00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:10,820
200 meters and 17 within 300 meters so

00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:12,830
really we have like something that in

00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:17,000
the middle that is significantly higher

00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:22,130
than what is around and that makes sense

00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:24,380
i mean if you're not really it's so

00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:25,880
there are lots of different users and if

00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:29,270
you're not from berlin you might not

00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:30,410
know yesterday there was a there was a

00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:32,630
world not only you

00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:36,220
in election but about about the temporal

00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:39,410
ferret which is a disused airspace in

00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:42,110
tempelhof and there was a world whether

00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:43,610
it should stay as the day so whether it

00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:45,560
the Senate is allowed to build some

00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:46,820
houses there and it seems like the

00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:49,580
people who organize the loads are

00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:52,490
currently meeting there and discussing

00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:54,410
um what's going on so that is one hot

00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:56,540
spots that we found and of course

00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:58,910
there's something in Charlottenburg for

00:22:56,540 --> 00:23:02,060
the names basically sometimes with a

00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:05,270
with treats or instagram posts you get a

00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:08,090
name a location name being send out and

00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:10,040
we just take that for the name so

00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:11,990
there's something in Charlottenburg I

00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:14,240
don't know know what there is we have

00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:16,070
Martin copious ball I can tell you

00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,650
living here that there is a David Bowen

00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:20,240
our via exhibition there so there we can

00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:22,550
see it's a lot of people seem to be on

00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:25,460
the exhibition at the moment east side

00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:27,380
gallery constantly trending like every

00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:28,970
tourist goes there and sends a picture

00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:31,300
of himself standing in front of the

00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:33,710
gallery art that happens every day

00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:38,690
bundestag people visiting the bundestag

00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:40,790
of course that bikini is a new shopping

00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:44,180
center which is fairly nice and fairly

00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:48,050
popular airport is always to all the

00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:50,300
time trending a little bit disappointed

00:23:48,050 --> 00:24:01,280
we're not on it at the moment you need

00:23:50,300 --> 00:24:04,100
to tweet more right okay and then here

00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:08,480
we have some in the steam motors running

00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:10,700
on a server we have just a just a little

00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:13,010
web interface for it and for example you

00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:15,610
can see I've seen should have shown you

00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:17,810
the barter shift before so this is

00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:21,670
people hanging out in the Sun and

00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:25,460
posting selfies it's Instagram after all

00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:27,940
and twenty percent tempelhof a Fed I

00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:30,410
don't know this is people running kites

00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:33,610
you know it's also a sunny day so people

00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:33,610
are out there enjoying their time

00:24:38,029 --> 00:24:53,429
all right now let's see the only bus was

00:24:47,219 --> 00:24:57,659
finally so that's not me that someone

00:24:53,429 --> 00:24:58,710
else but yeah I mean you can see there

00:24:57,659 --> 00:24:59,969
is something is not with the web

00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:01,619
interface something is not quite right i

00:24:59,969 --> 00:25:02,969
mean they're definitely to the more than

00:25:01,619 --> 00:25:05,940
two posts and your goals can see it's

00:25:02,969 --> 00:25:08,580
only one displayed but so that's a

00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:14,749
general idea and this is the raw data it

00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:14,749
just swallows some of the stuff okay

00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:28,379
yeah so this is already 0 mostly what I

00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:29,429
wanted to show you there are no tests

00:25:28,379 --> 00:25:31,009
have been said I mean this is very

00:25:29,429 --> 00:25:35,849
simplified there are lots of things that

00:25:31,009 --> 00:25:37,859
are not uh not as good as it should be

00:25:35,849 --> 00:25:39,719
and then something quite a few things

00:25:37,859 --> 00:25:41,700
can be improved for example at the

00:25:39,719 --> 00:25:44,969
moment we are assuming that the center

00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:46,409
of an individual geocache is the center

00:25:44,969 --> 00:25:48,929
of an event that's of course not always

00:25:46,409 --> 00:25:50,539
the case right and that brings some

00:25:48,929 --> 00:25:53,309
noise some additional noise into the

00:25:50,539 --> 00:25:54,779
computations and you have like some

00:25:53,309 --> 00:25:57,059
locations which are trending every day

00:25:54,779 --> 00:25:58,950
for example the train station the

00:25:57,059 --> 00:26:00,749
airport the printing burgade east art

00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:02,789
gallery it's just like you know I mean

00:26:00,749 --> 00:26:04,799
at every point in time when you would

00:26:02,789 --> 00:26:08,460
look there it would be trending so we

00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:10,289
need something like IDF tf-idf for geo

00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:11,549
hairs just to figure out you know this

00:26:10,289 --> 00:26:15,719
is constantly trending this is not

00:26:11,549 --> 00:26:17,369
really interesting and yeah as I said

00:26:15,719 --> 00:26:18,929
before Instagram coordinates are not

00:26:17,369 --> 00:26:20,279
always where the photo was taken so

00:26:18,929 --> 00:26:24,149
sometimes you have really weird stuff in

00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:25,440
there and yeah so actually what we want

00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:28,129
to do is kind of like we want to have a

00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:32,190
bit more sophisticated and lysis there

00:26:28,129 --> 00:26:33,960
which is not on github at the moment but

00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:36,989
it gave a talk here last year which in a

00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:38,879
sense then talked a lot about that and

00:26:36,989 --> 00:26:40,559
there's also paper out there and you can

00:26:38,879 --> 00:26:42,450
watch talk online if you're interested

00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:46,889
so this is what we did last year I'm not

00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:48,909
going in in detail there may be just

00:26:46,889 --> 00:26:50,409
like onk-onk I can take a few things

00:26:48,909 --> 00:26:52,269
so we had a feature there which is

00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:54,190
called common theme that might actually

00:26:52,269 --> 00:26:56,859
be very interesting so we want to know

00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:58,509
if if there are lot of posts coming from

00:26:56,859 --> 00:27:00,759
one location we actually want to know

00:26:58,509 --> 00:27:02,409
whether they talk around whether people

00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:04,720
there talk about the same topic or not

00:27:02,409 --> 00:27:10,690
so we can see whether some overlap in 10

00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:14,379
grams that actually helped and another

00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:17,440
thing that that helped is like unique

00:27:14,379 --> 00:27:20,080
coordinates because quite often you have

00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,700
robots sending out tweets especially and

00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,919
they're always from exactly the same

00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:25,539
location so if you have like a cluster

00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:27,309
where like the exactly the same location

00:27:25,539 --> 00:27:30,159
constantly tweets then that's probably

00:27:27,309 --> 00:27:32,559
also something some noise there and it's

00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:35,649
not what we're looking for and so on and

00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:37,029
so forth so that is was that work

00:27:35,649 --> 00:27:38,799
basically was done for the company I

00:27:37,029 --> 00:27:41,710
used to work for and so the code is

00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:44,799
locked in the company so but there's a

00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:46,509
paper so people can read it and again I

00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:48,849
mean as I said I mean with the analyzers

00:27:46,509 --> 00:27:51,070
there there's lots of stuff that can be

00:27:48,849 --> 00:27:53,320
done better I'm sure of it and the code

00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:57,239
is on on get up and I mean I would love

00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:57,239
if people would try some ideas seriously

00:27:59,099 --> 00:28:03,639
i'm going to put put the slides online

00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,859
of course and also going to put this on

00:28:03,639 --> 00:28:07,929
get up I'm not going did the detail here

00:28:05,859 --> 00:28:10,210
if you want to run the code it's fairly

00:28:07,929 --> 00:28:11,619
simple the only complicated thing that

00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:13,629
you have to do is you have to get your

00:28:11,619 --> 00:28:17,019
own API tokens so you have to register

00:28:13,629 --> 00:28:20,169
which all of with Twitter with instagram

00:28:17,019 --> 00:28:23,679
and with Foursquare and once you've done

00:28:20,169 --> 00:28:29,799
that you need to add your API tokens and

00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:33,210
then it will basically run and yeah

00:28:29,799 --> 00:28:33,210
that's it already

00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:57,650
questions yeah okay ah thanks okay

00:28:55,700 --> 00:29:02,230
turning the microphone honor the trick

00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:02,230
where were the hand please read thanks

00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:11,480
hi regarding your problem that some

00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:14,210
locations are always or very often

00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:17,750
trending did you consider to use some

00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:19,370
sort of moving average over you know

00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:22,880
slide I'm sliding window over that

00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:24,950
locations history and to compare the

00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:27,290
value from the time you're interesting

00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:29,330
and with the average of the history just

00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:31,940
to see if it you know if it has a peak

00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:34,220
or if it goes up or down in general so

00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:36,800
yeah I did consider it but I didn't do

00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:38,120
it yeah but there's no specific because

00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,650
that's a good idea I think that's

00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:56,300
something you need your idea okay thank

00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:58,910
you I came a couple of minutes too late

00:29:56,300 --> 00:30:02,600
maybe that was already said if it was

00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:05,000
then I apologize and I mean you are from

00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:08,030
cheeks T data that's the company behind

00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:11,240
the whole text data text data is like

00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:15,140
basically my company okay so and the

00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:18,260
social this social radar what kind of

00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:20,450
project is that from let me say

00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:22,460
commercial standpoint is that is that an

00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:27,020
open source project why are you doing

00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:28,700
that what's the background yeah so for

00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:31,040
 you would like baby to

00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:34,130
participate then the question is in what

00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:37,700
way what kind of scene so the I mean it

00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:39,620
used to be a project that that I just

00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:41,270
did for fun and by the time we were kind

00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:43,610
of like thinking maybe know you could do

00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:45,560
a product with it and blah blah blah but

00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:49,010
then we kind of like moved in a bit of

00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:50,940
another direction and so we still I mean

00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:52,470
I still think I mean it was it

00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:54,960
what's a very nice thing and it's kind

00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:56,730
of like you know in a city like Berlin

00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,200
it's it's kind of like really nice to

00:30:56,730 --> 00:31:00,270
just discover what's happening around

00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:02,280
you but from a commercial point I mean

00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:04,140
one thing is you know we don't own the

00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:06,750
data so we're very dependent on the data

00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:08,220
providers and if you really use that in

00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:09,870
large volumes we at some point have to

00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:12,930
pay and they you know I mean if you

00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:17,400
change the API or just raise their fees

00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:19,110
and so well we didn't follow it we

00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,790
didn't follow up on it to be honest and

00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:22,620
then we just put it aside and still

00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:24,390
because we thought it's a nice bro check

00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:26,370
and people you know i mean it's it's

00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:27,750
even useful so it sits there and get up

00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:30,510
and there's a server actually that runs

00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:33,690
it i think i can give you ul and you can

00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:35,130
play with it a bit and yeah but it's

00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:36,690
there's no commercial interest it has

00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:38,550
it's a guitar pit is an Apache to

00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:40,500
license now and you know do what it

00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:50,270
whatever you want so it's an open source

00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:53,010
project now yeah okay more questions

00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:55,190
okay then thank you very much for your

00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:55,190
talk

00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:01,570
