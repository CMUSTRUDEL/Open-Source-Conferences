Title: Berlin Buzzwords 2014: Breno Faria, Christoph Goller - High quality, low maintenance content tagging
Publication date: 2014-05-28
Playlist: Berlin Buzzwords 2014 #bbuzz
Description: 
	On ApachCon 2012 we presented a system for content tagging at ZEIT Online. This talk presents recent work on improving the ranking of the tags by building exclusively on the data (complete ZEIT Online News Archive). Tags are either named entities, statistically relevant terms/phrases occurring in the news articles or topics delivered from text classification. 

The system uses open-source technology such as Lucene and Gate to produce these tags. We will present the requirements and expectations of an online editorial office on such a system and ideas on how to meet those expectations. All tags are ranked based on trend analysis, typical contexts and overall TF-IDF scores, all computed on the whole archive. No manual maintenance of thesauri or ontology resources is necessary.

ok so I'll start hi I'm Brianna Faria

00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:17,170
is a joint talk with my colleague Chris

00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:20,320
of gawler but since it's a kind of short

00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:22,630
talk i will be doing it my only myself

00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,610
and he's sitting here in front and he

00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:26,110
will be available for questions in case

00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:30,130
you have any you can come to me of

00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:32,800
course also i work for inter find intro

00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:35,050
find is a company there is an elastic

00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,630
search partner we specialists for

00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:40,480
information retrieval and text analytics

00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:42,700
we're strongly based on open source

00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:47,050
technologies we have to leucine

00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:49,420
committees on board and we're we have

00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:52,149
high quality linguistic analyzers for

00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:53,589
mostly European languages and we have

00:00:52,149 --> 00:00:56,469
most of our customers are in the

00:00:53,589 --> 00:01:00,219
german-speaking European area so we are

00:00:56,469 --> 00:01:02,829
very good at German analysis and we also

00:01:00,219 --> 00:01:08,740
do entity extraction and other

00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:10,690
information extraction exactly I'm the

00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:13,659
outline for the talk I would present a

00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:20,020
project that we have going on at site

00:01:13,659 --> 00:01:22,240
online since 2010 and I'll just talk a

00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:25,840
bit about the beginning of the project

00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:29,920
how the workflow in the editing office

00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:35,079
is and what the requirements are and how

00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:37,479
we we try to meet these requirements so

00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:39,850
that site online project side for those

00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:42,130
of you that don't know is a very

00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:45,430
renowned and newspaper in Germany it was

00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:50,100
founded 46 so to use a one year after

00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:55,289
World War Two and it's issued weekly and

00:01:50,100 --> 00:02:00,579
site online is the the web page of the

00:01:55,289 --> 00:02:04,119
the newspaper it was begin it began 96

00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:09,820
and of course it's not weekly issued its

00:02:04,119 --> 00:02:12,670
online 2010 we had the we started the

00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:14,640
project and site came to us and said we

00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:19,300
want to have our whole archive of

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:23,610
articles since 46 and searchable

00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:25,860
researchable and am tagged with metadata

00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:30,840
because we want to link

00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:32,250
articles between themselves so what kind

00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,080
of metadata we're talking about we're

00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:36,270
talking about classical named entity

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,850
extraction this is a text book named

00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:42,000
entity extraction problem it's I think

00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:44,190
rarely in my experience it's rare to see

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,170
projects where people actually do want

00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:47,970
to extract person locations and

00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:50,750
organizations when you have enterprise

00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:52,980
data this is rarely what enterprise

00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:54,690
customers want to extract but in the

00:02:52,980 --> 00:03:00,300
case of a newspaper this is actually

00:02:54,690 --> 00:03:02,810
interesting of course we beside

00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:05,640
extracting entities we also extract

00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:07,800
other statistic statistically relevant

00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:11,430
keywords which are not necessarily

00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:15,120
entities and we do text classification

00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:17,820
because we had to classify the old

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:21,989
articles into the new editorial sections

00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:25,920
that they have and at the website of

00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:28,430
side you can browse the keyword archive

00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:31,320
you can click on the keywords that

00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:32,760
desire that exists and you will get a

00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:35,730
list of all the articles ever written

00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:40,110
that mentioned this keyword or person or

00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:42,810
location etc and the guys at site and

00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:45,900
they have opened this content there's an

00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:49,650
API for accessing this this archive

00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:54,390
which is pretty cool this is a graph

00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:58,080
that you can hardly see I guess but it's

00:03:54,390 --> 00:04:01,380
a graph of the 250 most mentioned people

00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,989
in the year of 2012 and it's not only

00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:06,269
it's a nice picture it's also a nice

00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:09,540
feedback tool for the editors themselves

00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:11,489
because they can in a picture see what

00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:14,870
they have been writing about in one year

00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:16,919
and where they might be missing on right

00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:21,630
and they actually do use it as a

00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:23,370
feedback tool so how does the the work

00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:27,479
how's the workflow in the editorial

00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:29,729
office the second step was of course

00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:33,690
after we tagged the whole archive and

00:04:29,729 --> 00:04:36,690
made it a searchable we they wanted us

00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:38,650
to integrate this tagging system into

00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:41,770
their workflow

00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:44,830
so the first thing that happens is an

00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:47,560
article comes about and a journalist

00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:49,419
writes an article we it's it got sent to

00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:52,900
this robot which we call tagging service

00:04:49,419 --> 00:04:55,479
and it attached tags to this document

00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:58,120
and the document ends up in the web page

00:04:55,479 --> 00:05:00,340
and in the archive and there's this link

00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:03,360
between the archive and the robot and

00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:05,770
this is an important part of this slide

00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,930
because this is the only knowledge that

00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:10,120
robot has of the world this is the only

00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:16,479
link only outside knowledge that this

00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:19,060
robot has and this is how the the web

00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,560
page or where the keywords are shown you

00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:22,210
see it's just a handful of them of

00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,030
course there are many more in this

00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:32,199
article but they're the user only gets

00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:35,530
to see a handful but of course is not as

00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:37,300
simple as I just explained and if people

00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:40,270
are going to see these keywords you

00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:41,680
cannot rely on a robot to to extract

00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:43,870
this content because site has a

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:47,919
reputation to lose they cannot just let

00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:53,470
the Machine and publish their content

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:56,590
without supervision and on the other

00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:58,599
hand you can't just forget about the

00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:01,900
machine and let the editors do that

00:05:58,599 --> 00:06:05,590
completely freely because everyone has

00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:08,500
their own ideas of what is the content

00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:12,010
what what are the tags of this article I

00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:14,740
just wrote and you want to have a bit of

00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:17,500
a homogeneous landscape of keywords you

00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:19,750
don't want em every article of this

00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,070
particular editor to have a particular

00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:26,229
set of keywords and the other editors

00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:28,659
use another set of keywords so the

00:06:26,229 --> 00:06:32,500
solution to this problem is to have a

00:06:28,659 --> 00:06:34,389
curated list of keywords and to let the

00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:39,970
editor pick a subset of the keywords

00:06:34,389 --> 00:06:42,220
that are suggested for each article of

00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:44,680
course curating this keyword list it is

00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:47,080
extremely expensive but it's not a thing

00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:50,370
that we can just forget and there's no

00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:53,639
other way to do this because and

00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:56,210
the risk is too high but going through a

00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:59,400
large list of keyword candidates is also

00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:02,010
something that is expensive I mean the

00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:04,229
journalist writes the article and then

00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:05,970
the job is done the journalist doesn't

00:07:04,229 --> 00:07:08,610
want to go through the list a huge list

00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:12,919
of keywords and decide which ones fit it

00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:16,260
just wants to get to the next job and

00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:20,639
it's the problem we we want to solve and

00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:23,789
we're trying to solve the last month so

00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:28,949
what's the feedback we got from the from

00:07:23,789 --> 00:07:32,580
the journalists um after a few after two

00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:35,430
years of the system running we had again

00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:39,150
a talk with them and they they like it

00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:41,699
actually quite a lot but they have of

00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:44,400
course with the usage of it they have

00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:46,620
come to gather feedback and one of the

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:49,020
important feedbacks we got was that on

00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:50,430
the website it's more important it's

00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:52,320
very important that the keywords are

00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:54,450
highly relevant while on the archive

00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:57,030
it's important that we have all keywords

00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:59,550
that are a little cure in an archive in

00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:03,840
an article because we want to be able to

00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:07,979
link all possible articles more concrete

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:10,590
feedback just as examples and it's

00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:14,190
important or they want rather to have

00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:16,800
generic keywords than specific ones like

00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:18,750
if you have Stuxnet and Stuxnet virus on

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,510
an article they want Stuxnet to be as a

00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:27,889
keyword and not stuck stacked Stuxnet

00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:31,199
virus and also one requirement was that

00:08:27,889 --> 00:08:34,830
it would be very important to them that

00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:36,510
if prison workers in an article NSA is

00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:39,479
also a keyword even if it doesn't occur

00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:43,890
in the article so this is a an expansion

00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:46,890
of keywords for that that we should do

00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:49,380
and they don't want to see also stop

00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:53,190
keywords angular miracle and I mean site

00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:55,680
is a serious newspaper they write a lot

00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:58,440
about politics and economics and Angela

00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,900
Merkel is is a curious and almost all

00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,450
articles they write so they don't want

00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:04,080
to have angular metal as an entity as a

00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:08,880
relevant

00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:11,370
word and all articles they have they

00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,850
also don't want keywords that are that

00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:18,240
are out of context so if there is a

00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:20,160
something that is mentioned just as a on

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,200
the side of the article some argument

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,300
that is being made but it's not actually

00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:28,830
the core of the article then this

00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:33,210
shouldn't appear as a keyword and then

00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:38,490
also they they they want that we

00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:41,970
consider trends as one kind of defining

00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:44,430
relevance so if at some point a guy

00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:46,470
named Edward Snowden is psychics coated

00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:48,840
a lot of times then he is probably

00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:52,860
important we should we should show him

00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:55,560
as an entity and on the archive of

00:09:52,860 --> 00:10:00,060
course on the on this side and they want

00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:02,100
to get everything and of course we

00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:03,540
shouldn't any changes we do to the

00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,340
system should not mean that the

00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:07,530
journalists have more work to do this is

00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:09,090
this is a hard requirement so if we

00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:11,130
think about the problem of expanding to

00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:13,650
similar keywords the first idea we had

00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:16,160
was just to use knowledge bases or

00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:18,260
cesare e and this is a no-go because

00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:22,170
they don't want to have an editor

00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:27,600
curating beside the whitelist also other

00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:29,520
resources so the idea is to solve the

00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,860
problem just like information retrieval

00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:34,560
systems have you provide a ranking and

00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:36,510
this is what we need because then you

00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:39,090
show just the first part of the ranking

00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:40,500
the first end keywords there the

00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:43,410
relevant ranked keywords that the

00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:47,460
journalist has to see and choose from

00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:48,720
and we still have all other keywords on

00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,830
the bottom of the list and we can't

00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,640
attach them to the document in the

00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:55,530
archive so that's what we we want to do

00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:58,350
but a problem the first problem that you

00:10:55,530 --> 00:11:01,200
are confronted with is to compare how do

00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:05,280
you compare at different kinds of

00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:07,740
keywords what's more important to have a

00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:10,260
person be mentioned three times or a

00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:12,120
statistical keyword with a score of 0.7

00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:14,310
whatever this means so it's hard to

00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:17,400
compare those stuffed so our idea was to

00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:22,720
compute tf-idf of the tags

00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:24,840
based on the archive so we simply

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,670
compute the document hit of each tag and

00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:31,360
we can rely on our linguistic analyzers

00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:33,820
to to find other forms of text that with

00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:36,730
that we discovered in the document for

00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:39,190
example in German you have this thing

00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:41,350
that them probably most of you know that

00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:44,230
you can compose words out of other words

00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:46,360
and in this case bundesrat rafts

00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:48,220
minister is this actually the same thing

00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:52,000
as bonus with Minister favorite soft and

00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:55,150
with our analyzers we can find both so

00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,760
this is um this isn't cool and nice and

00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:59,530
we use a losing similarity to compute

00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,150
the tf-idf of each of each sex so it's

00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:04,120
in this case it's a tag frequency

00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:07,390
inverse document frequency and once we

00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:13,000
have this we can sort we have a first

00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:16,630
scoring of the text but of course tf-idf

00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,790
might hurt context in this example here

00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:20,830
so it's a dummy example of course m

00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:22,930
ranch Tyga which is not a politician

00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:26,200
he's a football player member of the

00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:27,880
German national team he's probably out

00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:30,220
of context in this document because he

00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:35,980
occurs only once and and although all

00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:38,830
the other tags are politicians so but

00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:41,380
because site is focused more on politics

00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:46,690
he gets a high tf-idf because you cure

00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:48,610
is less in the rest of the archive ok so

00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:50,440
how do we fix that the idea is to

00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:52,300
compare the document we're processing

00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:55,150
with other documents that contain this

00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:59,800
tag so we compute the typical context of

00:12:55,150 --> 00:13:04,570
attack and it's these context is kind of

00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:06,940
a document and we compute the distance

00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:09,670
between the document we are processing

00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:13,810
at this point with the average document

00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:16,750
that contains this tag and it's it's a

00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:19,330
kind of a similarity actually the

00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:20,980
context what we are comparing is and we

00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:23,530
compare the tags that we extracted from

00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:27,970
a document with the average tags that

00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:29,710
cure with this in all documents that

00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:32,250
have a mention of this one particular

00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:32,250
tag

00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:38,380
so this allows us to detect that

00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:40,660
schweinsteiger in does not co-occur

00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:45,060
frequently with the other tags we found

00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:47,170
so we can either decrease his score or

00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:48,700
increase the score of the others because

00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:51,700
we detect that they are occurring in a

00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:54,880
typical context and again this context

00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:56,950
is also gathered from the archive that

00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:00,370
we have so there's no other outside

00:13:56,950 --> 00:14:03,760
knowledge and the nice thing about this

00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:05,950
thing this technique and is that we can

00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:08,230
use the same thing to expand to other

00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:10,210
texts so we just need the the text that

00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:13,210
we found in a document we search for all

00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:15,490
of them for for all co-worker often

00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:17,890
co-occurring tags with these other with

00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:21,520
these tags and we can just pick the

00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:24,610
first end that are not in our found text

00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:28,630
set and then we have new text that

00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:30,610
co-occur with this with these tags okay

00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:31,930
but what if in this case in this example

00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:34,060
in this dummy example what if

00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:36,150
Schweinsteiger is not there incidentally

00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:41,260
maybe it's World Cup time like we're

00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:44,260
getting there in our definition in this

00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:47,650
problem a trend is a measure of

00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:50,770
variation of hit counts in our m archive

00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:52,300
in our in a specific time stamp so we

00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:54,160
can compute those trends quite easily

00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:56,770
from the archive by counting the dif

00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:59,380
different it counts and we get something

00:14:56,770 --> 00:15:01,660
like this this is the trend for the

00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:04,930
keyword Schweinsteiger in the year 2010

00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:09,100
and as you might have noticed there's a

00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:12,160
huge bump here this is the world cup in

00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:14,500
south africa the Green Line I think can

00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:17,710
you see the green line it's the first

00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:20,410
one here it's almost here this is when

00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:23,080
balik the former german kappa captain

00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:24,280
was hurt and then there was a public

00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:26,020
discussion who should be the next

00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:28,420
captain and Schweinsteiger was one of

00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:31,300
the most prominent ones that should

00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:33,400
substitute him and here starts the here

00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:35,830
is the point when the world cup starts

00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:38,860
and here's when it ends and here's the

00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:44,230
last game of Germany so you see we can

00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:47,620
compute these things it's not not magic

00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:50,440
and having this trend we're able to

00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:53,290
include it also in our scoring so now we

00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:54,880
know maybe in this example that revenge

00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:56,620
to its world cup time and shrine

00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,180
schlager was quoted in a document okay

00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:00,400
with lots of politics may be there

00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:02,830
instrumental izing him and the world cup

00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:07,480
to do politics that's something you use

00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:11,050
very off you see very often and so this

00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:12,970
is what we get at the end we have these

00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:15,940
several scores there more of them these

00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:17,860
are just three I showed and we score

00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:21,250
each tag and then we have to somehow

00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:23,170
combine these scores and the combination

00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:25,210
is done by individually scaling them

00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:28,270
onto us the same interval so that we can

00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:30,580
actually compare them we then multiply

00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:33,240
them by a weight each one of them this

00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:36,010
is a configurable weight so that you can

00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:39,670
if you want you can buy us your score

00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:41,170
two towards one of these scores and then

00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:45,880
you sum up and scale again so that you

00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:47,680
have a a nice result and there is of

00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:50,310
course a lot to configure and there is

00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:53,590
no such thing as a perfect configuration

00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:55,450
because a every person you will ask will

00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:58,950
say did a different set of texts that

00:16:55,450 --> 00:17:01,630
should be attached to the article so and

00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:04,000
that's why we decided to give this

00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:06,190
problem to side and they have the power

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,500
to configure it so they can't complain

00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:15,880
if if it's if the ranking is not how

00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:19,420
they they expect so what was this

00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:23,530
summary and I think the important thing

00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:26,800
is that the requirements in such an

00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:29,020
editorial office are on a tagging system

00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:31,330
are really complex i think this also

00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:34,060
matches with what we heard in the first

00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:36,130
keynote on technology transfer that I

00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:38,680
mean when you hear in University about

00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:42,160
an entity extraction you never hear

00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:43,930
about stuff like this I mean that the

00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,560
customer would want to have a ranking of

00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:49,300
keywords I never heard of it before and

00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:53,470
so it's it's there's much more work to

00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:55,690
do then then what you you expect and and

00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:58,029
that there is this trade-off between

00:17:55,690 --> 00:18:00,090
relevance and completeness of texts

00:17:58,029 --> 00:18:02,409
this is I think intrinsic because I

00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:04,809
think for a thing to be relevant it has

00:18:02,409 --> 00:18:06,429
to be not complete and for a thing to be

00:18:04,809 --> 00:18:08,499
complete you have to include things that

00:18:06,429 --> 00:18:12,369
are not relevant this is quite obvious

00:18:08,499 --> 00:18:17,309
and you need both at least in this case

00:18:12,369 --> 00:18:21,519
and we can solve it by using ranking and

00:18:17,309 --> 00:18:24,129
I think the nicest thing is for all of

00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:29,169
this from all these endpoints and this

00:18:24,129 --> 00:18:31,210
is the thing that also justifies the the

00:18:29,169 --> 00:18:33,669
title of the presentation as being a

00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:37,029
high quality but low maintenance tagging

00:18:33,669 --> 00:18:39,399
system is that we don't use any outside

00:18:37,029 --> 00:18:43,289
resources we just use the archive that

00:18:39,399 --> 00:18:47,200
keeps growing and we use it in to

00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:48,879
bootstrap these cores and there's a lot

00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,529
you can do to enrich text only by

00:18:48,879 --> 00:18:57,659
looking at a representative set of

00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:57,659
documents okay let's that's it thank you

00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:08,480
okay I think we have time for maybe two

00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:14,390
questions two quick questions there's

00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:17,990
one I'm only here okay so you decide

00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:19,580
which one you want to ask them yeah so

00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:21,880
the first one is very simple how many

00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:25,730
keywords do you have how many keywords

00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:29,360
number of approved keywords oh this is a

00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:32,200
thing that this is on the part of site

00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:36,650
online and I would have to ask them but

00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:40,760
it's it's a lot it's a lot 100,000 yeah

00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:44,090
okay do you use the query log to inform

00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:46,850
your your rankings and what queries etc

00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:49,430
no there's there's no search in this in

00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:51,640
this ranking the ranking is just and

00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:55,160
that the journalist types an article and

00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:58,280
gets a suggestions a suggestion of terms

00:19:55,160 --> 00:20:02,210
that should be used as a metadata and

00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:04,940
this this term list this tag list is

00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:07,550
ranked on relevance but this relevance

00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:11,000
has little to do with with search

00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:12,950
relevance it's more of a semantic or

00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,190
contextual relevance there are lots of

00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:18,140
criteria i showed you three of them

00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:24,800
which define if the keyword is relevant

00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:27,050
or not okay hi I wanted to ask at some

00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:30,650
point you show that you in fact had the

00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:33,740
problem of finding correlations between

00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:36,440
tags like and so do you solved by

00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:39,830
analyzing the data and checking whether

00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:42,860
one keyword would be mentioned with

00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:45,890
other keyboard in mind documents no but

00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:50,060
I was wondering I mean sometimes you

00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:54,260
have this problem that one two keywords

00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:58,790
can come up in the same document when

00:20:54,260 --> 00:21:01,910
it's about oneness object and but

00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:04,580
instead a different combination like AP

00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:06,830
can be in this context but BLC can be on

00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:08,480
another context and yeah the problem is

00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:11,410
that in this kind of analysis you

00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:15,020
basically lose the context you just

00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:16,880
compute and trust some distances

00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:18,680
and yeah I didn't know I was wondering

00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,690
whether this was a problem in your case

00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:25,130
or if it's thought about this or

00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:26,810
anything no I'm I'm not sure I

00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:29,960
understand what what you mean I

00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:32,360
understand that you say that the words

00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:35,480
can be ambiguous I guess that's what you

00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:37,910
said that in one context if the word is

00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:40,160
occurs in cold here's with another one

00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:43,700
it means something and if it doesn't it

00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:47,780
means something else yeah and of course

00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:50,150
this is this is a problem but this works

00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:52,820
quite well actually and because you use

00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:55,100
we use this the one keyword to do a

00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:57,590
search on the archive and then we get a

00:21:55,100 --> 00:22:01,070
set of documents where this word occurs

00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:04,670
or similar forms of this word occurs and

00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:07,940
then we compute the average tags that

00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:11,570
are present in these documents so we

00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:14,780
have if you have a word like like Mars

00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:18,410
which is a chocolate bar and the planet

00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:19,760
and you will probably get all documents

00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:21,680
that have a chocolate bar and a planet

00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:25,760
so you won't be able to do to the

00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:29,570
distinguish both and unless unless we

00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:33,560
would use a more words or more tags from

00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:37,120
our document to to get the score but we

00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:39,620
try to keep things simple and it's I

00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:43,130
don't think that that this would make

00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:49,490
much difference but it's it's a nice

00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:53,710
input actually thank you okay look well

00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:53,710
again thank you very much okay

00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:58,190
