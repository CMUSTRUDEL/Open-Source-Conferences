Description: 
	***Unfortunately, because of technical difficulties we could only record 30 minutes of the keynote. But we would like to share a part of this great keynote with you anyway.***

The idea of devops has come a long way in the few years since its creation. While it started as a movement so small that only a few people had even heard of it, it has grown into something that can be found nearly everywhere in the tech industry, from any piece of software that involves configuration or automation to huge conferences and expos packed with more commercial vendor pitches than actual content. Some people have seen this and declared that devops has jumped the shark, that the term has been used for so many things that it no longer has any meaning. 

So where do we go from here? More than just teaching sysadmins how to write code or giving developers root access, devops was originally a movement that aimed to reduce friction between development and operations teams. By applying these principles and the lessons that have been learned to other organizational pain points, we can give new meaning to the term and use that to enable companies and teams to scale product development to the next level.

thank you good morning it's great to be

00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,640
here this morning in Berlin thank you

00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:10,710
very much for having me my name is

00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:14,910
katherine daniels and i'm going to talk

00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:16,619
to you today about how DevOps is dead to

00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,839
start out I'm going to give you a bit of

00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:21,239
background information about me so you

00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:25,289
kind of know who I am and where I'm

00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:27,269
coming from when I say this i started

00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:29,999
out playing with computers from a very

00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:32,640
young age i went to university to study

00:00:29,999 --> 00:00:34,739
computer science because somehow i was

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,480
still into computers after an ill-fated

00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:38,879
attempt to teach me see when I was about

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,730
five years old shockingly that didn't

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:44,070
work too well but here I am I thought I

00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:47,010
wanted to be a developer at that point

00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,899
and outside of running a couple media

00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:51,539
servers at home I didn't even know that

00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:56,309
operations was even a thing that you

00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:58,379
could do after that I did R&D for

00:00:56,309 --> 00:01:01,289
workstation graphics for hewlett-packard

00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:03,870
for a few years I got to do fun things

00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:06,030
like play with really expensive graphics

00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:08,250
cards and see monitors do things that

00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:10,560
they shouldn't actually be able to do I

00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:12,630
didn't get to play any Halo 3 but I did

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,580
get to play several other video games in

00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:18,000
the name of testing and debugging which

00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:21,090
was fun it was you know a big

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,040
corporation now DevOps wasn't even

00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:25,140
invented back then and even if it had

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,030
been a company like that there's too

00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:30,810
many different teams too many silos to

00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:32,640
really even count so after a few years

00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:34,500
of that I moved to New York and

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,450
accidentally became a system

00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:39,000
administrator you know how it goes

00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:42,030
you're working for a small start-up

00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,300
doing development QA kind of stuff and

00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:47,070
the one sysadmin quits and somebody had

00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:48,780
to keep the data center from burning to

00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:52,500
the ground and that somebody happened to

00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,930
be me so I did operations for a couple

00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:57,000
years at a couple different startups

00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:59,010
learned a lot had a lot of fun but at

00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,280
those places operations was very

00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:05,070
segregated it was kept separate from the

00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,570
rest of the company at one point my

00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:07,770
co-workers I think thought I quit

00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:09,179
because there were two months when I

00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:11,750
just went straight to the data center

00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:13,830
instead of ever coming into the office

00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:16,950
even at places that suppose

00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,630
we did DevOps the operations part of it

00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:20,520
was still kept separate from everything

00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:24,600
else and I really didn't like that too

00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:27,720
much I fed have spent a few months with

00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:29,550
the job title of devops engineer which

00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:32,670
the internet tells me has something to

00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:34,470
do with cats and computer hardware but

00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:36,390
for reasons that I'll get into later I

00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:39,170
didn't like that title very much so it

00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:42,420
didn't stick around for very long so

00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:45,030
currently I am an operations engineer at

00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:47,430
a company called game changer we do

00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:50,010
scoring statistics and community

00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:52,590
management for amateur sports primarily

00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:55,580
baseball and basketball we're about 30

00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:59,700
people headquartered in New York City

00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:01,500
it's also a very small shop but I'm not

00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:03,900
segregated away from them anymore I work

00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:06,209
very closely with the developers with

00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:08,340
all of the engineers and because we're

00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:12,209
entirely in AWS there isn't even a data

00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:16,110
center to banish me too so that's who I

00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:18,330
am kind of an operations background so

00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:20,940
why am i up here saying that DevOps is

00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:23,220
dead that's a pretty bold statement to

00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,810
make if dev ops were dead nobody would

00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:27,380
be talking about it nobody would have

00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:30,150
asked me to come here and talk about it

00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:31,680
so to explain what I mean by this I'm

00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:35,670
going to talk about something called the

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:38,040
hype cycle this was developed by the IT

00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:40,620
research firm gartner to describe how

00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:43,230
various technologies are adopted how

00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:45,390
they mature over time I'm going to be

00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:47,250
using a version of this that's a little

00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:51,720
more generalized but the same basic

00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:53,880
principles apply so the hype cycle for a

00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:57,450
technology or an idea starts with the

00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:59,190
trigger at this point an idea is usually

00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:01,860
just a potential breakthrough but it

00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:03,510
hasn't been proven yet for software or

00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:05,610
hardware this could mean that there's

00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:06,930
maybe only an alpha product but not

00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:09,440
something that you can really put into

00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:12,330
the hands of customers and have them use

00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:14,280
for an idea like the idea of DevOps

00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:18,090
somebody just thought of it and it's

00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:20,489
just starting to come to life so for

00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:24,930
DevOps this trigger was some time back

00:04:20,489 --> 00:04:27,600
in 2009 the first DevOps days event was

00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:29,640
held in belgium in i believe october

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,720
that year and this was the year that

00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:36,150
DevOps as a term was first coined at

00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,530
this point nobody had heard of it nobody

00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:39,930
had thought of it before and this really

00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:41,850
was the first conference of it of its

00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:46,110
kind that brought developers and

00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:49,440
operations together Patrick Dubois the

00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:51,780
organizer of DevOps days said in a blog

00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,360
post that he wrote after this first

00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:56,580
DevOps days event he said I'll be honest

00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,650
for the past few years when I went to

00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:00,450
some of the agile conferences it felt

00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:03,120
kind of like preaching in the desert I

00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:05,400
was kind of giving up maybe the idea was

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,280
to crazy developers and offs working

00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:11,220
together but now oh boy the fire is

00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:15,060
really spreading and back then it really

00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:17,010
was kind of a crazy idea back then this

00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:19,890
was not just an internet meme it was

00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:22,940
kind of the way things were developers

00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:25,950
saw sis admin's as stuck in their ways

00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:27,810
you know grouchy curmudgeonly the

00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:29,790
so-called bastard operators from Hell

00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:31,470
that hated change would never let anyone

00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:34,590
get anything done or touch their

00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:36,710
precious servers sis admin's saw

00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:39,810
developers as reckless and irresponsible

00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:42,000
people who would write code and probably

00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:43,500
not bother to test it before throwing it

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,810
over the wall putting it in production

00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:49,860
and making the ops people figure out how

00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:52,590
to run it and maintain it so what was

00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:57,420
this newfangled DevOps idea and how

00:05:52,590 --> 00:06:00,180
could it help patrick said to tackle the

00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:03,570
problem DevOps encourages cross cycle

00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:07,050
collaboration constantly not only when

00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:09,540
things fail I'm sure most of us are

00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:11,220
familiar with these stories of failure

00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:13,460
when something goes catastrophic Lee

00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:15,570
wrong and that's the only time that

00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:17,490
developers and sisson mins are brought

00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:19,050
into a room together but it's not

00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:21,900
exactly the fun kind of working together

00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:23,130
it's people pointing fingers and yelling

00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,930
and throwing each other under the

00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:27,120
metaphorical bus trying to figure out

00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:28,800
what went wrong so why would these

00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:33,900
groups of people even want to work

00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:36,240
together Jess humble said a fundamental

00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:39,540
assumption of DevOps is that achieving

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,320
both frequent reliable deployments and a

00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:44,620
stable production environment is not

00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:46,300
zero-sum game and this was I believe one

00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:49,840
of the keys to understanding the

00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:51,850
movement and how popular it was in the

00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,880
old way of thinking about things it was

00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:57,820
a zero-sum game if the developers one it

00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,620
meant that the Sisson mins lost if the

00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:01,630
developers got there are frequent

00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:04,810
reliable deployments getting their code

00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:06,580
out quickly into production it meant

00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:08,290
that the servers were probably going to

00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:09,700
catch on fire because they didn't the

00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:10,870
developers didn't bother to test their

00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,780
code and everything was going to go

00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:15,250
wrong and it was going to be terrible

00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:16,780
from the other side of things the

00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:18,700
sysadmin thought that if if they got

00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:20,350
stability that meant that things

00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:22,300
couldn't change that things had to

00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:25,390
remain just the way they were just right

00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:29,250
don't look at the server's wrong so it's

00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:29,250
easy to see why this idea was so popular

00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:36,250
next in the hype cycle is the peak of

00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:37,900
inflated expectations at this point

00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:40,960
there have been quite a few success

00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:43,210
stories about a technology may be a few

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,790
failures but not ones that have really

00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:50,230
deterred people from from thinking about

00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:53,170
this or trying to try it as these

00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:55,570
stories make their way around some

00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:57,100
companies will take action and decide

00:07:55,570 --> 00:08:00,520
that they should do DevOps themselves

00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:02,800
but others don't as one would expect big

00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:05,350
corporations tend to be a little slower

00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,840
more hesitant to implement a change like

00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:12,160
this then smaller companies and

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:14,350
especially startups I'm not sure exactly

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,420
where it started but sometime on the

00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:19,570
Internet the idea came around that we

00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:24,820
had hit peak DevOps this was sometime in

00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:26,290
late 2013 probably early 2014 by this

00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:29,980
point it had been a few years since

00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:31,600
DevOps was invented everyone knows what

00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:35,380
it's about we've all heard the word

00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:37,570
before there have been over 30 just

00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:39,910
DevOps days conferences all over the

00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:42,430
world and bigger conferences are

00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:45,130
starting to add DevOps tracks like the

00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:46,810
web operations conference velocity or

00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:49,180
the large installation system

00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:52,030
administration conference Lisa everyone

00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:54,190
is starting to talk about DevOps we've

00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:55,150
all heard the successes of well-known

00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:57,040
places

00:08:55,150 --> 00:09:00,610
like Etsy that really got DevOps right

00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:04,300
and stories of people who tried to do

00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:06,460
DevOps and failed but it's still you

00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:08,530
know we've hit peak DevOps everyone is

00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:10,120
talking about it and people are still

00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:11,710
really think that this is a great idea

00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:15,610
and it's going to be the answer to

00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:18,640
everything DevOps related jobs are

00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:21,040
everywhere if you search for DevOps on

00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:24,640
any major job board you'll find hundreds

00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,930
of postings if you have DevOps on your

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,820
resume or LinkedIn you'll have

00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:31,090
recruiters contacting you weekly if not

00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:33,430
daily part of the reason that i took

00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:35,740
devops off of my job title was to cut

00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:38,680
down on recruiter spam is kind of an

00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:40,600
experiment cut by about 90% the number

00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:43,630
of recruiters just contact me out of

00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:45,490
blue saying let's talk about DevOps you

00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:48,670
can be a devops engineer or a DevOps

00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:50,590
lead you can even be a sparkly DevOps

00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:52,630
princess I mean if people are getting

00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:55,360
tiaras you know that this is kind of a

00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:59,620
big deal or maybe that people have

00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:01,660
stopped taking it so seriously and that

00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,980
leads us down into the next part of the

00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:06,910
hype cycle which is the trough of

00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:09,820
disillusionment at this point enough of

00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:12,760
people have tried to do the DevOps and

00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:14,800
failed that it's it's lost its kind of

00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:16,330
magic appeal where people think that it

00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,090
is going to be the answer to everything

00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:21,490
and these failures might come for

00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:23,800
different reasons maybe it was an

00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:26,050
environment that was you know just too

00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:28,540
big to change quickly enough and people

00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:30,400
you know gave up or maybe they just

00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:33,370
didn't understand what it was that they

00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:34,900
were trying to accomplish some people

00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:37,930
are just tired of hearing the word

00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:40,630
DevOps used or misused and decided

00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:42,220
they've had enough the community at

00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:44,800
large was kind of feeling this way as

00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:47,890
well especially among people who had

00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,780
seen it since 2009 seen it from the

00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:52,330
beginning who had followed along with

00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:53,950
its growth for all of these years and it

00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:56,290
was something that grew very very

00:10:53,950 --> 00:11:00,460
rapidly from that one little conference

00:10:56,290 --> 00:11:02,380
in Belgium into a global movement you

00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:03,760
know the hipsters who were doing DevOps

00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:07,120
before it was cool they were kind of

00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:08,450
over it already and so people started

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,780
writing blog posts I

00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:14,870
giving talks about this stuff like you

00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:19,250
are not a dev up there is no such thing

00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:22,250
as a dev ops team or even dev ops in

00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:24,340
your job title is doing you harm and the

00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:26,630
numbers on these slides I have linked to

00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:28,040
the various materials that I've

00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:30,050
referenced here they're all very good

00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,340
talks very good blog posts I'd they'll

00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:32,600
be at the end of my slides which i'll

00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:36,500
post later so i'd really recommend

00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:39,380
reading them DevOps in your job title is

00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:42,650
doing you harm part of the reason that i

00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:44,510
took devops engineer off of my resume

00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:48,740
and off of my linkedin was because i was

00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:50,540
tired of the recruiter span also a title

00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:52,430
like devops it makes it sounds like

00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:55,280
you're the sole owner of something that

00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:57,530
should be owned by everyone when my

00:11:55,280 --> 00:12:00,050
twitter says sparkly devops princess

00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:01,760
it's because it's more to make fun of

00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:03,980
people who think that DevOps is just

00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:08,210
this magical fairy dust that you can

00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:10,010
sprinkle on things puppet labs put

00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:11,510
together a great blog post highlighting

00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:15,580
some of what they thought were the best

00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:18,500
or perhaps worse uses of the term DevOps

00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:21,170
like the VP of DevOps will be

00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:24,170
responsible for everything DevOps

00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:27,920
related like creating silos we're having

00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:30,350
some good buck-passing skills we only

00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,900
use this in DevOps we use a different

00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:36,110
tool in production because apparently

00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:38,300
DevOps is not an idea it's some

00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:39,830
environment like staging or testing

00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,660
that's totally separate from production

00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:46,150
because you know that makes a lot of

00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:49,190
sense so when I say that DevOps is dead

00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:50,920
what I really mean is that DevOps is in

00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:53,900
this trough of disillusionment right now

00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:56,750
I'm sick of hearing about it so are a

00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:59,330
lot of other people it's become a term

00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:01,250
that has been misused or used in so many

00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:06,260
different ways that it started to become

00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:09,680
meaningless it could be configuration

00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:12,890
management release management agile the

00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:17,810
cloud its web scale it it could mean

00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:19,580
anything you keep using that word I do

00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:21,279
not think it means what you think it

00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:25,130
means

00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:26,930
so what's next the slope of

00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:28,790
enlightenment is the part of the hype

00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:32,300
cycle when it becomes more widely

00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:33,800
understood how a technology or idea can

00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:39,279
benefit the people are the companies

00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:41,690
that are trying to adopt it so

00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:44,270
developers and operations people working

00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:46,130
together what else is there to really

00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:50,510
understand it's not that complicated

00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:52,670
right I would argue that when we're

00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:54,620
talking about DevOps what we're really

00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:58,940
talking about or what we should be

00:13:54,620 --> 00:14:02,060
talking about is empathy empathy is the

00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:04,370
capacity to recognize to understand and

00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:07,970
to share another person's feelings and

00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:10,790
experiences empathy allows a developer

00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:13,400
to understand why stability is important

00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:14,870
to assisted men why it matters to them

00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:18,050
that the site doesn't go down all the

00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:20,120
time an empathy allows that sysadmin to

00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:21,320
realize why being able to deploy the

00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:24,170
code that they've been working on is

00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:28,730
important to the developer empathy is

00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:31,010
what allows people to work together Jeff

00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:32,630
Cessna actually wrote an excellent blog

00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:35,150
post about this a few months ago that

00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:37,220
speaks directly to this and if there's

00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:38,600
one thing that I've linked in these

00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:42,500
slides that you should read it would be

00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:44,930
this one blog post on empathy he wrote

00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:48,020
that empathy allows software makers and

00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:49,670
operators to help each other deliver the

00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:52,190
best possible functionality and

00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:55,850
operability on behalf of their customers

00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:57,589
and I think that phrase on behalf of

00:14:55,850 --> 00:15:00,589
their customers is what's really

00:14:57,589 --> 00:15:02,330
important here because after all aren't

00:15:00,589 --> 00:15:06,230
our customers the people that were

00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:09,050
ultimately thinking about he also said

00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:11,780
you can't design anything truly useful

00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:15,470
unless you understand the people for

00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:18,279
whom you're designing this takes empathy

00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:20,870
one step further outside of the company

00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:22,520
to the people that the company is trying

00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:26,000
to help with their products or their

00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:27,830
service I mean how many products have

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,990
flopped how many startups have failed

00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:31,820
because somebody had an idea that they

00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:33,620
thought was good but they didn't

00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:34,449
understand the problem they didn't

00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:36,579
understand their

00:15:34,449 --> 00:15:41,079
target audience well enough to make it

00:15:36,579 --> 00:15:43,029
actually succeed at game-changer our

00:15:41,079 --> 00:15:45,850
target audience is the people involved

00:15:43,029 --> 00:15:48,699
in amateur sports it means the players

00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:51,249
the coaches and score keepers and their

00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:53,559
friends and family who are care about

00:15:51,249 --> 00:15:56,439
the results of their games we have

00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:58,720
everyone at the company talk to meet

00:15:56,439 --> 00:16:01,059
interact with our customers on a regular

00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:04,389
basis so that even those of us who don't

00:16:01,059 --> 00:16:05,949
have a sports background understand what

00:16:04,389 --> 00:16:08,649
it is that we're trying to do and the

00:16:05,949 --> 00:16:11,139
people that we're trying to help I'm not

00:16:08,649 --> 00:16:12,970
really a sports person myself I don't

00:16:11,139 --> 00:16:15,160
really understand the ins and outs of

00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:16,779
baseball statistics it turns out there's

00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:20,529
a lot of them and some of them are very

00:16:16,779 --> 00:16:23,139
complicated but I do understand why it's

00:16:20,529 --> 00:16:24,699
helpful for a coach to have stats

00:16:23,139 --> 00:16:26,589
generated automatically instead of

00:16:24,699 --> 00:16:29,919
having to spend hours after every game

00:16:26,589 --> 00:16:31,660
doing it by hand and I understand what

00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:33,939
it means for a grandfather to be able to

00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:35,769
follow along with his grandsons Little

00:16:33,939 --> 00:16:37,329
League baseball games when he's stuck in

00:16:35,769 --> 00:16:42,249
the hospital and can't make it to the

00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:44,319
games himself on the front wall of our

00:16:42,249 --> 00:16:48,369
office we have a poster with our company

00:16:44,319 --> 00:16:50,829
values a lot of time and thought and

00:16:48,369 --> 00:16:52,869
effort was put in to creating these

00:16:50,829 --> 00:16:55,299
values to making sure that they reflect

00:16:52,869 --> 00:16:59,139
what we want them to reflect and the

00:16:55,299 --> 00:17:01,959
first one is customer first it says

00:16:59,139 --> 00:17:05,939
listen be empathetic stop and ask

00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:08,919
yourself will this help our customer or

00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:11,919
CEO said to us after he put this poster

00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:14,019
on the wall I've never believed that

00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:16,839
words printed on a wall will create a

00:17:14,019 --> 00:17:19,269
strong culture in Shore business success

00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:22,839
or win a championship for that matter

00:17:19,269 --> 00:17:24,730
and these words are no exception but I

00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:27,189
do hope that they can be a subtle

00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:29,470
reminder of the principles that we hope

00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:31,389
will be the foundation of a company that

00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:33,789
makes a positive difference in all of

00:17:31,389 --> 00:17:38,070
our lives and the lives of our customers

00:17:33,789 --> 00:17:38,070
and that's what empathy is about

00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:47,190
it's really about culture we talk about

00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:51,009
tools a lot when we talk about DevOps

00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:53,409
but the best automation configuration

00:17:51,009 --> 00:17:55,179
management release management you know

00:17:53,409 --> 00:17:57,130
the fancy new text editor that you have

00:17:55,179 --> 00:17:59,590
to have some beta invite for because vim

00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:03,460
wasn't good enough these tools cannot

00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:06,519
fix a broken culture it doesn't matter

00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:08,919
how many shiny new features your latest

00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:11,740
office chat program has if people don't

00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:13,690
actually use it tools can't make people

00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:16,899
talk to each other it can't they can't

00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:19,899
make them listen to each other this can

00:18:16,899 --> 00:18:21,789
work in a good way or a bad way we'd

00:18:19,899 --> 00:18:23,440
probably all agree that project

00:18:21,789 --> 00:18:26,169
management and bug tracking or good

00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:28,360
things but if every single team at your

00:18:26,169 --> 00:18:30,460
company is using different bug tracking

00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:33,399
software how much collaboration is

00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:37,029
really actually going to go on if every

00:18:33,399 --> 00:18:39,730
tool is different tools can reinforce

00:18:37,029 --> 00:18:41,769
trust and empathy between teams or they

00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:44,799
can be used to kind of demonstrate their

00:18:41,769 --> 00:18:47,289
absence I've been on teams where the

00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:50,080
developer said well we don't want the QA

00:18:47,289 --> 00:18:52,029
team to have write access to our JIRA

00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,860
because then they'll just add bugs and

00:18:52,029 --> 00:18:55,960
that'll be more work for us and we don't

00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:58,090
want them to tell us about bugs because

00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:00,669
you know our software is infallible you

00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:02,289
know you're lucky to use it I've had

00:19:00,669 --> 00:19:05,679
teams that didn't even want other teams

00:19:02,289 --> 00:19:09,549
to have read access to their to their

00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:11,110
JIRA to their Trello because I don't

00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:12,820
even understand the logic for that they

00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:14,860
were so paranoid about other people

00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:16,929
knowing what they were doing for

00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:20,500
whatever reasons that was a culture

00:19:16,929 --> 00:19:21,970
without trust without empathy and even

00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:26,279
though they called themselves DevOps

00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:26,279
there was not a lot of DevOps ingo

00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:33,909
adopts how do you know if you're

00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:36,370
actually doing it right for software

00:19:33,909 --> 00:19:38,409
development joel's polski invented the

00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:40,750
joel test you know 12 questions so

00:19:38,409 --> 00:19:42,820
software developers can you know figure

00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:44,409
out how good how productive the

00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:46,210
environment is that they're working in

00:19:44,409 --> 00:19:49,360
or going to be working and if they're

00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:51,760
looking for a new job Tom Lehman Shelly

00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:54,070
put together the operations report card

00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,820
kind of a similar idea for a system

00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:57,669
administrator

00:19:54,820 --> 00:20:01,090
is to gauge how well they were doing in

00:19:57,669 --> 00:20:02,679
terms of operational best practices so

00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:05,200
maybe somebody needs to put something

00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:07,870
together that's similar for DevOps like

00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:12,100
a few key questions to gauge how

00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:13,899
empathetic your company culture is I'm

00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:16,000
not sure exactly what those questions

00:20:13,899 --> 00:20:18,639
should be there probably a little more

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,429
complicated than how many pull requests

00:20:18,639 --> 00:20:24,100
or how many deploys you have per day but

00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:26,860
maybe ask questions like who is involved

00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:29,080
with planning does planning consist of

00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:30,940
just a few executives sitting in a room

00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:33,250
closed off and they make decisions that

00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:37,419
just come down from on high to everyone

00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:39,129
else are where are the different product

00:20:37,419 --> 00:20:40,720
teams the people to interact with the

00:20:39,129 --> 00:20:43,539
customers are they the ones that are

00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,399
helping to plan things as well how much

00:20:43,539 --> 00:20:47,289
time is spent interacting with the

00:20:45,399 --> 00:20:50,830
customers do you even talk to the people

00:20:47,289 --> 00:20:52,480
who are using your product so I don't

00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:54,309
know all of the questions that we should

00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,889
be asking but maybe there's some benefit

00:20:54,309 --> 00:21:01,450
to be gained from figuring out what

00:20:56,889 --> 00:21:04,840
those questions are bringing it back to

00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:07,899
empathy empathy allows you to view teams

00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:11,620
other teams as enable errs rather than

00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:14,919
blockers in the old view of things other

00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:16,960
teams were very adversarial and if you

00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:19,870
haven't read this book I would recommend

00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:22,299
Jean Kim's book the Phoenix project it's

00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:24,730
a very good story of a company that

00:21:22,299 --> 00:21:26,500
started out in this kind of owe the

00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:31,360
devastate the ops and the ops hate the

00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:34,120
dev kind of view of things when things

00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:36,549
are bad teams view each other as trying

00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:39,759
to get in each other's way as if the Ops

00:21:36,549 --> 00:21:41,679
teams goal is not to like operate the

00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:43,750
site or anything but simply to keep the

00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:47,830
developers from doing their job which

00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:50,679
obviously isn't the case if you view the

00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:53,169
other teams as enable errs you're asking

00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:56,230
how can we work together to accomplish

00:21:53,169 --> 00:21:58,779
what we're trying to operations isn't

00:21:56,230 --> 00:22:00,250
trying to block forward progress they're

00:21:58,779 --> 00:22:04,269
just trying to make sure that the

00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:06,070
platform that the site is deployed on is

00:22:04,269 --> 00:22:08,740
stable so that the customers can

00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:10,929
actually enjoy it reliably

00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:16,000
it doesn't matter how many shiny new

00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:18,130
features you have if the site's down so

00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:23,290
the last phase in the hype cycle is the

00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:25,990
plateau of productivity this is when an

00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:28,270
idea starts to really take off when its

00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:31,090
applicability and relevance are really

00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:33,820
clearly understood we started out with

00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:36,100
the peak of inflated expectations where

00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:37,840
this new idea was magical where it was

00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:41,290
going to solve all of our problems and

00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:43,150
then we realized that it wasn't magic

00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:44,679
that we'd have to actually you know put

00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:48,220
some work into this instead of just

00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:51,190
sprinkling fairy dust on it now we need

00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:53,020
to figure out what we can actually do to

00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:55,630
make this work when we can take this

00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:57,730
idea that we've seen that it started to

00:22:55,630 --> 00:23:01,750
mature and use it to really make things

00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:04,080
better so we know what we want is a

00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:07,480
culture of empathy and understanding

00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:10,270
what productive steps can we take to get

00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:13,090
towards that kind of culture it's not

00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:16,150
enough to just talk about it talk

00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:18,760
without any meaningful action doesn't do

00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:21,010
anything that's the kind of places who

00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:22,660
decide to rename one of their teams

00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:25,090
doesn't really matter which one they

00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:26,380
rename that team the dev ops team they

00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:28,809
call it good and then six months later

00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:35,260
they're like why did nothing actually

00:23:28,809 --> 00:23:40,030
change so what can we do what we can do

00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:43,030
is stop creating dev ops teams DevOps is

00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:45,160
about culture and for that reason it

00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:48,160
doesn't make sense to have any one team

00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:52,150
especially any one person be responsible

00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:55,870
for it one person on their own even the

00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:57,340
CEO even the vice principal of DevOps

00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:59,679
whatever you're going to call them

00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:02,770
cannot change an entire company's

00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:05,230
culture they can help they can lead by

00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:08,950
example but they cannot force people to

00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:11,140
change cultural changes have to be a

00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:13,390
collective effort they need to have

00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:16,360
buy-in throughout an entire organization

00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:19,540
if they're to succeed it can't be just

00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:21,730
one team if we're talking about DevOps

00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:22,630
is the idea of development and

00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:24,970
operations

00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:27,280
working together it doesn't make sense

00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:28,900
to have just one team that's responsible

00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:33,160
for working together I mean shouldn't

00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:35,500
all of your teams be doing that DevOps

00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:37,420
is about tearing down the functional

00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:39,580
silos that we had in the past and

00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:41,920
replacing them with trusting and

00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:44,920
empathetic relationships between teams

00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:46,930
and it's important to remember that

00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:49,690
there's more silos that an organization

00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:53,890
can have than just development and

00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:57,550
operations any team can become a silo in

00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:59,670
the wrong environment we talked about

00:24:57,550 --> 00:25:02,650
tools tools can be used either enhance

00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:05,680
silos or to prevent them it's about

00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:10,330
adding or removing visibility between

00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:12,340
teams if operations has visibility into

00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:14,380
what development is doing they know what

00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:16,320
features it is that they need to be

00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:19,420
running that they need to be supporting

00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:21,850
I've been in a position where as an

00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:23,440
operations engineer something went down

00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:25,480
and somebody came and yelled at me about

00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,550
and they said why is that mobile site

00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:29,920
down and I said what mobile site because

00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:31,690
nobody had told the operations team that

00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:33,420
there even was a mobile site that we

00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:35,920
were supposed to be monitoring

00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:38,860
visibility between teams can prevent

00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:41,770
that sort of catastrophic lack of

00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:44,560
communication this can be especially

00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:47,290
true when you add teams like sales and

00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:49,840
marketing into the mix it's important

00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:52,300
that they understand what it is that the

00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:54,550
developers are working on it's important

00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:57,370
for the operations team to give them

00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:59,860
visibility so that the ops team can say

00:25:57,370 --> 00:26:02,020
oh hey heads up you know we're having a

00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:04,210
problem with this one feature so that's

00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:08,980
not a surprise when customers might ask

00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:11,470
about it the DevOps movement started in

00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:13,570
large part to try and solve the problems

00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:15,700
in dysfunctions that came from having

00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:21,820
isolated functional silos within an

00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:23,950
organization functional silos make it

00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:26,470
easier to pass responsibility out of

00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:29,470
them onto another silo on to another

00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:33,300
team than it is to encourage people to

00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:33,300
take responsibility for themselves

00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:37,540
taking responsibility instead of

00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:39,250
culture of just passing the buck someone

00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:42,850
else can take a lot of different forms

00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:46,150
depending on your product your culture

00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:47,620
the size of your organization but as a

00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:50,670
first step consider something like

00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:53,980
simply putting the developers on call

00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:55,750
not necessarily for everything but for

00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:57,550
the parts of the site or the app or

00:26:55,750 --> 00:27:00,190
whatever that they are working on that

00:26:57,550 --> 00:27:02,380
they are developing we did that a game

00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:04,330
changer and after a couple weeks of

00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:07,390
being on call the developers really

00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:08,920
understand why unreliable software that

00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:13,810
wakes you up at four in the morning is a

00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:16,180
bad thing to have it increases their

00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:18,550
visibility their understanding of what

00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:21,280
it means to actually run software in

00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:22,780
production it's easy to say sometimes oh

00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:24,910
well you know i'll just write the code

00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:28,270
done with it now it's not my problem

00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:30,760
anymore but when when it is your problem

00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:32,500
you want to make it better you care

00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:34,330
about quality more when it's waking you

00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:38,520
up at four in the morning instead of

00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:41,950
somebody else have developers and QA

00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:43,480
work in the same environment from when

00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:46,840
they're developing that you have in

00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:49,660
production seems like common sense but

00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:52,750
I've seen too many places say oh they

00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:54,430
can write the code on a macbook even

00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:55,840
though we're you know running on Linux

00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:58,090
in production you're not you don't have

00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:01,870
your MacBooks in the data center you

00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:06,070
need to make sure that responsibility is

00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:08,830
taken so that these environments are the

00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:11,400
same thing so that you know that it's

00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:14,230
going to be the same environment and

00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:16,390
when the developers inevitably do get

00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:18,130
paged or the ops team you know whoever

00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:20,440
is getting paged but preferably both

00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:22,120
functional team we switch to cross

00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:24,430
functional teams just a couple months

00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:26,950
ago and the reason for doing that was

00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:29,380
that it increased the idea of

00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:32,320
responsibility for something so we have

00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:34,780
a team that lasts you know between three

00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:37,330
weeks and about three or four months for

00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:40,240
a specific project for specific feature

00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:43,150
and so at this point it's really easy to

00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:46,270
say you're done being responsible when

00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:48,450
the feature works in production whereas

00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:50,020
with with silos with non

00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:52,450
cross-functional teams

00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:54,310
it was it was kind of harder to say okay

00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:56,080
when's the line when it's done because

00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:58,150
okay the developers finished writing the

00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:01,060
code is that done well if it doesn't

00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:03,190
work in production it's not done so with

00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:07,380
cross-functional teams the idea of done

00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:07,380
becomes a little easier to define I

00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:14,080
thanks for a very nice time was very

00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:16,510
inspiring so I'm an assistant professor

00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:19,480
so I'm up from an academic background

00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:22,420
and my question for you will be going

00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:25,270
back to the education what what do you

00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:28,000
think dear all for the application could

00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:31,030
do with respect to this changing the

00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,700
culture and what could be done with

00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:35,470
respect to perhaps improving the skills

00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:37,180
for system administration that perhaps

00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:39,610
are not part of the curriculum in most

00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:44,680
of the computer science universities

00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:46,090
yeah um I'm not sure about education in

00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:48,220
terms of you know what could we do with

00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:49,690
a four-year degree or you know even a

00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:51,970
two-year degree that would be a lot

00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:54,400
harder to change there are a couple

00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:57,460
things that one that comes to mind is

00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:59,650
called ops school which is a wiki that a

00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:02,830
bunch of people in the Operations

00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:05,560
community has but together with the idea

00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:08,920
of teaching operators system

00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:11,740
administrators a variety of the skills

00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:14,710
that they need the other thing that I

00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:16,630
really like for kind of teaching new

00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:18,220
system administrators is just grabbing

00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:19,720
you know someone who's really junior

00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:21,880
someone who's fresh out of college they

00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:24,250
might have a CS degree they might not

00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:27,340
but the key is to you know get them

00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:29,470
interested in operations cuz I mean I

00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:31,000
don't know apparently I'm one of the few

00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:32,980
people who really likes you know Oh

00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,170
figuring out why the server doesn't work

00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:38,110
but you know it's it's kind of fun I

00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:39,700
describe it like Legos for adults you

00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:41,560
get to play with the server and put all

00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:43,270
the different pieces together and if you

00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:45,070
do it right you get you know something

00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:47,020
functional at the end so finding

00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:49,330
somebody with that kind of drive and

00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:51,580
just pairing with them you know working

00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:54,160
with them because i think you know

00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:57,340
academics like in terms of a degree it's

00:30:54,160 --> 00:31:00,550
you don't get so much of the required

00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:02,260
working with people i mean none of the

00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:03,430
projects that i did in school even group

00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:05,050
projects really helped

00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:07,870
me that much it was actually getting to

00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:11,220
work on you know a product that went

00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:14,920
into production that taught me more

00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:17,170
really really really great talk thank

00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:19,180
you one of the things you touched on

00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:21,010
that hit home with me is alerting

00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:22,840
fatigue and that's a major problem in my

00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:26,230
company and it makes sense that

00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:27,550
distributing the pager to more ppl makes

00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:30,210
everyone more aware but are there any

00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:33,280
other techniques that you or tricks for

00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:34,330
reducing that fatigue and adjusting the

00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:37,750
alerts is there any kind of group

00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:40,120
process that you use yeah one process

00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:44,070
that we have for reducing the alert

00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:46,600
fatigue was to pretty much get rid of

00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:48,190
all of the alerts because the alerts

00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:51,370
that we had they'd built up over time

00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:53,380
you know months and years of oh somebody

00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:56,650
decided that this was a necessary alert

00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:59,110
so what we actually did was just get rid

00:31:56,650 --> 00:32:01,030
of all of them bring back the ones that

00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:03,280
we knew that we needed like you know is

00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:05,920
the site down that's pretty obviously

00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:08,290
one and then just bring them back as

00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:12,190
needed because that way you figure out

00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:14,470
what you need to be alerting on now we

00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:17,860
also do the same thing with post mortems

00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:19,360
we say okay in addition to all the you

00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:21,640
know technical stuff what what went

00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:23,740
wrong how was our alerting on this did

00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:30,340
it alert us enough did it alert us too

00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:35,410
much and we'll adjust from there any

00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:37,330
more questions all right if people have

00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:40,360
questions later you can find me on the

00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:41,800
internet and I have you know everything

00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:43,630
here for further and even further

00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:47,520
reading i will post these slides later

00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:47,520
if people are interested thank

00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:50,470
you

00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,260
