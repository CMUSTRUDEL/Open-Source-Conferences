Description: 
	All the cool cats are using Redis, and with a reason: It's fast, it's robust, it's easy and it's web scale. Redis is powering sites like Twitter, Instagram or Pinterest, but you can also benefit from the power of redis even in a more modest project.

In this session I will talk about what is redis, what you can do with it, how other people are using it, and how we have used it at teowaki for a number of common use cases. 

I will talk about:
- intro; what REALLY FAST means, Redis data structures, in memory storage, persistence
- use cases: How Twitter, Pinterest or Viacom use Redis.
- famous failures: Instagram, twilio
- use cases: queuing slow operations, cross-language development, atomic counters and generating sequences, dealing with temporary data in your application, redis as a cache, Lua scripting for atomic operations
