Description: 
	Sirar Salih talking about "Not automating Tinder in the Cloud and the day I didn't break Tinder by accident".

It was a cold day in December of 2018, I was sitting with my developer friends at a local pub in Oslo. Inspired by our conversations, I got the idea to finally fix the "Tinder problem". We're all so tired of swiping, it's about time we automated this thing! Never did I imagine what I'd get myself into, the intrigues and the drama that would follow. 

Sure, investigating the Tinder API was easy enough. Sure, building an Azure Function and deploying it to the cloud to fully automate Tinder was not a big deal. But eventually getting my account locked by Facebook and finding a security threat in the OAuth 2.0 protocol?! The Tinder service coincidentally going down and seeing this event unfold all over the media?! Never did I imagine I'd have so much fun and learn so much along the way.
