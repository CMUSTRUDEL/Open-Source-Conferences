Description: 
	Sirar Salih talking about "Not automating Tinder in the Cloud and the day I didn't break Tinder by accident".

It was a cold day in December of 2018, I was sitting with my developer friends at a local pub in Oslo. Inspired by our conversations, I got the idea to finally fix the "Tinder problem". We're all so tired of swiping, it's about time we automated this thing! Never did I imagine what I'd get myself into, the intrigues and the drama that would follow. 

Sure, investigating the Tinder API was easy enough. Sure, building an Azure Function and deploying it to the cloud to fully automate Tinder was not a big deal. But eventually getting my account locked by Facebook and finding a security threat in the OAuth 2.0 protocol?! The Tinder service coincidentally going down and seeing this event unfold all over the media?! Never did I imagine I'd have so much fun and learn so much along the way.

well yeah all right so yeah so basically

00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:11,740
you know I'm a developer right and you

00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:14,770
know developers are curious people you

00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:16,420
know we're like we're an interesting you

00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:18,430
know type of people type of people

00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:20,680
basically we're curious we like to

00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:23,350
investigate we like to break things at

00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:25,180
least I like to break things maybe we

00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:27,850
don't mean as festive as it happens and

00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:30,790
we like to just you know to find out new

00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:33,610
things right so and you know you know

00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:36,280
we're living in this API age right we're

00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:40,300
pretty much every service out there has

00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:42,970
an open API right and tinder actually

00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:48,030
has an open API and that's quite

00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:49,180
interesting but just like kind of like a

00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:50,470
discretion

00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:54,550
you know before I do this talk is that

00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:56,920
I'm not promoting you know automating

00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:59,020
this in their service because it's not

00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:02,560
allowed you know it's actually not a lot

00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:06,310
so tinder is has very strict rules they

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:08,530
have Terms of Use which states what you

00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:11,920
can do when you use their service and

00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:14,500
what you cannot do and if we try to

00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,120
automate their service we are not using

00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:20,080
their app and then they get really angry

00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:21,940
right so so this is like an

00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,910
experience-based talk I'm gonna tell you

00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:26,470
what happened basically this year for me

00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:28,360
when I try to

00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:30,040
I was very curious and I did some things

00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,570
and then some stuff happened and then

00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:34,690
some drama happened and then you know

00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:38,110
the whole thing so I hope that that can

00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:39,790
kind of you know tell others tell other

00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:42,790
developers and other people out there

00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:44,110
that you know you know this is how it is

00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:47,230
if you want to work with tinder tinder

00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:49,060
API basically all right so that's why

00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:54,670
you see this is a kind of a like a

00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:57,040
sarcastic title all right so yeah all

00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:59,740

right so so today I'm gonna talk to you

00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:29,140
about a tinder story but it's not that

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:33,610
kind of story it's a different kind of

00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:35,470
story right okay so how many of you use

00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:37,120
tinder or our female is familiar with

00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:38,530
cinder and don't be shy you know it's

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,280
you know it's normal it's just a social

00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:45,430
app right okay so about 50 people 60

00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:48,790
people in the room so you know this

00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:51,720
whole story it started this place here

00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:55,840
that you see on the on the slide and

00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:59,860
this is a local pub in Oslo it's called

00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:02,530
the Oslo mechanical like also a

00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:04,180
mechanical recall Factory that's the

00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:06,310
name of the pub that's because it was a

00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:07,750
factory back in the old days and then

00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:09,400
they you know eventually they shot down

00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:13,030
the factory and then it became a pub and

00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:14,980
it's a famous pub in Oslo and I was

00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:17,320
there with a couple of my friends a

00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:20,440
couple of my developer friends back in

00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:22,810
December 2018 and you were having some

00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:25,270
some beer and we're just talking you

00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:28,870
know and we were talking about this

00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:30,880
tinder thing right so you know I'm gonna

00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:33,190
explain what tinder is all about for

00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,770
those that don't use the app but um

00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:37,539
you know when you stand er you get this

00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:39,370
you know suggestions of people you get

00:04:37,539 --> 00:04:39,970
pictures of people right in the app and

00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:42,190
then you have

00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:44,320
swipe right for saying yes that you like

00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:46,720
the person and then swipe left if you

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,810
say no we don't like the person and if

00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,490
two people swipe right that they like

00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:54,400
each other they will get a match and

00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:56,200
then they can start chatting so we were

00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,420
talking and thinking and then like you

00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:00,010
know why do we waste our time doing

00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:03,520
these swipes how about we just get

00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:04,810
instant matches right so so this is this

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,630
is like if you use the app a long time

00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:09,310
you will get you know really you know

00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:12,310
maybe will get frustrated like that I

00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:14,260
guess we got frustrated you know so so

00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:17,500
you know let's get instance matches and

00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:19,420
then we can just meet people you know so

00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:21,220
here's here's you can see this is how it

00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:23,080
works so basically when you get the

00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:25,060
match and then then you can get you know

00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:28,900
you can send a message or you can just

00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:31,630
keep swiping you know like to see others

00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:33,910
so so a couple of beers and then you

00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:35,920
know developers you know we got a little

00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:38,650
drunk we got very creative suddenly and

00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:41,800
then you know we're thinking okay how

00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:43,300
about just Auto swipe right right so if

00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,150
you just if you just swipe right all

00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:47,200
time if you just like everybody

00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:50,680
statistically you'll get a match all

00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:52,720
right it's simple mathematics so we do

00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:55,720
that and then we don't need to do this

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,130
wiping ourselves anymore and you know

00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:59,620
and then it just takes off from there

00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:01,990
you know we can we can write this thing

00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:03,490
we can distribute it in a cloud we can

00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:05,620
you know we can use the cloud and then

00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:07,090
we have a distributed data center doing

00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:09,400
swipes for us and we don't need to do

00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:11,230
anything we just sit there and then get

00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,990
the matches and then I can talk to the

00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:17,350
people so it's really interesting

00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:20,650
interesting you know problem to solve so

00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:23,260
a couple of beers at that local pub in

00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:25,300
Oslo and then you know I went home and

00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:26,890
then I started coding because I was born

00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:30,310
and that's what I do when I when I'm

00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:33,340
very very bored and a bit drunk so then

00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:35,260
so then so then actually I did this it I

00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:38,380
did it and it works so this is a

00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:40,540
screenshot showing you showing you the

00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:42,910
scripts that I wrote basically that

00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:44,890
talks to this in their API and then just

00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:47,830
does the swiping it does the you know

00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:49,229
like swiping right all the time and it's

00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:52,800
doing that

00:06:49,229 --> 00:06:56,039
very very frequently I believe this is

00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:59,639
doing this like you know 40 times a

00:06:56,039 --> 00:07:01,889
second or something so it's very fast so

00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:04,439
yes as you can see I had to of course I

00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:06,569
have to censor the names of the people

00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:09,120
because this is just you know the

00:07:06,569 --> 00:07:11,280
console showing you what the code is

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,930
doing basically so so I just I just

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,509
censored all the names of the people

00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:17,939
here to you know to protect their

00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:19,349
privacy but in any case you get only the

00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:20,219
first name in any case you know with

00:07:19,349 --> 00:07:22,560
tinder so

00:07:20,219 --> 00:07:25,530
tinder you know also works very hard to

00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,930
protect the privacy of people so and you

00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:30,150
as you can see you know I I got all like

00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:32,909
every data I wanted I got it from the

00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:37,379
API even I got some information that

00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:39,180
actually isn't in the app but after some

00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:42,449
conversations with tinder they assured

00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:44,879
me that you know this data is you know

00:07:42,449 --> 00:07:46,979
it's not so one of the things is that I

00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:49,139
I got actually the birthdate of people

00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:51,750
right from the from the from the cinder

00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:53,400
servers from the API and that thing that

00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:55,800
you don't get that in the app and this

00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:59,159
is you know this potentially this is a

00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:01,379
major breach of data protection you know

00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:03,479
protection protection laws but tinder

00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:06,930
told me that the actually the birth

00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:10,310
dates are fake all right

00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:12,810
they said to me that only the year is is

00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:14,819
is correct the year is correct but the

00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:18,029
rest of the you know the of the date

00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:19,680
time field is faked out and I believe

00:08:18,029 --> 00:08:23,069
them I completely believe them because

00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:25,259
because I noticed that I was getting

00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:26,909
matches and then and then I got I was

00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:28,710
you know the birth date of people was

00:08:26,909 --> 00:08:30,360
very close to each other you know so

00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:33,899
when I got a match in January for

00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:36,419
example I saw that the girls they had

00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:38,969
like their birthday like very close to

00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:40,649
each other so and sometimes got like

00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:42,750
matches the same day so everyone had the

00:08:40,649 --> 00:08:46,010
same like birthday on the same day and I

00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:49,290
was like what really is that true

00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:52,079
I'm like really that's a very you know

00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:53,699
coincidence in that case but on tinder

00:08:52,079 --> 00:08:58,770
said that you know this is just fake so

00:08:53,699 --> 00:09:00,420
okay so we believed them so yeah so you

00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:02,520
got a lot of data to work to play around

00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:04,410
with right from the API which I found

00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:06,839
really really cool as you can see in a

00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:10,730
slide here you'll see that you know also

00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:13,470
the location is printed out right so

00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:14,819
tinder works so that they use the

00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:18,569
location that you have on your phone

00:09:14,819 --> 00:09:22,079
right on your GPS and and so you don't

00:09:18,569 --> 00:09:24,660
need to think about the location like

00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:26,760
you know storing the location locally

00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:28,920
anywhere because the tinder tracks your

00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:31,800
phone they have your GPS they have your

00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:33,750
location and saved at their service so

00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,579
that means you can create apps you can

00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:37,470
do whatever you want and get your

00:09:35,579 --> 00:09:41,610
location from tinder based on your phone

00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:43,920
right right so basically this script of

00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:46,290
mine if it's running let's say it's just

00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:49,470
running in the clouds and then I I

00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:51,540
traveled to Germany then when I when I

00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:53,490
enter Germany is gonna swipe right on oh

00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:55,949
everyone like all the women in Germany

00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:58,350
and I go to to Paris it's gonna swipe

00:09:55,949 --> 00:10:00,300
right on hold on do all the woman in

00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:01,620
German in Paris right I don't need to do

00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,810
anything about the location it just

00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:05,640
works magically right so if you like

00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:07,800
jumping around in Europe is just swiping

00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:10,500
all the time but again this is not this

00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:13,890
is not legal what I'm doing here just so

00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:15,480
you know so but you know so you get the

00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:18,060
idea here it's pretty cool it's pretty

00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,649
cool actually actually a friend of mine

00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,910
when I did this friend of mine said you

00:10:19,649 --> 00:10:24,390
know you should create a heat map that

00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:26,790
would be really awesome you can see like

00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:29,089
you know where's the most matches and

00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:33,569
stuff like more visualized yeah

00:10:29,089 --> 00:10:36,360
interesting yeah okay so so I wrote this

00:10:33,569 --> 00:10:38,670
thing the script and then I you know I

00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,990
deployed it to Azure because I'm like an

00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:42,569
azure freak you know I work with

00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:46,829
Microsoft stuff so I put it in a sure

00:10:42,569 --> 00:10:48,390
and then it was distributed you know and

00:10:46,829 --> 00:10:50,220
then suddenly you know it started

00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:53,850
working so I was getting matches like a

00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:55,529
lot of matches without doing anything so

00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:57,329
pretty interesting so the hypothesis

00:10:55,529 --> 00:11:00,060
worked out right

00:10:57,329 --> 00:11:02,010
those crazy developer guys at the pub

00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:04,370
actually you know we were right about it

00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:06,089
we did it actually proved the point so

00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:07,980
statistically you'll get a lot of

00:11:06,089 --> 00:11:09,569
matches without having to do anything if

00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,949
you just wipe rights on everyone but

00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:12,180
then of course if you you know if you

00:11:10,949 --> 00:11:13,430
got a match with someone that's you

00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,420
maybe you don't you know

00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:16,490
you know you're not attracted to that

00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:18,320
person then you don't need to you don't

00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:20,480
need to worry about that you just not

00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:23,860
talk to the person and you know it's a

00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:28,490
naive thing naive approach here going on

00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:29,570
okay and then you know of course you

00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:33,020
know when you're when you're writing

00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:35,330
code it doesn't stop it doesn't stop at

00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:37,520
a you know at a place at a stage you

00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:39,680
always have to do some more and more and

00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:41,030
more you know have you experienced this

00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,890
you know this phenomenon like when

00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:44,870
you're building something we just want

00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:46,520
to extend it extend with more stuff with

00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,840
more cool stuff with more you know so

00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:50,690
then I set up you know I set up like

00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:52,700
email notifications from address so that

00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:55,010
so that basically every time I get a

00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:56,510
match I'll get an email and then you

00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:58,160
know in the email it gets all everything

00:11:56,510 --> 00:12:02,350
the pictures as well all of this stuff

00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:04,910
directly to my inbox you know of course

00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:08,510
of course there is notifications and the

00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:11,900
tinder app but and this is completely my

00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:13,520
opinion and my experience it doesn't

00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:15,050
work for me with notifications

00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:16,910
it's not working I don't know why it's

00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:19,640
buggy or whatever like the tinder app

00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:22,550
but this thing here that this actually

00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:25,940
worked better and it wasn't a lot of

00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:27,950
code either it's like very simple and in

00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:30,350
addition you can since you're getting

00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:32,720
all the data from the API you can even

00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:34,790
make notifications you know even better

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,710
so that you can send the pictures for

00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:37,910
example directly to your inbox you don't

00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:39,290
you don't have that today and it's in

00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:41,210
your app since we're app today you'll

00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:43,040
just you know you'll get an email saying

00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:44,960
that oh you got a match you know click

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,960
here to talk to the person so they

00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:49,940
direct you to their app basically but

00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:53,030
but here you can you know you can mix

00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:58,700
and tricks as you want but again it's

00:12:53,030 --> 00:13:01,460
not allowed so then so then so I open

00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:02,870
the email I get the pictures right and

00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:05,540
then as you can see there you have like

00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:07,130
the age and all and you know number of

00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:09,650
photos stuff like that you can play

00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:12,150
around it's just data open data so okay

00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:14,430
so I did all that it was fun you know

00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:21,000
and you know lots of fun and then this

00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:23,040
happens so tinder went down actually so

00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,390
I was writing code and you know working

00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,970
with the script and then suddenly the

00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:29,250
service was down and I was getting like

00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:30,060
five out of three and you know what the

00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,850
heck is going on

00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:35,490
I like I never experienced something

00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:37,800
like you know it said like no back-end

00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:41,580
server is at capacity that was the error

00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:43,440
from tinder of course you know

00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:46,529
developers are paranoid people as well

00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,480
we're paranoid so I was like in full

00:13:46,529 --> 00:13:51,420
panic whoo did I did I break tinder you

00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,130
know of course we love drama so I

00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:56,160
thought that you know I broke tinder and

00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:58,740
you know this but of course I mean it's

00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,270
a very low probability that you know you

00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,290
have a script because my script was

00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:05,070
running for like eight days

00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:07,410
consecutively in the cloud and it was

00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:09,570
doing like lots of likes you know like

00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:11,339
as I mentioned to you like 40 likes a

00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:13,440
second or something and it was running

00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:15,060
for eight days you know I didn't I

00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,610
didn't do it it wasn't a DDoS attack

00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:20,040
here you know I wasn't doing that right

00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:23,730
tinder but uh and it I would be very

00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:24,600
surprised if that very small script took

00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:26,940
down their service

00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:29,070
I mean cinder has like 50 million users

00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:31,529
around the world and they have ten

00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:33,029
million active users so yeah pretty sure

00:14:31,529 --> 00:14:34,740
this was a coincidence a pure

00:14:33,029 --> 00:14:36,839
coincidence but it was interesting

00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:40,529
nonetheless because you know as you can

00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:42,720
see it happened here's the time those

00:14:40,529 --> 00:14:46,800
there is also the day you know it was

00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:48,720
the 8th of January this year and it was

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:52,410
it was like a full chaos and social

00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:54,470
media so as you can see here people are

00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:57,000
like panicking you know like all right I

00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:59,100
met my future partner you know and all

00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,600
this and then you know tinder went down

00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:03,450
and they lost everything you know

00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:08,880
so people very sad about this and you

00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:11,250
know and stuff yeah ok so here's a

00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,900
screenshot showing you you know for for

00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:14,310
the tech one sticky ones in the room I

00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:16,470
know that there's a lot of you in the

00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:18,900
room here's a screenshot showing you

00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:21,089
what what I saw while debugging my

00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:23,250
application on the same day that this

00:15:21,089 --> 00:15:25,930
happened and this is the code basically

00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:29,380
as you can see here I've marked out the

00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:31,180
day time just like a proof that this

00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:33,700
happened at the same time that I was

00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:35,950
working with my codes and you know the

00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:37,290
service was service unavailable back-end

00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:42,520
servers at capacity

00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:44,800
pretty interesting alright so as I

00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:46,540
mentioned to you the API is open but

00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,250
there is no tinder doesn't want

00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:51,339
developers to do this stuff you know

00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:55,510
like what I did so they don't have like

00:15:51,339 --> 00:15:57,279
any documentation on their API so so

00:15:55,510 --> 00:16:00,370
like we're not supposed to work with the

00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:02,649
API basically so people are creative

00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:05,620
around the worlds what what what one one

00:16:02,649 --> 00:16:05,770
person actually did he's a developer as

00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:10,300
well

00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:12,670
he made a github repository showing the

00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:16,000
he made a documentation basically for

00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:18,220
the API so so he was just looking at the

00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,690
traffic and seeing how the how the API

00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:23,860
works and he wrote like an unofficial

00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:25,750
documentation and that was the

00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:27,490
documentation that I used now this

00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:30,700
documentation is out on github it's

00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:32,260
fully public and open so he probably

00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:34,060
shouldn't have done that because you

00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:40,240
know again tinder doesn't want people to

00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:41,920
do this but anyway I at that time I was

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,950
really into this stuff so what I did is

00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:47,260
I made a pull request to the developer

00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:50,410
and I told him you know I actually got

00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:51,790
this 503 error and this wasn't in the

00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:53,800
documentation so he had never

00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:56,080
experienced it before so I just told him

00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:58,240
this happened and so we got the prayer

00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:00,310
requests approved now this was one it

00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:07,689
was like happy times and rainbows that

00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:09,339
was before I contacted cinder yeah so ok

00:17:07,689 --> 00:17:11,640
so all this stuff you know all this

00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:14,199
experience all these experiences they

00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:17,040
led to this you know to the creation of

00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:21,130
a white hat hacker hub and although that

00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:23,500
I that I that I basically I found it and

00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:25,420
it was really interesting because how

00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:28,120
many of you are like a familiar with

00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:30,100
hacking you know like hacking stuff and

00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:32,220
don't be shy about it you know let me

00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:36,160
shadow rise how many raise your hands

00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:38,290
yeah a couple of people yeah so you know

00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,430
you know this concept of black hats vs.

00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:41,560
white hat you know

00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:43,990
so basically it's a white hat hacker hub

00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:45,910
which makes basically means is that we

00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:48,130
want to hack systems in order to improve

00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:50,260
the security right so there's nothing

00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:53,680
wrong about that we make an agreement

00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:55,480
with the client or the third party that

00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:57,130
we want to hack and we told them that

00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:00,160
you know we're gonna hack your system

00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:02,410
but under your approval in order to

00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:05,200
improve your security that was the

00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:06,670
concept behind the hacker hub so so it's

00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:10,110
totally fine to do to do white hat

00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:14,320
hacking there's no like issue with us so

00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:16,000
so I started this group and gathered

00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,430
some people smart people you know like

00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,750
all of you in the room and then you know

00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:21,670
we were thinking you know how can we

00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:24,100
improve this script even better you know

00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:27,130
like even you know how like how could we

00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:28,930
even do also logging in right because we

00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:31,240
are logging into tinder through Facebook

00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:35,680
right we're using the OAuth protocol

00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:38,800
with open ID how open ID Connect so so

00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:41,170
basically you have this o auth URL here

00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:43,090
which is this one basically by the way

00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:46,300
this doesn't work anymore so obviously

00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:48,610
tinder and Facebook fix this thing to

00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:52,390
make it harder to do this stuff but this

00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:54,340
link here when it was working if you

00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:55,660
click on if you clicked on this link now

00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:57,580
as you can see on the top this is a

00:18:55,660 --> 00:19:01,060
fully genuine link you know it's a

00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:03,310
Facebook link and it's to authorize a

00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:06,730
third-party app so when you click on

00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:08,320
this link if you have Facebook you get

00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:10,980
directed to Facebook you login to

00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:14,530
Facebook and then you get a screen up

00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:16,480
with like a tinder tinder asking you to

00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:17,260
authorize tinder right you've probably

00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,270
seen this before

00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:22,330
authorizing third party applications

00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:24,310
right so you get the screen up and then

00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:26,050
if you open up the blog I should have

00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:28,840
had a screenshot here you know I'm sorry

00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:30,340
about that actually it's too bad because

00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,990
it now I can't do this anymore I need to

00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:35,860
find a new link here but when you click

00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:38,370
on it you get this you know this tab up

00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:40,570
with tinder asking you to get access and

00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:43,450
then and let's say if you're using

00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:46,060
Chrome Google Chrome if you open up the

00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:48,460
developer tools you go to network and

00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:50,880
then you just look at the traffic and if

00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:53,240
you look at it click ok on the tab

00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,340
you'll see that you'll get a token

00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:58,159
you know you'll get authorized tinder

00:19:55,340 --> 00:20:00,230
it'll get a token back and that token is

00:19:58,159 --> 00:20:03,049
likely access to the kingdom basically

00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:06,200
you can use this token to to log into

00:20:03,049 --> 00:20:07,580
tinder right from your own account

00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,840
you don't need password anymore you

00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:10,159
don't need anything of this stuff

00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:12,529
anymore

00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:14,000
now the token has an expiration date you

00:20:12,529 --> 00:20:17,029
know how many of you are familiar with

00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,100
JWT tokens you know yeah Jason web

00:20:17,029 --> 00:20:21,710
tokens a lot of people yeah they have an

00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:23,570
expiration date right so how can we

00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:26,890
automate this that you know that was the

00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:29,539
you know the challenge but how can we

00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:31,490
get new tokens automatically basically

00:20:29,539 --> 00:20:33,200
after expiration dates and basically

00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:35,480
automating this whole clicking process

00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,580
we have to click the link you know we

00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:40,840
want to make it program a table you know

00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:42,890
like with code and of course the group

00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:44,510
the group that I gathered they're really

00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:44,990
super smart so they actually found a way

00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:49,730
to do it

00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:52,580
so basically basically we we wrote we

00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:54,529
made it so that the code would go to the

00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:56,750
web browser on up a web browser and then

00:20:54,529 --> 00:20:59,029
click on okay basically doing those

00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:00,679
human operations through the code that's

00:20:59,029 --> 00:21:04,549
what we did and it works

00:21:00,679 --> 00:21:08,029
we got like we because you probably have

00:21:04,549 --> 00:21:10,850
you know you know MFA multi-factor

00:21:08,029 --> 00:21:12,710
authentication where you have to use

00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:14,029
your phone in order to log into Facebook

00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:16,669
for example right there's a double

00:21:14,029 --> 00:21:20,600
security measure so we managed to type

00:21:16,669 --> 00:21:22,580
bypass MFA so that you actually you get

00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:24,799
it you get like an okay here and the

00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:27,830
phone and click okay then it so then it

00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:30,140
like it works so this this little code

00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:32,299
actually bypasses everything so we did

00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:34,179
that and then suddenly we had auto

00:21:32,299 --> 00:21:36,710
log-in in place that was really awesome

00:21:34,179 --> 00:21:38,990
then I got it out to an azure and then

00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:42,409
my my Facebook account was banned of

00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:44,240
course so Facebook actually locked my

00:21:42,409 --> 00:21:46,220
account and they said as you can see on

00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:49,179
the screen here they said that you know

00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:53,029
your accounts temporary locked because

00:21:49,179 --> 00:21:55,070
we see that we see that you are in two

00:21:53,029 --> 00:21:58,010
places at once which is not physically

00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:59,330
possible because my like the code as I

00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:01,580
mentioned to you it's running an azure

00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:04,490
so it's distributed so suddenly it was

00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:06,980
logging in from Amsterdam and then I am

00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:08,690
in Oslo and I'm using Facebook on

00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:11,030
the basis and then there's a login from

00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:13,370
Amsterdam so Facebook is like whoa

00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:15,530
what's going on here we think someone

00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:17,480
hacked your account so we're locking

00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:19,130
your account and you have to change your

00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,690
password and then I'm like you know I

00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:22,070
don't want to change my password but

00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:23,929
then I said what you have to change your

00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:26,299
password you don't have a choice

00:22:23,929 --> 00:22:28,010
this we're forcing you to do this so I

00:22:26,299 --> 00:22:31,070
said okay fine so I changed my password

00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:32,900
and that's unfortunately where like you

00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:34,940
know everything ended because once you

00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:37,400
change your password you can't really

00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:40,910
automate stuff you know it's not you

00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:44,179
know it's gonna be really tough but of

00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:47,740
course where there is a will there is a

00:22:44,179 --> 00:22:50,390
you know a chance to do so so basically

00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:53,600
let's say if you are running the data

00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:56,960
centers in the same country where you

00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:58,850
are using the service right then you'll

00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:04,309
probably bypass the security measures of

00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:06,860
Facebook so if I'm running the the codes

00:23:04,309 --> 00:23:09,140
and a data center in Norway for example

00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:11,330
then they wouldn't detect any any issue

00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:13,250
they wouldn't know right but of course

00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:16,160
I'm not gonna I didn't test that out and

00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:19,130
I'm not gonna test that out of course

00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:24,440
again this is not allowed yeah but you

00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:27,230
can it's possible okay so all right so I

00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:28,970
sent an email to tinder because after

00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:32,330
doing this stuff all the stuff that I

00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:34,640
did and then I started you know sending

00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:36,500
abstracts you know talks around the

00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,510
world to conferences just to talk about

00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:40,640
this stuff that happened to me but then

00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:41,929
a lot of tech people that I know back

00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,059
and although they told me that you know

00:23:41,929 --> 00:23:45,980
you should you shouldn't do this you

00:23:44,059 --> 00:23:47,720
should do the ethical thing and contact

00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:49,700
hinder you shouldn't you know do you

00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:51,290
know do what you did without telling

00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:53,570
tinder what you did and then go talk

00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:55,400
about it you know so I thought about it

00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:57,320
and I said you know okay fine okay right

00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,790
I'm gonna do that I'll contact them so I

00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,419
contacted them and then they said you

00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:01,370
know hello

00:23:59,419 --> 00:24:03,320
you know like thank you for reaching out

00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:04,790
and you know and then I said you have to

00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:07,010
stop immediately they were pretty

00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:11,299
annoyed of what I did

00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:14,179
so automation is not allowed so I you

00:24:11,299 --> 00:24:15,500
know no problem we stopped that but then

00:24:14,179 --> 00:24:17,750
I also told them you know your service

00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:20,000
went down you know it affected millions

00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:23,210
of people so yeah

00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,520
and III don't think it was me I hardly

00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:27,530
hardly doubt that it was me but you know

00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:31,250
what do you have any comment about that

00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:33,500
and then they're like no we neither

00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:34,100
confirm or deny your assumption here or

00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,720
what happen

00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:37,370
yeah but the service didn't work for

00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:40,330
millions of people for two hours yeah

00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:43,850
but no they're like no no no no comments

00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:47,210
and also you know the funny thing with

00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:51,050
tinder is that you get like a finite

00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:53,810
amount of likes per day and if you pay

00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:56,900
for tinder so if you pay for the service

00:24:53,810 --> 00:25:01,000
you can get unlimited amount of likes

00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:03,620
you can like people you know forever and

00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,620
you can do also super likes but super

00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:08,090
likes you have to pay extra you know but

00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:10,100
the code that I did was like doing

00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:13,130
infinite super likes infinite lights

00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:15,860
with the free account because it was

00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:17,420
returning 200 okay the whole time their

00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:19,460
service so I'm assuming that it's worked

00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:22,850
you know I wouldn't two hundred is like

00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:25,490
okay except or okay basically that's

00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:26,930
what it means and the rest right but

00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:28,820
don't they said no no no you know like

00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:32,840
if you get a two hundred it doesn't mean

00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:35,660
that it was actually successful now that

00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:37,160
I don't understand I mean what what do

00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:39,080
you think you know if you get a 200 ok

00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:41,600
what do you think in your head the

00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:43,160
operation is successful or not or raise

00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,870
your hands if you think if you get a few

00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:46,790
right your developer you're implementing

00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:49,310
something you got a 200 ok what do you

00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:51,710
think is was that okay was that a 200

00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:56,510
successful operation raise your hand

00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:59,360
okay and the rest of you do you think

00:25:56,510 --> 00:26:02,120
that it isn't okay you need further

00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:03,680
investigation to actually confirm the

00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:07,040
operation was okay or not

00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:11,600
raise your hands okay interesting yeah

00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:12,080
cool cool cool you're more experienced

00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,930
than me

00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:19,940
the other you know the rest that's a

00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:22,430
yeah okay so I was like okay fine fine

00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:24,980
I'll stop everything you know but I

00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:26,150
think this is really cool can I help you

00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:28,190
no because they have like this bug

00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:29,870
bounty program so I was like you know

00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:32,960
can I help you can I join this bug

00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:33,920
bounty program so that I can contribute

00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,870
your

00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:38,180
security work I want to do it for free

00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:41,300
because you know this is fun for me

00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:45,460
you know so what do you think it's okay

00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:45,460
but then they never they didn't reply

00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:52,250
they didn't reply at all it was like

00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:54,680
silent treatment you know top level so

00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:56,870
so that was pretty bad they didn't they

00:26:54,680 --> 00:27:00,560
don't want my help and everything so but

00:26:56,870 --> 00:27:03,140
okay fine it's you know whatever so then

00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:04,730
but then you know if my friends told me

00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:07,280
that because I open sourced the code

00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:10,090
that I wrote so I just put it up on

00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:12,500
github but that my friends some of the

00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:14,120
you know some tech people back and also

00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,680
they told me that you should you know I

00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:17,150
should probably just lock the codes

00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:19,670
because maybe tinder is not happy about

00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:21,140
this and like that so unfortunately I

00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:25,070
took down the code it's a private

00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:26,330
repository too bad to that but what can

00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:29,450
we do I mean it's you know we have to

00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:31,130
respect we have to respect the the

00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:33,290
people who make the services as we use

00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:33,680
it's their service right it's their

00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:38,180
business

00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:41,930
we are just consumers so the code is in

00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:44,690
a private repo and

00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:47,450
you know I you know I don't use the code

00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:50,990
I have I stopped the moment that tinder

00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:52,430
said stop so I stopped at that time the

00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:55,820
OAuth link that I showed you earlier

00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:57,590
doesn't work anymore it was working fine

00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:59,480
what I used to it and I think I believe

00:27:57,590 --> 00:28:01,370
it was working for a very long time I

00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:03,040
believe it was working for years

00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:05,210
actually because I saw a lot of people

00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:08,180
discussing this in github on github and

00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:10,490
they're like you know here's the URL and

00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:12,410
it was the same URL for being used for

00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:15,260
years so something happened definitely

00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:20,510
something happened at Facebook and

00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:24,110
tinder but it's a mystery but we we have

00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:27,530
yet to figure out well I'm not gonna

00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:29,300
investigate this I don't know or I don't

00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:31,640
want to get into trouble here

00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:37,880
you know enough trouble for me that's so

00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:41,060
far so all right so so how to kind of

00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:45,050
conclude this experience right it was

00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:47,540
really fun while it lasted you know it's

00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:49,520
very very important to talk to the you

00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:52,030
know to the third party in question

00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:56,390
before you do any white hat hacking

00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:58,790
otherwise it's not white hat so and of

00:28:56,390 --> 00:29:02,030
course you know ethical hacking is you

00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:04,970
know is really really fun and I think

00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:10,190
that we can learn Lots if we do this I

00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:11,540
believe that you know we can definitely

00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:14,990
improve the security around the world

00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:16,220
but you know of course a lot of people

00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:18,910
say that security is really an illusion

00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:23,930
right you can bypass pretty much

00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:26,630
anything but having some security is

00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:29,750
better than no security at all so it's

00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:31,490
very very important to do that so yeah I

00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:34,540
hope that you enjoyed this little talk

00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:37,940
here about my experiences I hope that

00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:43,280
you know you would be inspired to do

00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:46,220
some white hat hacking and of course I'm

00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:47,810
open for any questions that you that you

00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:49,140
if you have any questions I'm very open

00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:51,990

00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:02,880
is my technical blog I blog a lot of you

00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:04,470
know a lot about different different

00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,809
developer stuff it's very technical

00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:11,610
all from you know don't not JavaScript

00:30:06,809 --> 00:30:13,320
stuff to assure you know and yeah I hope

questions let's you know we can take

00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:20,580
them now we have some time still so any

00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:24,990
questions and don't be yes any question

00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:30,059
we have a question yes over there don't

00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:33,150
be shy by the way yeah thank you sweetie

00:30:30,059 --> 00:30:34,740
for that very funny talk and thank you

00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:35,940
for for being ethically enough for

00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:38,070
through hacking to first do it

00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:39,600
disclosure with the with the vendor and

00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:42,600
then going public because that's just

00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,980
the right way to do it even especially

00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:46,770
if you're talking about Whitehead

00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:49,860
hacking talk talk about the security

00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:52,200
problems with the vendor first so they

00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:54,929
have a chance to fix it before you go in

00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:58,679
public so to answer your question

00:30:54,929 --> 00:31:02,250
earlier I raise my hand because I just

00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:06,000
had the same problem as you working with

00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:10,100
an API getting two hundred okay's and

00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:13,500
not having the actual thing happen so

00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:17,100
yeah I'm not smarter than you I just had

00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:18,750
the same problem with another API my

00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:23,809
question would be have you ever found

00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:26,309
out what for the tinder offers this API

00:31:23,809 --> 00:31:30,330
what what's the actual use I have not

00:31:26,309 --> 00:31:33,000
read the Terms of Use so can you can you

00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:35,820
shine a line or light on that what can

00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:39,929
you use it for yeah so what can we use

00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:41,730
the app for the API for yes so you can

00:31:39,929 --> 00:31:44,580
use all the functionality that you can

00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:46,080
use with the official tinder app so for

00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:48,750
example you can get really creative and

00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:50,910
like oh create a bot for example you

00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:52,470
know if you are just at home let's say

00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:55,200
you get a match you can also do chatting

00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:56,610
for example through the API so basically

00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,500
all the features that you get with the

00:31:56,610 --> 00:32:01,590
app you get it from the API because the

00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:05,400
app uses the API right

00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:07,140
so yeah so we can do pretty much

00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:09,390
everything you want to do without having

00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:11,880
the app but again this is not a

00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:14,520
something that I that is recommended

00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:16,290
here right we have to respect tinder and

00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:19,230
use their app and you know all that

00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:20,970
stuff I hope that of course that tinder

00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:23,400
will you know will close their API that

00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:25,410
would be wouldn't that be a you know a

00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:27,330
logical thing to do why would you have

00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:29,850
an fully open API if you don't want

00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:32,400
people to use it in their applications

00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:35,640
so I hope that they do that that they

00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:40,290
close the API yeah definitely any other

00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:45,090
questions feel free to ask if you have

00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:46,920
any all right if you want I'm still here

00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:49,680
around in the conference I'm gonna stay

00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:52,410
here for another three hours before I

00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:54,840
have to take the flight back to Oslo so

00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:56,850
please feel free to come over and talk

00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,950
to me and ask me you know questions

00:32:56,850 --> 00:33:01,230
about this or about anything else that

00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:03,160
you wondering about thank you so much

00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:08,540
