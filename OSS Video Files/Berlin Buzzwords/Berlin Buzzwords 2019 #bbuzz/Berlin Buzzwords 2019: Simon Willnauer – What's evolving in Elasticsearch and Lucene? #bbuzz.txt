Description: 
	This talk will walk through the latest developments in Elasticsearch and related changes in Apache Lucene. We will look into significant query performance improvements, frozen indices, usage of the new soft-deletes feature for cross data-center replication and changes APIs and usability changes that makes search-as-you-type almost trivial.

The talk also presents the results of some long standing changes that we made in Lucene which are now paying off in geo-search use-cases and how they are integrated in Elasticsearch. Folks that are interested in distributed aspects of Elasticsearch will also hear about improvements in Zen 2 and Index-lifecycle-Management.
