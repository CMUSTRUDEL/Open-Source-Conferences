Description: 
	Building a chat system relies on recognizing known entities being spoken. The Solr Tagger, a powerful unique capability of Apache Solr, provides performant tagging of known, concrete items in free text. Using the Solr Tagger as a first stage of query interpretation provides rich entity metadata that can be leveraged to hone in on user intent.

This session will introduce the Solr Tagger and its myriad of use cases culminating with a chat application that creatively uses the tagger for query interpretation.

This talk is presented by Lucidworks.
