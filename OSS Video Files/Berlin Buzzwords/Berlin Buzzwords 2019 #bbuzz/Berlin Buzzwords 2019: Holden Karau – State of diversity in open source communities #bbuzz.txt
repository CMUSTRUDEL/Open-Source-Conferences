Playlist: Berlin Buzzwords 2019 #bbuzz
Description: 
	Holden Karau talking about "State of diversity in open source communities: A bi exploration of correlations, draw your own inference".

Open Source projects are a medium to expose engineers to innovation, other cultures and fast-track ways to learn more about the new leading technologies. Representation in the world of Open Source contribution has the opportunity to benefit not only the participants but the broader society. While there are many intersectional aspects to diversity, this talk will focus on diversity of region of contributors and gender as these are easier to analyze and we have more personal experience with them. Together we will explore data from projects in the Apache Software Foundation, Linux Foundation, and Jupyter family of projects.

Topics include:
- Diversity of representation of gender, working hours, and region among the different levels of a given project’s leadership (committers, PMC, etc.)
- Source of project origination
- The existence of codes of conduct
- And how creating a welcoming environment helps diversity
- Language & time of communication in comments, code, and mailing lists
- The rate & sources of promotions for project participants
- The importance of recognizing non-code contributions and how projects with better process are more diverse
