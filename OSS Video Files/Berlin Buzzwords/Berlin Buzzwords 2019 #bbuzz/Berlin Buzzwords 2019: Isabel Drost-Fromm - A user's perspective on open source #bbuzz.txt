Title: Berlin Buzzwords 2019: Isabel Drost-Fromm - A user's perspective on open source #bbuzz
Publication date: 2019-06-17
Playlist: Berlin Buzzwords 2019 #bbuzz
Description: 
	"We have won" - that's what I once heard about the trust that is being put into free and open source projects. Looking back at ten years of Berlin Buzzwords, it's hard to imagine how things could be any different: Projects developed at the Apache Software Foundation are basis on which tons of data analytics systems are built. 

But as a downstream user likely betting their core business on open source - how well do you understand how these projects are being governed, how direction is being set, how well they are equipped to survive the next decade? After all, there's more to open source than the source code itself.

The ASF provides a home to several hundred OSS projects - a lot of them relevant to the search, store, scale, stream ecosystem that Berlin Buzzwords targets. If you have been digging a bit deeper, you may have encountered the phrase “The Apache Way” - often used in relation to how projects at the ASF should work.

This talk tries to give a glimpse behind the scenes - with a strong focus on what the implications of best practices advertised at the ASF are for downstream users of it’s projects.

	00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:11,360
good morning feels like ages ago is that

00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:15,219
I will standing ready no while standing

00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:17,960
now introducing a keynote speaker for

00:00:15,219 --> 00:00:19,880
pretty much ten years I've refused to

00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:22,640
give a talk right here because I've been

00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:24,619
part of the organizing team someone

00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:30,019
tricked me into standing up getting up

00:00:24,619 --> 00:00:34,100
early this morning so I'm gonna talk to

00:00:30,019 --> 00:00:37,430
you about open source essentially from a

00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:39,820
user's perspective for 15 years I've

00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:43,129
spent time with open source communities

00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:45,260
mostly at the Apache ecosystem and what

00:00:43,129 --> 00:00:47,809
I've seen there is how these projects

00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:51,590
managed to build bridges bridges across

00:00:47,809 --> 00:00:54,170
time zones geographies countries but

00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:55,969
also organizations what I would like to

00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:59,000
explain to you is how to become a part

00:00:55,969 --> 00:01:03,489
of this community and how to draw your

00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,140
team into a bigger open-source ecosystem

00:01:03,489 --> 00:01:09,310
before I do that we've got a couple

00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:12,410
empty arrows here if you are in a

00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:14,000
Apaches of her foundation member can you

00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:16,040
please come up to me so that you can

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,890
correct me over sitting right there I

00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:29,020
see you can you come here please I've

00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:32,740
seen kneel somewhere up there I see you

00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:35,210
Thank You Nick for coming

00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:38,980
doesn't matter first or second so you

00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:38,980
can shout at me if I'm telling

00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,050
thank you

00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:57,920
okay the entire slide tech isn't only

00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:59,840
born from my inspiration it's based on

00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,450
an Apache wait presentations that was

00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:05,900
given before by many other people many

00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:08,929
of C's mentioned up there thank you for

00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:10,610
the inspiration so for those of you who

00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:13,310
haven't heard about my name before

00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:15,250
I'm a open source strategist at over

00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:18,590
pace which is a company here in Berlin

00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:20,209
in the financial sector I'm also a

00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:23,630
member of the Apache Software Foundation

00:02:20,209 --> 00:02:25,400
I happen to be co-founder of this very

00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:28,550
conference which feels awkward to say

00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:33,200
right here essentially the idea was that

00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:35,660
I don't like flying in plane so much so

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,940
I prefer to have you come here so that I

00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:41,900
can come to a conference was public

00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:44,030
transmitted transit or bicycle I'm also

00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:48,400
a co-founder of fuss backstage

00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:51,709
which deals with everything economics

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:54,860
governance legal of open source projects

00:02:51,709 --> 00:03:03,799
going to happen again likely later this

00:02:54,860 --> 00:03:06,230
year talk to these people so what's my

00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:09,140
journey what's my user journey and open

00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:13,730
source my first email to any open source

00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:17,600
project that went out I believe in 2002

00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:19,700
maybe 2003 you can search with your

00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:21,799
favorite search engine if you still find

00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:25,790
it I was still a very young student when

00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:28,640
I send it after that I joined a research

00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:32,989
group which was dealing with text mining

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:34,850
with link mining here at HQ Berlin what

00:03:32,989 --> 00:03:40,519
I wanted to do was to analyze the web

00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:43,010
structure to figure out if web pages in

00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:45,459
the social media space which Bexon still

00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:48,799
were called web locks and not Facebook

00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:50,750
were differently linked between each

00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,640
others in the regular web for that I

00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:55,970
needed a search engine and a crawler

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:58,910
that was Apache not about exon it was

00:03:55,970 --> 00:04:01,130
hosted on SourceForge while I was using

00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:02,750
not it moved from SourceForge to the

00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:04,890
incubator from the incubator to a

00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:07,970
top-level pops up

00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:11,069
of a patchy low seen every single time

00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:13,200
these moves happened my inbox got

00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:17,130
flooded again and I was like what are

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:20,100
those people doing what helped so Vall

00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:22,830
said I joined Z's mailing lists I got my

00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:24,840
questions aren't answered I started

00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:28,530
answering questions of other people and

00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:30,960
I got valuable input while I got this

00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:34,440
input I also asked how to cite this

00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:36,419
project in a research publication one of

00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:39,330
the founders of self Apache notch came

00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:42,840
back to me and said to me hey this is

00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:45,240
how you can cite it and say hi to a year

00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:48,140
advisor because the founder of that

00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:51,030
project thought that I'm just a student

00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:53,940
same thing happened to me afterwards I

00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:56,690
was communicating with people at eye

00:04:53,940 --> 00:05:00,180
level mistaking many people in sea level

00:04:56,690 --> 00:05:02,880
positions in senior research positions

00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:03,500
it's just your neighbor from across the

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,690
street

00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:09,270
luckily nobody ever took offense with me

00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:12,240
mistaking them for some same for some

00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:13,860
things that they were or not what

00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,610
happens when I left research was that a

00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:19,620
state subscribed at some point grand

00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:21,750
Ingersoll posted an email on Zilla seed

00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:23,790
mailing list asking whether there should

00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:27,030
be some Apache text mining project I'd

00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:28,860
say I reached out he came back to me

00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:31,229
that there's like five six people

00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:35,310
interested in it half a year later

00:05:31,229 --> 00:05:38,669
Apache mahute was born which was machine

00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:43,919
learning classification clustering and

00:05:38,669 --> 00:05:45,660
recommender systems at scale now tired

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:48,180
of flying to conferences those was a

00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:50,070
conference that I created half a year

00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:52,380
later someone made me a member of C

00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:53,490
Foundation and I'm like what what

00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:57,000
happened me

00:05:53,490 --> 00:06:02,300
I believe this happened to a few other

00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:05,070
people as well now it's true throughout

00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:07,800
my entire time at Apache what I found

00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:09,990
fascinating is the independence that

00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:13,160
these projects have of single entities

00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:15,240
there's always multiple people multiple

00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:17,310
organizations involved that keeps your

00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,390
project sattell alive and that something

00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:20,490
said I'm looking

00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:26,090
for when I'm looking at open-source

00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:28,590
projects today now I want you to wake up

00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:31,920
don't worry I'm not going to make anyone

00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:34,290
else come to the front please raise your

00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:38,330
hand if you run your systems based on a

00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:42,660
vanilla upstream project release one

00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:46,770
really just one two three okay anyone

00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:51,740
running based on a vendors packaged

00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:54,180
release you're all sleeping aren't you

00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:56,510
don't worry I'm not making you come to

00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,510
the front

00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:06,090
how many vendors do we have in the

00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:13,200
audience that have faced their offerings

00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:15,180
on open source some more okay okay now I

00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:19,440
really want to see hands how many of you

00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:22,920
do contribute After Hours for any

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:25,080
definition of After Hours how many of

00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:31,110
you contribute occasionally as part of

00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:37,170
your job okay half wasn't half how many

00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:46,370
contribute full-time sir maybe fourth

00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:49,770
fifth okay so why should you care well

00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:52,650
if you build your business on top of an

00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:54,630
in a project then there are a few

00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:58,170
questions that you want to answer before

00:07:54,630 --> 00:08:01,950
building it a strong dependency on that

00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:04,980
project you want to know how these

00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:06,930
projects deal with security issues you

00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:09,780
want to understand who is behind the

00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:13,190
project and who's driving it you want to

00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:17,190
know what happens if this entity fails

00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:20,070
to continue say if this one company runs

00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:23,940
out of funding or if this one person

00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:26,370
runs out of funding you also want to

00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,910
understand how project decisions are

00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:29,460
being made

00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:32,099
if CS like one person driving the

00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:37,979
decision or if he can become part of

00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:40,440
decision-making process and this is what

00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:43,469
this talk essentially is all about how

00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:46,259
do these projects run now you've heard

00:08:43,469 --> 00:08:48,300
already is that my background is a

00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:50,790
strong Apache background so this isn't

00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:53,370
really a talk about and uses perspective

00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:55,259
on open source in general but really on

00:08:53,370 --> 00:09:00,329
the Apaches of your foundations version

00:08:55,259 --> 00:09:02,670
of open source now what does it mean to

00:09:00,329 --> 00:09:05,009
be to be open source if you tell or

00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:08,220
Twitter is there's quite some discussion

00:09:05,009 --> 00:09:10,259
going on about the term open source for

00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:12,690
me personally it means it has to be a

00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:16,410
and an open source initiative approved

00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:19,110
license so said it's open source PI's

00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:22,170
license but to me coming from Apache it

00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:25,470
also means an open development process

00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:29,399
that means open road map creation open

00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:32,430
architecture architecture decisions plus

00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:39,209
open design documents plus a process

00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:42,360
where I can go and participate now who's

00:09:39,209 --> 00:09:46,230
part of this community making these

00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:48,509
decisions in my personal experience that

00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:54,630
starts will see users so this was

00:09:48,509 --> 00:09:56,970
everyone here in the room now

00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:58,680
if you've been in the lysene community

00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:00,449
for long enough and you've been digging

00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:03,660
through the wiki for long enough uvula

00:10:00,449 --> 00:10:06,329
run across this citation which is Yonex

00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:08,970
law of Patch's a half-baked patch in

00:10:06,329 --> 00:10:10,949
JIRA who has no documentation no tests

00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:13,889
and no backwards compatibility it's

00:10:10,949 --> 00:10:15,899
better than no petted or referring back

00:10:13,889 --> 00:10:18,110
to my first experience with Apache notch

00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:22,110
of course I made some modifications

00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:24,420
dealing was writable Bexon Enzi

00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:27,839
so-called much disappeared file system

00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:29,250
I never contributed it back I wanted to

00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,649
have it perfect I wanted to have it

00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:34,620
polished I want her to have it such that

00:10:31,649 --> 00:10:37,470
it just works except it never went out

00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:39,839
this is where I learned that it's better

00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:42,480
to share your progress very early on

00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:45,640
even if it feels awkward even the few

00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:50,350
not confident with that people around

00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:52,990
we'll help you get it freezer was your

00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:57,700
first patch was it you will be counted

00:10:52,990 --> 00:11:00,070
as a project contributor at Apache

00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:02,170
mahute a friend of mine once told me

00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:04,840
that in order to become a committer what

00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:07,600
he did was to flop the project with

00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:10,540
patches and worse contributions so that

00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,010
over time committees were just like come

00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:16,560
on I don't want to review yet another

00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:16,560
patch give him right access and go ahead

00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:23,800
if it's so for some projects that's the

00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:26,500
same level actually being a committer

00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:28,600
and a PMC member but what do you get if

00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:31,180
he is the stick a lot stick around for

00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:37,360
long enough you are the one who makes a

00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:39,130
decision who else to pull in if you

00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,530
again stick around for long enough do

00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:43,630
something cross foundational people will

00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:47,440
nominate you as a member of C Apaches of

00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:49,060
the foundation if people come to me and

00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,800
tell me hey I want to be a member what

00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:52,990
should I do what I do

00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,580
what I first asks them is do you really

00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:57,070
want to be a member you get a read

00:11:54,580 --> 00:12:01,810
another two mailing lists was high

00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:03,520
traffic said really what you want so

00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:06,360
what do you get to do as a member of

00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:10,000
Chris you become part of that foundation

00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:12,250
you may be elected as a board of

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,670
directors remember yet another mailing

00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:17,950
list to read and follow plus you can

00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:19,440
vote who becomes a director what's the

00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:22,180
task of these directors wise

00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:25,450
directorship between PMC and membership

00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:30,460
sayers of ones providing oversight over

00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:33,310
the projects what's this fuss is funny

00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:35,620
foundation therefore it's fair to serve

00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:38,290
see projects essentially providing

00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:44,290
services like infrastructure press etc

00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:47,200
through offices and committees however

00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:51,690
everything all of that starts with a

00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,690
users need turned into a contribution

00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:57,160
now interestingly enough let's bake deep

00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:59,800
into the history of the Apache

00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:02,889
foundation actually I still bump

00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:04,720
randomly into people like this weekend

00:13:02,889 --> 00:13:06,790
for instance when going shopping who

00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,439
talked to me like wait a minute you're

00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:10,569
wearing your custom t-shirt what's your

00:13:08,439 --> 00:13:11,800
relation to open-source and I'm like I'm

00:13:10,569 --> 00:13:16,740
part of the Apache Software Foundation

00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:23,339
and say go like yes this web server no

00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:25,689
not really but still the history so see

00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:27,249
where is this foundation comes from and

00:13:25,689 --> 00:13:29,439
said they were a bunch of people relying

00:13:27,249 --> 00:13:31,059
on a web server for production use

00:13:29,439 --> 00:13:33,639
except such a person who wanted to

00:13:31,059 --> 00:13:36,100
develop it at some point didn't have the

00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:39,519
time and resources to do so anymore so

00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:45,790
they banded together continuing the

00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:47,860
development of a patchy web server what

00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:49,420
do you see if you look at that it sets

00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:51,999
those whole contribution saver and

00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:54,129
altruistic at all Savior very

00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:55,929
self-serving say headless web server and

00:13:54,129 --> 00:13:59,559
protections they wanted it to be fast

00:13:55,929 --> 00:14:02,170
performant secure so xavier making these

00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:04,269
contributions not because they had a lot

00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:06,220
of time left they didn't do so because

00:14:04,269 --> 00:14:11,529
they wanted to make the world a better

00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:13,629
place they wanted to get a job done in

00:14:11,529 --> 00:14:15,399
order for that to work even then people

00:14:13,629 --> 00:14:18,730
were coming from different organizations

00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:21,300
what they built was what someone once

00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:23,559
called Acey switzerland of open-source

00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:27,970
what they mean with that is a neutral

00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:30,059
place for people to collaborate they're

00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:32,620
independently of you of affiliation

00:14:30,059 --> 00:14:34,300
independently of your history you can

00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:38,499
collaborate to bring your project

00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:42,429
forward so how does it work let's get

00:14:38,499 --> 00:14:47,049
some simple issues to get started start

00:14:42,429 --> 00:14:49,119
with copyright patenting trademarks why

00:14:47,049 --> 00:14:52,869
are the legal aspects important for

00:14:49,119 --> 00:14:56,170
downstream uses think about projects

00:14:52,869 --> 00:14:59,529
pulling in dependencies you want your

00:14:56,170 --> 00:15:02,199
projects that you rely on to be clear of

00:14:59,529 --> 00:15:06,220
any license and Frenchman's you want it

00:15:02,199 --> 00:15:07,860
to be clean think about

00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:12,220
contributions coming from corporations

00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:15,600
you want to make sure that it's okay for

00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:21,100
these people to make that contribution

00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:23,410
think about patent issues what else is

00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:25,420
there just trademark issues as a trade

00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:27,100
down system use of what I wanted they

00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:28,180
said if I'm downloading a duck it's

00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:31,210
actually is the duck side I'm not

00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:35,260
looking for so I want to make sure that

00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:36,940
the project trademark is being used such

00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:39,280
that it's not confusing for my

00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:41,620
downstream uses but I also want to make

00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:43,450
sure that my project name doesn't

00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:45,400
infringe on existing project names

00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:47,440
otherwise I'm going to have to rename

00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:51,280
over and over and over and my user

00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:55,650
doesn't know where the project went okay

00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:58,690
so far four simple issues what about

00:15:55,650 --> 00:16:02,620
slightly more messy complex issues

00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:04,510
called project governance some things

00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,990
that we do today and tomorrow here as

00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:09,240
well

00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:12,190
a purchases community over code

00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:14,350
someone wants translated that as a

00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:18,780
project without people is a dead project

00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:21,130
or at least one that's very deep asleep

00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:25,600
which kind of community are we talking

00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:27,250
about everyone here in the room not only

00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:31,080
commuters not only the ones sitting here

00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:31,080
in the front row but like everyone here

00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:36,490
where do we find you we find you on

00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:39,220
social media we find you on sestok

00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:41,890
overflow but don't be surprised of speak

00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:44,340
people speak up and try to channel

00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:48,160
discussions back to the official project

00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:52,330
communication channels what are those

00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:54,370
still mailing lists so you're still

00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:59,380
higher bandwidth than what you get on

00:16:54,370 --> 00:17:01,300
Twitter so don't be afraid to join an

00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:04,180
official project channel to speak up

00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:06,130
there to ask your questions here I still

00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:08,890
remember that 15 years ago that felt

00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:10,510
very awkward to me what happened was

00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:15,490
that people were very friendly into

00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:17,740
answering so often there's paid support

00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:19,990
available from Zurich parties my

00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:21,970
experience is that it's still helpful to

00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:26,319
remain in the loop of C original

00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:29,440
projects even if you won't get when two

00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:31,720
specific questions answers there people

00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,970
will be able to help you out with more

00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:35,830
generic questions but more importantly

00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:38,590
just from watching the discussions you

00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:42,040
will see which issues people run into

00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:43,720
and you will avoid running into the same

00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:47,559
problems and avoid making the same

00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:51,010
mistakes and trust me over time you

00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:55,450
can't help but answer questions in there

00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:57,940
and become involved now where does

00:17:55,450 --> 00:18:00,130
communication happen direct

00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:02,590
communication walks so this is a picture

00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:04,990
taken at buildin buzzwords I don't know

00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:08,500
it was a Tonya so maybe second or third

00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:11,470
edition its high bandwidth use easy

00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:13,990
phrases you see gestures being made

00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:17,020
you typically realize when someone's

00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:18,910
being sarcastic accepts that this kind

00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:21,040
of communication doesn't scale as much

00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:24,160
as I would like to have you everyone in

00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:27,130
Berlin all of like every months and

00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:30,160
every day in the year that won't happen

00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:35,830
so we will have to rely on asynchronous

00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:38,020
communication so there's a rule at

00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:40,929
Apache which says if it didn't happen on

00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:42,400
our mailing list it didn't happen does

00:18:40,929 --> 00:18:43,330
that means that Berlin bus routes

00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,690
doesn't happen

00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:48,700
clearly not people are chatting here say

00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:51,880
you're hacking here we've had hackathons

00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:54,580
happen here for specific projects all

00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:56,350
this rule says is that if you make an

00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:57,760
important decision you have to take it

00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:59,650
back to the mailing list because not

00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:02,290
everyone can make the flight here and

00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:04,120
King makes a time to be here so that

00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:08,429
they can participate in the decision

00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:14,200
making process now what do they mean was

00:19:08,429 --> 00:19:16,270
mailing lists let's not see scary CC

00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:18,730
lists that you have in some companies

00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:21,429
it's one mailing list where everything

00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:24,550
you write you is archived you can go

00:19:21,429 --> 00:19:25,990
back to 1995 for the httpd mailing list

00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:28,990
and still read where everything is

00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:32,380
coming from all of that is searchable

00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:33,400
searchable with a leucine based search

00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:36,850
engine

00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:39,910
somewhat smiling there plus all those

00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:42,550
links are stable so you can link down to

00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:44,290
the specific conversation you can

00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:46,780
reference the conversation in today's

00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:52,600
communication and this link will remain

00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:54,580
stable what does it look like cs1 user

00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:57,220
lists years from death list all of that

00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:59,830
is public like every decision

00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:02,290
my personal checklist as a user but also

00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:04,900
as a developer is documentation public

00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:08,050
both developer documentation and user

00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:10,929
documentation it's roadmap planning

00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:14,710
public is serious some public a user

00:20:10,929 --> 00:20:20,080
support our architecture decisions being

00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:23,080
made in public now everything is public

00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:26,860
everyone can get involved and everyone

00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:32,140
has to be involved does it take ages not

00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:33,880
quite so so for input so you you you can

00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:36,550
make decisions by something called lazy

00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:38,650
consensus and avoid tracking decisions

00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:41,590
forever what that means as you say I'm

00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:45,100
going to make change X within the next

00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:47,620
two days unless someone speaks up you

00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:50,590
wait 42 days nothing happens you can go

00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:55,300
forward you don't have to wait for

00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:57,280
explicit approval if you go to mailing

00:20:55,300 --> 00:21:00,850
this you will see a plus one minus one

00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:04,480
zero what have you so it's just people

00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:06,580
voting on decisions sometimes explicitly

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,590
in a vote stripe sometimes even

00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:10,690
implicitly people just posting plus one

00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:12,970
minus one if you're interested you can

00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:15,420
go to the Apache dog website there are

00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:18,460
even clear rules on how to vote and

00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:22,210
there are rules on vessel something is a

00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:27,130
majority decision or if ser can be hard

00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:29,710
weed vetoes now I told you that

00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:33,040
everything is public right except when

00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:35,050
it's not when a project is discussing

00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:37,990
but whether Nick should get commit right

00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:42,340
that's not gonna be public Google won't

00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:43,840
be able to surface this discussion this

00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:46,030
happens on the private list

00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,670
what does private mean it's private to

00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:51,310
see project

00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:54,640
probably who else can see it directors

00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:55,990
of the foundation can see it and members

00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,740
of the foundation can see it it's like

00:21:55,990 --> 00:22:01,870
700 people so much for true privacy

00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:03,640
that's something you should keep in mind

00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:13,090
when posting something to your private

00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:14,920
list something else those who do the

00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:17,650
work are the ones who did take the

00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:20,050
decisions it's kind of like a scratch

00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:22,450
your own itch kind of thingy so if you

00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:24,640
want to have something done it's better

00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:30,250
to volunteer to help with getting it

00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:32,560
done if you come to a project as someone

00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:36,070
just requesting a new feature because

00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:41,080
that's what you want people tend to ask

00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:42,970
you can you help out taken to the

00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:45,490
extreme before doing Berlin buzzwords

00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:47,350
like oh my gosh that's 11 12 years ago I

00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:51,190
was running a Hadoop meet up here in

00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:53,320
Berlin like meetups goes everyone was

00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:55,330
complaining like I felt like everyone

00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:58,750
was complaining it's the wrong time at

00:22:55,330 --> 00:23:01,060
the wrong place it's the wrong date ok

00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:02,950
you complain here is a woman to be the

00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:05,800
next first speaker and then you set the

00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:12,280
date and time that's how I found

00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:14,680
speakers ok what does that mean what are

00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:20,710
those contributions just could be a

00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:22,330
contribution what else doesn't have to

00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:23,620
be code only it could be conference

00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:25,450
organization could be meetup

00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:27,910
organization could be helping the sea

00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:31,270
keeping the issue tracker clean could be

00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:33,280
user support could be press work could

00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:37,360
be helping missive fixing security

00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:40,380
issues everything that contributes to

00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,380
the success of the project

00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:46,900
so essentially contributions are more

00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:49,870
than just so it's good what do you get

00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:54,760
for a contribution I've learned that

00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:57,280
chocolate works well for bribery some of

00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:59,050
you I don't know if so neil is here but

00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:00,880
some of you may have received droplet

00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:04,440
from me in the past

00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:08,320
I once was offered iTunes vouchers

00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:11,370
except I don't use iTunes what works

00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:13,660
better is a public qualified thank you

00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:16,270
what do I mean biz public qualified

00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:18,340
thank you qualified meaning thank you

00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:21,250
for acts because it helped me do why

00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:23,350
better because this isn't informing me

00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:26,950
as a user how to continue and how to

00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:30,490
help the project even further now for my

00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:33,850
very first contribution that went out to

00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:36,100
a JBoss project what I got was a

00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:39,460
mentioned a thank you in the JIRA issue

00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:41,890
in the commit in the release notes my

00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:44,260
own resistors helpful I could take this

00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:46,300
public thank you go to my manager and

00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:48,430
tell him hey we made a contribution in

00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:50,590
this being made public there he could

00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:52,750
take that go back to his customers and

00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:56,170
say hey we are very active in the open

00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:57,850
source space and suddenly more people in

00:24:56,170 --> 00:25:01,440
our company caught time to inclusive a

00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:04,420
practical open source so this is the

00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:09,610
reasoning behind giving a public thank

00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:11,110
you what else works at least that's the

00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:13,120
Apache Software Foundation is that

00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:16,990
people will give you increased influence

00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:18,820
and increased ownership remember paksy

00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:21,310
project management committees those are

00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:23,950
the people who decide who else to invite

00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:27,550
as a committee this will typically

00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:34,480
happen if you remain committed for long

00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:37,720
enough now we've done a survey at Apache

00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:40,090
on what does the apache way mean to you

00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:44,770
and something some quotes that i like

00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:47,350
was this one i hear very often that

00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:50,250
contributing to open source is kind of a

00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:52,690
de sharing is caring

00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:55,000
now if you every remember houses web

00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:57,460
server was built from people who had a

00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:01,420
business case themselves it actually

00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:04,990
boils down to get gaining by sharing it

00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:08,320
means earning together across boundaries

00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:10,300
across organizations to build something

00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:13,410
that's bigger than anything that you

00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:13,410
could have built on your own

00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:18,820
if you stick around long enough that's

00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:21,280
easy me standing here 15 years later and

00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:25,000
also means building an awesome network

00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:28,030
of bill people across geographies across

00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,740
organizations who meet not only at

00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:34,570
conferences like here but also who

00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:38,410
exchange technological patterns but also

00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:41,890
like stories from from their work

00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:46,900
experience so you get to benefit across

00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:48,760
all of those communities you know it's a

00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:51,100
funny thing is such as influences kind

00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:54,000
of influence doesn't go away marry it

00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:56,530
doesn't go away why is this important

00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,200
clearly you can take a break that's what

00:26:56,530 --> 00:27:01,690
I'm gonna do two days from now going on

00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:04,420
a vacation for three weeks I'm gone I

00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:06,880
can return all good what's more

00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:11,650
important though if you are contributing

00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:14,410
as part of your day job fixing problems

00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:17,620
that you run into it's fine to be there

00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:20,620
very active in January not be active in

00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:23,380
February March April and some become

00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:26,080
active and somewhere again even if you

00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:30,130
switch jobs you're committed status goes

00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:33,670
with you so if three years three years

00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:36,280
ago I was very active I went to a job

00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:37,990
where I cannot be so active anymore but

00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:40,360
because it doesn't align those business

00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:43,530
goals anymore I can switch jobs five

00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:46,330
years later returned back to where I was

00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:54,190
except the technology may have continued

00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:56,020
and evolved but my status remains now

00:27:54,190 --> 00:28:00,370
Apache talks a lot about volunteering

00:27:56,020 --> 00:28:02,320
about things not being paid such does

00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:04,420
that means that everyone is contributing

00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:07,080
after hours we've seen their hands right

00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:09,250
here in the beginning that's not true

00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:11,050
while the Apache Software Foundation

00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:13,840
itself doesn't pay for software

00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:18,150
development that doesn't mean that these

00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:18,150
open-source developers aren't being paid

00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:23,320
they are paid by entities who are

00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:26,350
interested in furthering the projects

00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:27,970
that they have experience with so it

00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:31,750
doesn't mean that all of these people

00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:34,150
are behaving in an altruistic way what's

00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:35,950
the ASF expects us that you act as an

00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:42,970
individual is this easy

00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:45,640
nope so let's take a little bit deeper

00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:47,830
into why people are being paid to work

00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:51,370
on open-source and maybe you can take

00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:53,650
some of these reasons back to your own

00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:56,170
manager in order to explain why you

00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:59,200
should be the one to contribute back to

00:28:56,170 --> 00:29:01,510
take some of your time to work on the

00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:07,150
projects that you hear about today and

00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:10,090
tomorrow it starts with the really easy

00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:11,650
even before using any of the projects

00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:13,540
that you will hear talks about today

00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:16,810
today and tomorrow you want to take a

00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:19,540
look behind the scenes they are being

00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:21,580
developed in the open if before you make

00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:23,530
a decision before or against a

00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:26,530
dependency you want to know how

00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:29,350
decisions are being made you want to

00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:32,650
know who owns the project you want to

00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:35,260
know how trademark issues IP issues are

00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:37,900
being dealt with you want to know how

00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:39,760
security issues are being dealt with for

00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:41,920
that in order to learn that you will

00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:46,330
have to spend some time researching that

00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:48,850
project once you've got it in

00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:51,640
development or even in in production you

00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:53,440
want to learn from the experts much like

00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:56,170
I subscribe to energy development

00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,910
mailing list back in the day you want to

00:29:56,170 --> 00:30:00,850
subscribe to your favorite project as

00:29:57,910 --> 00:30:02,710
well you want to want to learn from

00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:05,890
these experts you want to learn also

00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:11,470
from the users and wanna avoid making

00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:12,940
the same mistakes you want to get in

00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:16,780
touch with those who are actually

00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:19,570
working on those projects that way you

00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:23,890
can extend your team's knowledge beyond

00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:26,170
your own organization and there is

00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:28,870
something important you will learn not

00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:32,060
only the technical skills over time you

00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:34,700
will also gain leadership skills

00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:39,490
leading discussions on these lists

00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:39,490
getting people aligned behind one girl

00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:45,890
now for every single opens those

00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:47,570
projects that I fused in the bar in the

00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:49,820
past there was always some things that

00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:52,520
didn't sit quite right documentation may

00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:56,270
have been wrong some implementation may

00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:59,630
have been not quite right so it's very

00:30:56,270 --> 00:31:02,180
quick said at some point you will start

00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:04,550
working on a patch why should you

00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:06,620
contribute this thing back you can keep

00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:08,720
it in your organization you don't have

00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:12,790
to polish it you don't have to make it

00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:15,620
more reliable or more broadly applicable

00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:18,350
what you gain by contributing it back is

00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:18,830
a you don't have to pay the maintenance

00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:21,590
cost

00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:25,280
next time you upgrade your patch will

00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:27,200
already be integrated and so's making

00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:31,070
modifications will have to take it into

00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:34,430
account when making refactorings but

00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:36,440
also for one of my patches that I sent

00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:39,040
to Apache Tomcat actually what I

00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:41,360
received was valuable feedback on the

00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:43,730
limitations of the changes that I had

00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:46,970
made and how to make it better such that

00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:49,160
it applies in a broader scope so some

00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:52,280
things that I'm changed would have

00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:54,620
broken in production except that see

00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:58,640
actually developers helped me improve

00:31:54,620 --> 00:32:00,710
the patch of course if you're on a

00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:04,000
consultancy it also helps you gain in

00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:07,910
street credibility so you pick

00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:10,490
participate actively you help out you

00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:13,820
are visible like was my first patch to

00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:17,440
see Chavis project so you gain street

00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:20,180
cred abilities that you can show others

00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:22,550
Nena already talked about our sponsors

00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:26,740
you get visibility and that helps with

00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:26,740
employer branding and recruiting clearly

00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:33,140
if you remain active at least at the

00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:36,800
Apache space what you gain is influence

00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:43,100
you can help navigate and skier steer

00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:45,580
Razer ship is going but referring back

00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:49,910
to the quote I gave earlier Bertie

00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:53,180
gaining by sharing but open-source

00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:56,720
enables huge get is to collaborate on a

00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:59,780
project to grow beyond what you your you

00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:02,810
on your own could achieve you work

00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:05,090
together as Bo's friends and competitors

00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:08,090
on a project to build something that

00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:11,240
each single one player wouldn't be able

00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:14,570
to create and with that you will

00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:16,910
innovate much faster you will move much

00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:19,130
faster but you will also build some

00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:23,240
things that's sustainable on in the long

00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:25,310
run so to some extent the communication

00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:28,190
on the patch Sheila's has a bad

00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:31,340
reputation for dragging for a long time

00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:33,650
because it's very consensus driven but

00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:36,920
pulling all of these people around one

00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:39,080
table means that you have a sustainable

00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:46,190
communities that can carry on over

00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:47,930
decades why does it help us well to

00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:50,990
contribute back it helps was pushing

00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:52,670
open standards in order to if you help

00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:55,400
improve the tool links that supports

00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:59,870
those standards more people will be able

00:33:55,400 --> 00:34:04,550
to adopt them of course it can also help

00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:11,950
to further projects set serve as like

00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:11,950
candy for users to use your offerings

00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:21,960
now Apache remains the Switzerland of

00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:24,310
open source the idea is that you

00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:27,190
interact and participate as an

00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:29,590
individual with so many people being

00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:33,090
paid there's a lot of head switching

00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:36,280
going on between being board member and

00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:41,830
committer between being employee of

00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:43,960
company acts and PMC member what helps

00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:47,590
is if people make set hats wiki

00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:49,330
switching explicit this is a little

00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:53,020
anecdote again from a keynote here at

00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:55,870
Berlin buzzwords it was about Hadoop see

00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:58,450
her do pack ecosystem and about see

00:34:55,870 --> 00:35:00,220
YouTube community the person was giving

00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:02,110
really nice keynote about the current

00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:05,740
state affairs and where things were

00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:07,440
going accepts the audience was very

00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:10,270
skeptical

00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:13,260
turns out what's this person had done

00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:16,120
was to use a slide deck from his company

00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:18,790
he wasn't talking company issues at all

00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:20,590
but people were skeptical because it

00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:24,310
wasn't clear which hats this person was

00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:26,620
wearing going forward this was being

00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:29,020
made explicit at the beginning if the

00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:31,360
person was speaking for company X or

00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:34,840
force a project and this we helped very

00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:40,900
much and made it very clear what message

00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:42,160
people were expected to receive so

00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:46,210
catchy doesn't pay for software

00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:49,480
development someone wants a cute pay was

00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:52,240
time and love what I mean was you pavers

00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:55,300
time and lavas you can't pay your way

00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:57,640
into Zeke foundation you can't be pay

00:35:55,300 --> 00:36:00,580
for a board seat you can't pay for

00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:05,500
someone to become a commuter however you

00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:08,140
can pay with your employees time if

00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:11,440
someone is a committer you better retain

00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:13,360
them because they will take their

00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:18,000
committed status with them if said

00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:20,680
switch employers there's one warning so

00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,930
make sure that you do not pay with your

00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:24,430
physical health we did have a keynote

00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:27,280
here a couple years ago and post

00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:29,620
Bonhoeffer from someone talking about

00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,309
seeing negative effects of being a

00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:35,279
software engine

00:36:30,309 --> 00:36:35,279
here make sure to watch out for yourself

00:36:35,549 --> 00:36:41,769
same goes for Mental Health's there are

00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:44,859
even more subtle side side effects if

00:36:41,769 --> 00:36:48,099
you put too much time and love into your

00:36:44,859 --> 00:36:50,170
open sores there are some links oh you

00:36:48,099 --> 00:36:54,039
can't see this judges these funny

00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:56,769
balloons so there is a link as a patchy

00:36:54,039 --> 00:36:58,119
org slash volunteer Rica's even if you

00:36:56,769 --> 00:37:01,479
just google for volunteer eaters you

00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:03,729
will find it which warns about not

00:37:01,479 --> 00:37:05,769
putting too much energy into your open

00:37:03,729 --> 00:37:11,259
source project beyond what's healthy and

00:37:05,769 --> 00:37:14,309
that's very easy to say so you pave us

00:37:11,259 --> 00:37:17,019
time and love except when you're not

00:37:14,309 --> 00:37:18,910
what does the foundation pay for it pays

00:37:17,019 --> 00:37:21,160
for infrastructure machines for people

00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:24,489
working on infrastructure for press for

00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:27,959
legal for travel support for trademarks

00:37:24,489 --> 00:37:27,959
work anything else I've forgotten

00:37:28,109 --> 00:37:35,679
nodding heads okay so how do we pay we

00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:39,219
pay through donations and sponsorship

00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:41,199
programs give us all your money talk to

00:37:39,219 --> 00:37:45,219
fundraising at Apache door org if you

00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:47,289
want to support the foundation what's

00:37:45,219 --> 00:37:48,999
interesting for me and someone who once

00:37:47,289 --> 00:37:50,650
was a user now I'm a member of said

00:37:48,999 --> 00:37:54,249
foundation so is that you are not alone

00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:57,130
on that journey through its focus on

00:37:54,249 --> 00:37:59,619
neutrality apache manages to build

00:37:57,130 --> 00:38:02,609
bridges across organizations - it

00:37:59,619 --> 00:38:05,859
manages to bring people together and

00:38:02,609 --> 00:38:08,799
often the issues that projects are

00:38:05,859 --> 00:38:11,529
facing today aren't new so there are

00:38:08,799 --> 00:38:14,289
people around who know what to do or

00:38:11,529 --> 00:38:17,920
what worked in the past you just have to

00:38:14,289 --> 00:38:21,699
make them speak and speak in a way that

00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:24,279
you understand it so there's a lot of

00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:27,999
best practices related to project

00:38:24,279 --> 00:38:29,650
governance currently the foundation is

00:38:27,999 --> 00:38:32,679
working on making a clearer of rich

00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:37,329
pieces of C governance structure based

00:38:32,679 --> 00:38:40,029
on which experience so it's nice to work

00:38:37,329 --> 00:38:42,730
together to meet in person we are going

00:38:40,029 --> 00:38:46,810
to have an Apache con later this year in

00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:53,230
I believe hosted right here just come

00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:55,510
back here in couple months just many

00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:57,220
other conferences that you can go to the

00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:59,260
funny thing about Apache is that they

00:38:57,220 --> 00:39:02,619
also have links to other open-source

00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:08,040
communities think open JDK sync Debian

00:39:02,619 --> 00:39:08,040
Zink Dockers Inc WCC 3 and many others

00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:13,300
serious experience was dealing with

00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:15,880
poisonous people like if everything is

00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:18,820
public sooner or later you will have

00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:21,310
people that don't fit quite with your

00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:23,859
community there is a nice talks that I

00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:26,170
am NOT going to go deeper into pipe Ryan

00:39:23,859 --> 00:39:28,349
Fitzpatrick and ben collins-sussman on

00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:33,070
dealing with poisonous people

00:39:28,349 --> 00:39:35,910
my recommendation is to watch it but

00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:38,950
really if anything feels overwhelming

00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:43,630
don't be afraid to call that out to ask

00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:45,609
for help so to summarize if you want to

00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:48,819
contribute and you don't want to do this

00:39:45,609 --> 00:39:51,970
after hours go to jail manager right now

00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:55,359
tell them about the advantages both for

00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:59,230
yourself but also for the team and for Z

00:39:55,359 --> 00:40:01,690
company and versed I would like to

00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:04,240
invite you to join both development and

00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:06,730
user at whatever your favorite project

00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:08,910
maybe it was that I'm happy to take

00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:08,910
questions

00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:15,239
[Music]

00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:32,240
any questions otherwise go for coffee

00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:34,800
I'm standing between you and coffee okay

00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:37,980
I'm going to be around today and

00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:39,920
tomorrow if you do have questions just

00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:44,979
