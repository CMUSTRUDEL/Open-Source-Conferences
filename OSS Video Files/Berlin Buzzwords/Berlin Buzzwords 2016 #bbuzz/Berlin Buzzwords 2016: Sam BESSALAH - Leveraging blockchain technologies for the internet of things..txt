Title: Berlin Buzzwords 2016: Sam BESSALAH - Leveraging blockchain technologies for the internet of things.
Publication date: 2016-06-11
Playlist: Berlin Buzzwords 2016 #bbuzz
Description: 
	Blockchains are usually assimilated to bitcoins, but in reality they are much more than being the Bitcoin Network backbone.

On one hand, the "Blockchain" can be seen as a distributed, peer to peer log like system, on top of which distributed applications can be built with security, encryption and accountability.

And on the other hand, we are  transitioning to an age of smart devices, with a need to communicate in a Machine to Machine fashion, with security, and scale that make a centralized architecture not viable in the long term.

In this session, we intend to introduce the blockchain as a scalable and secure solution, on top of which critical IoT applications can be built, by using examples from the Ethereum Project to implement smart contracts, and embed more intelligence into smart devices without relying on a centralized system.

like I think many of you here I work as

00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:10,920
a data engineer so my day job is

00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:12,960
actually building data file data

00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,839
pipelines using things like cough cough

00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,060
links park so I don't do block chains or

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,680
Bitcoin on my day job this is something

00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:22,170
just that I grew up out of interest

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,570
because I'm really passionate about

00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:27,630
distributed systems and what you can do

00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,460
with it and Bitcoin beyond the financial

00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:32,189
aspect before I beyond what you can do

00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:35,370
with it today when we do the trading

00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:37,770
aspect of Bitcoin so ah in this talk

00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:40,469
we're going to talk about not especially

00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:43,620
Bitcoin or we'll talk about it but

00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:45,570
mostly block chain and some of the work

00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:49,860
that has been going on to actually use

00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:51,270
blockchain not just for financial

00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,010
application like I said like asset

00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,149
management but beyond the standard

00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:59,100
application but actually build

00:00:54,149 --> 00:01:04,860
blockchains within connected devices so

00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:06,990
as I said that this is me so just so you

00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:09,030
know I'm not a very very block chain

00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,680
expert I just play spend a lot of time

00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:15,119
reading peppers on it working on it for

00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:17,549
fun so bear with me here so today when

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,650
you see what you all over the place all

00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:21,780
of the time you hear people talking

00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:24,600
about block chains for almost everything

00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,820
so let's build a block chain for that

00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,860
let block chain for this and at some

00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,659
point you like okay what exactly do we

00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:33,000
want to do with block chains there's one

00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:35,640
like every technology there comes a time

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,079
when it's over hyped and at some point

00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,939
to forget really what we can do with it

00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:41,009
so the main aspect of block chain has

00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:43,049
always been about being things that

00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:45,270
underpins Bitcoin but today it's going

00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:48,420
beyond that so I've had this thing was

00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:51,450
this drawing from Gilbert from did Bert

00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,979
was very interesting on on how people

00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:54,960
actually interested in block chains and

00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:58,500
somehow it's evolving too fast and it's

00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:01,140
hard to catch up and like everything

00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:03,000
that's over hype they call the block

00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,310
chain or bit coy but trust machine you

00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,840
see that you see on all every financial

00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:09,539
publications today that at some point

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,030
you wondering exactly how what are we

00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:12,660
what's the point really with this with

00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:22,110
this block chain

00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:24,420
so sorry let me yeah so before we go

00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:27,210
into blockchain let's say a quick word

00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:29,640
about Bitcoin I'm sure everybody here

00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:31,920
knows about Bitcoin who doesn't know

00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,860
about Bitcoin good everyone has good

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,380
good that's that's that so away to it's

00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:39,120
a a peer-to-peer version of money

00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:42,570
actually it's a digital cryptocurrency

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,760
money that's has been created by this

00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:48,660
guy we thought we know him but it's not

00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:51,000
him eventually Satoshi Nakamoto and the

00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:53,540
real Bitcoin get entrapped is beyond

00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,770
being a currency a cryptocurrency

00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:58,290
because it's actually a combination of

00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:00,510
many things one of them is that and now

00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:04,170
a peer-to-peer architecture actually

00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:06,360
that you can see like BitTorrent but

00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:10,200
with public cryptography I a concepts

00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:12,720
inside and it's also a secure backbone

00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,280
network where all the transactions

00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,540
actually public and available for

00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:19,830
everyone and that's secure backbone

00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:23,610
later where all the transactions are

00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:26,310
recorded is called the blockchain so the

00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:29,130
bludgeon is like I said a decentralized

00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:32,280
ledger for all the transactions and it

00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:35,280
underpins very badly if internals of

00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:38,030
Bitcoin network and it wills are out of

00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:41,280
blocks which are actually a batch of

00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:43,380
transactions and they are aligned in a

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,850
sequential manner in a secure energy

00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:48,270
control mouse so what you can see here

00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:50,730
is that one block has a lot of two has a

00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:53,730
batch of transactions and it has a link

00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:55,620
to the previous hash which is a links to

00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:57,360
the next block an order block all over

00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:00,020
that we come back I'll come back a

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:03,180
little bit on how it works a bit inside

00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:05,190
so one interesting figured with the

00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:07,800
block chain is that every node of this

00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:10,770
distributed ledger has a full copy of

00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:12,959
all the data that inside the block chain

00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:14,070
so you can you appeal to your

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,720
organization you don't have just a

00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:17,669
single property have all the data that

00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,260
actually order the data actually in the

00:04:17,669 --> 00:04:20,700
in the block chain which makes it very

00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,710
interesting compared to what you have

00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:24,419
with databases that are disputed the

00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:26,070
database like Cassandra where you can

00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:29,010
have all the data but not always

00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:30,930
you can't have all the data of course

00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:32,340
but you have some part of the data but

00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:34,260
you can tune your consistency the

00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:36,810
blockchain is when you write something

00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:38,850
it's usually broadcasted everywhere so

00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:42,960
the data is available for everyone in

00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:45,330
the Indian network and the process of

00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,580
adding a transaction because when you

00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:49,380
actually using bitcoins on blockchain go

00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:52,470
to that which is doing our transactions

00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:55,250
so that's a simple an interesting way to

00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:57,480
actually do a transaction so when you

00:04:55,250 --> 00:05:00,690
doing a transaction which is the process

00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:03,030
of evil buying mind doing anything with

00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:05,790
Bitcoin you broadcast your transaction

00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:09,450
that's the first way even nodes will

00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:10,710
create a block we've with all the

00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:12,570
transaction that predator has already

00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:16,410
seen so that's the batch of transaction

00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:18,920
and it randomly pits when it only picks

00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:20,970
with the data of love and mud and

00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:23,010
broadcast it to a and broadcast the

00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:24,960
block to all over nodes and the other

00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:26,790
nodes we have to receive and validate

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,910
this blog and if it's very dated the

00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:31,560
block to the copy of the change so they

00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:33,300
had the block they had to validate first

00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,130
block of Attraction actually that's here

00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:37,170
and then broadcast without 2002 all over

00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:39,600
the place and then the atoms with copy

00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:41,460
of the block chain but that's an easy

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,480
way but in reality it's a bit more

00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:47,760
complex than that so this is how a real

00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:49,440
block chain looks like this is the data

00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:52,380
that contained in the block chain so you

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,360
have a header that's the public that's

00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:56,730
the non-encrypted usually part of the

00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,560
block chain and timestamp you have the

00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:01,050
difficulty have all visitor that's there

00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,330
and you have something inside that's

00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:05,310
called a miracle tree so for those who

00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:07,650
do that Cassandra I think you know what

00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:10,710
the marquetry is so it's very

00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:13,890
interesting it's very good to summarize

00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:16,530
and verify the integrity of huge data so

00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:19,560
that's very fine so they are in many

00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:21,920
databases anyway and they wilt using

00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:25,050
cryptographic hashes now in the Bitcoin

00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:26,850
blockchain what you have today is that

00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:28,620
all the transaction are actually

00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:31,650
fingerprinted using a digital digital

00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:34,340
digital cryptographic key so you can

00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:37,810
verify them and make them auditable and

00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:39,520
will the cryptographic hash that's been

00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:43,630
used in the block chain is something

00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:45,550
that you will wish are 256 but it's

00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:51,130
applied twice so usually call it the

00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:52,750
rubbish sha the shade 256 double so yes

00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:55,540
that's what you have in a local tree so

00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:58,000
the way it looks like is that in the

00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:59,889
block chain like you have something like

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,010
a linked list you have the mercury woods

00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:05,380
that's here that's where you have the

00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:07,870
roots of all the hashes and the data is

00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:10,630
so installed way below when you have

00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:12,760
only a one hash at the end that's where

00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:14,320
you can store the data so you double

00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:17,830
hash all the way all the way around and

00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:20,139
this allows you to store many many data

00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:22,300
in just making just many many

00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:24,100
transaction or one transaction many men

00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:26,290
transaction in just one block so that's

00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:28,900
why we can have actually multiple data

00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:32,320
in unblock in one block of the of the

00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:34,030
chin so this is what you have we've we

00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,710
this is what the book shall look like

00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:37,660
and this is what Roman fur traders so

00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:39,550
the more country is really important to

00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:41,169
all the block chain so every time every

00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:43,270
time you hear about blockchain most of

00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:44,740
the time when people talks about the

00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:49,120
architecture of the blockchain you hear

00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:51,039
about market risk so another problem if

00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,890
you have a distributed architecture like

00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:56,590
this is how do you solve the issue of

00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:58,330
consensus so consistent for all of you

00:07:56,590 --> 00:08:02,470
do that a district system you know that

00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:05,560
it's a hard problem and the Bitcoin

00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:08,139
paper and Bitcoin proclaims to actually

00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:10,539
solve the issue of consensus by solving

00:08:08,139 --> 00:08:13,360
with non problem of the Byzantine

00:08:10,539 --> 00:08:15,130
general problem ah that's a lot of

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,110
discussions will go with that but yes

00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:18,610
that's that's another thing i'm not

00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:20,710
going to dive into this kind of thing

00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:23,650
that the way this term the consensus is

00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:26,110
for the process called mining so miners

00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:28,810
are mining is the process where miners

00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:31,090
create blocks but to create blogs you

00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:33,520
need to solve an integral integral

00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:35,860
actually a hard chana a cryptographic

00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:38,140
challenge which literally actually does

00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:40,360
to doing real brute brute force that's

00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:42,400
why when people talk about Bitcoin and

00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:44,920
block chain they say that it's just

00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:46,690
about wasting energy because it's so

00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,280
expensive to actually create blog to

00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:51,130
solve this cryptographic challenge today

00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:54,100
that mining bitcoin is really expensive

00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:56,680
and that's challenge of solving of that

00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:58,270
challenge keeps increasing every time so

00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:00,370
this is for example this is a graph I

00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:02,200
don't know if one can see this I took

00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:04,990
this just a few minutes ago from

00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:07,420
blockchain that info that actually gives

00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:09,730
you an idea how the challenge of solving

00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:13,720
this thing is is growing it's actually

00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:15,190
expanding so this is a bit hard and this

00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,170
process there's a process called proof

00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:19,330
of work where you actually have a new

00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:21,280
blog add a new blog every 10 minutes but

00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:26,110
to do that it's a bit expensive so how

00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:28,390
does it work you have a big idea is

00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:32,230
actually to find a hashing key that's

00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:34,960
less than a certain value so you do a

00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:36,610
random things that's you hush hush until

00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:39,040
and it's a really expensive until you

00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:40,210
get the proper value you lets the proper

00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:44,230
value of your hash that's below a

00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:47,170
certain threshold so to sum up how the

00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:49,720
Bitcoin block chain works is that you

00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:51,130
have 10 minutes of transaction that our

00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,490
broadcast is to all the miners the

00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:56,680
manners are the ones who create blogs

00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:58,570
you send your transaction to minors the

00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:01,120
manners try to create blog the have a

00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:02,770
puzzle they do the proof of work to say

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,350
that they have spent enough energy

00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:07,780
actually to be able to create new value

00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:09,550
bitcoins and this is the successful

00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:12,370
manner with broadcast is proof of work

00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:15,190
to other miners and once the verify it

00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:16,990
they can restart the process so the

00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:19,810
Bitcoin block chain is built upon the

00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:22,660
idea is that creating new blocks has to

00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:25,150
be a really expensive really costly but

00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:26,800
verifying your you do with 800 you block

00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:30,910
the chef created has to be easy for all

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:35,860
over the software for other people so

00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:37,870
that was bitcoin bitcoin his blah blah

00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:39,790
that's sometimes what started particular

00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:41,890
that words that's what that's the basis

00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:44,140
that's the baseline that's we're trying

00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:46,750
to emulate today we've it's a block

00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:49,720
chain but bitcoin has actually sprung a

00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:51,820
lot of over al Cowen's not meaning other

00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:53,230
cryptocurrencies that look like Bitcoin

00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:56,170
but are not really bit gods and that

00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:58,600
those over cryptocurrencies actually

00:10:56,170 --> 00:11:01,060
come with their own block chain and one

00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,680
of the most heard of blockchain today

00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:04,810
let's we've been talking about easy

00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:07,029
theorem block chain

00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:08,800
it's a a new project but it's girls

00:11:07,029 --> 00:11:12,700
actually beyond what you have with

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:14,980
Bitcoin it's a huge block chain and what

00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:19,600
you can do with advantage of actually

00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:22,990
having III reham ET arrium is actually

00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:25,420
because it's really versatile and it

00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:27,430
works unlisted of contracts contracts

00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:29,560
actually code that has that can be

00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:31,870
executed that's stored on the blockchain

00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:35,110
on each one block chain and can be

00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:38,410
executed at one by automatically

00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:41,080
executed and those country contracts do

00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:42,520
not have to be financial application

00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,050
they don't have to be currencies don't

00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:45,790
have to be bit going there'll have to be

00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:47,410
money they can be any type of

00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:49,750
application that you can write actually

00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:51,430
so you can build with those contracts

00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:53,740
things like currencies of watching

00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:56,440
systems financial district and financial

00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:58,630
derivatives make talk a lot of

00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:01,150
applications or either what we call

00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:03,610
today decentralized application so

00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:06,310
basically what the interim block chain

00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:07,900
is is the block chain for all everything

00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:10,930
all type of application that's what you

00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:14,410
can do with it so at the core of the

00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:18,220
atrium is what's called a smart contract

00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:22,290
but on the Bitcoin blockchain the

00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:24,970
currency is Bitcoin that's the unit of

00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:27,790
computing there that's the Bitcoin in

00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:30,820
this in the HMO it's called eater so

00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:34,210
ether is what is what's actually poor as

00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:36,670
well underlying blockchain so what you

00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:40,270
have is smart contracts smart contracts

00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:42,550
is actually a simple application a block

00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:45,430
of code that actually stored on the

00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:48,339
block chain so what you do is that to

00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:50,050
call a smart contracts like you have an

00:12:48,339 --> 00:12:51,820
idea here i Wasi groups have an address

00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:53,709
which is a little bit clearer the

00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:55,930
balance donated so you still have the

00:12:53,709 --> 00:12:58,270
idea of actually money but that money is

00:12:55,930 --> 00:13:01,270
a little bit eater but that's not the

00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:04,020
point here but what you have is that you

00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:06,970
call that contract and when it's done

00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:08,890
the execution stop the moment that mode

00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:11,620
that amount is gone now you can use

00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:15,700
smart contracts between without eater

00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:17,070
that's okay it just looks that's called

00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:19,230
a an account so

00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:20,790
in the Bitcoin you have money you have

00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:22,770
accounts while let's see this kind of

00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:24,120
things I didn't talk about them but this

00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:26,820
is what you have a smart contract with a

00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:29,370
little bit what it looks like so here

00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:32,250
what you have it's just a huge a small

00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:34,710
amount of data with an address I balance

00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:36,870
some fields that you can have this is a

00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:40,650
smart contracted did at a hackathon in

00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:42,330
Paris for a meetup which actually a

00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:44,550
meetup smart contract we use a

00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:46,050
blockchain to actually count count when

00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:48,510
other people attending meet ups or not

00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:50,310
so just for the sake of fun of it so you

00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:52,620
can have an event one I don't know if

00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:54,330
you decide to meetup com but we wanted

00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:56,520
to build something like that but totally

00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:57,960
decentralized but using rupture so this

00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:01,380
is what the smart contract of a meter

00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:04,380
looked like so it's just a balance and

00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:06,570
address methods events and this you can

00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:07,800
write some codes inside of it those that

00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:09,810
code is called a decentralized

00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:13,230
application that's contained inside the

00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:16,350
smart contract and to write smart

00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:18,690
contracts you have a lot of application

00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:22,500
another way to do that I have a lot of

00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:23,880
languages the most the most popular one

00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:26,510
that's actually supported by the

00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:29,220
platform is called solidity it looks

00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:31,650
it's not very hi jata Hodge looks like

00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:33,900
javascript anyway and on top of solidity

00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:36,690
they have built a lot of other contracts

00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:38,280
that's a lot of other things that's like

00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:41,430
a framework a JavaScript framework

00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:42,840
called web free which stands for the wii

00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:45,480
decentralized web but is an application

00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:49,170
on top of that so here's the code and

00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:51,210
this is how it's actually translated

00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:53,640
within the within the secret i'll be in

00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:56,430
the code inside a tree on blockchain so

00:14:53,640 --> 00:15:00,060
here i can write a simple contract for

00:14:56,430 --> 00:15:02,160
older what I'm going to transfer all the

00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:04,700
data just the simple code that looks

00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,750
like really nothing in particular and

00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:08,250
like I said you can build the

00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:10,290
centralized application centralized

00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:12,150
application actually composed on front

00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:13,890
end where you can interact and the back

00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:16,710
and restore the back end is usually a

00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:19,320
simple block chain so what you do is

00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:21,060
that you write a solidity contract which

00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:24,840
looks like the language here on that you

00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:26,820
have there yeah sorry that you had that

00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:30,570
you have there and you compile them

00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:33,270
using web 3gs for example here

00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:35,760
and then you can try on locally locally

00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:37,740
you can create your own III on

00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:41,160
blockchain that looks that it's usually

00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:42,840
called a test shin or or or a private

00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,640
each run network so that's something

00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:47,580
that's local and then you can push them

00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:50,130
later on using these tools into the

00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:52,520
global HR on blockchain so each one

00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:54,900
block down as you can see here has as

00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:56,690
many implementation that the freemen

00:15:54,900 --> 00:16:00,900
implementation today have the goo

00:15:56,690 --> 00:16:02,400
implementation of the etm + pi the bikes

00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:06,270
on a tray of the bite on implementation

00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:08,090
and the original one in c++ we see why

00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:11,640
i'm talking about this in a minute and

00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:13,260
the ghoul yttrium platform it's very

00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:16,860
interesting because it runs on many

00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:19,740
platforms on linux OS x and especially

00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:21,240
on arm which makes sense because we've

00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:24,900
tried to run these kind of things on

00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:27,060
small devices with low power and since

00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:28,620
each room I can do whatever I like and

00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:30,750
one thing I didn't talk is that's when

00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:32,520
it comes to performance on the Bitcoin

00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:34,800
blockchain you have to wait 10 minutes

00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:36,960
for a transition to appear to all the

00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,820
other nodes within a of each one block

00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:40,980
chain it takes something close to 10

00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:45,690
seconds it's a little bit more

00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:50,250
performance so this is the atrium

00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:52,650
implementation in go which is itself

00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:55,320
very entry which is which in itself is

00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:57,150
quite interesting so like I said you

00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:59,100
have you can take them and run them in

00:16:57,150 --> 00:17:00,690
multiple in multiple platforms that's

00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,880
what makes this the interest in hand

00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:05,760
since its goal it has a lot of memory

00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:09,079
footprint so it works very well on small

00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:11,970
devices with low I with low power so

00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:14,240
what you what we actually have of

00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:16,560
blockchain is something that's secure

00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:20,060
transparent have a dispute consensus and

00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:22,740
something well that's auditable and

00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:25,530
since we add burswood the block chain

00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:27,209
being one best boards let's talk in LA

00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:30,210
but another bus world which is the

00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:32,100
Internet of Things I think other unless

00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:35,460
you've been living under a rock you have

00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:37,680
heard but I would T I mean that's all

00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:41,090
over the place so they predicting that

00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:43,960
we have will have a huge amount of

00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:45,809
connected devices in the coming

00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:48,850
in the coming monday coming years I

00:17:45,809 --> 00:17:50,799
still haven't seen not seeing them all

00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:53,110
over the places but they're predicting

00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:55,690
that we have many of them so that's nice

00:17:53,110 --> 00:18:00,580
already and they're everywhere literally

00:17:55,690 --> 00:18:02,830
so on thermometer on your phone you have

00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:07,260
things like this I simple Raspberry Pi

00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:09,520
and yes they're all over the place so

00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:10,840
look the most popular one when you want

00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:15,220
to have fun if you have to tinker with

00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:17,529
with IOT you take small things like this

00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:19,720
is the Raspberry Pi portal which is

00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:22,450
another computer it has one gig of ram

00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:25,149
and all of the things inside and you can

00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:28,750
take or do arduino which is really a

00:18:25,149 --> 00:18:30,220
microcontroller but it reads way more

00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:33,970
limited than what you have in our

00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:37,990
Raspberry Pi and what you have today is

00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:40,840
that we have consumer electronics that

00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:43,779
are network so that was the first of the

00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:45,370
first wave and we have industry that are

00:18:43,779 --> 00:18:46,990
actually connected through all the

00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:49,480
devices that is wise the devices are

00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:51,669
talking to each other and the first wave

00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:54,399
is that everything that's coming up is

00:18:51,669 --> 00:18:57,399
going to have a devices connected to the

00:18:54,399 --> 00:19:00,490
internet so that's apparently what we

00:18:57,399 --> 00:19:02,470
going and the only issue is that what

00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:05,080
you usually have today is that all of

00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:06,520
the design all of these devices want to

00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:08,559
try to talk to each other they have to

00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:10,600
go for the internet but what I called

00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:13,299
Internet of Things so they always have

00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:17,440
some way to go for a central authority

00:19:13,299 --> 00:19:20,440
and other things that has been seeing

00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:23,710
lately is that you have a lot of

00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:27,130
security gaps in the coyote world so

00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:30,149
like Jeep calling our many many a lot of

00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:33,399
his vehicles to fix some of the bugs and

00:19:30,149 --> 00:19:36,010
even people hacking your frigerators I

00:19:33,399 --> 00:19:37,899
mean why do you hurt my dear why would

00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:39,490
you want to do that but yes since

00:19:37,899 --> 00:19:42,270
everything is something is connected to

00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:46,960
the Internet today that always is a

00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:48,789
security issue so IBM came up with this

00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,409
thing is that the limitation today is

00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:53,049
that you have broken business models

00:19:50,409 --> 00:19:55,570
when it comes to internet surveys lack

00:19:53,049 --> 00:19:57,639
of privacy the not future proof and

00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:59,499
they're very expensive to deploy

00:19:57,639 --> 00:20:02,979
so what you want to do is actually

00:19:59,499 --> 00:20:05,649
change that and what you usually have

00:20:02,979 --> 00:20:07,629
before is that all the centralized

00:20:05,649 --> 00:20:10,029
attended IOT networks talk to a central

00:20:07,629 --> 00:20:12,609
authority today they talk to the cloud

00:20:10,029 --> 00:20:13,989
but it still centralized and what you

00:20:12,609 --> 00:20:16,239
want tomorrow is actually all this

00:20:13,989 --> 00:20:18,279
application to actually be totally

00:20:16,239 --> 00:20:20,229
decentralized so how do we come to a

00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:23,559
place where all I OT devices are

00:20:20,229 --> 00:20:26,259
completely decentralized so Samsung and

00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:29,139
IBM came up with a project called adept

00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:31,989
project publish a paper on it it's a

00:20:29,139 --> 00:20:35,440
simple proof of concept but what they

00:20:31,989 --> 00:20:37,539
want to do is actually good tackle some

00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:41,489
of the challenges in the IOT world the

00:20:37,539 --> 00:20:44,619
costs will lack of trust how to monetize

00:20:41,489 --> 00:20:46,690
interoperability discovery or toxic

00:20:44,619 --> 00:20:48,519
ations and all of these problems that

00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:51,429
actually we know today that's drawn

00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:53,440
invitation when it comes to IOT and what

00:20:51,429 --> 00:20:55,929
they actually want to see is something

00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,719
that you build you want they want to

00:20:55,929 --> 00:21:01,570
build digital market places within

00:20:57,719 --> 00:21:03,820
connected device an economy of devices

00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:06,700
but that are actually intelligence so

00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:08,979
willed intro device agreements direct

00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:11,409
payments between devices and service

00:21:08,979 --> 00:21:12,579
resources between those devices and the

00:21:11,409 --> 00:21:15,249
good thing is that they came up of a

00:21:12,579 --> 00:21:17,649
demo but so long ago so it was kind of

00:21:15,249 --> 00:21:20,200
interesting and they came up with an

00:21:17,649 --> 00:21:23,109
architecture where you have multiple

00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:24,489
layers well you have devices that use

00:21:23,109 --> 00:21:26,229
blockchain technology to actually

00:21:24,489 --> 00:21:27,459
communicate with each other and the

00:21:26,229 --> 00:21:29,349
layer where you can build application

00:21:27,459 --> 00:21:32,529
now not going to dive into this but this

00:21:29,349 --> 00:21:33,820
is just a simple idea so one of the use

00:21:32,529 --> 00:21:37,119
case that came up with is to actually

00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:39,279
have a dishwasher dishwasher no a away

00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:41,889
as a washing machine so the washing

00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:45,299
machine actually buys itself detergent

00:21:41,889 --> 00:21:47,979
if it lacks so what it does is it using

00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:51,129
ether money to make orders using a

00:21:47,979 --> 00:21:53,200
blockchain to buy automatically are the

00:21:51,129 --> 00:21:56,889
Trojans because it's lagging so that's

00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:58,899
what it's going today this it makes it

00:21:56,889 --> 00:22:00,519
stupid idea but it's a good way to start

00:21:58,899 --> 00:22:02,950
on the funny thing is that they come up

00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:04,869
of the real video at CES in January that

00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:07,299
actually demoed this thing so it's kind

00:22:04,869 --> 00:22:10,269
of fun and it's working quite well so

00:22:07,299 --> 00:22:11,370
the device is not going to make the

00:22:10,269 --> 00:22:15,480
order to check

00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:19,140
John's going to notify the user of owner

00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:21,240
of the device about the lack of the lack

00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:23,250
of detergent and make a service request

00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:26,160
to a service van drove through the block

00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:28,320
chain and the same thing they can

00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:30,330
validate the one the warranty through

00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,130
the vendors actually in the same way so

00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:34,380
you have devices what you have in the

00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:36,180
complete decentralize economy not just

00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:37,800
between people actually using the blood

00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:39,630
chamber even devices actually going for

00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:42,809
the abrupt change themselves so it's the

00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:45,179
same thing and what they actually came

00:22:42,809 --> 00:22:47,850
up with is a universal digital digital

00:22:45,179 --> 00:22:49,950
ledger so like able still still a

00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:52,470
blockchain specified for the digital

00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:55,710
devices where you can register device or

00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:58,980
25 to 30 kids new devices write

00:22:55,710 --> 00:23:01,770
contracts to actually have device make

00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:04,470
make Emma make the cooperation between

00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:06,270
themselves and a lot of other things so

00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:07,410
this is just a proof concept but it says

00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:12,540
that there's something that can be done

00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:14,370
with this and like I said today most I

00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:15,900
think are either centralized or see my

00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:18,480
centralized but you want something that

00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:20,550
really decentralized but it comes with a

00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,830
security risk as well and you have

00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:25,410
domain problem if I ET today is really

00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:27,900
security so that these consortium called

00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:30,390
channel things that did something

00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:33,090
similar to what you have we've with IBM

00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:35,730
but they use solar power solar meals so

00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:38,700
instead they actually use a way to load

00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:41,100
the data and to prove that you can

00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:43,500
secure the speed these layers they added

00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:45,450
some checks and some some challenges to

00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:47,280
be to work on this is still a working

00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:49,380
project in progress so you have solar

00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:51,450
middle that actually gets the data push

00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:53,400
the data inside a block chair it's using

00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:54,900
this is instead of having a theory on

00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,980
this is the block the Bitcoin block

00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:58,440
chain so they're using something called

00:23:55,980 --> 00:24:00,480
bit seed which is a connected devices

00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:02,220
you connect device with a blockchain

00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,809
already inside so I just have to connect

00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:08,400
it goes through the block chain itself

00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:10,260
and its sit still do something so the

00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:13,110
main problem the to try to serve is

00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:14,580
actually to have to check about the

00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:18,840
first auto type authenticity

00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:21,240
authenticity of the data and how do you

00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:24,150
manage security between the data from

00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:25,680
the devices to the lasers

00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:27,450
and how do you maintain that data

00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:29,010
security and how do you share those

00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:30,120
translation so does a still question

00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:31,740
that people are still working on but

00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:35,120
today you can do that yeah with enjoy

00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:37,950
yourself so if you want to get started

00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:40,080
if you want to do your own IOT

00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:42,570
blockchain but put something like

00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:44,370
etherium in a raspberry device in were

00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:46,110
speeding for example there's a way

00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:48,630
actually just going to resp node you

00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:50,810
download a specific distribution aware

00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:55,170
you have can all you can order a

00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:58,350
specific raspberry pie with all with

00:24:55,170 --> 00:25:01,260
abduction already inside or you can go

00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:03,870
yourself within your own raspberry and I

00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:05,280
style any tea on blockchain within yo yo

00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:07,080
yo yourself that's something that's

00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,580
quite easy to do it's just a linux

00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:13,050
command and then you can write your

00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:15,000
smart contract I'm going to be just like

00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:16,680
it a little bit so a smirk on a smart

00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,110
contract is actually quite easy this is

00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:21,900
just a blinker you use something like

00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:23,010
web free the one that I mentioned you

00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:25,770
have a debit card is straightforward

00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:27,420
just JavaScript anyway you can write the

00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:31,530
same thing and go as well so you have

00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:35,160
other bindings for that and then check

00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:37,740
the connection to to your blood to go to

00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:51,020
to to the blockchain your contract

00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:51,020
address I'm sorry oh yeah sorry okay

00:25:51,900 --> 00:26:01,290
so the code is really is really not hard

00:25:56,430 --> 00:26:03,810
so yes this is it and just go on the

00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:05,670
internet writing a simple smart contract

00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:07,080
and then using these two Pusha T to push

00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:09,600
a contract within on each one block

00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:11,880
chain it was quite a quite handily it's

00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:17,070
not it's really has so here are plagued

00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:18,690
with in both the the blinking of the

00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:21,570
blocks and this was supposed to actually

00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:27,350
light a set up a lightning between a

00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:27,350
light between our 444 lamp and that's it

00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:35,610
so and since we're in Berlin I don't

00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:42,420
know but that this company called slug

00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:44,760
it if which are okay yeah it's a bit

00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:47,310
slow this this is company called slow

00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:49,260
kids and smoke it is actually a startup

00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:51,690
that start actually building et rien

00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:53,970
computer actually the building a an

00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:56,610
embedded device egnater i'm using ubuntu

00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:59,520
snappy that's a small a lowly Lupo a

00:26:56,610 --> 00:27:01,800
low-power able to platform and within it

00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,420
within this is what these devices they

00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,890
actually built a home computer and now

00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:07,380
they going for something a little bit

00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:08,820
bigger that's good with deal I think I

00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:10,680
don't know if you heard about it that's

00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:12,950
the decentralized autonomous organism or

00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:15,530
organization basically it's building

00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:18,480
total distant relies organization

00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:20,940
without central authorities but it

00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,040
raised a lot of money but the using each

00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:25,140
one block chain for that but there are

00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:27,090
people actually some people i work with

00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:29,850
were actually experiencing this to

00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:36,270
actually have a deal a deal but for

00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:38,730
connected devices so that's all ahead so

00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:45,590
thank you for listening if you have any

00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:45,590
question but thank you sir

00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:54,050
we indeed have 10 minutes for question

00:27:48,920 --> 00:28:02,150
of who wants to fire the first one speak

00:27:54,050 --> 00:28:04,130
to heart it seems I have one I in the

00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:07,550
last at the last PI data conference

00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:12,100
there was um Trent I can't remember his

00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:15,620
surname I'm talking about a new

00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:17,690
blockchain database called blockchain DB

00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:20,240
have you got agenda the big 20

00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:21,710
regardless if I know about big chanderi

00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:26,570
it's a really interesting project

00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:28,640
actually you see that the thing the guys

00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:31,160
on the Big Ten did we try to do instead

00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:33,740
of going for I have a blockchain and

00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:35,840
then build a database or that access

00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:37,520
layer on top of it like you would think

00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:40,100
to do they want with a distributed

00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:42,260
database and added the concept of block

00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:44,270
chains on top of it so they try to

00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:46,040
enhance to take the good ideas that have

00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:49,160
into block chain but actually creates a

00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:51,620
database it's still in its infancy I

00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:52,670
haven't used it for real application yet

00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:54,470
but it's something that's going to

00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:56,780
select albicans right so it's very nice

00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:58,220
and I think they're picking up some

00:28:56,780 --> 00:29:00,230
steam now because when people are

00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:02,900
interested actually having block chain

00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:05,270
is not just for photo project like I do

00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:06,980
offer for Bitcoin mining these kind of

00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:08,930
things but actually for storing data

00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:10,340
because the idea is out there because

00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:13,120
you have limitation that you have to in

00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:15,320
most data today's have privacy autumn

00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:17,090
what is the ability with this kind of

00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:19,220
thing so bringing them into the world of

00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:21,140
databases it's quite interesting and one

00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:23,210
good thing one thing for example that's

00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:26,120
going on is actually people building

00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:28,640
data processing for risk for risk well

00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:32,390
for some you have derivatives of

00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:35,750
financial risk using the debt level of a

00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:39,050
block chain or Bitcoin or eater for that

00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:41,090
but actually using loop or devices that

00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:43,220
run the processing in the Bitcoin in do

00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:46,310
in in the in the block chain so they're

00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:48,500
doing this kind of work I think we still

00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:50,060
at the very beginning of this kind the

00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:52,010
steel rod talk when it comes to

00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:53,870
blockchain technology today but there

00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:56,600
are still there are also real projects

00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:59,040
going on diction TV is a nice a nice

00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:07,090
project as well

00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:09,850
any more questions I guess okay so thank

00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:13,230
you very much for coming let's thank you

00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:13,230
