Title: Berlin Buzzwords 2016: Ellen Friedman - The Surprising Course of Knowledge and Innovation #bbuzz
Publication date: 2016-06-12
Playlist: Berlin Buzzwords 2016 #bbuzz
Description: 
	Distributed Systems are a complex topic. There's abundant research about it but sometimes it is hard for a beginner to know where to start. I would like to outline the main concepts of distributed systems, so the interested person can have a clear path on how to start their own research as well.

In this talk I will review the different models: asynchronous vs. synchronous distributed systems; message passing vs shared memory communication; failure detectors and leader election problems; consensus and different kinds of replication.

I will also review a series of books on distributed systems in order to recommend the best one according to the topics we would like to learn about, or the problems we would like to solve.

The goal of the talk is to set a good foundation for people interested in learning more about distributed systems

if I step forward i can actually see

00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:08,400
there are people out there that's a good

00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:11,550
thing well thank you all for coming to

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,889
this talk this is the fifth buzz words

00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:16,049
I've been to and I am a great fan let's

00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:20,119
see if I can actually aim two directions

00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:20,119
at once here and get it to progress no

00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:36,149
okay to work you okay I just do it from

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:46,860
here I don't know why this is one more

00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:51,780
try alright so I am a consultant i work

00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:53,460
for map our technologies in san jose i'm

00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,780
pretty good at some things but

00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,539
apparently not very good at getting the

00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,579
slide clicker to work i'm in a Riley

00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:01,530
author and also a committer on the

00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:04,140
Apache drill I'm Patti mahout projects

00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:07,520
I'll repeat this contact information at

00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:10,110
the end so today won't talk to you about

00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,240
the ways that people come to knowledge

00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:13,950
and innovation some things that have

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,869
worked well some things that have not

00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,369
worked as well and give you a chance to

00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:19,229
think about how the lessons you learn

00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:20,790
from what other people have done may

00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:22,799
play out and what you're trying to do

00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:25,140
but if you were take home one piece of

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,420
advice for me today it's this first one

00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:30,540
it sounds like nothing but it's a huge

00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:32,430
thing we're all very busy people there's

00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,799
a lot of noise there's a lot of details

00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:37,140
around and whatever we're doing but you

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,700
have to actually make formerly time for

00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,490
yourself quiet time to get away from

00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,990
everything to really think and part of

00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:45,509
what i recommend that you think about

00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:48,030
are what are the key ideas the key

00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:49,979
concepts in whatever you're trying to do

00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:52,500
and you may think you know what they are

00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:53,880
but we really think about them it may

00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,100
surprise you if you can really identify

00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,170
that it helps you communicate your work

00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,939
to other people but more importantly it

00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:01,770
gives you the foundation for thinking in

00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:03,500
which you can come up with new ideas and

00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:06,829
that's a real foundation for innovation

00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:09,360
so that's my first bit of advice and

00:02:06,829 --> 00:02:12,330
let's look at how innovation has worked

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,590
in a big data an open source project all

00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:15,690
of you are working in this V

00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:17,370
that are very exciting time people are

00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:19,950
using data in completely new ways

00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:22,140
learning to use data at scale they're

00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:24,180
able to ask questions that really

00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:26,040
nobody's trying to ask before it's a

00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,709
very exciting time for you to work in

00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:31,530
this and so let's look at a project that

00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:34,230
had used enormous data and have lot of

00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:36,959
success this is a really big project

00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:39,000
open source crowd-sourced it also

00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,459
involved data-driven decisions that

00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,349
actually saved people's lives and made

00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:45,930
some people very wealthy and the most

00:02:43,349 --> 00:02:48,540
surprising thing about it is it always

00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:50,310
took place in the 19th century so there

00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:52,230
was a sailor in the u.s. Navy his name

00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:54,269
is Matthew Maury when he was a fairly

00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:56,430
young man he injured his leg he could no

00:02:54,269 --> 00:02:59,069
longer go to see the Navy gave him a

00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:00,690
desk job and surprisingly that's when

00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:02,910
the real adventure in his life began

00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:06,480
because he was very innovative thinker

00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:10,260
he discovered that there were boxes and

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,730
boxes of old books old captain's logs

00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:14,069
while the captain's weren't old but the

00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:15,569
books were so when people go to see the

00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:17,400
captain would take measurements this

00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:18,780
were actually time series data that

00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,329
measured maybe the temperature air

00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:23,280
temperature water temperature speed of

00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:25,440
the winds whatever what they had for

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,389
breakfast and if that was enough rum so

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,709
it wasn't very consistent data and they

00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:29,910
would turn in these books at the end of

00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:32,250
the trip somebody would throw it in a

00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:33,810
box and they forget it so what Maury

00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:35,340
realized is there were hundreds and

00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:37,620
hundreds of these maybe thousands i

00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,599
don't know each log had very little

00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:42,150
value but you realize if he

00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:44,579
painstakingly with his team extracted by

00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:47,489
hand all of the data that was valuable

00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:49,859
and aggregated that data you have a

00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:51,810
really tremendously valuable resource so

00:03:49,859 --> 00:03:54,829
they produce these winds and currents

00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:56,639
charts that had enormously valuable

00:03:54,829 --> 00:03:58,500
navigational information for shipping

00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:01,200
routes all around the world and when

00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:05,220
they first published this the impact of

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:07,470
it was basically nothing because people

00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:09,030
didn't appreciate the value of that data

00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:10,530
so it is important to learn to

00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:12,090
communicate what you do if you're

00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:13,889
working at an open source project you

00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:16,079
build it you also need to build a user

00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:18,269
community and help people understand why

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,310
that tool may be useful to them what

00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:22,890
happened here is that one ship captain

00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:26,219
his name was Captain Jackson he was

00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:26,770
doing a sail down from excuse me on the

00:04:26,219 --> 00:04:28,449
coast

00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:31,090
the Americas down for Baltimore to Rio

00:04:28,449 --> 00:04:33,729
de Janeiro and back he used one of these

00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:35,800
charts he shaved 17 days on the way down

00:04:33,729 --> 00:04:38,740
and 18 on the way back when you come

00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:40,389
into port 30 days early other people

00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:41,919
notice they're very competitive now

00:04:40,389 --> 00:04:44,319
everybody wanted one of the charts

00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:46,629
here's amore was really smart he wanted

00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:48,430
better data so he made a uniform

00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:51,129
template and in order to get one of his

00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:53,080
charts somebody had to go collect better

00:04:51,129 --> 00:04:54,610
data in a uniform way turn in the

00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:57,849
template and they would get her chart

00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:59,349
had a huge impact on navigation so the

00:04:57,849 --> 00:05:01,659
lessons that you can learn from this the

00:04:59,349 --> 00:05:04,300
main 1i want you to take away is this

00:05:01,659 --> 00:05:05,710
idea of innovation if you look past the

00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:08,169
normal things that you think about you

00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:10,330
may discover a big idea and also a

00:05:08,169 --> 00:05:13,000
lesson that you all know already is that

00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:15,250
there can be huge value in an aggregate

00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,789
of data that smaller data sets don't

00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:21,280
have on their own now I just came from

00:05:18,789 --> 00:05:23,380
strata in London and I saw this big

00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,449
poster up from Sherlock Holmes's quote

00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:28,690
it's a capital mistake to theorize

00:05:25,449 --> 00:05:30,159
before one has data I agree with that I

00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:31,840
also want to point out there's some

00:05:30,159 --> 00:05:33,819
pretty big mistakes you can make after

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,069
you have data as well if you don't do it

00:05:33,819 --> 00:05:39,190
right so the next part of my talk is

00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:41,050
called undiscovery the cure for scurvy

00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:44,620
how many people in here have heard of

00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:46,779
scurvy yes a lot a few a few people

00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:49,449
raise their hands well scurvy is fairly

00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:52,240
horrible disease is called caused by a

00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:54,969
scarcity a lack of vitamin C vitamin C

00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,770
is actually asked Orbach acid it's

00:05:54,969 --> 00:05:59,409
really a terrible disease but it can

00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:01,770
easily be prevented or cured by eating

00:05:59,409 --> 00:06:05,139
fresh foods that have vitamin C

00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:06,940
especially citrus watercress even meet

00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:09,550
to some extent if it's unprocessed meat

00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:11,199
so we've known that for a long time even

00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:14,169
from ancient time people thought this

00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:17,199
might be true but a British doctor named

00:06:14,169 --> 00:06:18,909
Lind in 1747 did some moderately

00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,219
controlled experiments he was able to

00:06:18,909 --> 00:06:24,159
actually show that it looked like fresh

00:06:21,219 --> 00:06:26,229
citrus really contributed to curing or

00:06:24,159 --> 00:06:28,569
preventing scurvy he published this in a

00:06:26,229 --> 00:06:30,550
fairly famous a document at the time a

00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:32,830
lot of people heard about it now it

00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:34,659
wasn't until much later in 1933 that

00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:36,460
people could actually isolate what it

00:06:34,659 --> 00:06:38,710
was in citrus fruit vitamin c ascorbic

00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:40,240
acid that was a cure but they knew that

00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:42,370
eating fresh citrus

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,460
would take care of you and certainly by

00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:47,830
1799 the British Navy required sailors

00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:49,810
to have fresh lemon juice this was a

00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:51,759
tremendous advantage to the British Navy

00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:53,889
because they could stay out at sea

00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,690
longer they were healthier this one on

00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:58,030
for years and years it's part of how

00:06:55,690 --> 00:07:01,270
they really dominated the disease for a

00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:06,580
long time so it was somewhat surprising

00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:09,669
that in 1911 a British doctor who was on

00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:11,229
a long polar expedition record in his

00:07:09,669 --> 00:07:14,110
journal that people were dying from

00:07:11,229 --> 00:07:18,460
scurvy how sad it was that nobody had

00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:23,400
any idea how to cure or prevent it what

00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:26,680
should we conclude from this is

00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:28,330
something happened so you can read about

00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,250
this there was an interesting blog that

00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:32,440
was based on this book called the worst

00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:35,110
journey in the world talking about this

00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:38,830
Scott's polar expedition but basically

00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:41,380
what had happened in between is in 1860

00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:43,360
the British Navy made a change and what

00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:46,810
they changed is they had been using

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:49,120
lemons mostly from Italy that was

00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:51,250
expensive they decided they could use

00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,500
limes they thought was the acidity that

00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:56,440
is what you wanted and the lines are

00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:58,930
more acidic than lemons they figured

00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:00,280
that would be better and then they

00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:02,469
wanted to get lines from the West Indies

00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:04,659
that was land that they control that was

00:08:02,469 --> 00:08:06,340
better for them so started using and

00:08:04,659 --> 00:08:09,099
it's easier to use bottle lime juice

00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:11,169
than fresh juice or lines or limits so

00:08:09,099 --> 00:08:13,539
that was a change that they made and why

00:08:11,169 --> 00:08:15,969
was that an issue is because it turns

00:08:13,539 --> 00:08:19,120
out that this bottle lime juice was

00:08:15,969 --> 00:08:23,020
ineffective against scurvy but it also

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:29,860
turns out nobody noticed what should you

00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:31,810
conclude from that okay so here's what

00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:33,700
was going on it was this bizarre set of

00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:35,709
little decisions each of which wasn't

00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:37,870
totally crazy at the time but they

00:08:35,709 --> 00:08:40,599
weren't tested in a disciplined way

00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:42,969
people didn't have the consider

00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:45,250
alternative explanations so what

00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:47,140
happened is they move from limits two

00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:50,410
limes that goes to twenty-five percent

00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:52,430
as much ascorbic acid vitamin C it also

00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:55,490
turns out that vitamin C is

00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:58,460
sensitive to air to oxidation exposure

00:08:55,490 --> 00:09:00,410
to heat and exposure to copper they made

00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:02,360
this in these big vats heat of the VATS

00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:04,010
they exposed it to air and then piped it

00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,480
through copper there wasn't much a

00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:07,250
vitamin C in there to start with and

00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,720
they put it in bottles so by the time

00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:10,700
they bottled it there really wasn't much

00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,100
of anything there there was a mistake

00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:14,570
that they made in making that change you

00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:16,040
would think right away however they

00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:18,920
would notice that people would get sick

00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:21,610
and die from scurvy they didn't so what

00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:23,720
else happened is bad set of coincidences

00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:25,610
they're actually doing something right

00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:28,700
they let go of their old idea in the

00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:30,260
response to new new data but they didn't

00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:32,720
do it in a careful and disciplined way

00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:35,510
so this is just unfortunate that right

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,339
about the same time steamships speeded

00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:39,230
up travel sailing ships were more

00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:41,510
efficient thanks to Maurice charts and

00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:43,160
so ships didn't stay out at sea is long

00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:45,320
and it turns out you only need a very

00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:47,149
small amount of vitamin C and it takes a

00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:49,250
very long time to develop the symptoms

00:09:47,149 --> 00:09:50,990
so people kept treating themselves as

00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:53,060
lime juice thinking they're okay and

00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:55,550
they weren't until they started taking

00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:57,740
these very long polar expeditions and so

00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:59,300
at that point another mistake was made

00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:01,400
which is basically to think you know

00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:03,110
something change fine they knew that but

00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,790
they throughout the entire idea of

00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:08,060
citrus and kind of went back to square

00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:11,420
one so the lesson to take away from that

00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:12,860
is when something changes look for what

00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:14,959
changed and look for alternative

00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:16,250
explanation very quickly I'll tell you

00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,870
because like I'm not doing people of my

00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:20,180
timing here but I'll tell you that

00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:21,920
there's a modern laboratory story i was

00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:24,529
actually i'm actually not trained in in

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,880
the field of computing originally i was

00:10:24,529 --> 00:10:27,320
biochemist have a doctorate in

00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:29,510
biochemistry and i did research

00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,950
molecular biology a friend of mine who

00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:33,200
has her hands a technician in a lab

00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:34,430
called me one day almost in tears she

00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,990
was doing an absolutely standard

00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:38,390
procedure she done it over and over and

00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:40,579
suddenly one day it didn't work that's

00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:41,810
surprising but not that surprising she

00:10:40,579 --> 00:10:43,880
did what you're supposed to do which is

00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:46,670
repeat the procedure she did that many

00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:48,290
times but has still failed at this point

00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:52,010
repeated it more times and began to

00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:54,200
consider another career path a better

00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:56,240
choice would have been for her to ask

00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,920
what changed well she was asking what

00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,540
change but it didn't seem like anything

00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,310
and change was doing the same way every

00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:02,850
time and she keeping very good record so

00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:05,730
she knew she was doing the same why

00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:08,040
when it appears that nothing changed but

00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:09,750
clearly something broke what you need to

00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:12,180
do is to remember that physics works

00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:13,740
don't abandon that and look again and

00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:16,410
ask yourself what possibly could have

00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:19,170
changed in this case one of the reagents

00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:21,089
she was using was from a new lot a new

00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:24,089
group of reagents and it turned out that

00:11:21,089 --> 00:11:25,889
reagent was contaminated so in fact she

00:11:24,089 --> 00:11:27,959
wasn't doing anything different her

00:11:25,889 --> 00:11:31,800
starting material was different it took

00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:34,110
her a long time to discover that when

00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,970
things break ask yourself what changed

00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:38,490
last hopefully you've taken good enough

00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:40,649
records that you can tell ask yourself

00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:42,690
what changed when did it last work and

00:11:40,649 --> 00:11:44,130
you know trust that there has to be

00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:46,470
something that's different and it has to

00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:48,149
make sense so what does this have to do

00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:50,310
with you and the kind of world work that

00:11:48,149 --> 00:11:52,529
you do came up with this one example

00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:54,870
somebody does something they've

00:11:52,529 --> 00:11:56,670
developed something and the program is

00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:58,769
working fine they go into production and

00:11:56,670 --> 00:12:00,569
now it doesn't work everybody's heard

00:11:58,769 --> 00:12:03,209
anybody say what but it worked on my

00:12:00,569 --> 00:12:05,759
machine so clearly what they need to do

00:12:03,209 --> 00:12:07,079
is ask themselves what changed what

00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,279
could possibly be different and

00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:09,689
obviously there are a number of

00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:11,160
different things that might change in

00:12:09,689 --> 00:12:14,310
the environment that's certainly a place

00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:15,449
to start when things appear to break you

00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:17,339
think you're doing the same thing you've

00:12:15,449 --> 00:12:20,279
done before consider alternative

00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:22,050
explanations here's a quick story as i

00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:24,569
said i used to be a biochemist i was on

00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:26,819
a plane going to a big biochemistry

00:12:24,569 --> 00:12:29,430
conference man sitting next to me worked

00:12:26,819 --> 00:12:31,709
for a company that made pet food I

00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:33,329
worked in academic research that was a

00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:34,829
very different world for me so he's

00:12:33,329 --> 00:12:37,139
telling me stories about how they do

00:12:34,829 --> 00:12:39,720
biochemistry they were making a new

00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:41,250
synthetic flavor for dog food and he

00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:43,259
said one of the challenges is that you

00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:45,660
make it but then is it better than the

00:12:43,259 --> 00:12:47,519
old flavor well do dogs like it better

00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:49,800
so here's how he did the test he

00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,689
basically did a bee testing they would

00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,699
take old the old flavor about old dog

00:12:51,689 --> 00:12:55,620
food but the old flavor of dog food put

00:12:53,699 --> 00:12:57,029
in a bowl to put the new flavor in a

00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:58,860
bowl put the bowls down on the floor

00:12:57,029 --> 00:13:01,380
opened the door and let a dog in

00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:03,180
basically they asked a dog now this

00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,589
wasn't a real big sample size but they

00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:07,470
did repeat the test a number of times

00:13:04,589 --> 00:13:09,810
and they just looked to see which flavor

00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:11,939
which dog food to the dog prefer and

00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:14,639
they did the test over and over and

00:13:11,939 --> 00:13:16,050
greatly to their disappointment the dog

00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,459
preferred the old food

00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:19,500
so that all right the new flavor is no

00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:21,899
good they went back tried it again

00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:24,029
synthesized a new flavor do the same

00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:26,279
sort of test again will the dog prefer

00:13:24,029 --> 00:13:28,769
the old food or the new food again they

00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:30,720
let the dog in very disappointing the

00:13:28,769 --> 00:13:32,910
dog goes to the old food they start

00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,529
thinking maybe the food flavor they had

00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:37,529
originally is as good as you can do

00:13:34,529 --> 00:13:40,410
until it finally occurred to somebody to

00:13:37,529 --> 00:13:42,779
reverse the position of the bowls and it

00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:45,360
turns out every single time the bought

00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:47,310
dog went to the bowl on the left so

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:50,250
basically they thought that they were

00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:52,560
testing the dogs preferences for flavor

00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:55,170
they were testing the dogs preferences

00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:58,470
for the position of the bowls now last

00:13:55,170 --> 00:14:00,480
year at hadoop summit in san jose my

00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:02,730
co-author ted dining and I were doing a

00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,680
book signing for two titles that we'd on

00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:06,750
her machine learning series want a

00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:09,029
recommendation one an anomaly detection

00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:12,180
we let people when they came up to get a

00:14:09,029 --> 00:14:13,709
book choose which one they wanted and I

00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,820
was very surprised to see that most

00:14:13,709 --> 00:14:16,890
people were choosing the one on

00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:18,240
recommendation and it mainly surprised

00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:20,399
me because we happen to have a lot of

00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,230
people there who work for telecoms or

00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,490
four banks I would have thought to be

00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:25,680
interested in the one on an anomaly

00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:27,570
detection until I suddenly remembered

00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,610
night leaned over and whispered dog food

00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:31,470
to Ted we took the stacks and we

00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:33,180
reversed them and we discovered that

00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:38,459
data scientists prefer the books on the

00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:40,350
right so when you when you're doing

00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:43,110
testing when you're doing a V testing or

00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:44,970
any kind of testing do your testing do

00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:47,970
it carefully keep good records but also

00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:49,950
make sure that the thing that you're

00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:52,649
testing is what you think you're testing

00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:55,620
it's not always true consider

00:14:52,649 --> 00:14:57,480
alternative explanations how does this

00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:59,640
feed into the world that you live in

00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,620
well take one example and this is

00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:03,810
actually again this really happens the

00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:06,209
story I heard from Ted Dunning a long

00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:07,709
time ago he was building a

00:15:06,209 --> 00:15:10,709
recommendation engine for an online

00:15:07,709 --> 00:15:13,470
video streaming service and he built the

00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:15,930
model and when they first used as input

00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:17,310
data for the models clicks basically

00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:19,199
here's a title how many people would

00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:20,880
click on a particular movie the

00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:22,350
recommender wasn't working well you

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,270
start trying to tweak the algorithm or

00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:26,370
whatever which is very frustrating but

00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:28,860
then he had the idea to not use that and

00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:29,699
instead to use who views the first 30

00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:32,100
seconds of

00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:34,980
of a video suddenly the recommender

00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:37,529
worked really really well and so this is

00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:39,029
a like the dog food case in the first

00:15:37,529 --> 00:15:41,369
case you're really testing how well

00:15:39,029 --> 00:15:43,079
people like the title of the movie not

00:15:41,369 --> 00:15:45,089
whether they actually like that video in

00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:46,980
the second case you're actually testing

00:15:45,089 --> 00:15:48,689
their preference through the videos so

00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:50,129
it's one of those cases where you're not

00:15:48,689 --> 00:15:51,959
testing what you think you're testing

00:15:50,129 --> 00:15:53,790
another one if any of you have done

00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:55,980
modeling you know the danger of having a

00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:58,290
target leak this is one where there was

00:15:55,980 --> 00:16:01,949
a classifier built for news groups and

00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:04,379
in order to do testing oh I'm sorry they

00:16:01,949 --> 00:16:07,199
built this they tried it out and it

00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:09,569
worked really well in order to do the

00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:11,609
testing basically want to separate

00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:13,319
training data from your evaluation data

00:16:11,609 --> 00:16:16,049
so they just took the single data set

00:16:13,319 --> 00:16:17,879
and took every other article even number

00:16:16,049 --> 00:16:20,009
articles for training odd number for

00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:21,540
testing and it turned out it worked I

00:16:20,009 --> 00:16:25,199
mean that's a good logical way to build

00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:27,929
a kind of matched excuse me training and

00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:29,579
data and evaluation set so it worked

00:16:27,929 --> 00:16:31,790
really well and that's good news except

00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:34,949
it worked really really really well and

00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:36,720
so it really worked too well to be true

00:16:34,949 --> 00:16:38,730
so you want to do a little alternative

00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:42,029
testing and say oh I'm that's great but

00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:43,980
maybe not so great it turns out many of

00:16:42,029 --> 00:16:45,660
the articles were articles that were

00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:47,939
basically repeated and had a slight

00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:49,439
modification or correction and so when

00:16:47,939 --> 00:16:51,629
you separate them this way you have too

00:16:49,439 --> 00:16:53,879
much overlap one way to test that out

00:16:51,629 --> 00:16:56,100
was to actually separate them in terms

00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:59,579
of earlier later articles and at that

00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:01,379
point the classifier collapsed if it's

00:16:59,579 --> 00:17:04,850
too good to be true it's probably not

00:17:01,379 --> 00:17:06,839
true consider alternative explanations

00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:08,130
quick a moment here and we'll go into

00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:10,139
the whole story because running out of

00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:12,779
time but anybody in here I studied

00:17:10,139 --> 00:17:14,880
chemistry french chemist Lavoisier we go

00:17:12,779 --> 00:17:17,189
back to the 18th century he made some

00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,169
astounding discoveries about what

00:17:17,189 --> 00:17:21,720
happens when combustion happens and he

00:17:19,169 --> 00:17:23,939
did this really by taking very careful

00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:25,740
measurements of the weight of the

00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:27,659
reagents and the products and in these

00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:30,029
processes but he didn't see old

00:17:27,659 --> 00:17:32,309
containers so he was weighing the solid

00:17:30,029 --> 00:17:34,740
and the gases and then testing what

00:17:32,309 --> 00:17:36,750
happened and from this he drew an

00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:39,139
interesting set of conclusions he was

00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:41,429
able to figure out that this mysterious

00:17:39,139 --> 00:17:43,530
substance called flow just on that

00:17:41,429 --> 00:17:44,970
people thought within a substance and

00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:47,760
in a way when the substance was heated

00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:50,010
in fact didn't exist he was able to get

00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,900
data that supported an idea that was

00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:54,120
already there which is the conservation

00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:56,040
of matter and in along the way he

00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:58,380
actually discovered and named oxygen I

00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:00,360
puts us in to remind myself to remind

00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:03,330
you that careful measurements

00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:05,310
measurements monitoring metrics they may

00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:07,740
not sound super exciting but the really

00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:10,380
powerful techniques if you do them well

00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:12,150
you do them often you keep really good

00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,230
records and then you take time to step

00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:14,670
back and think about what they're

00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:17,820
telling you you can learn a lot from

00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:20,520
that now lately I think can talk a lot

00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:22,380
about streaming data I feel like that's

00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:24,480
you know the most surprising thing about

00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:27,120
my talk today is it wasn't about flink

00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,440
and it wasn't about Kafka which makes it

00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,960
unusual so of course I have to talk

00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,460
about streaming data a little 10 and I

00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,460
just finished another book called

00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:37,560
streaming architecture and one of the

00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:41,430
things that we talked about is that if

00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:43,680
you use a messaging system that has the

00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:45,780
right kinds of capabilities which by the

00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:47,460
way we think apache Kafka's are really

00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:51,150
good one oops now I'm back to Kafka and

00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:53,070
map are has a new messaging system

00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:55,860
that's actually built into its platform

00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:57,750
it uses the kafka API it has goes a

00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:59,310
little beyond what Kafka does but we

00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:01,530
think both of those are a great way to

00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:03,240
approach these kinds of architecture now

00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:05,250
what happens is you basically have

00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,440
decoupled the producers and the

00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:09,270
consumers and part of why that's

00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,950
important the messages delivered it can

00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:13,230
be used right away it doesn't have to be

00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:15,630
used right away consumer can be offline

00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:18,150
online it means you can add consumers

00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:20,880
and as you add consumers to consume that

00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:23,220
same streaming data here I have is an

00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,350
odd kind of reverse way of drawing a

00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:27,120
piece as a piece of a larger diagram

00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:29,640
because this is out of the book but

00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:32,430
these cylinders are actually looking at

00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:34,380
places where you use Kafka or map our

00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:37,050
streams those are the the messaging the

00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:39,090
cues and the end of this was gained from

00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:41,520
a video example the thumbnail extractor

00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:44,160
is a service it's running but besides

00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:46,010
just the uploads in the out put the

00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,610
thumbs you can have various checkpoints

00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:50,310
exceptions you can do a lot of

00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:52,440
monitoring a lot of metrics it's very

00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:54,450
easy to add in those new consumers and

00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:56,669
by doing that you don't interrupt what's

00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:59,489
happening with the other consumers are

00:19:56,669 --> 00:20:01,590
that means it's easier to have metrics

00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:04,049
at more stages of what you do it means

00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:06,509
you can have more fine-grain monitoring

00:20:04,049 --> 00:20:08,100
and metrics very very powerful thing to

00:20:06,509 --> 00:20:10,109
do in a shift and how people are working

00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:11,730
so we think that's going to you know

00:20:10,109 --> 00:20:13,919
help a lot with people making

00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:18,649
discoveries about how their systems are

00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:20,909
working metrics metrics metrics okay

00:20:18,649 --> 00:20:22,649
this isn't quite about measuring but

00:20:20,909 --> 00:20:24,299
it's another good lesson in this and

00:20:22,649 --> 00:20:26,730
this is also a real world example a

00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:30,570
friend who was head of security for a

00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:33,029
bank did a kind of unusual thing but he

00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:35,340
saved the headers for all website

00:20:33,029 --> 00:20:37,409
request he wasn't looking for any

00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:39,179
particular thing he just wanted to save

00:20:37,409 --> 00:20:42,059
that data in case it was important and

00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:44,639
he saved it for a long period of time it

00:20:42,059 --> 00:20:46,590
turns out as people tried to attack the

00:20:44,639 --> 00:20:49,710
website you get through the security

00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:52,470
barriers he was able to detect anomalies

00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:54,210
in the pattern of the headers they

00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:56,279
happen to be slightly different for the

00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:57,899
attackers now this isn't something he

00:20:56,279 --> 00:21:00,269
could know our priority he needed to

00:20:57,899 --> 00:21:03,299
look for he just saved as much data as

00:21:00,269 --> 00:21:05,279
he could to document what was happening

00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:07,169
in case you would need to look back at

00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:09,090
it and in fact he did and he found this

00:21:07,169 --> 00:21:11,489
this pattern he was able to stock

00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:14,429
basically stop these attackers at the

00:21:11,489 --> 00:21:17,249
perimeter so keeping a careful history

00:21:14,429 --> 00:21:19,019
of data paid off the wazee a and in fact

00:21:17,249 --> 00:21:20,820
with the help of his wife kept very

00:21:19,019 --> 00:21:21,899
careful records that's part of how they

00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:24,239
could look back and make these

00:21:21,899 --> 00:21:25,619
discoveries it's also a different sort

00:21:24,239 --> 00:21:27,210
of lesson here and this is one of the

00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:30,299
things that's beginning to change in

00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:31,889
this modern world of big data is that

00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:33,470
you may say things that you don't know

00:21:31,889 --> 00:21:36,059
at the time are going to be useful later

00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:38,190
it's really helpful it turns out in

00:21:36,059 --> 00:21:40,409
medical research is is important to as

00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:41,759
people do retrospective studies they've

00:21:40,409 --> 00:21:43,710
taken all these case studies from

00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:45,539
patients later as they began to

00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:48,359
understand what is going on they say I

00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:50,249
wish from two years ago we had recorded

00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:51,869
this information you don't always know

00:21:50,249 --> 00:21:53,100
so you don't just record the single

00:21:51,869 --> 00:21:57,059
thing you already know is going to be

00:21:53,100 --> 00:22:00,239
important keep data you don't know what

00:21:57,059 --> 00:22:02,609
will be important later and it turns out

00:22:00,239 --> 00:22:05,099
this is again becoming increasingly easy

00:22:02,609 --> 00:22:08,159
to do so back on the topic of these new

00:22:05,099 --> 00:22:09,860
tools for streaming data if you have a

00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:12,500
messaging system

00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:14,270
it has is able to do very low latency it

00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:16,790
has very good performance even with

00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:18,799
persistence older systems you traded off

00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:21,320
performance or persistence but with

00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:23,480
Kafka with map our streams that's not

00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:25,490
true you get both so this means you not

00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:27,340
only deliver data for some sort of low

00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:30,110
latency or real time or near real-time

00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:32,929
application but you also have a

00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:35,480
replayable stream that becomes a history

00:22:32,929 --> 00:22:37,429
and auditable log and that can be useful

00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:39,470
in a lot of different ways you can

00:22:37,429 --> 00:22:41,330
configure in both of those systems and

00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:43,640
Kafka and map our streams you can

00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:45,980
configure the time to live so you can

00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:47,720
have these messages last almost not at

00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:49,970
all get rid of them you can have them

00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:51,830
basically set to infinity for time to

00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:53,750
live and you've persisted the message

00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:55,549
you can go back you could save longer

00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:58,700
periods of messages weeks months years

00:22:55,549 --> 00:23:00,650
and actually be able to look back and

00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:03,140
that becomes a very powerful tool for

00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:05,630
certain kinds of investigation now I

00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:07,640
didn't realize that people had thought

00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:11,059
of this but we did a talk at a flank

00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:13,070
meet up last week in London and in

00:23:11,059 --> 00:23:16,130
talking about this idea of keeping a

00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:18,020
long-term replayable log a couple of

00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:19,790
people said but you couldn't save that

00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:22,070
much day I mean that's not practical you

00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:25,010
can just save short amount of data and I

00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:27,559
realized if you are thinking in terms of

00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:29,870
coffee used to the idea that you have a

00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:31,910
topic you have partitions of that topic

00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:34,549
for load balancing and so forth but as

00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:35,720
of now the topic lives on a machine it's

00:23:34,549 --> 00:23:37,280
a little bit different so we were

00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,929
thinking in terms of map our streams

00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:41,360
it's a little different in streams

00:23:38,929 --> 00:23:42,620
because the partitions and the topic are

00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,690
actually distributed all the way across

00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:46,669
the cluster so it opens up this

00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:49,370
possibility of saving years of data

00:23:46,669 --> 00:23:51,380
really not a problem not important for

00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:54,559
all applications but in some

00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:56,600
applications it's useful so let's do a

00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:59,030
quick summary I think some of these

00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:01,640
lessons you can learn from from all-time

00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:03,190
mistakes and some some recent mistakes

00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:05,750
and some things people have done well

00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:08,540
take time to think again it sounds

00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:10,910
trivial but it has huge payoff find

00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:12,710
essential concepts essential concepts in

00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:15,130
what you do or what somebody else does

00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:17,299
is not the same as generalizations a

00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:19,550
generalization doesn't have much meaning

00:24:17,299 --> 00:24:21,559
at all you find the core of what really

00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:23,210
matters and that helps you think about

00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:26,809
how systems work and how

00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:29,210
they can work in new ways things do

00:24:26,809 --> 00:24:31,549
break when they do ask when they work to

00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:33,049
last ask what changed if it appears that

00:24:31,549 --> 00:24:34,730
nothing changed and they're broken

00:24:33,049 --> 00:24:36,950
obviously something changed look back

00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:39,679
further consider alternative

00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:41,779
explanations make sure you're testing

00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:44,299
what you think you're testing consider

00:24:41,779 --> 00:24:46,539
alternative explanations when it's too

00:24:44,299 --> 00:24:49,330
good to be true I suggest that you

00:24:46,539 --> 00:24:51,649
consider alternative explanations

00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:53,450
remember if you measure more keep

00:24:51,649 --> 00:24:55,309
metrics you can really change the way

00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:56,630
you can fine tune what you're doing and

00:24:55,309 --> 00:24:58,610
you can change the way you can look back

00:24:56,630 --> 00:25:01,220
in history and see what happened and

00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:03,409
that can be a very powerful tool and

00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:05,270
also you may want to save data that at

00:25:03,409 --> 00:25:07,059
the time you're not consciously aware

00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:09,230
exactly how are you going to use it

00:25:07,059 --> 00:25:12,020
we've written a number of these short

00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:14,149
books O'Reilly sells them if you want to

00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:15,770
read just a PDF manpower makes them

00:25:14,149 --> 00:25:17,990
available for free if you go to the map

00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:19,909
our site you have to register they might

00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:22,549
send you an email but you'll be able to

00:25:19,909 --> 00:25:24,950
read the PDF our most recent book

00:25:22,549 --> 00:25:27,020
streaming data we have a few copies and

00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:28,789
we'll do a little mini book signing and

00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:31,100
give some away tomorrow I'm not sure

00:25:28,789 --> 00:25:33,440
exactly when I have to look at the

00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:36,830
schedule the co-author Ted dunning is

00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,720
doing a talk today at 1720 and I think

00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:40,370
he's going to say at the talk you know

00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,740
when but my guess is it will be in the

00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:45,860
morning and I don't know the exact time

00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:48,049
if you want to read the book online this

00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:50,000
is actually available not as well it is

00:25:48,049 --> 00:25:53,419
as a PDF but you can read it just as an

00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:56,899
active book online if you go to this to

00:25:53,419 --> 00:25:59,690
this link a quick plug please do support

00:25:56,899 --> 00:26:01,549
women in technology but I also want to

00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:02,870
say I love to see these groups who are

00:26:01,549 --> 00:26:05,120
women are getting together and they're

00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:06,740
looking at the issues of how can we get

00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,929
more women into open source how do we

00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:10,669
get more women in engineering this is a

00:26:08,929 --> 00:26:13,490
topic I think should be of interest to

00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:15,649
people not to women not just groups of

00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:17,779
women talking not just female speakers

00:26:15,649 --> 00:26:19,130
coming not just female panels would like

00:26:17,779 --> 00:26:21,590
to see groups of men and women get

00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:25,100
together and talk about how to encourage

00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:27,230
more women in these fields thank you

00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:30,409
very very much for having me here and

00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:32,559
there's my contact information okay on

00:26:30,409 --> 00:26:32,559
time

00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:44,930
thank you so much it's very nice so I

00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:47,270
didn't watch time is there time for a

00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:49,850
few questions you know right we have

00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:52,670
very much time for questions do you have

00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:54,830
questions to earn okay or I'll do this

00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:57,740
in the Ted way do we have answers yeah

00:26:54,830 --> 00:27:00,940
okay no that doesn't all right thank you

00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:00,940
