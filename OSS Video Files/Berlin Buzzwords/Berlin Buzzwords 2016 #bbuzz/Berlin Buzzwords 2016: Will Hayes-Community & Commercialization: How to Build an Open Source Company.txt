Title: Berlin Buzzwords 2016: Will Hayes-Community & Commercialization: How to Build an Open Source Company
Publication date: 2016-06-11
Playlist: Berlin Buzzwords 2016 #bbuzz
Description: 
	Many companies tout themselves as “open source,” offering support for popular tools and technologies. But professional services alone don’t typically produce the kind of revenue required for long term business success. 

So what does it take to build a profitable and healthy open source company? In this session, Will Hayes, CEO of Lucidworks — the company built on and around Apache Lucene and Solr — will share how business success need not come at the expense of the open source community’s integrity. 

Using Lucidworks as a case study Hayes will explain the power of specificity in driving both revenue and committer happiness, exploring why open source companies should avoid commercializing product features with broad, cross-industry appeal, such as security, management and monitoring. These are fundamental features and monetizing them will harm the integrity of the open source community.

okay well thank you all very much this

00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,710
is um the the saloon so if you were

00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,860
looking for the club it's actually the

00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:16,379
other other room over there I'm will

00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:18,449
Hayes I'm the CEO of lucid works

00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:20,939
lucidworks were the commercial entity

00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:22,859
behind leucine and solar also the

00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:24,779
creators of a lucid works fusion

00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:27,420
platform which we'll talk about quite a

00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:29,910
bit I've been with loosen'd works for

00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,590
about three and a half years now and

00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,750
prior to that I was part of the founding

00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:36,000
team at a company called spunk which you

00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,530
might be familiar with as well so kind

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,079
of seeing a whole spectrum of kind of

00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:41,610
commercial and open source technology

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,920
and what we thought would be interesting

00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:46,020
to do here today is sort of give you

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,340
some background on the evolution of the

00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,530
company some of the things that we've

00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,149
learned over time in terms of building a

00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,530
community building a company around the

00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:54,629
community and some kind of best

00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:57,870
practices or lessons learned around

00:00:54,629 --> 00:01:00,000
commercialization so as I said Lucy

00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:02,430
works as the company behind leucine and

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,710
solar and so what that means is that we

00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:06,420
drive a lot of the development so about

00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:08,189
seventy to eighty percent of what goes

00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,740
into the code base is coming from our

00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:12,900
employees we employ about forty percent

00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,750
of the active committers that are in the

00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,460
community around the technology and we

00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:20,990
tend to act as a sort of a focal point

00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:23,070
for the community as a whole with other

00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:24,689
people who are contributing other

00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:26,460
companies that are sort of collaborating

00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:28,380
kind of helping sort of drive a lot of

00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:30,299
those activities we end up doing things

00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:32,280
like sponsoring the revolute all or

00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:35,400
evolution for example a lot of the

00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,500
marketing that goes on the webinars web

00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,630
development and other sort of things

00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,180
that we can contribute back into in and

00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:43,950
around the technology solar if you're

00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:46,110
not familiar is used by about ninety

00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,820
percent of the fortune 500 so it's one

00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:49,530
of the most widely deployed open-source

00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:51,899
search engines that's out there today

00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:53,369
primarily a document store there's other

00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:56,460
technologies that are out there things

00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:59,430
MongoDB elasticsearch to also sort of

00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:01,020
built or derivatives from leucine we

00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:03,000
look at a lot of more kind of primary

00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,520
search use cases so things like your

00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,829
e-commerce shopping sites content

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,360
management anytime we're serving up sort

00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:11,580
of documents highly unstructured data

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,410
typically where solar plays within the

00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,880
enterprise one of the things that we

00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,770
pride

00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,810
selves on is that you probably use solar

00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:19,520
every day whether you know it or not if

00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:20,540
you're using something like the iCloud

00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,760
you're working with companies like

00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:27,560
Bloomberg like AOL eBay Amazon and so on

00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:29,630
there's also a massive ecosystem in and

00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:32,150
around solar so we're the primary search

00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:33,350
interface into the Hadoop platforms that

00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:36,410
are out there today the commercial

00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:38,180
platform so Cloudera Hortonworks and map

00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:40,790
are and as a company we work very

00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:42,440
closely with with these organizations to

00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:44,480
help kind of coordinate the efforts

00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,860
coordinate a lot of the features and

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,450
functionality that go into the

00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:52,400
technology that can power a lot of these

00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:53,510
sort of next-generation use cases so

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,490
what I want to talk about today is

00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:57,860
really you know how do you kind of

00:02:55,490 --> 00:03:00,680
strike that balance between community

00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:02,630
and commercialization because both are

00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,920
incredibly important and I think as most

00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:06,110
people know that have been around the

00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,580
industry for a long time that these open

00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:09,740
source projects especially the more

00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:11,810
popular ones typically don't get there

00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:13,940
independent of a company or an

00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:15,680
organization that's supporting it so in

00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:18,200
most cases if you go back to things like

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,360
Linux and red hat right and then a lot

00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,800
of the Hadoop evolution that you've seen

00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,510
today the platforms that are being

00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,520
widely deployed today they're typically

00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:27,530
backed by an organization whose primary

00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:29,540
focus is in driving the development

00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:32,030
driving the direction providing the

00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:34,040
marketing support providing that kind of

00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:36,440
push if you will to really move the

00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:38,870
technology forward but that being said

00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:41,030
there's a lot of advantages that you get

00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:42,860
from this Community Development both as

00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:44,420
an end user or an implementer of the

00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:46,670
technology or as a commercial

00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:49,070
organization like ourselves it's really

00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:50,780
the diversity that comes in the

00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:53,480
different types of viewpoints the use

00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:54,980
case is the test cases the cultures in

00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,990
which we get deployed and so being a

00:03:54,980 --> 00:04:00,590
search engine obviously we work across

00:03:56,990 --> 00:04:02,900
multiple languages multiple types of

00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:04,940
inputs and those types of things and so

00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,950
we benefit greatly as a technology

00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:09,680
platform from all of this collaboration

00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:11,450
that goes into it there's different

00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,120
models as we know so just because

00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:16,280
something is open source doesn't

00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,780
necessarily mean that it sort of follows

00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,070
either the Apache standard whether it

00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:20,480
comes from governance or even a

00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:22,430
licensing model where you can sort of

00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:24,330
package and redeploy so we'll look at

00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:26,759
some of the pros and cons of

00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:28,229
of different approaches in general as

00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:30,780
I'm sure most people at this conference

00:04:28,229 --> 00:04:32,400
know you know open source it means that

00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:34,500
there's a level of transparency you

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,150
typically have access to the code you

00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,560
can modify the code depending on

00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:39,930
licensing and we won't get into that in

00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,699
too much detail here you can package you

00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:43,560
can modify you can ship you can really

00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:46,379
leverage it as part of your technology

00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,659
stack the Apache foundation brings

00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:51,360
another element to this and that's

00:04:48,659 --> 00:04:53,189
governance and governance has its pros

00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,319
and cons in some ways you know it can

00:04:53,189 --> 00:04:57,180
create some inefficiencies in order to

00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:58,919
sort of drive things like roadmaps and

00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:01,500
features forward but it really means

00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:03,150
that there's a stabilization around the

00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:06,000
code base and if you think about solar

00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:07,500
and the ecosystem that's around it a lot

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,659
of that adoption comes from that

00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,310
confidence that these organizations have

00:05:09,659 --> 00:05:13,379
that the code base will remain steady

00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:15,120
that things like backwards compatibility

00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:17,159
or thought about in a very kind of

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,440
thoughtful and slow manner and that the

00:05:17,159 --> 00:05:21,930
roadmap is moving consistently with the

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,819
foundation of the project so that can

00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:25,259
kind of give a peace of mind and as an

00:05:23,819 --> 00:05:27,419
organization it's something that we

00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:29,279
cherish in terms of what it really means

00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:31,650
around the way that we control changes

00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:34,289
within our technology the inputs and the

00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:36,569
collaborations that go into that now

00:05:34,289 --> 00:05:38,789
there can be you know some disadvantages

00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:40,710
to this model as well like I said if

00:05:38,789 --> 00:05:42,569
you're familiar with splunk it's it's

00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:44,610
sort of the other side of the spectrum

00:05:42,569 --> 00:05:46,199
kind of where I started out in data

00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:48,240
platforms and that was you know highly

00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:50,580
commercialized very expensive very

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,259
proprietary and so there are some

00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:54,029
advantages to that in terms of the way

00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:55,620
that we controlled the codebase the

00:05:54,029 --> 00:05:57,539
decisions that we could make the pace in

00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:59,610
which we could drive changes we could

00:05:57,539 --> 00:06:01,349
decide you know release to release if we

00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:03,169
wanted to dramatically shift things like

00:06:01,349 --> 00:06:06,000
architecture and those kinds of things

00:06:03,169 --> 00:06:08,460
but you know the cons that can kind of

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,710
come with this other model tend to be

00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:13,339
around velocity right and so with

00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:16,319
collaboration comes sometimes a lot of

00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:18,300
difference in opinions and within the

00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,310
apache foundation in particular you know

00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,690
you have the right to sort of prevent

00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:23,069
certain things from going forward

00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:25,229
without having sort of further

00:06:23,069 --> 00:06:26,580
discussion and again the advantages of

00:06:25,229 --> 00:06:28,529
this is that we get a lot of district we

00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:30,270
get a lot of diversity within those

00:06:28,529 --> 00:06:32,069
inputs and we get a lot of confidence in

00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:33,479
the way that changes are being governed

00:06:32,069 --> 00:06:35,039
in the way that the direction of the

00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:36,630
technology is going so there's not a lot

00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,660
of surprises which is something

00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:39,370
important especially

00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:41,290
with search right where you're building

00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:43,060
this foundational technology which

00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:44,650
typically isn't being delivered is just

00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:46,600
the vanilla service but we're building

00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:47,740
on top of this things that are powering

00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:51,310
our business things like customer

00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:53,530
service ecommerce all the way into some

00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:55,570
of the more kind of surveillance and 360

00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:57,340
types of applications where research as

00:06:55,570 --> 00:07:00,220
a paradigm really which provides

00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:03,400
unstructured natural access back into

00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:05,290
your technology so within the apache

00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,990
foundation you know one of the things

00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:09,790
that again we really benefit from is

00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:11,500
sort of keeping things we call like on

00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:12,790
the rails right there's a lot of

00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:15,490
transparency there's a lot of

00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:17,680
collaboration we're not able to even as

00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:19,300
an organization who sponsors and puts a

00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,370
lot of sort of monetary support behind

00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,720
the project lucidworks doesn't have the

00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:24,220
power just to come in and say you know

00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,690
what we're just going to kind of take

00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,770
this thing in another direction we're

00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:28,630
going to sort of rip it out from

00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:30,310
underneath people and so with that that

00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:32,230
collaboration and that confidence comes

00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:34,030
in and we're very fortunate as an

00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:36,100
organization because a lot of larger

00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:37,090
organizations then collaborate with us

00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,950
and so we get to work with companies

00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:41,350
like Cloudera we work with companies

00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:43,420
like IBM and even in the commercial

00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:44,770
space sort of the non technology sector

00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:46,810
if you will I look at companies like

00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:48,730
Bloomberg who actually contribute a

00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:51,070
tremendous amount of knowledge and

00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:52,690
information back into the project and so

00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:54,669
as a company who's sort of the sponsor

00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:56,740
of this you know we benefit pretty

00:07:54,669 --> 00:07:59,140
heavily from that other companies that

00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:01,480
apply this model companies like datastax

00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:03,250
with the Cassandra project companies

00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:05,169
like Hortonworks with with their

00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:07,090
distribution of Hadoop and we'll look at

00:08:05,169 --> 00:08:08,470
some of the models that you can take to

00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:10,750
market across these different

00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:12,400
organizations and like I said a lot of

00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:14,710
what we want to reflect on here are the

00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,810
things that we've learned from both the

00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:19,060
pros and the cons and why we've sort of

00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:21,669
evolved our business over the years to

00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:24,820
adapt to some of these challenges now

00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:26,169
you take the non Apache model where open

00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:27,790
source becomes more of a distribution

00:08:26,169 --> 00:08:29,919
mechanism and this is something that's

00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:30,970
similar to free software right you kind

00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,800
of have the whole you know it can be

00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:34,450
free as in beer or not as in speech in

00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,979
other cases they still have a patchy

00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:38,530
licensing where they allow you to take

00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:40,479
and redistribute package and modify code

00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:42,010
as you see fit what you don't

00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,200
necessarily get with these is that

00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:46,210
governance and so in some cases

00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:48,370
organizations are able to push changes

00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:49,900
faster they're able to make bolder

00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:51,370
decisions in terms of the direction that

00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:53,080
they want to go but

00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:55,330
you don't really have that confidence or

00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,620
that peace of mind within the project if

00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:59,230
you're adopting this for a broader

00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:00,580
purpose and so companies like elastic

00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:02,800
who have built a great business in and

00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:04,839
around open source technology mongodb

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,000
tend to use open source is more of a

00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:09,100
delivery mechanism again similar to sort

00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,500
of a freemium model not quite the same

00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:13,150
broader benefits that we see in some of

00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:18,520
the more kind of community driven

00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:20,260
development so why I even build a

00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,580
community around a technology why does

00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,779
it matter especially when you're trying

00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:25,270
to build a business and trying to take

00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:28,330
something to market well you know again

00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:30,910
without having that body you have no

00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:32,170
governance and there can be advantages

00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:33,670
and as you're an organization who's

00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:35,320
trying to drive something especially in

00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:36,970
the early days in the one dot 0 and the

00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:39,700
two dot 0 where bolder decisions are

00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:41,170
important it's it's helpful right

00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,730
because you're not necessarily having to

00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:44,350
do the whole bike shedding around every

00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:46,990
change you don't have to kind of come in

00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:48,880
and debate but without that what you

00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:51,610
don't get is this sort of diverse set of

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,650
inputs you don't ensure that a broader

00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:55,480
set of environments a broader set of

00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:57,880
culturals like when it come to things

00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:00,760
like languages are effectively getting

00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:02,950
to utilize this technology and so as you

00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:05,170
build this community it can kind of keep

00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:07,330
you sort of true to the ultimate goal

00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:08,890
which is building great software and I

00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:10,540
think it you know something we pride

00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:11,830
ourselves in lucid works every day we

00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:13,029
want to go build a great business but

00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:14,500
more importantly as you talk to

00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,790
engineers or some folks who are here

00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,770
today even and you'll see them giving a

00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:19,570
variety of talks they really believe in

00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:20,980
what they're doing and they believe in

00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:22,839
the adoption that they've seen of this

00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,920
technology and the evolution that's

00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:25,900
something that you can take a lot of

00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,950
pride on pride in and whether you're

00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,330
working for the company or you're

00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:30,250
outside of the company you're sort of a

00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:32,680
part of a bigger movement if you will

00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:34,750
around this technology and like I said

00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:36,430
nothing makes us prouder than the fact

00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,839
that you know hundreds of millions of

00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:40,089
people every day billions of

00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,070
transactions go through our system and

00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:43,600
this is coming from contributions that

00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:45,100
we make as an organization but more

00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,589
importantly the contributions that come

00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:49,660
in from the broader community you get a

00:10:47,589 --> 00:10:51,820
lot of folks who dedicate a lot of time

00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:54,220
and effort which is really special and

00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:55,810
so people who want to see things move

00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:58,120
forward they want to see changes they

00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:59,680
have ideas that they want to share and

00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,900
collaborate on and so they get to be a

00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,339
part of this broader movement and as a

00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:06,139
company it's a very fortunate thing when

00:11:04,339 --> 00:11:08,149
come to events like this and we can meet

00:11:06,139 --> 00:11:10,220
people from all over the world who have

00:11:08,149 --> 00:11:12,050
interest in our technology not just in

00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:14,389
utilizing it but in actually advancing

00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:15,980
it forward and that body of that body of

00:11:14,389 --> 00:11:17,720
knowledge of that body of experience

00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:19,579
that we get to bring in is really

00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,800
special and it really has an impact on

00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:24,290
our technology so with all of that

00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,610
greatness in open source and in the

00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:28,399
communities in places like the Apache

00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:29,959
foundation why build a company right why

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,970
can't we just let these things sort of

00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:34,639
go and as I talked about earlier there's

00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:35,839
a lot of velocity that can come from a

00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:37,579
company and you see the more successful

00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,199
projects they've always have an entity

00:11:37,579 --> 00:11:41,329
or a sponsor behind them somebody who's

00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:43,790
employing people to contribute on a

00:11:41,329 --> 00:11:45,379
daily basis because in most cases people

00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:46,639
who are contributing with in open source

00:11:45,379 --> 00:11:48,230
who are not working for a sponsor

00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:50,180
company you know they're either doing

00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:52,040
this in their spare time or they're

00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:53,809
doing this sort of in a lot of time that

00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:57,439
they're given by their by their employer

00:11:53,809 --> 00:11:58,970
when they've got a day job right what

00:11:57,439 --> 00:12:00,800
also ends up happening is that companies

00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:03,170
start to put these things into more

00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,939
mission-critical types of deployments

00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:07,699
right so the first thing that always

00:12:04,939 --> 00:12:08,660
sort of comes to mind is support you

00:12:07,699 --> 00:12:10,370
know in a commercial software

00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:12,139
organization we kind of have this saying

00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:13,610
it's all about the throat to choke right

00:12:12,139 --> 00:12:14,990
if somebody is going to make a big bet

00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:17,089
on technology especially an

00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:18,800
infrastructure technology where it's not

00:12:17,089 --> 00:12:20,240
just something that you're delivering to

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,589
an end user but you're building your

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,899
business you're building a variety of

00:12:21,589 --> 00:12:25,189
products and services on top of this you

00:12:23,899 --> 00:12:27,499
want to ensure that when something goes

00:12:25,189 --> 00:12:28,730
wrong you have somebody to call right

00:12:27,499 --> 00:12:30,410
you want to ensure that the people that

00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:32,779
you have to call can actually get you up

00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:34,610
and running quickly can respond can meet

00:12:32,779 --> 00:12:36,620
service level expectations just like you

00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:38,329
would within commercial software so

00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:40,610
support is something that kind of comes

00:12:38,329 --> 00:12:42,920
naturally to a company and at lucidworks

00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:45,230
this was sort of the evolution of the

00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:47,240
business that came from the founders and

00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:48,230
committers of the project that said hey

00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,879
you know we're helping a lot of people

00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:51,589
out here through the forums through

00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:53,120
things like stack exchange what if we

00:12:51,589 --> 00:12:55,220
build a business here where we can start

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,839
to deliver SLA s and that to

00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:59,389
organizations that want to go farther

00:12:56,839 --> 00:13:01,160
with solar consulting is another big

00:12:59,389 --> 00:13:04,029
thing obviously there's no better way to

00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:06,139
get help whether its direction

00:13:04,029 --> 00:13:08,540
architectural guidance or even how to

00:13:06,139 --> 00:13:10,279
drive modifications within the code when

00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:12,410
you can work with the core group of

00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:14,299
people themselves and so this is a very

00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:15,860
natural posture that a lot of open

00:13:14,299 --> 00:13:17,150
source companies take and it's one that

00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:18,530
can actually have some draw

00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:20,510
backs and we'll talk a little bit about

00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:23,150
that later the things that we really

00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:25,370
realize our it goes beyond the core

00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:27,410
project right when you get into the

00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:30,260
enterprise in particular take something

00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:32,510
like a vertical like retail life science

00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:34,610
for research insurance where they're

00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:36,980
doing compliance in monitoring where

00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:38,840
they need more and it's not that they

00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:41,450
can't develop more on their own but

00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:43,880
there's really no point in them trying

00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:45,140
to invest in the resources and the

00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,880
development and the ongoing maintenance

00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:48,530
to integrate with things like

00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,210
proprietary technology security

00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:52,850
frameworks like Active Directory for

00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:54,950
instance more advanced features and

00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:56,960
capabilities that go beyond the core of

00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:59,090
that open source project and that's

00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:01,220
where we see a great opportunity and

00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:03,500
building a company around open source

00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:04,910
where you can start to look into the

00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,410
broader ecosystem and say there are

00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:08,570
areas where we can start to make things

00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:10,100
easier for folks because at the end of

00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:12,320
the day one of my favorite sayings when

00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:14,960
I talk to customers is free ain't free

00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,790
right as developers and folks who have

00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:18,050
worked with in open source technologies

00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:19,490
just because you're not paying for a

00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:21,410
license for something doesn't mean that

00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:23,450
it just comes to you and suddenly you're

00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:24,980
just ultimate instantly successful with

00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:26,810
it right you often need to invest

00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:28,160
resources you need to hire the right

00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:30,260
people you need to ensure that you

00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,700
actually have access to those people and

00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:33,890
so sometimes talent can become a

00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:35,930
bottleneck when it comes to adoption and

00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:37,220
this is another opportunity as you have

00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:39,020
a project that you're involved in

00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:40,940
whether there's a sponsor or not to say

00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:43,310
hey we can go stand up an organization

00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:46,280
that can provide this final mile for

00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:49,100
these folks so when you look at the

00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:51,050
different models you know what what ends

00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:53,780
up happening and it really depends on

00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:55,610
the type of organization you build so in

00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:57,710
you know I'm from San Francisco sort of

00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:59,120
the what we call the silly valley if you

00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:00,740
will especially now because we have so

00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,930
many dating and food apps and things

00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:04,760
that are just kind of ridiculous but as

00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:06,740
the pressure comes in when you start

00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:08,480
raising venture capital money it's not

00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:10,130
just to say hey we're generating revenue

00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,410
on a regular basis it's growing that

00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:14,150
revenue right and the difficulty comes

00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:16,130
when you get into a business where

00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:18,410
you're simply coming in and offering

00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:20,180
consulting services where organizations

00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:22,460
will come to you and say hey I need your

00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:23,810
help with a B or C and you go in and you

00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:25,370
solve their problem and then they're on

00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:27,290
their way and you never hear from them

00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:30,420
again that's a very difficult way to

00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:31,889
sort of build a reoccurring revenue base

00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:34,290
and that's something that's incredibly

00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:35,519
important for the lifespan of the

00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:37,200
company and you see a lot of

00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,519
organizations especially open source

00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,350
companies that run into this challenge

00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:42,420
where they get a lot of popularity

00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:44,190
within the project especially early on a

00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:45,750
lot of adoption people are coming to

00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:46,920
them for consulting and that type of

00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,990
help and then they determine you know

00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:50,760
what I think we're good projects has

00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:51,870
been stabilized we've been up and

00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:54,089
running we've been able to go out and

00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:56,639
hire people and so as a business it's

00:15:54,089 --> 00:15:58,980
really hard to continuously sort of grow

00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,630
that revenue stream and so you want to

00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:03,000
find ways where you can actually create

00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:04,260
ongoing value for your customer where

00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,750
you can help them do things better

00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:09,000
faster stronger where they're relying on

00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:12,060
that open source core but you're driving

00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,920
additional value support is another

00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:15,149
thing where it goes a little bit beyond

00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,620
consulting because you can have

00:16:15,149 --> 00:16:19,290
relationships when you're offering

00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:21,269
support that are ongoing but again over

00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:23,339
time organizations start to build up

00:16:21,269 --> 00:16:25,500
that expertise support is a lot like

00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:27,630
insurance right it's saying you know

00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,889
what I kind of know what I'm doing here

00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:31,199
but in the event that something goes

00:16:28,889 --> 00:16:32,820
incredibly wrong I want to have somebody

00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,500
who I can call who I know is going to be

00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:37,079
on the hook to make me successful and

00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:40,320
you can imagine in your own daily life

00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:42,209
if something like car insurance was a an

00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,560
option for you right you could have it

00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:45,209
but you weren't forced to have it you

00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,980
could say you know what when times are

00:16:45,209 --> 00:16:48,720
good and yep I like having that peace of

00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:50,550
mind but you know as the economic

00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,380
headwinds start to hit I think I'm going

00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:54,390
to take a little more risk and so our

00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:56,820
organizations tend to sort of think that

00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:58,649
same way and so this is where kind of

00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:00,630
moving that model from being a

00:16:58,649 --> 00:17:02,940
consulting services organization even

00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:05,339
being a pure support organization aunts

00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:07,199
open source into that integration into

00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:10,410
sort of building that higher level value

00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:12,449
becomes incredibly important so in these

00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:14,339
different models that companies tend to

00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:15,900
take on you know you see companies like

00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:17,880
data bricks today who are sort of

00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:20,819
starting out with services and training

00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:22,380
and again this is a great opportunity to

00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:24,059
kind of get engaged with your install

00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:25,589
base to start provide value to create

00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:27,150
awareness of what you can do and where

00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:29,220
you can come in and help them get

00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:30,630
enterprises deployed quickly you can

00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:33,000
harden their deployments give them

00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:35,309
advice on things like architecture and

00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,200
so forth but over time there's very

00:17:35,309 --> 00:17:39,330
little commitment from that customer

00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,370
back into the organization so again it's

00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:43,620
difficult to sort of build a continuous

00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:44,399
revenue stream and to continue to build

00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:47,110
your organism

00:17:44,399 --> 00:17:50,259
another challenge is you want to grow

00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:52,690
right so who can you afford to hire when

00:17:50,259 --> 00:17:53,830
you can't predict what type of revenue

00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:55,870
is going to be coming into the business

00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:57,759
right we all want to hire more engineers

00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:58,960
we want to hire more field consultants

00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:01,659
people who can go out there at luce

00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,940
works you know we see it being such a

00:18:01,659 --> 00:18:06,100
scarce resource of people who have deep

00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:07,509
knowledge of our technology that we want

00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,860
to go out and find as many folks as

00:18:07,509 --> 00:18:10,929
possible to come be a part of our

00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:12,730
organization but in order for me to do

00:18:10,929 --> 00:18:14,769
that as a CEO of the company I have to

00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:16,090
be able to project what our growth is

00:18:14,769 --> 00:18:17,289
going to be how much cash are we going

00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:19,360
to put into the business year over year

00:18:17,289 --> 00:18:21,549
and so simply relying on a training

00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,690
model doesn't really get you there and

00:18:21,549 --> 00:18:24,580
you need to find something that's a

00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:26,919
little more consistent as your sort of

00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:28,629
building that revenue stream talked

00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:30,309
about this a bit a bit already but that

00:18:28,629 --> 00:18:32,500
Enterprise Support model you know this

00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:34,690
is one of the more natural evolutions

00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:36,700
that an open source company goes towards

00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:39,039
where you can start to provide those SLA

00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:40,720
s and these types of things but the

00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:43,899
drawback is where you get into this idea

00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,789
of sort of optional insurance and over

00:18:43,899 --> 00:18:47,919
time as companies build up their

00:18:45,789 --> 00:18:50,470
expertise we see a diminished value and

00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:53,409
what history has kind of told us is that

00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:56,649
people who sort of start to build out an

00:18:53,409 --> 00:18:58,419
organization around this model when the

00:18:56,649 --> 00:18:59,830
project is in its infancy stages where

00:18:58,419 --> 00:19:01,029
it has a lot of issues where there's a

00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:03,519
lot of stability where they need

00:19:01,029 --> 00:19:05,139
constant touches with the organization

00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:06,250
it tends to be an exciting time because

00:19:05,139 --> 00:19:08,379
you can go out and you can start to

00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:10,690
acquire a lot of customers especially in

00:19:08,379 --> 00:19:12,639
a popular project but as organizations

00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:13,960
become more dependent on you I'm sorry

00:19:12,639 --> 00:19:14,710
more dependent on your technology what

00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,269
they're going to do is they're going to

00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:17,500
invest in their own resources they're

00:19:16,269 --> 00:19:19,539
going to start to hire they're going to

00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,919
start to bring people on board who can

00:19:19,539 --> 00:19:23,350
start to you know handle these things

00:19:20,919 --> 00:19:24,580
internally we go into organizations

00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:26,620
today some of the financial services

00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:29,169
where their solar team is 10x the size

00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:30,940
of ours and their organizations or you

00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:32,320
know tens of billions of dollars right

00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:33,220
so when we come in and say hey yeah

00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,500
we're going to be the folks that you

00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:37,539
guys can call when something goes down

00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:38,860
that doesn't typically Phi so well so

00:19:37,539 --> 00:19:41,860
you want to find a way to kind of

00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:44,559
evolved beyond this datastax did

00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:47,139
something interesting and I it kind of

00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:48,549
has its pros and it's cons but you moved

00:19:47,139 --> 00:19:50,980
into what sort of a certified

00:19:48,549 --> 00:19:52,510
distribution model and so what this said

00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:55,210
is that we are going to give you a

00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:56,769
version of Cassandra that's been

00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:57,600
hardened that's been tested that goes

00:19:56,769 --> 00:20:00,460
through more

00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:02,800
testing and trials then what you get

00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:05,650
from the Apache version and they've

00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:07,720
pegged their open source support to that

00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:09,580
version and so there you're at least

00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:11,560
creating some dependency within your

00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:13,120
customer base where if they want to have

00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:15,010
this level of service in this level of

00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:17,920
assurances they're working along your

00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:19,720
certified distribution what happens here

00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:21,910
in what typically is the drawback is

00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:24,520
that you start to deviate from what that

00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:26,560
sort of primary branch or Corbett of

00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:28,330
code is and so a lot of the advantages

00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:30,340
that people see in open source is again

00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:32,050
diversity of input the changes that they

00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:34,420
could take advantage of the transparency

00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:36,340
starts to diminish so where it sort of

00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:39,070
creates a tighter relationship with the

00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:41,770
end user it can tend to sort of dilute

00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:44,110
the value of what open source technology

00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:45,070
really brings into an organization so

00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,660
it's something that you want to think

00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:48,460
carefully about it's something that you

00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:50,020
want to spend a lot of time with your

00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:51,820
community and with your customer base

00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:53,230
and understand where the areas that

00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:54,850
people are challenged that we can come

00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:56,350
in and help and where are the things

00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:57,970
that we want to stay away from so we

00:20:56,350 --> 00:21:00,070
don't look like we've just simply forked

00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:01,840
that you know fork the code and we're

00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:03,340
maintaining something else over here and

00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:06,430
you're not really getting the value of

00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:08,320
open sores and then finally this is

00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:10,930
where at lucidworks we sort of have

00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:13,600
gotten to recently is extending with

00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:14,920
proprietary features and add-ons and as

00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,620
you do this what you want to be

00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:19,600
cognizant of is sort of what are the use

00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:21,100
cases that we can really go build a

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,570
business around because when you're

00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,830
dealing in something like like searcher

00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:25,210
or a data platform you know as

00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:27,220
technologists and engineers we tend to

00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:28,990
say hey this thing can do everything we

00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:30,370
can replace your Oracle database we can

00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:32,500
run your shopping website we can run

00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:34,060
your content site you name it but as

00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,470
we're building a business around this we

00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:37,570
want to focus in on what are those

00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:39,520
primary use cases that we think that we

00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:41,650
can go out and monetize where we can add

00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,750
a lot of value where we can build things

00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:46,060
that help customers be a better version

00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:47,740
of themselves right so in search an

00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:49,870
example would be something like retail

00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:51,730
where we've extended solar to bring in

00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:53,470
all of the data acquisition that can go

00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:55,180
out and pull things from databases and

00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:57,700
provide data enrichment services at

00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:59,140
ingestion time and then the relevancy

00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:00,760
tuning and the recommendations and

00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:04,120
machine learning that can help drive

00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:05,980
better conversion on websites and as we

00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:08,440
do this what happens is we sort of we

00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:10,090
avoid creating conflict within the

00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,410
community because we're looking at very

00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:13,690
specific features in

00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:15,370
capabilities that can extend solar in a

00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:18,430
way that may not be for everybody

00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:20,020
because what you don't want to do as the

00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:21,760
commercial sponsors you don't want to

00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:23,710
piss off your community to be frank

00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,780
excuse my language but it's it's really

00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:28,150
about what are the things that we can

00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:30,070
contribute and in a source we have a

00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:32,140
dedicated team within the open source

00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:34,570
who their job is to continuously bring

00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:36,310
code back in and we try to look at the

00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:38,470
broadest set of features that we can

00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:40,060
contribute back into solar and the

00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:41,920
things that we commercialize the things

00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:44,500
that we make proprietary on top of it

00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:46,570
are very specific we tend to look at

00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:48,640
this sort of sponsor versus guardian we

00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:51,070
are not the guardian of the community

00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:53,560
the commuting is the community is the

00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:55,360
guardian of itself our job is to be a

00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:57,490
cheerleader our job is to support to

00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,800
provide resources where we can wear it

00:22:57,490 --> 00:23:01,630
actually makes sense to help sort of

00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:03,580
encourage and grow the open source

00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:05,680
community and build our business or

00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:07,210
along specific verticals where we can

00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:10,060
create additional value for customers

00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:11,080
that are really looking for solutions so

00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:12,250
when you think about the community one

00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,840
of the things that the community really

00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:15,130
cares about well they don't want to see

00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,660
you hold this back and I think some

00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:19,420
companies actually do a pretty poor job

00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:21,400
at making this separation things like

00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:23,080
security security is important

00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,880
especially in a data platform there's no

00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:26,650
reason for the organization to go and

00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,020
develop proprietary features around

00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:30,820
security when it's something that can be

00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:32,140
absorbed by the broader community and so

00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:34,570
it's important to bring those types of

00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:36,640
features back ease of use scalability

00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:38,200
stability you know when you get into

00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,060
that certified model you want to stay

00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,860
away from this notion of well this is

00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:43,210
the more stable version of the open

00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:45,340
source code if you have that capability

00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:46,960
to go out and develop at you should be

00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:49,120
bringing that back into the community

00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,980
the things the community doesn't care

00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,260
about necessarily again these industry

00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:55,270
specific use cases integrations with

00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:57,040
proprietary technologies right our

00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:58,780
SharePoint connector not the most

00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:00,130
exciting thing but this isn't something

00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:01,570
that you know the solar community is

00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:03,670
incredibly excited for us to go and

00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:05,140
contribute back so we can take that out

00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:06,820
we can commercialize that for

00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:08,680
organizations that are using SharePoint

00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:10,630
typically organizations used to working

00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:13,510
with proprietary software who are okay

00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:15,340
purchasing license you can also look at

00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:16,870
this in terms of other sort of pain

00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:18,700
points for the community where they may

00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:20,230
not want your additional extensions

00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:22,240
right where we're increasing the

00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:23,860
technical debt within the project so

00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,030
things like testing overhead and that

00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:27,700
becomes more complicate

00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:29,560
in longer tail where you're increasing

00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:30,940
the size of the package that oh hey we

00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,680
developed all of these things for some

00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:34,450
very specific use cases and now the

00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,680
package size is doubled it's not really

00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:37,420
something that the community gets too

00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:39,430
thrilled about so what you want to look

00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:43,030
at is again can I develop things that

00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:44,650
that that aren't useful to a broader set

00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:47,230
of the population but for really a

00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:48,400
subset of that population I'm going to

00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:49,990
kind of hurry up here just because we're

00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,730
running out a little bit of time but I

00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:53,740
wanted to make this a bit of a case

00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:55,480
study so at lucidworks we had been in

00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:57,250
business for about five years we were

00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:59,020
working along apache solr like i said

00:24:57,250 --> 00:25:00,790
providing support surrounding consulting

00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:02,290
services and one of the things that we

00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:03,580
noticed in our install base was that

00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:05,830
more and more people were building

00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:07,630
expertise operationally didn't

00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:09,250
necessarily need support to keep the

00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:11,560
thing up and running in fact solar was

00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:13,510
quite stable but they were building

00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:15,910
these applications with varying degrees

00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:18,040
of success that we felt like we could

00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:19,210
come in and help them do better so the

00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,890
first thing is we took a look at

00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:23,140
different industries we looked at

00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:25,120
patterns within our support cases we

00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:26,740
looked at patterns within the services

00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,000
business that we were building and we

00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:29,920
look for areas where we thought you know

00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,110
what people would be more than happy to

00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:33,940
make a by verse bill decision if we

00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:36,370
could extend solar in these particular

00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:37,780
ways so when you're looking into the

00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:39,670
verticals that you want to extend into

00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:41,410
make sure that there's use cases that

00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:43,780
exist that you can go out and monetize

00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:46,210
you want to find industries that are

00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:48,970
open to open source adoption now this is

00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:51,310
something that's actually evolved over

00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:53,410
the years you know back in the day ten

00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:55,360
years ago you very rarely see government

00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:57,310
or financial service or health care

00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:59,470
actually utilize open source technology

00:25:57,310 --> 00:26:00,880
now it's considered imperative for

00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:02,620
organizations that want to stay agile

00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,940
that want to stay competitive that they

00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:05,650
have to look to what's going out there

00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:08,140
in the community and not become locked

00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:11,050
in by vendors so that problem is no

00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:12,730
longer really as much of a concern and

00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:14,500
then like I said you have organizations

00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:16,000
that are active within communities and

00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:17,710
these are areas that you can target and

00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,390
then from there you want to go to the

00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:21,010
use cases you want to say what are the

00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:22,810
most high value areas and you want to

00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:23,830
pick just a handful right you can't just

00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:25,510
go out and say you're going to go out

00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:26,860
and boil the ocean and do things for

00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:28,510
everybody because it can tell you it's

00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:30,010
just from experience it's very hard to

00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:32,350
go out and build a business that way but

00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:33,730
when you can find a very narrow set of

00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:35,020
cases where you say we can build

00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:37,840
proprietary features here that

00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:38,710
specifically increase the capability for

00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,419
these verda

00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:41,940
for these industries for these use cases

00:26:40,419 --> 00:26:44,620
you can start to build a successful

00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:46,840
commercial business on top of your open

00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:48,460
source so with loosen'd works we like i

00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:50,080
said we looked back over all of our

00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:51,789
consulting engagements training

00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:54,159
engagements the support cases that we

00:26:51,789 --> 00:26:56,529
had and we determined what our top six

00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:58,059
use cases were in which people wanted to

00:26:56,529 --> 00:27:00,700
do more with search and they were

00:26:58,059 --> 00:27:02,980
usually limited by time and resources or

00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:04,450
simply just acquiring enough talent to

00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:06,039
go out and build things like

00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:08,380
recommendation engines like data

00:27:06,039 --> 00:27:10,330
acquisition frameworks and so we

00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:12,909
developed a platform that we call fusion

00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:14,830
which takes solar and then we've

00:27:12,909 --> 00:27:16,029
introduced spark recently and talk more

00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:18,100
about that if you want to come by our

00:27:16,029 --> 00:27:19,870
booth and then built the proprietary

00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:22,000
features around that that could drive

00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:24,130
our core use cases so things like our

00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,049
data acquisition framework our machine

00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:27,730
learning and signal processing

00:27:25,049 --> 00:27:29,770
facilities which allow us to do advanced

00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:32,380
analytics to determine better user

00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:34,120
experiences and relevancy better you is

00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:35,890
for doing tuning and again these are

00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:37,630
things that add value in particular

00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:38,799
cases but not necessarily things where

00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:40,779
the community goes hey why don't you

00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:42,429
contribute that back in we try to be

00:27:40,779 --> 00:27:44,260
very careful about the things that we

00:27:42,429 --> 00:27:46,899
want to bring back into solar that we

00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:48,279
know have that broader case this also

00:27:46,899 --> 00:27:50,470
allows us to take advantage of a model

00:27:48,279 --> 00:27:52,270
that we call open core which means at

00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:55,840
its at its core you're dealing with

00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:58,360
unadulterated solar so all of the api's

00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:00,549
are available you can deploy the fusion

00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:02,169
bits against existing applications and

00:28:00,549 --> 00:28:03,940
so it prevents some of that vendor

00:28:02,169 --> 00:28:05,740
lock-in as well so what you get is you

00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:08,260
get that advantage of open source

00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:09,909
technology but we can build a licensed

00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:12,039
business that's much easier to scale

00:28:09,909 --> 00:28:14,049
from a revenue perspective and so you

00:28:12,039 --> 00:28:15,669
reduce the friction of adoption of

00:28:14,049 --> 00:28:17,140
places that are saying you know what we

00:28:15,669 --> 00:28:18,070
don't want to get burned especially in

00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:20,380
search there's been so much

00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:23,140
consolidation right and Dekka got bought

00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:25,360
by oracle fast gets bought by might but

00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:27,549
by microsoft autonomy turned into a

00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:30,010
freaking disaster so people are very

00:28:27,549 --> 00:28:32,230
kind of apprehensive about this adoption

00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:33,730
and so as we can deliver this open core

00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:38,529
model it makes it gives people a peace

00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:40,179
of mind finally you know again I can't

00:28:38,529 --> 00:28:41,799
stress enough and I think most people

00:28:40,179 --> 00:28:43,929
understand this but you know we like to

00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:45,460
sometimes romanticize about open source

00:28:43,929 --> 00:28:47,740
and just the community driven

00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:49,450
development good projects need good

00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:51,130
companies they need companies who are

00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:52,630
acting as a sponsorship who are not

00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:54,280
trying to just be the Guardian and

00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:56,800
controller of something but really the

00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:58,150
cheerleader the supporter bringing in

00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,800
things that the community can't

00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:01,630
necessarily do themselves you know we

00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:03,670
promote every solar release through

00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:05,740
webinars we go out to thousands of

00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:08,140
people who come in can learn about this

00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:10,480
we have our folks lead those efforts

00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:12,490
providing cooler t-shirts and stickers

00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:15,580
and websites and all the things that we

00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:17,500
can do to really prop up the community

00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:19,450
effort and prop up the project without

00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:21,700
getting in the way or sort of seeing as

00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:23,380
a burden or a drag to it we try to

00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:25,180
champion the committers wherever we can

00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:26,620
again we're always out there trying to

00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:28,390
hire different folks from within the

00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:29,890
community there's a whole other talk we

00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:31,930
could give about the balance of not

00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:32,950
wanting to hire everybody within your

00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:34,480
community because then you don't really

00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:36,130
have the diversity and those types of

00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,110
things that are important but we want to

00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:39,850
ensure that wherever we can is we have

00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:40,870
get-togethers as we sponsor conferences

00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:42,760
that we're bringing these folks together

00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:44,260
that we're showing them appreciation

00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,820
that we're trying to provide the support

00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:48,100
that an organization can provide that

00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:50,650
can't necessarily happen organically out

00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:51,930
there and then finally you know what are

00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:54,700
some of the lessons that we learned

00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:56,170
support is a hard business it's a great

00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:57,670
way to get started it's a great way to

00:29:56,170 --> 00:30:00,010
bootstrap but it's a very hard business

00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:01,150
to scale and as people are coming to you

00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:02,680
and they're coming for these low-end

00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:03,790
packages in particular where they're

00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,860
saying hey you know I want to pay you

00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:07,510
fifteen twenty thousand dollars a year

00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:09,280
what ends up happening more often than

00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:10,960
not is that they have a specific set of

00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:12,760
problems that they want you to come in

00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,530
and help resolve and then they sort of

00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:16,000
go away and again if you're going to

00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:17,680
build a healthy organization if you go

00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,420
out and hire great engineers and great

00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:20,890
people you need to have the ability to

00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:23,140
predict your business to grow your

00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:24,700
business and so our lesson was that you

00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:26,860
know what we're really need to kind of

00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:28,720
stay away from just a pure-play low end

00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:30,190
support business we find other ways to

00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,360
help them through community forums and

00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:33,250
those types of things but they're really

00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:36,100
not the kind of customer base that we

00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:38,110
have again going beyond just sort of

00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:39,760
that brake fixed support if something is

00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:41,260
important to your customer they will

00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,730
build expertise around it there's no

00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:44,200
doubt about that whether it takes them a

00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:45,940
year or five years they will get there

00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:47,770
eventually and so you want to kind of

00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:50,920
increase the value of what you bring as

00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:52,390
an organization our people I've always

00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,800
been our most valuable asset will

00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:55,300
continue to be our most valuable asset

00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,890
one of the things that you know we pride

00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:58,300
ourselves on again is that the folks who

00:30:56,890 --> 00:31:00,520
are here at lucidworks what they're

00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:02,230
doing with this technology whether they

00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:04,120
were working for us or not these are the

00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:05,500
things that they care about and care is

00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,440
an incredibly important part of our

00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:08,720
business and we looked

00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:10,070
people who have just care about the

00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,870
technology I care about the customers

00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:13,580
who care about the problems that we're

00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:15,980
solving and we try to value that as much

00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:17,179
as possible this is not you know the 90s

00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:19,190
where you would go out and build these

00:31:17,179 --> 00:31:20,539
software companies up in the boardroom

00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:22,580
and all the business folks were there

00:31:20,539 --> 00:31:24,620
cheering in cigars and whatever you know

00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:26,870
this is the world of developer led

00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:28,850
business and as we go in as we start to

00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:30,470
work with our customers we're not

00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:31,879
talking to executives we're talking to

00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:33,320
executive developers we're trying to

00:31:31,879 --> 00:31:35,539
solve their problems we're trying to

00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:37,070
bring value into what they're doing day

00:31:35,539 --> 00:31:39,529
to day and that's something that we

00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:41,360
pride ourselves on and the final thing

00:31:39,529 --> 00:31:43,580
and as lucid works again eight years in

00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:46,399
the business what we learn is the open

00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:47,840
to evolution right what works today may

00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:49,220
not work tomorrow I think one of the

00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,690
worst things you can do is you're trying

00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:52,370
to grow an organization or grow a

00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:54,259
business it's sort of commit to

00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:55,639
something full-heartedly where you say

00:31:54,259 --> 00:31:56,629
you know what this is what we said this

00:31:55,639 --> 00:31:58,159
is what we're going to continue to do

00:31:56,629 --> 00:31:59,629
and we're not going to waver right you

00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:01,159
want to be open to that evolution you

00:31:59,629 --> 00:32:02,480
want to listen to your customers you

00:32:01,159 --> 00:32:04,100
want to watch the business you want to

00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,529
see what's working and what's not and

00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:07,909
really optimized for that so I think I'm

00:32:06,529 --> 00:32:09,200
a few minutes over so everybody can get

00:32:07,909 --> 00:32:11,990
to lunch happy to answer any questions

00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,879
here or afterwards but thank you all

00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:19,970
very much I really appreciate it it's a

00:32:13,879 --> 00:32:22,190
great buzz word thank you will yes we

00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:24,409
have time for questions we have exactly

00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:27,440
seven minutes for questions so slow down

00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:34,460
yeah so who has a question in the

00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:36,950
audience I'm so quick question what is

00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:38,419
your revenue mix look like today like

00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:40,340
how much is platform how much is still

00:32:38,419 --> 00:32:43,399
support that's a good question so you

00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:46,250
know we we sort of made this shift about

00:32:43,399 --> 00:32:48,740
three years ago and in fact even to blow

00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:50,059
it out even further initially what the

00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:52,100
business was looking like was about

00:32:50,059 --> 00:32:54,259
seventy percent consulting services and

00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:56,960
thirty percent enterprise support and

00:32:54,259 --> 00:32:58,490
about 2013 we made a real focus within

00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,110
the organization to say we've got to get

00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:02,509
away from you know what we call one-time

00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:03,830
revenue because again it's very hard to

00:33:02,509 --> 00:33:04,820
predict it's very hard to grow the

00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:06,919
business and frankly as you're out

00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:09,320
raising money and doing all the kind of

00:33:06,919 --> 00:33:10,669
under the less glamorous things that you

00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:13,100
need to do in terms of running an

00:33:10,669 --> 00:33:15,289
organization it's just it's difficult to

00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:18,350
gain that traction when we launched

00:33:15,289 --> 00:33:20,269
fusion which was in 2014 so by then we

00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:23,029
had shifted the business to about

00:33:20,269 --> 00:33:26,059
t % subscription which was a very good

00:33:23,029 --> 00:33:28,700
shift for us within one year fusion

00:33:26,059 --> 00:33:30,259
launched in 2014 we finished 2015 of

00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:32,239
within that subscription revenue which

00:33:30,259 --> 00:33:35,269
was then about eighty percent of the

00:33:32,239 --> 00:33:37,489
revenue mix we were doing about 75% of

00:33:35,269 --> 00:33:39,559
that through the commercial platform so

00:33:37,489 --> 00:33:40,940
this was a goal that we set out to do

00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:42,679
and we were actually quite successful

00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:44,389
with and we were very proud of the

00:33:42,679 --> 00:33:45,889
outlier there and the one thing I didn't

00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:48,139
talk about too much in the support

00:33:45,889 --> 00:33:50,509
business is that you will get two cases

00:33:48,139 --> 00:33:52,639
where support can be interesting for you

00:33:50,509 --> 00:33:54,079
and we tend to look at some of the most

00:33:52,639 --> 00:33:56,299
complex and some of the largest

00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:58,579
deployment so salesforce com is replat

00:33:56,299 --> 00:34:00,379
formed everything search on top of solar

00:33:58,579 --> 00:34:02,149
and in those types of infrastructure

00:34:00,379 --> 00:34:03,859
decisions you're not going to go with

00:34:02,149 --> 00:34:05,659
something proprietary and we understand

00:34:03,859 --> 00:34:07,399
that but we're more than happy in fact

00:34:05,659 --> 00:34:08,720
we're quite excited to work with them

00:34:07,399 --> 00:34:10,549
and to support them the apple icloud

00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:12,349
would be another example of that and

00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:14,299
what we look at is if you think about

00:34:12,349 --> 00:34:16,490
the architecture and the open core model

00:34:14,299 --> 00:34:17,629
you know our investment in solar which

00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:19,399
is great because it's something we

00:34:17,629 --> 00:34:21,319
believe in it's also core to what we're

00:34:19,399 --> 00:34:23,119
trying to build on top so as we can get

00:34:21,319 --> 00:34:25,339
into environments like salesforce and

00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:26,929
start working at those volumes and those

00:34:25,339 --> 00:34:29,270
sizes of distributions and the

00:34:26,929 --> 00:34:31,549
complexity that they bring to it it's

00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:33,409
actually great experience for us we

00:34:31,549 --> 00:34:35,029
bring that obviously back into the open

00:34:33,409 --> 00:34:38,029
source code base and we consume all that

00:34:35,029 --> 00:34:40,309
value up the stack so sometimes that

00:34:38,029 --> 00:34:42,619
that mix though the transaction mix is

00:34:40,309 --> 00:34:45,919
much heavier on the platform side we've

00:34:42,619 --> 00:34:47,659
done some significant deals in the open

00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:51,619
source for support for these very large

00:34:47,659 --> 00:34:58,640
complicated organizations another

00:34:51,619 --> 00:35:00,049
question thanks are you mentioned

00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,880
industry specific features like a

00:35:00,049 --> 00:35:04,460
SharePoint connector which you develop

00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:06,710
for customers do you got a path for your

00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:09,260
industry or commercial products how you

00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:11,299
will push them into the community in the

00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:13,970
future if you see you brought need for

00:35:11,299 --> 00:35:15,380
that again if we see a broad need we're

00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:17,869
more than happy to do it we have a

00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:19,789
saying SolarWinds we win right but what

00:35:17,869 --> 00:35:21,470
we found is you get to these more

00:35:19,789 --> 00:35:23,539
specific especially proprietary

00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:26,059
integrations the community really is not

00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:28,220
interested in that and so I think we've

00:35:26,059 --> 00:35:30,740
done a really good job in sort of

00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:32,660
drawing that line between what do we do

00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:33,800
for the community as a whole and what do

00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:36,530
we do for the business

00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:39,020
and to date we haven't seen a lot of

00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:41,390
pressure either way what will get

00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:43,100
interesting is we do a lot of sort of

00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:44,450
machine learning and analytics and

00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:46,220
things that we're bringing back in to

00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:48,020
provide better search experiences I

00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:50,630
think the industry is sort of evolving

00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:52,310
towards that utilizing not just searches

00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:54,530
and index and a retrieval engine but

00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:56,420
really the smarts that come with the

00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:57,890
search engine and so I think we'll have

00:35:56,420 --> 00:36:00,350
a moment we'll have to kind of look at

00:35:57,890 --> 00:36:02,240
okay is some of what we're doing around

00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:05,000
you know the machine learning aspect and

00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:06,860
the prediction aspect of retrieval

00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,810
something that can make sense back

00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:10,970
within the community but then you get

00:36:08,810 --> 00:36:12,470
into again the technical debt and the

00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:14,240
footprint and that that you bring back

00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:16,280
into the project so it's quite possible

00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:18,380
that we open source a component that

00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:21,290
works with solar that's not necessarily

00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:24,440
part of the solar distribution good

00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:26,840
question we hear ya you mentioned the

00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:29,360
challenges of interacting with the

00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:33,290
community and gave revised how to avoid

00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:35,060
pissing them off so my question was do

00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:39,530
you think that the same advice would

00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:41,930
apply to a company that builds on open

00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:45,250
source software that is used by normal

00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:48,410
people as opposed to company's officers

00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:50,210
so I guess I mean in any case when you

00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:51,770
have a community community is a funny

00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:53,660
beast right because there's a lot of

00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:55,490
personalities there's a lot of emotions

00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:57,080
I remember when I first came to lucid

00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:58,850
works again I had not been in and around

00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:00,470
open source technology I was like wow

00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:02,540
like people take some of this stuff

00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:04,640
really personally it would like some

00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:06,230
really kind of nasty things that were

00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,870
going on on the list and that kind of

00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:10,760
thing I think it's always you know do

00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:12,710
your best to be a good citizen right do

00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:14,300
your best to be respectful and as an

00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:15,710
organization and I guess I think

00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:18,440
Bloomberg is a good example right there

00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:19,700
they are like so far ahead in terms of a

00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:21,650
lot of the rd and the things that

00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:23,270
they're doing but they showcase that

00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:24,530
back publicly and they're very open

00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:26,300
about their use and they've been

00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:27,950
contributing things back in and I think

00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:31,340
their companies that can do this really

00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:33,290
well the stigma i think is targeted more

00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:35,330
at the company who claims to be the

00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:37,640
steward of the project because now

00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:39,800
you're sort of exposed as whether you're

00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:42,200
doing right or wrong right companies who

00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:43,970
have other sort of focuses that are

00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:45,710
interacting with the community it's

00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:47,030
typically always seen as like oh that's

00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:49,040
really generous of them to

00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:51,380
come in and spend their time sponsor a

00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:53,510
conference contribute code or blogs and

00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:54,980
those kinds of things back but as you

00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:56,780
sort of stand up and say hey I'm going

00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:59,030
to be the commercial entity behind this

00:37:56,780 --> 00:38:00,170
thing you're you're just you have a lot

00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:02,990
more exposure and a lot more

00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:05,030
expectations and I think listening is

00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:06,800
the first thing that you have to do and

00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:08,360
I try to keep you know in touch with

00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,310
folks even outside of the company in

00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:12,290
terms of okay you know how are we doing

00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:13,460
what are the perceptions that are going

00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,780
on what do you think of the work we're

00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:17,210
doing infusion and those kinds of things

00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:19,550
and then our own team like I said it's

00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:20,840
very special in that our open source

00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:22,940
team some of them were actually here

00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:24,620
today are you know they're almost

00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:26,360
representatives of the community first

00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:28,430
employees of lucid work second and

00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:30,320
they're very vocal and they don't

00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:31,850
hesitate to tell us when hey you know

00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:34,400
what I don't think we should do it that

00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:36,290
way or you know things like logo changes

00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,370
or website updates and things that we

00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:40,520
just wanted to do to create better

00:38:37,370 --> 00:38:41,510
experiences for the end users we want to

00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:43,370
make sure that we were doing this

00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:44,840
without creating too much friction but I

00:38:43,370 --> 00:38:46,310
think like all things sort of social

00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:48,200
that you know you just kind of want to

00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:50,150
have a level of awareness and you want

00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:51,860
to listen to the people around you and

00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:53,360
it doesn't mean that you know they're

00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:54,650
necessarily always right or you're

00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:56,090
necessarily always right but there's

00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:57,950
just an element of respect that that

00:38:56,090 --> 00:39:00,320
needs to come into this and you know I

00:38:57,950 --> 00:39:01,760
hope that the impression is as an

00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,650
organization that we've done a good job

00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:06,020
at that it doesn't mean that we don't

00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:07,310
occasionally step on toes or create some

00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:11,990
friction that we have to then go out and

00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:15,500
kind of smooth the waters course oh well

00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:18,940
thank you will I'm giving a big round of

00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:18,940
