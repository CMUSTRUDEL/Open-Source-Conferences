Description: 
	Ira Cohen talking about "Learning the learner: Using machine learning to track performance of machine learning algorithms".

So you’ve created some machine learning algorithms and tested them out in the lab, and they seem to be working fine. But how can you monitor them in production, especially if they are constantly learning and updating, and you have many of them? This was the challenge we faced at Anodot and I’ll talk about the interesting way we solved it. 

At Anodot, we have approximately 30 different types of machine learning algorithms, each one with its own parameters and tuning capabilities, designed to provide real time anomaly detection. Many of these are online learning algorithms, which get updated with every new piece of data that arrives. Adding to the complexity, the outputs of some of the algorithms act as the inputs others. These algorithms run constantly on the vast number of signals that are sent to our SaaS cloud (currently more than 35 million signals are reported to Anodot every 1 to 5 minutes). We knew from day one that it was crucial to track the performance of these algorithms, so we would know if something happened that improved or degraded their performance, but we were faced with a challenge – how to accomplish this?
