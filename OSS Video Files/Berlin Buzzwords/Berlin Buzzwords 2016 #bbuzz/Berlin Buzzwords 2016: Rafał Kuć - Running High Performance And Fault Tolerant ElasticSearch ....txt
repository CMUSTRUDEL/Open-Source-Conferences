Description: 
	We’ve learned how to run Docker containers. And we’ve learned how to run ElasticSearch. However, to run containerized ElasticSearch nodes and to do that effectively -- and at scale -- takes a little more knowledge and work. Sure, containers can be easily started and stopped; but how do you do that with ElasticSearch inside them?

In this talk we’ll quickly run over the basic Docker+ElasticSearch setup and focus on harder problems:
- Architecting for ElasticSearch fault tolerance and high availability in containerized setup - using sharding, replication, node and shard-awareness for keeping your cluster green
- Running ElasticSearch in different modes with re-usability in mind
- Optimizing and tuning ElasticSearch for popular use cases like ELK
- Ops/Devops - monitoring ElasticSearch & Docker together - which metrics to watch, what they mean, how to act on them and first of all, how to watch them
