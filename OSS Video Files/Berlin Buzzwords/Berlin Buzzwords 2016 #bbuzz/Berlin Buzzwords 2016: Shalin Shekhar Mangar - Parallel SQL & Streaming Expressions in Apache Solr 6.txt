Publication date: 2016-06-12
Playlist: Berlin Buzzwords 2016 #bbuzz
Description: 
	Apache Solr is a powerful search and analytics engine with features such as full-text search, faceting, joins, sorting and capable of handling large amounts of data across a large number of servers. However, with all that power and scalability comes complexity. 

Solr 6 supports a Parallel SQL feature which provides a simplified, well-known interface to your data in Solr, performs key operations such as sorts and shuffling inside Solr for massive speedups, provides best-practices based query optimization and by leveraging the scalability of SolrCloud and a clever implementation, allows you to throw massive amounts of computation power behind analytical queries.

In this talk, we will explore the why, what and how of Parallel SQL and its building block Streaming Expressions in Solr 6 with a hint of the exciting new developments around this feature.

This is a talk sponsored by LucidWorks.
