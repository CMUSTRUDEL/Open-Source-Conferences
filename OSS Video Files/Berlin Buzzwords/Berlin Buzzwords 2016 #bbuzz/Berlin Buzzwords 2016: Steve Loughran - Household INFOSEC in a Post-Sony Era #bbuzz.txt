Title: Berlin Buzzwords 2016: Steve Loughran - Household INFOSEC in a Post-Sony Era #bbuzz
Publication date: 2016-06-11
Playlist: Berlin Buzzwords 2016 #bbuzz
Description: 
	The attack on Sony led to lots of talk about how they could have defended themselves. Is your household any better? Have you defence in depth? Is all that protects you a ISP's base station hasn't had an upgrade for four years? How often do you upgrade Adobe Flash on your TV? And what is it you really need to worry about in a world of internet-enabled-everything? 

I examine the threat model and attack vectors, going beyond "keep your PC up to date" to the new problems: smart TVs, fitness trackers, smartphone apps â€”even the INFOSEC issues of modern cars. In the process: whether you are publishing so much private data that worrying about laptop security is moot. Finally, it considers whether your github credentials are strategic data to nation states. After this talk you'll not only want an OSS router, you'll be packet sniffing your TV, encrypting your sensitive data off-site, and, the next time you buy a car, asking to download its ABS and near-miss event history.

Steve hi everyone i am steve cochran and

00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:13,549
quick and don't come up Mount myself I I

00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:15,990
work at home I work on Hadoop full-time

00:00:13,549 --> 00:00:18,690
hands up who uses her dupe all the

00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:21,750
libraries okay you're running my code

00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:24,359
and your own you'll notice if you see

00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:28,980
stack traces the key point is I code

00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:31,500
from home now title is talk household

00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:35,190
infosec in a post Sony era what does

00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:37,680
that mean well a couple years ago Sony

00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:39,149
got completely owned I had all their

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,010
data out there they're embarrassing

00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:44,129
emails their spreadsheets on star

00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:45,989
salaries everything got ripped apart and

00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:48,180
all the security people saying oh oh

00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:50,370
sony got it wrong so he didn't have

00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:52,050
their defense in depth their log truck

00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:54,690
he know that all their security stuff

00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,219
what were they doing wrong and I felt I

00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:58,800
felt that was a bit cruel because I

00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:00,930
thinking could I secure my own health

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,799
would I know what would happen how can I

00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:06,510
say criticize them without being in a

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,610
state myself to defend the things so I

00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:11,220
thought right well I will do it I will

00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:13,950
try and make my house secure as a

00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:16,560
summary the talk I failed dramatically

00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:18,119
for reasons we'll get into okay but I'll

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,820
be surprised if you could do any better

00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:24,630
and if you are can I'd like some answers

00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:26,580
I think key point is is like what am I

00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:28,920
trying to do so I'm trying to make my

00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:31,829
house secure or more importantly I want

00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,350
the data in it to be secure I want it to

00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:36,689
be uncorrupted I want to be able to get

00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:38,340
that data one I when I want it don't

00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:40,710
want it to be you know encrypted and

00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:43,350
having to paying bitcoins for it back so

00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:45,420
it available and I wanted to be mine as

00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:47,579
in private I don't want it to be up on

00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,220
the web unless I specifically put it

00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:52,350
there the final thing resource control

00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:54,090
means I want my son to go to bed and not

00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:57,450
watch YouTube when he's in bed okay so

00:01:54,090 --> 00:02:00,479
that's a special case so the first

00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:03,060
lesson from the Sony hack is do not make

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,130
an enemy of a government or anyone with

00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:08,399
similar skills anonymous other full-time

00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:09,959
hacker groups none of us stand a chance

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,670
in that world if somebody's going to sit

00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:12,840
down and break into you knowing who you

00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:15,629
are what you run

00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:21,150
and stuff you're doomed so get over it

00:02:15,629 --> 00:02:22,950
by not making enemies like that scope

00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:25,290
things back and say right I'm going to

00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:26,849
defend against drive-bys malware that

00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:29,190
just basically does a boot force attack

00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:30,540
scans my network tries to go through the

00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:32,250
browser's things like that with

00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:34,260
laura-leigh targeting me they're

00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:36,900
targeting everyone in mass market

00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:41,099
attacks so that's my goal can I defend

00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:44,940
against that but you got to think about

00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:46,380
privacy to the key point is when I

00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:48,120
started looking at security I should

00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:51,030
think about not just how to stop people

00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:53,940
malicious getting in but stop my

00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:56,010
personal data getting out I think the

00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:58,110
big difference between security then in

00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:00,120
privacy is security is how vulnerable is

00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:03,780
my systems are having somebody break in

00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:05,400
whereas privacy is more how much of my

00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:08,160
personal information does this

00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,650
well-designed app leak outside my house

00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,360
even when it's behaving as intended you

00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:14,129
know privacy violations that are built

00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:17,430
into modern systems I think would be my

00:03:14,129 --> 00:03:18,810
conclusion so I went around trying to

00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:22,620
split things up onto that different

00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:25,019
scale vulnerability versus privacy nice

00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:27,000
and simple beginning a notepad piece of

00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:29,310
paper and a pencil nobody can steal it

00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,660
lista get into your health doesn't

00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:33,420
really leak day to the outside world

00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:34,980
unless I stick photos up online there's

00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:37,079
not much of a backup strategy there's

00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:41,669
the house burns down the papers gone so

00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:44,040
that's a price but it's it's secure the

00:03:41,669 --> 00:03:46,139
other end of the scale windows XP the

00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:48,120
most insecure system you can buy right

00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:50,549
now well god buy it you wouldn't even

00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,319
bother to download it by the time you've

00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:53,700
installed it it will be have somebody

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,099
will have found it on the network and be

00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,810
running things the sole reason it won't

00:03:56,099 --> 00:03:59,340
be running bit calm mining is it's so

00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:01,200
out of date that they probably don't get

00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:04,169
the decent device drivers for the GPUs

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:09,269
so just hands up who's got windows XP in

00:04:04,169 --> 00:04:10,919
their house I saw her that was buying

00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:12,630
something two weeks ago in a shop and

00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:14,250
they had a windows XP to shopping too

00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:16,349
you know till for the money which is

00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:19,470
terrifying it's embedded out there so

00:04:16,349 --> 00:04:21,390
that's 11 on the security scale the

00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:23,490
other one is the previously scale 11 is

00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:24,570
google okay they want everything about

00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:26,190
you they want to know everything about

00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:31,500
you they're trying to model you

00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:32,790
so that's that's the other axis so now

00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:36,180
that foreground let's have a look at

00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:37,560
what our systems we have how what do I

00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:39,660
think they are in terms of security and

00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:42,660
vulnerability so Firefox hands up

00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:43,910
Firefox now I think actually it's pretty

00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:46,170
secure as long as you keep it up-to-date

00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:48,180
you also have to run your ad blockers

00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:50,310
out there because that's the standard

00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:52,620
attack for drive-bys is people will

00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:55,350
place an ad saying i want people running

00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:58,320
windows XP with firefox and flash

00:04:55,350 --> 00:05:00,660
installed and they own you so keep it up

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,210
to date what's nice it's relatively

00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,500
secure it's relatively private except

00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:07,410
once you make Google your search engine

00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:09,030
and then we have chrome I actually think

00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:11,490
it's better for keeping itself up to

00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:14,070
date but in exchange it's permanently

00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:16,380
sharing all your personal data if you're

00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:18,270
curious bring up wireshark and start

00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:19,920
listening to how much packets being sent

00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:22,350
once you're logged into chrome it's just

00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:24,030
permanently chattering away I have no

00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:25,950
idea what it's doing I tried to actually

00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:27,360
uninstall this and make go myself user

00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:29,520
list but then everything broke at that

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,280
point so I've logged in and accept

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,770
inevitable there and then there's

00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:36,090
internet explorer don't run this that's

00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:37,830
all the summaries just don't run it okay

00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:42,120
download firefox or chrome and then just

00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:43,860
leave it alone flash don't run that

00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:46,560
either if you can help it really it's a

00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:48,990
it's insecurity jitters between a 9 in

00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,790
the 10 every two weeks so it starts off

00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:52,500
beginning a month with a nine there'll

00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:55,080
be an emergency patch two weeks later it

00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,970
goes to 10 so it's a losing battle the

00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:59,340
best thing you do is uninstall it you

00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:01,320
can maybe go with chrome it does keep it

00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:02,820
up-to-date maybe in the background it

00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,470
also leaked privacy in different ways

00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:07,610
because as its own cookies so you think

00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:10,080
you've deleted your cookies you haven't

00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:11,970
best metric that you have flash isn't

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,130
working as you go to BBC website and you

00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:15,960
can't watch videos about Donald Trump I

00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:18,300
think that's a success that you know we

00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,620
should all be grateful for that's

00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,660
destroying stopping your mind being

00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:23,970
damaged at the same time so now we have

00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:26,360
a nice scale basically we have privacy

00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:28,230
at the top vulnerability down below

00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,150
nodes where I've put everything at the

00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:31,620
end of the vulnerability scale and it's

00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:33,060
also interesting that things get more

00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:35,190
and more vulnerable over time if you

00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:38,390
leave something alone it just inherited

00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:38,390
becomes more insecure

00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:42,820
but that's just a PC that's not what my

00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:44,890
house is like I go into the room next to

00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:47,020
my office and there is sometimes too

00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:50,710
often a child in front of the television

00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:53,320
he's playing a video game online video

00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:54,970
game on a ps4 hooked up through a smart

00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:57,100
TV through an amplifier that has an

00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:58,750
Ethernet port in the back for airplay he

00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:00,160
has an ipad we're watching a YouTube

00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,240
video and there was a phone where he's

00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,050
actually talking to his friends on

00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:08,050
snapchat that is my son and most these

00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:09,760
things they are consumer goods the one

00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:13,210
I'm going to call out is the television

00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:15,550
by LG where someone found a couple years

00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:18,610
ago that it was sending unencrypted

00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:20,740
packets to LG servers in Korea South

00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:22,570
Korea that is letting them know what

00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:24,460
terrestrial TV channels you were tuned

00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:25,600
into that's a television that's

00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:27,640
basically something what you're watching

00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,560
and there's a bit of embarrassing but

00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:32,490
about that an LG basically changed your

00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:34,450
privacy policy to say yes we can and

00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:36,180
children shouldn't be watching this TV

00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:38,710
because it's personal information I

00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:40,450
brought up wireshark I couldn't see it

00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:42,040
but in the hand it's it chatters away

00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:44,500
and choosing encrypted channels now so

00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:46,990
it might be you know enough that's the

00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:49,270
dividing line between a smart television

00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:51,180
and the dumb monitor okay dumb monitors

00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:54,720
don't steal your personal secrets and

00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:57,700
there's nothing in there to get owned

00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:00,580
and of course all this is defended from

00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:02,080
the outside world by a netgear firewall

00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:08,080
off but whilst people and all he's got a

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:11,169
ps4 at home smart TV netgear firewall

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:13,330
between them in the outside world okay

00:08:11,169 --> 00:08:14,590
well the scary thing about this is a few

00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:16,510
years old liver time I checked for a

00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:18,729
firmware update it says there isn't none

00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:20,440
and you think how many more security

00:08:18,729 --> 00:08:22,750
patches and violation have come up over

00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:26,710
time when this one goes no nothing

00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:30,729
insecure I got fed up with this and went

00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:33,099
and downloaded the dd-wrt open-source

00:08:30,729 --> 00:08:35,110
firewall stuff instead it's incredibly

00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:36,880
good it's incredibly powerful it's got

00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:39,039
lots of features I couldn't get it to

00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:42,070
work or more strictly I couldn't get the

00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:46,060
PPP o OE stuff to work with my isp

00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:49,510
British Telecom so I sort of half gave

00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:51,130
up on that stuck it in the middle of

00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:52,250
things probably insecure relative

00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,930
private said right

00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,890
I'm going to give up on that instead I'm

00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:58,100
going to solve the problem slightly

00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:59,960
differently so what is went out and

00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:01,760
bought a new netgear firewall and I'm

00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:03,380
just going to assume that consumer

00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,090
devices like this they're going to have

00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:06,560
a finite lifespan of about two or three

00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:09,890
years before I start trying to open

00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:12,830
source them I took that all Rita flashed

00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:16,460
it to DB dd-wrt and actually created a

00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:18,470
separate subnet inside my house so

00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:20,720
lately partitioned the stuff I really

00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:23,840
care about my laptop my development

00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,850
tools the code you're running and that's

00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:27,740
isolated from the stuff that my son is

00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:30,320
trying to run consumer electronics the

00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:31,640
televisions the PS Falls there's a

00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,860
Raspberry Pi on there there's another

00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:35,810
smart TV dealers we're building this

00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:37,520
collection of internet-enabled devices

00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:39,650
in our house we have no idea what the

00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:41,420
source code is they don't get kept up to

00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:43,070
date and how you know how can you trust

00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:46,090
your doorbell or your light switch to be

00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:48,200
secure anymore so if isolated them out

00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:50,180
that doesn't mean I mean I've got no

00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:52,490
control over the privacy but at least I

00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:54,920
can kind of limit limit the damage they

00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:57,920
can do and I think that's the best I can

00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:59,800
hope for I would be like to declare

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,730
success at this point but like I said

00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:04,220
I've been fighting a losing battle

00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:08,540
because I have a smartphone smartphones

00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:10,400
in the room hands up yeah you lose here

00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:11,930
are two examples of phones is android

00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,730
android goes to previous even worse on

00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:15,200
the left british airways checking out

00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:18,740
and that british airways check it out

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:21,050
good it wants to know my calendar my

00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:23,390
private details my location and all my

00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:25,280
photos that's the left screenshot next

00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:27,830
to it says i'm flying to terminal null

00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:29,720
in nairobi so someone out there doesn't

00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:31,880
know their sequel validation about data

00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:33,890
that comes back over the wire that's a

00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:35,270
warning sign that means whoever wrote

00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:37,790
that code isn't going to be writing a

00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:39,410
secure app so many there's easyjet they

00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:41,390
want to them identity location photos

00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:43,880
camera device ID and call information

00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:45,620
who I'm talking to and it's got a

00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,990
nullpointerexception there it's the same

00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:49,970
thing the developers are well-meaning

00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:52,310
but they've asked for society much

00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:54,560
permission and like the rest of us we

00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:56,240
can't can't write write code that works

00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:59,810
properly there's not a fault of them

00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,970
with all the same but it's just the fact

00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:04,700
is the phones given the information and

00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:06,019
then even if the airplanes aren't

00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:09,259
maliciously stealing my

00:11:06,019 --> 00:11:10,550
calendar details it's insecure and we're

00:11:09,259 --> 00:11:12,139
you know we're building that in and it

00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:15,249
goes outside the firewall so we're just

00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:18,199
we've lost control there so that's an 11

00:11:15,249 --> 00:11:20,569
ok I'll phones or limb so I was really

00:11:18,199 --> 00:11:22,069
didn't like the android I went and

00:11:20,569 --> 00:11:23,959
bought an iphone instead and I was

00:11:22,069 --> 00:11:25,160
really excited now i'm preparing for

00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:27,379
this talk i was going to bring up the

00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:29,119
slide saying hey look last year android

00:11:27,379 --> 00:11:30,589
knew where I was going this year go to

00:11:29,119 --> 00:11:32,629
Google location and they don't know

00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:35,360
where I'm going except it turns out

00:11:32,629 --> 00:11:36,949
google no knew that i drove from bristol

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,869
to a bit of Wales and they could even

00:11:36,949 --> 00:11:40,699
work out how illegally fast i was

00:11:38,869 --> 00:11:42,619
driving based on the timestamps along

00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:44,629
there and the reasons that turned out to

00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:46,249
be Google photos I thought maybe

00:11:44,629 --> 00:11:48,019
actually the google mail checking with

00:11:46,249 --> 00:11:50,420
doing it but in fact Google photos

00:11:48,019 --> 00:11:52,189
heartbeats in letting Google central

00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:54,619
know where you are for a better

00:11:52,189 --> 00:11:58,100
photographic experience google photos

00:11:54,619 --> 00:11:59,569
hands up turn the privet turn the

00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,889
location data off in fact you know

00:11:59,569 --> 00:12:03,079
you're gonna run anything Google make

00:12:00,889 --> 00:12:04,850
sure it's not lugging you but basically

00:12:03,079 --> 00:12:07,160
Google seem to be doing everything they

00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:09,739
can to track you and model you and

00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:13,100
everything like that so no I think we've

00:12:09,739 --> 00:12:15,110
lost there as well and then of course

00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:18,529
comes my little fitness tracker fitness

00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:20,600
bits and some fitness trackers yeah okay

00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:23,600
that's sending my heartbeats and

00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:25,279
sleeping habits up to Microsoft

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,889
somewhere unless the same people the

00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:30,379
Microsoft that wrote windows XP though I

00:12:27,889 --> 00:12:33,429
think they've learned interesting enough

00:12:30,379 --> 00:12:35,569
I think someone else Fitbit they had a

00:12:33,429 --> 00:12:37,339
there was a virus that was going over

00:12:35,569 --> 00:12:38,959
bluetooth between their devices also

00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:41,689
they were unintentionally publishing

00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:43,249
when people were having sex which when

00:12:41,689 --> 00:12:44,839
you combine with a facebook graph you

00:12:43,249 --> 00:12:48,199
can work out who they are up to up to

00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:49,759
with i also have a little bicycle

00:12:48,199 --> 00:12:51,949
speedometer thing that tracks my

00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:54,529
location to both of those devices they

00:12:51,949 --> 00:12:57,470
upload my gps data to services like

00:12:54,529 --> 00:12:59,269
strata and that driver sorry at least

00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:00,860
that I'm getting something exchange for

00:12:59,269 --> 00:13:03,559
my information I can take my heart

00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:05,389
beating data my sleeping habits then go

00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:06,919
to my doctor and say look I'm having a

00:13:05,389 --> 00:13:08,869
bad time sleeping on my heart rates too

00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:11,660
high I can go to strive and say look I

00:13:08,869 --> 00:13:12,949
me doing work so yes I'm leaking lots of

00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:15,230
information there but I am getting

00:13:12,949 --> 00:13:16,970
something back for it I also think

00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:19,720
compared to something like a phone these

00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:21,699
are relatively secure

00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:25,899
I'm going to put them security probably

00:13:21,699 --> 00:13:29,339
three privacy six plus and then things

00:13:25,899 --> 00:13:32,620
just got worse we got a second-hand car

00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:35,230
lost september-october which was three

00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:37,569
years old at previous owner now I

00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:39,250
actually tried to download the vehicle

00:13:37,569 --> 00:13:42,009
history of this only they wouldn't

00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:43,420
really let me at it the point being it's

00:13:42,009 --> 00:13:45,579
all there the car knows when it's been

00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:46,990
driven how along ABS has been engaged

00:13:45,579 --> 00:13:48,459
whether it was in manual mode or

00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:49,660
automatic of all the kind of things that

00:13:48,459 --> 00:13:53,199
you shouldn't be doing with the car is

00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:55,449
in that look so it would be nice for me

00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,860
to know when we resell it I have to

00:13:55,449 --> 00:13:59,230
think about a raising all that history

00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:00,730
because my wife drives it badly but then

00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:02,019
you get suspicious when you go buy a new

00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:03,279
car you go let's look at this driving

00:14:02,019 --> 00:14:05,199
history and it's like oh no it's empty

00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:06,970
if you're like when you buy a car and

00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:08,290
the engines will be cleaned up it means

00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:11,290
although it was leaking oil and they've

00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:13,420
hidden it so that's that yeah that's a

00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:19,329
privacy violation being hard coded into

00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:21,790
our vehicles and about it where i live

00:14:19,329 --> 00:14:23,709
in bristol it's hilly so all i think i

00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:26,949
need to do would be actually no vehicle

00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:29,259
acceleration speed duration of your

00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:31,209
distance between stops and you can work

00:14:29,259 --> 00:14:33,579
out where I live where my son goes to

00:14:31,209 --> 00:14:35,800
school where our journeys are so it's

00:14:33,579 --> 00:14:37,389
not just a history of vehicle users a

00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:40,329
history of how I've traveled around the

00:14:37,389 --> 00:14:42,790
country at least one on driving combine

00:14:40,329 --> 00:14:44,170
that with my phone and my little fitness

00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:47,559
tracker and basically you know

00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:50,490
everything about where I go to so that's

00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:52,750
not very good on a privacy perspective

00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:57,370
what do you think is like security size

00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:59,410
3 4 5 you know it is ok I thought it was

00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:02,350
pretty good until eventually sat down to

00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:06,430
read the full infotainment manual and it

00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:07,809
tells me how to turn flash off this is

00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:11,379
not a joke this is from the manual it's

00:15:07,809 --> 00:15:13,649
like settings sound cookies change to

00:15:11,379 --> 00:15:17,860
mobile web page view call up options

00:15:13,649 --> 00:15:19,449
activate flash player it's like I was

00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:21,160
terrified at this point I mean you

00:15:19,449 --> 00:15:22,750
basically you run around to the car to

00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:30,209
make sure it's not really running flash

00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:33,310
ah oh yeah that's a good point really

00:15:30,209 --> 00:15:35,199
so that certificates isn't it that's

00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:36,880
don't warn about illegal certificate and

00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:38,410
of course this is the car that's hooked

00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,230
up to my phone and then gets back to my

00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:43,779
laptop so it's a couple of hops away

00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:45,550
anyway I was very lucky we got them we

00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:47,949
discovered that the previous owner of

00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:49,959
this car had not paid the premium for

00:15:47,949 --> 00:15:51,519
the flash option so you know we we

00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:53,709
dodged a bullet there but when you buy a

00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:57,339
second-hand car you don't say does it

00:15:53,709 --> 00:15:58,540
have flash installed I don't know why

00:15:57,339 --> 00:16:00,759
you're laughing hands up who's bought a

00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:05,440
car for this within four years old or

00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:08,079
less did it have flash installed exactly

00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:10,029
exactly we don't know we have absolutely

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:12,550
lost control and people going about

00:16:10,029 --> 00:16:14,170
diesel gate being a scandal I mean cars

00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:15,970
designed to kill people anyway but you

00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:19,120
know putting flashing is he morally

00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:20,050
wrong anyway at that point I'm going to

00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,000
have to conclude that we're out of

00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:24,220
control so you put the privacy and

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,410
security yourself up there and the fact

00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:28,300
that is windows XP there isn't actually

00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:30,279
so bad anymore because if you've got a

00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:33,850
phone up there and we've got a car with

00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:35,500
/ install and then you know I'm sending

00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:39,759
my entire heart beat and sleeping habits

00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:43,509
up to Microsoft huh and that's basically

00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:45,550
it really we have we've lost okay and

00:16:43,509 --> 00:16:47,589
you know I can't secure my house anymore

00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:50,649
I in the last few months I've become

00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:53,380
aware of how utterly insecure my house

00:16:50,649 --> 00:16:56,290
is but sure can keep Firefox up to date

00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:57,550
I can you know install the new flash

00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:59,470
player but there's always apps on the

00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:01,509
phone I need to check in to get home

00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:03,819
tomorrow we put a car that you know

00:17:01,509 --> 00:17:06,610
could have had flash installed and it's

00:17:03,819 --> 00:17:08,199
just no we can't do a thing about it the

00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:11,500
only way I could secure my house would

00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:13,390
be getting a 1950s car with no data in

00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:15,819
it at all getting all this little nokia

00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:19,860
phones going back to pencil and paper

00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:19,860
and telling my son he can't have friends

00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:26,110
it's too late for consumers to stand a

00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:28,809
chance to fix this okay you cannot do it

00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:32,110
at the point of purchase we need to fix

00:17:28,809 --> 00:17:33,280
this firstly whoever's in the BMW sauber

00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:34,900
engineering team needs to tell their

00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:37,690
marketing department that flash is a bad

00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:40,390
idea the rest of us we need to look at

00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:42,669
our code and start thinking this is

00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:43,299
unacceptable we cannot build in the

00:17:42,669 --> 00:17:45,340
security

00:17:43,299 --> 00:17:47,619
violations that are going to be out

00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:49,149
there we can't we have to think very

00:17:47,619 --> 00:17:53,320
hard about what personal information

00:17:49,149 --> 00:17:54,970
people give away and ensure that people

00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:57,759
get something meaningful in exchange for

00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:59,619
it sharing my GPS traces exchange for

00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:01,809
cycling history and stuff I'm happy with

00:17:59,619 --> 00:18:05,529
that having my television record what

00:18:01,809 --> 00:18:07,779
channels my son watches not so good so

00:18:05,529 --> 00:18:10,809
we need to do this we are the people who

00:18:07,779 --> 00:18:12,399
are aware of what can be going on we are

00:18:10,809 --> 00:18:17,350
the people who ruin our position to fix

00:18:12,399 --> 00:18:20,259
this so if you take home something from

00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:23,169
this talk consider this all external

00:18:20,259 --> 00:18:25,029
data is malicious just don't trust a

00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:27,100
single packet that comes over the wire

00:18:25,029 --> 00:18:29,529
assume things like anything talk about

00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:31,239
buffer length will be lying and you know

00:18:29,529 --> 00:18:32,649
anything that looks a bit like a struck

00:18:31,239 --> 00:18:35,139
that you're reading in is going to be

00:18:32,649 --> 00:18:36,489
malicious for example the arrow talk

00:18:35,139 --> 00:18:38,889
yesterday was talked about in memory

00:18:36,489 --> 00:18:40,539
data structures assume that in-memory

00:18:38,889 --> 00:18:41,799
data structure been passed as malicious

00:18:40,539 --> 00:18:43,090
and it's offsets a point you can

00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:45,070
somewhere random in your own system

00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:48,460
memory I just do not trust any data that

00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:50,529
comes in from outside similarly I think

00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:52,389
we need to consider that all interaction

00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:55,299
to the outside world are leaking some

00:18:52,389 --> 00:18:56,590
form of personal information now I don't

00:18:55,299 --> 00:19:00,940
know what we can do about that but at

00:18:56,590 --> 00:19:03,369
least be vaguely aware of it as an

00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:06,700
example here is me creating a URL of

00:19:03,369 --> 00:19:09,549
what is North Korea's new social network

00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:15,789
and then printing it is this secure or

00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:18,009
insecure his in its in a talk what

00:19:15,789 --> 00:19:20,889
actually happens is when you call URL to

00:19:18,009 --> 00:19:23,559
string in Java it does a DNS lookup of

00:19:20,889 --> 00:19:26,379
the string name you passed him so that's

00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:29,109
me is just on a DNS lookup in career but

00:19:26,379 --> 00:19:30,789
means North Korea now know that somebody

00:19:29,109 --> 00:19:33,429
from the UK is interested in their

00:19:30,789 --> 00:19:35,859
social network too they now have the

00:19:33,429 --> 00:19:37,179
option of sending a DNS packet all the

00:19:35,859 --> 00:19:38,739
way back to my house through that

00:19:37,179 --> 00:19:40,389
netgear firewall through the untrusted

00:19:38,739 --> 00:19:42,549
zone through my second firewall to my

00:19:40,389 --> 00:19:45,340
laptop and as we've seen this year you

00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:46,600
can't trust DNS either so you know

00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:49,720
that's just we don't think that's

00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:51,490
insecure but really it is so we need to

00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:53,019
understand all these issues and ideally

00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:56,410
we should be running systems that aren't

00:19:53,019 --> 00:20:02,560
that hopelessly insecure I'm going

00:19:56,410 --> 00:20:05,260
finishing early which brings me to looks

00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:08,860
golden tux spark spark everyone hands up

00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:11,950
who's yawning spark spark one point six

00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:15,640
point zero and using that version now

00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:18,550
you're nervous now aren't you this is 10

00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:20,980
lines of code which is in Scala so it's

00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:24,460
not really that intelligible but it's

00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:26,380
name is object file and key thing is

00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:30,310
that green thing a little bit from the

00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:34,180
bottom says utils deserialize array what

00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:37,530
this little function is doing is loading

00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:40,630
in a file that consists of a series of

00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:43,140
serialized java objects that's a data

00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:45,820
file so then why your java objects fine

00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:49,120
now one interesting aspect about java

00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:51,040
serialization is it assumed it doesn't

00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:54,040
assume external data is malicious it

00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:55,780
just reads it in int respects abuses all

00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:59,950
the registers and just leaves you in a

00:20:55,780 --> 00:21:01,890
bad state and it turns out the biggest

00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:05,770
vulnerability you can get on this is

00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:08,260
actually very good is with groovy

00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:10,360
because in groovy you can serialize

00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:15,280
closures little lump two juvies groovy

00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:17,590
script and when someone DC realises it

00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,630
they then groovy will then read that

00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:22,510
string in it'll pass that and it will

00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:25,270
run that code as you so what I need to

00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:28,330
do to run this code in somebody's spark

00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:30,400
cluster is to say please read this file

00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:32,530
here is some interesting data why don't

00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:35,380
you read it I could put it up online s3

00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:38,350
and say interesting data set and spark

00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:40,300
will quite happily go into it the good

00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:43,240
news is you have to have groovy on your

00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:45,760
classpath for this to happen the bad

00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:48,190
news is it's actually in spark assembly

00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:50,590
1.6 point naught naught because the

00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:53,050
spark people wanted it but because spark

00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:54,850
depends on hive and the hive maven

00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:58,240
metadata says by the way here comes

00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:59,890
groovy that was one of the things I did

00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,770
on spark was once we discovered this was

00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:04,270
trying to get rid of it it's not in

00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:06,550
spite one point six point one or later

00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:08,410
but it's an example actually of just a

00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:10,400
really hilarious combination of bugs

00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:12,260
there's javadi's serialization

00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,910
the real mistake its try to be helpful

00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:16,040
it trust the date when it shouldn't

00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:17,960
combined with something on the classpath

00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:20,860
that nobody realized was there and

00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:23,120
hideously insecure that combination

00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:24,770
we're not two controllers like we need

00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:27,920
you know we need to be more aware what's

00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:30,590
going on I also think that we need to

00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:33,140
move beyond this model of saying my

00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:34,970
process is trusted Java has a sandbox

00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:37,130
notion but I think we need to be more in

00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:39,560
terms of compartmentalizing inside

00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:42,410
system to the whole and you could maybe

00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:43,970
use containers to do that speaks a right

00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:47,050
let's use docker let's run their

00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:50,330
container and will reduce the damage

00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:52,430
which is good except when you type

00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:54,170
docker Paul you're downloading a binary

00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:57,680
from somebody else that says trust me I

00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:59,630
am well meaning and competent because

00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:01,430
here is a list of commands up there

00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:03,410
which I believe everyone in this room

00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:05,120
will have probably typed once in the

00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:08,210
last week hands up you've done any of

00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,440
these commands you're not software

00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:14,420
developer you've kept your hand down you

00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:15,680
an architect by any chance sorry but the

00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:17,300
point is actually that's amazing is that

00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:19,670
the only person in my house that

00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:24,050
downloads executables on a regular basis

00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:25,730
apart from yeah popham son's ps4 is me

00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:27,860
and I pretty much do it every morning I

00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:30,320
come in and do a get to pull maven in

00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:32,570
school or something like that I don't

00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:34,400
out gate up day I install them random

00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:35,930
things of NPM which because it doesn't

00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:40,340
work reliably its probly most secure but

00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:41,990
at the chain and it's let's just insane

00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:43,730
we're trying to write a secure systems

00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:46,880
of tomorrow I'm writing the software

00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:48,620
that you're running and yet I'm naively

00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,930
trusting everyone out there with a build

00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:53,960
file to basically be well-meaning and

00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:56,120
the third hop away version of groovy to

00:23:53,960 --> 00:24:01,700
not pass closures why are you nodding so

00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:03,200
much Nicholas and you know I think about

00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:04,820
those things that I really care about it

00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,550
actually turns out that probably

00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:09,410
actually those Apache credentials to

00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:10,850
actually commit code back into her dupe

00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:15,020
are probably some of the most sensitive

00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:17,300
things I have with my password I could

00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:20,390
probably change the build of Hadoop to

00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:22,640
download a to basically run some little

00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:23,720
maven plugin that downloads a jar that I

00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,639
stuck up on

00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:28,860
maven central week before that

00:24:26,639 --> 00:24:30,899
recognizes if the user name is Nick

00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:32,580
birch that will then run random code

00:24:30,899 --> 00:24:34,019
steal his credentials and in delete all

00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:36,870
his personal data apartment really

00:24:34,019 --> 00:24:39,570
embarrassing photo which goes up on

00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:41,809
YouTube I don't know why you're laughing

00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:46,049
you should be looking nervous now and

00:24:41,809 --> 00:24:48,149
you know we so we software developers we

00:24:46,049 --> 00:24:50,519
just chosen the wrong process we're you

00:24:48,149 --> 00:24:53,340
know we're we're naively trusting we

00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:54,659
have to recognize that we shouldn't do

00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:58,169
that we have to be paranoid about

00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:59,580
everything at the very least we should

00:24:58,169 --> 00:25:01,350
be starting to do things like checking

00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:02,820
the gpg signatures of stuff we

00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:05,070
downloaded off maven central you know

00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:07,740
just start being fixing that bit as a

00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:09,840
core bit of paranoia regarding things

00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:11,549
aren't apache credentials i am debating

00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,350
whether i should really be doing

00:25:11,549 --> 00:25:14,970
something like not have them on my

00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:17,580
laptop at all i really wanted to be

00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:19,380
nervous I mean cautious about it I would

00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:21,360
actually keep a separate container or

00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:23,610
something like that where even if

00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:27,000
somebody breaks into my laptop it's not

00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:30,149
bear and then one stop more empowered I

00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,919
would actually be saying I don't run

00:25:30,149 --> 00:25:34,820
development tools directly in my laptop

00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:39,320
go run it in a separate vm or container

00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:41,940
because it is just we're too vulnerable

00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:43,889
nobody the only reason that we've got

00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:46,590
away with it so far is nobody really

00:25:43,889 --> 00:25:48,539
malicious to set out to do it I'm

00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:51,120
tempted now was tempted as a proof of

00:25:48,539 --> 00:25:53,159
concept or actually do it but I knew

00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:55,139
would cause a bit of a upset all around

00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:58,230
especially with my colleagues you might

00:25:55,139 --> 00:26:00,899
ask me to leave the building but given

00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:02,519
that some my colleagues work on the NSA

00:26:00,899 --> 00:26:03,690
chemo project and I know who else has

00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:05,490
commit on the Akuma project could be

00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:08,039
running probably running code in the NSA

00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:09,210
within two weeks of setting off and that

00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:10,710
point I would make an enemy of a

00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:12,360
nation-state and I would die

00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:13,889
mysteriously in a road accident and

00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:19,139
that's not really why I'm not going to

00:26:13,889 --> 00:26:20,760
do it so that is pretty much it i will

00:26:19,139 --> 00:26:22,260
close by pointing out that despite all

00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:24,570
this over the message from linkedin

00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:26,820
saying by the way we stole your unsalted

00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:29,549
your unsalted hashed password was in

00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:33,690
fact stolen and they forgot to tell me

00:26:29,549 --> 00:26:35,159
about it so that's about privacy as well

00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:36,899
there's the stuff you stick up on the

00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:37,260
web isn't actually secure either so

00:26:36,899 --> 00:26:39,510
really

00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:41,250
you know those people those websites are

00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:43,860
based around collecting people's

00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:46,770
personal details they need to care a lot

00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:51,390
more about privacy too again all the way

00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:53,940
up the stack so like I say we've lost it

00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:57,000
can't be fixed at the consumer point all

00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:59,400
that's left is as developers we have to

00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:04,740
start thinking about what to do better

00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:10,290
and we're not even aware right now of

00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:12,420
what we're doing wrong and finally never

00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:15,090
trust a free light bulb which has a USB

00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:16,230
port on the back of it now that in mind

00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:18,450
because if you do make an enemy of a

00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:20,730
nation-state that's where they'd go you

00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:24,120
think you'd be grateful in fact you'd be

00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:31,980
collecting their data so that's me any

00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:38,330
questions thanks Steve questions

00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:38,330
comments there's one of the book

00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:55,020
um so how do you realistically see this

00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:57,830
getting solved in and how much time how

00:27:55,020 --> 00:28:02,550
do I realistic see is being solved I

00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:04,020
really don't know I think even if I try

00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:06,030
and do some better compartmentalization

00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:07,710
of my code at home I'm still running a

00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:11,040
maven build I'm still creating source

00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:12,900
code that gets distributed I mean we

00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:16,110
want to identify better wear those big

00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:18,120
vulnerabilities are and key one is that

00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:19,950
whole process of downloading and

00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:22,200
executing binaries as part of our

00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:23,250
building release process needs to be

00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:26,300
looked at we need to be far more

00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:28,770
paranoid at least about the signatures I

00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:30,510
think if you want to get involved in

00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:32,070
this if you're an open source project I

00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:33,390
would really recommend you actually go

00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:36,060
on the mailing list that deals with

00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:37,670
security issues because I am on some of

00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:40,590
the deeper stuff and you soon discover

00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:42,900
all these things going on the audits how

00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:45,270
to fix this stuff like cross-site

00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:47,790
scripting vulnerabilities a version of

00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:50,070
HTTP client that's version 3 that

00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:52,980
doesn't check HTTP certificates and all

00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:54,390
that kind of stuff so getting involved

00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:56,280
in that stuff will give you greater

00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:59,550
awareness what's going on there's things

00:28:56,280 --> 00:29:01,020
like the IRC sans newsfeed is continual

00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:03,000
security breaches in world and becoming

00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:05,400
more aware of the problems that is not

00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,480
sufficient to at least fix things at

00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:09,720
least in that point you'll be vaguely

00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:11,010
aware of how vulnerable we are and maybe

00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:13,290
maybe you can come up with some better

00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:14,940
ideas to fix this okay the problem is is

00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:17,370
that whenever somebody says security

00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:19,260
tries to solve the problem they end up

00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:20,640
producing something that's unusable they

00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:22,650
end up producing these big container

00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,120
compartmentalised certificate signing

00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:27,000
mechanisms and all this stuff and it's

00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:28,860
just it's unworkable and finally we

00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,360
develop as we like naively downloading

00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:33,630
all the binaries as long as I build

00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:35,250
takes less than three minutes yeah I

00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:37,380
don't really know what to do at all

00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:39,120
actually it's terrifying because you

00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:41,970
know we are building stuff with no

00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:43,290
security in naively downloading binaries

00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:45,480
to help do it and then we're sticking

00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:46,710
them in cars and televisions which are

00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,940
going to last for a long long time that

00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:50,700
cars going to be running for another

00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:53,010
decade from now our previous car dated

00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:55,650
from the windows XP era and yet it's

00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:57,890
still out there and you know hope the

00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:57,890
scenes

00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:11,640
alright more questions if not then this

00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:14,580
concludes our session exiled for the

00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:16,140
attendance we don't have a half of our

00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:19,950
coffee break and then we'll be meeting

00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:22,250
you again 30 minutes things thank you

00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:22,250
