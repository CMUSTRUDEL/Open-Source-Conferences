Title: Berlin Buzzwords 2018: Steve Loughran â€“ @Dissidentbot: dissent will be automated! #bbuzz
Publication date: 2018-06-13
Playlist: Berlin Buzzwords 2018 #bbuzz
Description: 
	Taking my lead from the (alleged) Russian participation in the 2016 US election, my contribution to the 2017 UK general election was @dissidentbot. This is 500 lines of ruby code running on a raspberry pi and tasked with heckling UK politicians via Twitter. As such it provided a valuable contribution to the democratic debate. While Twitter has not yet identified @Dissidentbot as actively interfering with the UK election, I am confident its few hundreds of tweets helped shape the outcome.

This talk looks at the engineering aspects of the project, the production experience such as Twitter's spam blocking algorithms, runaway-reply-loops, and the challenge of generating new content.

More important are the social and ethical aspects. Twitter has changed the nature of communication between politicians and the electorate, sometimes for the better, but sadly, sometimes not. Does @Dissidentbot improve the communications by giving us an immediate right to respond with our own message? Or does it worsen the online discourse which it's clear is shaping referendums and elections.

Most critically: the fact that a ruby script randomly picking phrases can become an active participant in the online debate of an election is not a good sign for a functional democracy.

hi everyone I'm Steve Loughran as people

00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,490
have said I normally work on the deep

00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,690
stuff this was something I did in my

00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:14,639
spare time last year

00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:16,860
it's called distant BOTS it is up and

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,990
running if you're running Twitter you

00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:21,030
can tweet to outdistance bots and it may

00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:23,870
actually reply to you right now okay and

00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:27,270
the codes are there for you to play with

00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:30,390
so what is this bot it was a small robot

00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:33,239
I created a Twitter account in January

00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,590
2017 Trump's inauguration when we first

00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:36,870
discovered that politicians were

00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,199
prepared to state random facts so I

00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:41,370
thought if they can do it so can i but

00:00:39,199 --> 00:00:43,489
being a software engineer I didn't

00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:46,800
actually write anything because I'm lazy

00:00:43,489 --> 00:00:48,839
until along comes April when Prime

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,100
Minister in the UK says we're going to

00:00:48,839 --> 00:00:52,379
have a general election and we will

00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,210
destroy everybody so at that point I

00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:55,829
actually brought up distant BOTS brought

00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:59,309
it life and we can see it working is a

00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:01,079
screenshot from May 2017 so resume says

00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:03,510
something we need the right of

00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:05,100
something-or-other within 15 seconds

00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:07,110
distant bodies replied going we need a

00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:09,509
strong leader her name is Angela Merkel

00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:11,969
may or may not be true but the point is

00:01:09,509 --> 00:01:13,439
it was a heckle and it came in first so

00:01:11,969 --> 00:01:15,299
the point is is that when politicians

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,430
say something the role of distant BOTS

00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:20,700
was to argue with them ahead of anybody

00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:22,380
else did it work well here's a

00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,899
screenshot of one of the online betting

00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:27,299
sites on the night of the election and

00:01:24,899 --> 00:01:29,130
Jeremy Corbyn and to raise a mayor

00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:31,439
actually roughly the same as who's going

00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:33,780
to win I would like to say I consider

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,490
myself personally responsible for that I

00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:37,289
haven't been summoned to Parliament to

00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:39,329
explain that and I wasn't given any

00:01:37,289 --> 00:01:40,829
rubles either so I don't think I was

00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:42,270
there but it's a start

00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:44,990
okay and because we can all join

00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:47,429
together and take part in this and

00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:49,950
interest enough I brought it up again on

00:01:47,429 --> 00:01:51,780
Friday it's just it is a raspberry pie

00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:55,170
running plugged into my Wi-Fi router

00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:57,030
booted it up on Friday still life still

00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:58,770
heckling politicians first thing we have

00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,929
to raise amazing I'm off of the g7

00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:03,200
summit distant bot says you're the

00:02:00,929 --> 00:02:06,509
worst-performing economy in the g7

00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,160
perfect timing still absolutely live the

00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:10,080
heckles from last year turn out to be

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,120
still valid which is kind of

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,420
disappointing but again it shows you

00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:17,370
having robots set to provide abuse in

00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:19,349
context awareness is actually quite good

00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,610
I have no context awareness it just

00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:22,980
happened to be picking sentences at

00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:26,540
random but that actually turns out to

00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:30,209
work I don't know why you're laughing

00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:31,800
here is the architecture we have we're

00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:33,920
hooked into the Twitter firehouse I

00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:38,370
don't robot listens to all gets tweeted

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,900
when it gets a scene one of the people

00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:41,700
that's following it looks to see in the

00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:44,489
data directory if there is a sign of

00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:48,330
that name if so it's a line and replies

00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:50,160
if it just gets a mention that isn't

00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:52,860
actually reply it picks up the phone

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,170
self text has anybody tried it so far

00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:56,099
this session so tweeted this and button

00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:58,980
you should get a reply

00:02:56,099 --> 00:03:01,709
and finally after control plane which is

00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:04,200
I can manage this through the direct the

00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:06,030
DM API off Twitter itself saves me

00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,879
having to actually find that little pine

00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:12,120
SS aging into it so that is the core

00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:17,700
architecture it is 450 lines of Ruby

00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:22,709
code right now I'm going to switch to

00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:26,040
the code itself for a second it's a

00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:32,519
little bit of Ruby code it starts up it

00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:35,639
listens finer it begins it basically

00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:37,739
gets a reply to say is it me I create

00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:40,410
ignores retweets it builds a reply and

00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:44,340
it sends it back so it is trivially

00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:46,519
simple okay it responds it keeps going

00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:49,260
forever until it's told to shut down and

00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:51,329
it just it just heckled that's all it

00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:52,859
does is it follows people and if you're

00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:54,750
on the list of people to argue with it

00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:56,700
will argue with you if you're not on the

00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:59,340
list and you mention it but not a reply

00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:02,239
it'll argue with you and I can tell it

00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:06,120
what to do how does it actually work

00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:08,310
it picks sentences at random and move

00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,169
from which or try an example here I

00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:12,870
would like somebody from the audience

00:04:10,169 --> 00:04:14,430
maybe Nick or somebody else to think of

00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:17,760
an extra sentence for me to add in as a

00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:20,209
heckle no then hello audience pay

00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,209
attention

00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:26,030
all right if I comment out some of the

00:04:24,289 --> 00:04:28,520
others a bit more likely so there is me

00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:30,590
I've added a new command to the file

00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:32,449
that's very good but that's my laptop

00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:35,710
and distant thought lives in a Raspberry

00:04:32,449 --> 00:04:37,129
Pi at home so we have to have a

00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:40,310
blockchain

00:04:37,129 --> 00:04:45,770
based communications mechanism to

00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:47,180
publish this so I go git commit

00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:51,830
directory I'm going to commit a

00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:55,430
directory and commit and push so we go

00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:57,740
push that's good so now it's on github

00:04:55,430 --> 00:05:01,490
or Microsoft github as we know how to

00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:03,050
call it and it's up there how are you

00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:10,250
actually going to get it to distant bot

00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:12,259
this is where finally we talk to the

00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:17,449
fact that distant bot is actually got a

00:05:12,259 --> 00:05:19,789
command interface - which is on the DM

00:05:17,449 --> 00:05:21,409
Channel in theory anybody actually who

00:05:19,789 --> 00:05:24,379
it's following and heckling can use this

00:05:21,409 --> 00:05:25,909
API - it just so happens that Boris

00:05:24,379 --> 00:05:30,020
Johnson and to raise a may don't

00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:31,759
understand my lines that nobody actually

00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:32,509
listens to them even when she tells them

00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:40,599
face to face

00:05:32,509 --> 00:05:40,599
so now we just do an update only wait

00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:45,900
and there we go it's pulled it so now

00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:47,490
it's ready to heckle okay so it's apart

00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:50,520
on the fact I can't update the code I

00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:51,960
can basically run this from from

00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,230
anywhere telling it what to do and

00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:58,610
heckle things so now if I say something

00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:58,610
pay attention you two in the front

00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,479
sorry we had a small ops problem there

00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:26,620
so I will say pay attention despite ops

00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:33,669
problems and we go and this is the bots

00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:43,720
will see that something else here and I

00:06:33,669 --> 00:06:44,500
get replies and what happens is this the

00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:50,139
bots listens

00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:52,569
it gets responses it's not working today

00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:55,960
it is up and running honest ok

00:06:52,569 --> 00:06:58,569
believe me um this isn't me look dooms

00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:00,639
me that's you happen unless you give

00:06:58,569 --> 00:07:04,449
overload it is your overload you this

00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:05,139
thing anyway there we go so it runs it

00:07:04,449 --> 00:07:07,539
heckles

00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:09,699
this is distant bot itself doing the

00:07:07,539 --> 00:07:12,759
replies interests enough one of the

00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:18,159
problems here is actually it is really

00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:19,750
hard to actually test this stuff picking

00:07:18,159 --> 00:07:20,800
random sentences is returning them but

00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:25,150
you have to make sure all this stuff is

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:27,190
working because I was not doing this at

00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:29,080
work I was using Ruby ran during the

00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:30,900
build tool I wasn't doing any testing

00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:34,150
apartment deployment

00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:35,860
fortunately the Conservative Party press

00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:39,340
office during election issued a press

00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:41,259
release every 15 minutes all day so

00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:42,639
basically I could deploy him than 15

00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:44,800
minutes and you were things are working

00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,960
on art halfway through the election I

00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,210
got blocked I think basically because I

00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,979
was replying too fast so I went to end

00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:53,440
up adding some jitter and sleep then a

00:07:50,979 --> 00:07:58,960
small possibility of not replying just

00:07:53,440 --> 00:08:00,699
to keep people happy things always go

00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,770
wrong in operations first one was

00:08:00,699 --> 00:08:05,050
distant BOTS kept on rebooting every

00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:08,289
night I tracked that down to the fact

00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:09,969
that my Wi-Fi base station is set to

00:08:08,289 --> 00:08:14,169
reboot every night and that powers off

00:08:09,969 --> 00:08:16,779
the USB driver for the delivery pipe the

00:08:14,169 --> 00:08:18,729
other fun thing was it accidentally

00:08:16,779 --> 00:08:20,740
started spamming a user called self

00:08:18,729 --> 00:08:23,649
whoever self is on Twitter I had to

00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:25,060
apologize for them because that self

00:08:23,649 --> 00:08:26,589
heckle thing everytime you mentioned

00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,360
distant BOTS and we just tweets herself

00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:29,310
and

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,780
I think they've got a bit bored of it so

00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:32,969
that you know but it's interesting

00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:39,149
operationally you have to create other

00:08:32,969 --> 00:08:41,640
accounts just to just a test the worst

00:08:39,149 --> 00:08:42,450
news is is that I left it up and running

00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,790
during election

00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:48,950
I had it sending messages out completely

00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:52,200
random fact people would argue with it I

00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:54,300
mean that is not funny at all especially

00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,800
from any beef in the UK so basically

00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:58,440
someone says some fat it goes you're

00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:00,779
arguing with a robot and losing users

00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,550
yes every time I guess I tried to get a

00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:04,260
job as put in for put in but failed the

00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:08,730
interview and we just go on like that

00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:11,430
and people do not seem to recognize that

00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:14,130
a account with the name distant BOTS

00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:17,279
whose photograph is a Raspberry Pi whose

00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:23,040
link is to a home page on github

00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:24,930
probably isn't a real person and that's

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:31,890
not good because these people go on and

00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:35,100
vote later this is really not good okay

00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:36,839
yeah and the but the other scary thing

00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:39,930
is right is that I could make up random

00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:42,209
facts to heckle politicians and it

00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:44,190
appeared to contribute to the level of

00:09:42,209 --> 00:09:46,100
discourse going on on the Internet

00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:48,839
so we know there are idiots out there

00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:50,760
they will seem to argue with random

00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:53,579
facts made up they probably believe

00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:54,779
random facts too so you could say well

00:09:53,579 --> 00:09:56,490
maybe we shouldn't be allowing these

00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:57,449
people on the internet but they're still

00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:59,430
out there and they're still going to

00:09:57,449 --> 00:10:00,510
vote and then it's either that throw

00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:02,940
them off Twitter and they'll be on a

00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:05,220
Facebook group it's just as bad but

00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:06,480
that's the scary thing so if you look at

00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,370
all the stuff that's been going on with

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,140
Russian involvement and all this kind of

00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:12,600
stuff what it really means is there are

00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:14,459
lots of idiots out there and what

00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,680
Facebook and Twitter have done have

00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:18,870
reduced the cost of communicating with

00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:20,640
idiots okay they've lowered the barrier

00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:22,410
till now you had to be using newspaper

00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,600
called the Daily Mail you had to have

00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:27,449
Fox but it was expensive the barriers to

00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,880
entry were quite high now raspberry pie

00:10:27,449 --> 00:10:33,300
for 50 lines of code and you can engage

00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:35,600
head-to-head with the idiots so I'm go

00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:37,610
to command line we've really done that

00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,959
you can pull down and play with yourself

00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:41,480
all you need to do is download a

00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:43,579
configuration file give it your Twitter

00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:45,560
secrets which you can create an API

00:10:43,579 --> 00:10:47,839
account for it and you can just deploy

00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:53,420
it make up your own accounts heckles

00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:56,410
anything you like Twitter it's quite

00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:59,839
happily happy to let you do this

00:10:56,410 --> 00:11:01,430
provided you don't put URLs as soon as I

00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:04,579
start my first URL in the account got

00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:07,699
blocked and what that does is it give me

00:11:04,579 --> 00:11:10,490
hints about Twitter's spam detention

00:11:07,699 --> 00:11:12,290
detection so they clearly they want to

00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:14,120
defend against spam they've done the

00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:17,449
work there they say okay how do you

00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:20,420
recognize spam things like the ratio of

00:11:17,449 --> 00:11:22,459
followers to follow EES stuff they say

00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:25,459
do they post URLs do they try and follow

00:11:22,459 --> 00:11:28,069
lots of people etcetera etcetera but

00:11:25,459 --> 00:11:30,800
since I put a URL in there kicks that

00:11:28,069 --> 00:11:33,199
off gets blocked stop sending URLs just

00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,690
start telling politicians their radius

00:11:33,199 --> 00:11:37,819
and should resign nothing stops it

00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:40,310
whatsoever and I think it's because it

00:11:37,819 --> 00:11:45,500
doesn't tip over the threshold it is too

00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:47,569
hard to distinguish from human beings if

00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,829
you are going to attack it I'd say you

00:11:47,569 --> 00:11:50,990
should be looking at things like what is

00:11:48,829 --> 00:11:52,699
the latency to respond if you say

00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:54,230
something if it responds immediately to

00:11:52,699 --> 00:11:56,959
something to raise a Mayor Boris Johnson

00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:58,490
says everytime suspicious you could look

00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:01,130
at the hours of operation and say yeah

00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:02,949
that's kind of suspicious too but

00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:05,240
otherwise it seems to get through

00:12:02,949 --> 00:12:06,800
another thing as well what about looking

00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:09,250
at what it says and the answer is well

00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:12,560
actually my robot was stating truth and

00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:14,660
we have basically the some of the most

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,750
senior politicians on the planet state

00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:19,579
utter lies and Twitter gets away with it

00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:22,699
so why shouldn't we be allowed to

00:12:19,579 --> 00:12:26,899
dissent at the same time it's kind of

00:12:22,699 --> 00:12:29,870
bleak because we apparently have seen

00:12:26,899 --> 00:12:31,220
lots of evidence but Russians and other

00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:35,930
nation states are interfering with

00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:38,870
democracy it is a lot harder to detect

00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:42,350
and defend against this than it would be

00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:44,209
to detect spam for example when I was

00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:46,069
running this code the biggest actual

00:12:44,209 --> 00:12:48,260
hardest thing to do was to try to think

00:12:46,069 --> 00:12:49,640
up new things to say on a regular basis

00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:51,380
once you used the

00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,790
Haeckel a few times I just turn that one

00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:54,530
off and try and think of a new one but

00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:56,960
actually content generation is the hard

00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:58,460
thing if you ever read some of the

00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:00,620
that's come out from the us about what

00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:02,930
the the Russian internet research group

00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:04,520
did whatever a big amount the effort was

00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:06,230
they had a whole roomful of people who

00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:08,330
were trying to generate new content and

00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:12,050
start arguments and it's that it's the

00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:13,640
content generation that's quite hard the

00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:15,560
scary thing is often actually worse than

00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:18,140
that the people doing this are often

00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:19,880
basically art students and graduates and

00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:21,530
people with language skills and they

00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:23,450
they tend to cost less than software

00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:25,790
engineers in terms of bringing stuff to

00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:28,160
production so you can have one person to

00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:29,960
write a 450 line Ruby script and then

00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,600
you just have hundreds of people that

00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:34,640
speak English vaguely well and that's it

00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:40,750
that that's basically your your you know

00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:42,980
your election disruption unit so one

00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:46,370
daddy's to build a robot that interferes

00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:49,280
with the the internet to lots of other

00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:51,710
people seem to be doing it as well three

00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:53,570
is it ethically right for me to deploy

00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:56,900
something like this hands up who's gonna

00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:58,040
do it when they get home okay I think

00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:00,380
you should I think it's really about

00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:02,780
this because otherwise if the you know

00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:04,190
the other teams are busy interfering in

00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:06,740
the world this way then why shouldn't we

00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:08,360
and if you got more of us there with a

00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:10,520
bit of jitter more random people

00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,840
heckling then actually we can make sure

00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:14,720
that our message gets across more

00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:19,700
broadly yeah codes that download and

00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:21,290
play and now we're on time so are there

00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:29,810
any questions from anyone in the

00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:31,340
audience okay first question I have an

00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:33,260
idea for preventing the spam detection

00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:35,210
and you could kind of pull in other

00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:37,790
tweets from other people just randomly

00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:40,400
so you get different content make it

00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:42,170
harder to detect is this spam yeah I

00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,790
think sometimes that's why spam bots

00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:45,560
retreat the other thing is they look at

00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:47,300
conversations so you can look at

00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:50,180
followers to follow ease the ratio and

00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:52,340
has a robot appeared to have a

00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:54,230
conversation with other people so mine

00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:56,570
hadn't done that so that bees detect but

00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:58,550
say if you have enough robots you can

00:14:56,570 --> 00:15:00,590
create that graph of a loop and I think

00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:02,240
that becomes really hard to detect so

00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:02,610
you can basically you can bootstrap and

00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,170
that

00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:07,110
of robots that know each other that

00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:10,410
follow but amplify and it's hard to both

00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:14,249
detect and defend against that more

00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:17,100
comments or questions more tweets

00:15:14,249 --> 00:15:24,049
somebody at the front could you improve

00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:29,399
the code in any way no that's question

00:15:24,049 --> 00:15:31,230
right one second if people start at the

00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:34,199
discretion with it doesn't mean that you

00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:37,499
pass the Turing test actually it doesn't

00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:39,569
if you talk to it it will reply most of

00:15:37,499 --> 00:15:42,569
the time but if you reply to it it stops

00:15:39,569 --> 00:15:43,860
replying because it was too easy to get

00:15:42,569 --> 00:15:45,239
into the loop you ever see those things

00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:47,549
where robots argues each other would

00:15:45,239 --> 00:15:50,069
never get bored I didn't want to do that

00:15:47,549 --> 00:15:51,989
mmm they got bored so it just hangs up

00:15:50,069 --> 00:15:54,329
so the point is if you talk to and it

00:15:51,989 --> 00:15:58,290
doesn't reply it's concluded Niels that

00:15:54,329 --> 00:16:01,470
you're boring you know and I don't be

00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:05,549
offended by this but does that mean that

00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:07,350
it is in fact self-aware who knows you

00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:08,879
know I mean who knows sometimes it stops

00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:10,290
talking to me in it you know I'm gonna

00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:13,679
have to kill it if it keeps doing that

00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:15,389
really and I running for the rest of the

00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:16,259
day tweet to distant BOTS see what

00:16:15,389 --> 00:16:18,030
happens okay

00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:25,820
alright thanks Steve

00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:25,820
