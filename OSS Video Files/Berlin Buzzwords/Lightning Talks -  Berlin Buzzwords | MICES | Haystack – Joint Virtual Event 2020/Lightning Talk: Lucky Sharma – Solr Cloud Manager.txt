hey everyone I'm lucky so today I'm

00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:15,690
going to talk about these food manager

00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:18,210
which is like a powerful tool to manage

00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:24,150
your solar plus choice from a single

00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:26,460
point so the solar the what's the origin

00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:28,380
of the SIS for our cloud manager so the

00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,470
reason why we came up with this solution

00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:33,480
is like we have once so we have multiple

00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:35,520
solar clusters and to manage them there

00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,710
was no centralized API or control center

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,320
so that we can make the changes and get

00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:44,070
the book get it to all these requesters

00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:45,719
so to make that we basically create a

00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,699
solar-powered manager which basically

00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:50,129
has much more potential on the

00:00:47,699 --> 00:00:52,230
capabilities like it sizes your solar

00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:54,960
cloud along the clusters with the

00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:57,239
convicts and this could happen across

00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,679
clusters second thing is like it's a

00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:01,949
single interface where if you want to

00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:03,870
change any config or updating them or

00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:05,190
uploading a new config itself so you

00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:08,250
just need to upload that country to the

00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:10,350
API or the UI we have and it will just

00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:12,270
update that config inside zookeeper and

00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:14,549
reloaded your solar cell if you want to

00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:17,610
so it has like multiple options to do

00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:20,759
that other thing is like tracking down

00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:22,619
the CDs here changes in the status so it

00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:24,210
will basically track down the CDC or

00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:26,880
changes which is happening so once you

00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:28,829
trigger CDs here it will check these

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:33,810
changes and notify you was it depend on

00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:36,000
the UI then you can also trigger the

00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:38,130
backup in the restore and it can notify

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,320
you if it's an async mode that once

00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:42,240
they're completed along with that so

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,049
there are cases so in our current lease

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:50,520
we basically have like a live shadow

00:01:45,049 --> 00:01:52,170
areas to manage the data in indexes so

00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,719
to switch the aliases or creating or

00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:58,049
managing the aliases in the multiple of

00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:59,520
course or across purchase so this sole

00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:02,100
account manager is helpful in that cases

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,450
and so in a case where you just want to

00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:07,289
switch the areas as something goes wrong

00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:09,300
in your life cluster we can the back end

00:02:07,289 --> 00:02:11,070
or team or the dev ops team can just use

00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:15,120
a single API to just statistical switch

00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:17,940
the aliases on that so here is the

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:21,190
architecture proposed for this one so

00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:22,690
once we have multiple solar plus

00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:26,110
like cluster one person requester and

00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:28,930
this is single set of services which is

00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:31,690
like solar of manager running on top of

00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:32,590
them so and there's a react to you I

00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:35,010
basically which kid

00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:36,910
it's basically and asked the ease-of-use

00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:39,489
to use these a peons

00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:42,819
so if if there's in service-learning we

00:02:39,489 --> 00:02:45,099
just want to interact with the clusters

00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:47,890
like in Jason has switched the aliases

00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:50,799
of condition then they can use this API

00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:52,690
directly or if the something goes wrong

00:02:50,799 --> 00:02:54,130
and someone has to create the

00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:56,049
collections or update the collections

00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:59,799
the developers or DevOps can use the

00:02:56,049 --> 00:03:01,630
react UI or can just use the API which

00:02:59,799 --> 00:03:03,250
can directly update your clusters so

00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:05,620
basically the wrapper around all the APS

00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:10,480
we have but brings all of them under one

00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:13,269
umbrella this is the sort of API list we

00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,970
have so like we have four areas CDC our

00:03:13,269 --> 00:03:17,829
data extra mentions in the count code

00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:19,060
management so as you see in the area

00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:22,420
since we have like deleting all the

00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:23,680
aliases switching the aliases or you are

00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:25,900
no special more specific clusters all

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,709
the aliases or just a specific you'll

00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:29,950
see me one is list

00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:32,620
similarly for other purposes like CDC

00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:36,519
are and the code management we have like

00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:38,950
cluster based thing and if I go to the

00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:40,750
UI part this is how simple UI looks like

00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:42,220
so you can select the question from the

00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:44,950
top down and you can see the solar

00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:47,500
hassle there could be cases that you can

00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:49,660
see that one of the cluster is down but

00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,370
other process alive so you can see from

00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:53,440
this UI itself that whiskerson is down

00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:57,790
and what are the health on other

00:03:53,440 --> 00:04:00,760
clusters so this is a single point of us

00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:02,799
or the first point of check that if

00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04,660
someone was to do what how the health of

00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:07,510
Sola Christus is and they want to update

00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:09,579
it so requester or they're all the

00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:15,780
questions they can just use this UI and

00:04:09,579 --> 00:04:18,190
the services to do that so that was the

00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:21,579
sole account manager if you have any

00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:27,330
question you can just post good slack so

00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:27,330
that's what AHA the solar power manager

00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:35,120
have some of the question was the

00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:36,710
corresponding channel nothing one of

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,140
them is a lot in mind I would I would

00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:41,480
bring my question at 1:00 but before

00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:43,940
that we have we have more questions you

00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:49,250
know there's a question that do you use

00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:51,140
the CDC are for the disaster recovery so

00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:52,940
it's not so CDC has not further deserves

00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:55,490
recovery but so kinetic they are not

00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:57,050
using CDs here so in cases there when

00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:58,670
they are CDs here so it's basically an

00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:01,220
answer the use case but some of some of

00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:04,400
the cases where we need to use CDC are a

00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:06,230
little recovery because like suppressor

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,510
one could be a blue custard cluster and

00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:10,130
the red cluster so in that case yes CDC

00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:13,520
are will be using but we are not using

00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:16,220
in that way okay there's another

00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:19,100
question that is the solar cloud manager

00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:21,530
open source which was one of my

00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:23,120
questions as well yeah so actually I

00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:26,540
have to get repository which I'm working

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,340
upon so I have pretty API which are like

00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:30,110
oh but suppose right now but I'm working

00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:31,910
on the UI so the UI which I've shown

00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:34,760
earlier it's not a fully fledged ey

00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:40,460
absolutely so it will be a launching

00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:43,040
soon but yeah the well I think we all

00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:44,990
look forward to this being available for

00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:47,750
the use I think it's going to be a great

00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:50,720
utility to us one of the questions that

00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:52,490
I had was that do you plan to extend

00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,979
this for the master/slave architecture

00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:57,200
as well sometime in future maybe

00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:59,750
something everyone so I miss the

00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:03,020
question can easily do you plan to

00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:05,300
extend this kind of capability for the

00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:07,130
master/slave architecture as well yeah

00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:09,080
yeah so basically I'm planning to cover

00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:11,419
all the cases or all the APNs to LA

00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:13,220
provide so that will be a complete big

00:06:11,419 --> 00:06:15,350
umbrella so nobody has to go to Seoul on

00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:16,880
you were to make the change because in

00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:18,290
our normal case we have multiple

00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,610
questions right we don't operate on a

00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:22,520
single solar power Moses Magnum

00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:23,000
production so to manage that crisis kind

00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,400
of cases

00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:30,140
yeah I'm planning to evolve it to cover

00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:32,090
also regulates okay we have lot of more

00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:35,240
questions coming in but we are tight on

00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:37,280
the schedule so I would but we would

00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:39,070
have to take them any social section

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,830
snow

00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:43,570
yeah we have we have very good questions

00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:46,720
I would say I think I can take one last

00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:47,890
question dr. Monson it says how do you

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,570
plan to handle security

00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:55,600
the first thing a manager gets active

00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:57,550
yeah so all the clusters exactly so

00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,350
actually for security order so what we

00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:01,090
are doing is like there are UI is made

00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:03,490
on react and we are putting

00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:06,760
authentication services like actually

00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:08,560
with authentication so nobody will

00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,000
directly if so the operation is like

00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,510
which is this via post shortcode

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,890
operations we are putting security so

00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:17,830
nobody can turn that

00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:19,090
ok yeah so you got a shady link and I

00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:20,560
think people are really excited to

00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:24,520
explore that

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:26,260
ok so I think thank you so much for a

00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,760
great talk this was pretty interesting a

00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:30,730
nice thing is going to be super useful

00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:32,590
for a lot of us will be using us or a

00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:36,490
cloud and I look forward to your mantra

00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:40,240
slave manager as well sometime soon

00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:43,290
sure thank you so much I think we are

00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,290
going to bring you back again

00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,029
