One of the things I like, working as a consultant, is working on different challenges, find parallels between the various solutions, and learn a lot along the way. I worked for customers among the most prominent e-commerce, travel, and food industries in The Netherlands. In this talk, I want to share the top 10 lessons learned from doing search projects at these customers for the past ten years. Without giving away spoilers, the lessons vary in areas like organizational structure, KPIs, technology, content, and user experience. After the talk, you have some ideas and inspirations for improvements to your search projects.

	00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:12,049
so today we're going to talk about ten

00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:14,210
lessons learned in search projects the

00:00:12,049 --> 00:00:16,610
past ten years I'm yet oh I'm going to

00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:18,080
do this with my colleague Barron as we

00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:21,470
have a tight schedule we will not take

00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:24,380
too much time to introduce ourselves so

00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:27,050
ten years of search it's a lot of a lot

00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:28,370
of time I still remember the first

00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:31,340
project that we did together

00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:34,160
about ten years ago we were well

00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:35,780
educated in in elasticsearch we knew how

00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,910
to install it when you have to configure

00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:40,310
it we knew how to talk to it when you

00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:42,950
have the right queries so we were ready

00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:45,680
for customers and we were ready to help

00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:47,480
customers so the first customer we we

00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,579
went to started asking questions and

00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:52,550
then he was asking questions about vm 25

00:00:49,579 --> 00:00:54,710
and he started asking questions about

00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:56,630
problems with stemming and stop words

00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:57,770
that you could lose words even if you

00:00:56,630 --> 00:01:01,460
did it in the right and the wrong

00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:03,380
combination and byron and myself were

00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:05,930
there and we started looking at each

00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:09,229
other like oh man we still got a lot to

00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:11,420
learn and well we're now 10 years

00:01:09,229 --> 00:01:13,399
further we've gained a lot of experience

00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:16,039
we know a lot more about search these

00:01:13,399 --> 00:01:18,770
days but we're still learning and I

00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:20,119
think that's very important in the

00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:23,389
search domain that you keep on learning

00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:26,409
keep on improving and keep on getting

00:01:23,389 --> 00:01:30,950
better experience to the search users

00:01:26,409 --> 00:01:33,590
let's start so another customer that I I

00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:37,520
was at I was called to to help them

00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:39,859
improve their search solution and while

00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:43,189
it took me a few weeks to to go through

00:01:39,859 --> 00:01:45,310
it thoroughly and I prepared a nice

00:01:43,189 --> 00:01:48,619
presentation for the management team I

00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:50,119
of course it was not as technical as you

00:01:48,619 --> 00:01:51,349
see in this slide with all the formulas

00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:53,869
for that was a kind of a technical

00:01:51,349 --> 00:01:55,909
presentation where I created a road map

00:01:53,869 --> 00:01:59,090
what we should do and how we could

00:01:55,909 --> 00:02:03,799
improve so I put my my laptop at screen

00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:05,509
and I I wanted to start talking and

00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:07,429
immediately the manager took the word

00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:10,489
and he said well search is really bad or

00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:15,280
he did use a little bit other words that

00:02:10,489 --> 00:02:15,280
I'm not going to repeat here but I

00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:19,400
even start my presentation and he was

00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,490
showing on the website why search was

00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:27,470
bad and I almost felt like that was it

00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:30,500
so that was what I had to do so when you

00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:32,600
recognize this maybe in this case no one

00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,970
cares enough about search could be wrong

00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:36,800
because he cared enough to hire me and

00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:39,710
to tell me that he thought it was very

00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:43,490
bad but they don't really care enough

00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:45,680
about improving it together and and to

00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:48,400
learn about how to improve it there's

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,930
not really like a business plan in

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,000
available and in how to improve search

00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:54,950
and why and the amount of budget that is

00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,750
needed and those kind of things and

00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:59,030
there's also nobody responsible for

00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:00,709
search in a management team usually they

00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:04,190
just see it as a sort of a technical

00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:05,690
problem and that's it so if you're in

00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:07,310
this situation the result is usually

00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:09,530
that the customer just tells you that

00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:14,300
search is bad and you just need to fix

00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:16,450
it or the solution to this to this thing

00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:19,550
is that before you actually start

00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:21,890
analyzing the search solution you need

00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:23,840
to prepare the management and the other

00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:25,370
involved people of the company for the

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,730
search challenge that are going to take

00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:30,320
you have to come with a sort of a common

00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:32,510
understanding of what the search problem

00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:34,640
is and you have to explain that

00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:37,459
improving search is a journey and not

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,330
just a singular a single event that when

00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:40,190
it's done it's done

00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:42,800
you need to keep improving you need to

00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:45,650
keep doing it together one thing that we

00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:48,320
learned is that you can execute sort of

00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:50,540
a maturity scan and the result of the

00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:52,820
scan is usually a road map in which

00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:57,950
steps you're going to improve search for

00:03:52,820 --> 00:04:00,440
the customer so the first lesson is that

00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:02,360
you need a business driver to succeed

00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:04,489
with your search challenge without the

00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:06,380
business involvement and without a clear

00:04:04,489 --> 00:04:08,030
goal together with the business it's

00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:15,320
going to be hard to get a very good

00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:17,479
search experience as general just

00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:19,700
explained search needs a business driver

00:04:17,479 --> 00:04:22,460
in order to become a success but the

00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:24,169
only way you can help a business figure

00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:26,599
out and where to steer that direction is

00:04:24,169 --> 00:04:28,800
when you give them some data to act on

00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:30,509
or analytics

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:35,669
so what happens if you don't have any

00:04:30,509 --> 00:04:37,409
latex slide then improvements are made

00:04:35,669 --> 00:04:39,330
without clear goals and nobody really

00:04:37,409 --> 00:04:40,919
has a clue what you're improving

00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:43,680
whether you're improving sales or

00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:47,159
customer experience at all now a lot of

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,500
times business has one KPI mostly

00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:51,569
conversion rate which is a good thing to

00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,430
act on as a KPI but there are multiple

00:04:51,569 --> 00:04:56,729
KPIs that you can actually look at and

00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:59,639
monitor and create reports for so if we

00:04:56,729 --> 00:05:01,469
check the next slide then what we

00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:04,289
recommend is actually from the start

00:05:01,469 --> 00:05:06,090
start creating some reports and no doubt

00:05:04,289 --> 00:05:08,370
some KPIs that you want to monitor and

00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:10,349
keeping track for instance zero results

00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:12,240
is the most obvious one because it

00:05:10,349 --> 00:05:14,129
really points out what terms users are

00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,870
searching but then end up with an empty

00:05:14,129 --> 00:05:17,969
page meaning that you either have

00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:20,009
something missing in your matching setup

00:05:17,969 --> 00:05:22,770
or you're just missing content which you

00:05:20,009 --> 00:05:24,599
can act on by getting that contract zero

00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:27,000
conversion is an interesting one

00:05:24,599 --> 00:05:29,069
that you actually have all the search

00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,800
terms that people get products for but

00:05:29,069 --> 00:05:32,750
then next up they don't buy anything

00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,889
meaning that there could be something

00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:37,110
wrong with the amount with the type of

00:05:34,889 --> 00:05:38,849
products that you're returning then we

00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:40,830
have often found but never clicked and

00:05:38,849 --> 00:05:42,090
often click but never bought which

00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:44,550
actually could tell you something about

00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:46,520
those kind of products that people are

00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:48,840
looking for but not actually converting

00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:50,250
but I think the most important part of

00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:52,740
these kind of analytics is that you

00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:54,990
start with them early create reports so

00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:57,150
it's visible by everyone who's working

00:05:54,990 --> 00:06:00,000
on this search solution to come up with

00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:02,340
ways on how to improve the search in the

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,949
future and then the most important part

00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:06,719
is to import business with that so I

00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:08,400
think the really the second lesson is

00:06:06,719 --> 00:06:09,719
willing to start and discuss analytics

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,449
like straight from the beginning and

00:06:09,719 --> 00:06:13,319
involve everyone that has something to

00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:18,360
do with the world

00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:21,360
totally all right so now we got

00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:23,039
analytics fix analytics gives a really

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,430
nice overview of where you're standing

00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:28,830
at the moment so you monitor your live

00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:31,259
performance and see where people have

00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:32,909
issues but we know that search is like

00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:34,580
an evolving system where we want to make

00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:36,719
changes and make improvements and

00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:38,969
normally what you would do when you want

00:06:36,719 --> 00:06:41,729
to make improvements to your setup is

00:06:38,969 --> 00:06:42,420
you think of an idea of something that

00:06:41,729 --> 00:06:44,010
could

00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:48,090
prove your relevancy you could approve

00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:50,910
add extra features but normally you

00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:53,790
start with an Ibis 'as you implement

00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:56,210
your change you run an a/b test for two

00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:59,280
weeks and you get results back and

00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:04,500
they're negative back to the drawing

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:06,270
board the next side so the symptom would

00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:09,090
be that you make changes but those in

00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:10,560
changes in the end don't expect you the

00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:12,960
same results as you expected

00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,400
so you don't have a positive outcome the

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,870
downside of that is that your release

00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,790
side was slow because you have to go

00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:20,010
back to the drawing board think of a new

00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:22,230
idea and start a whole phase over again

00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:24,030
with a/b testing so you don't really

00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:26,310
know up front before you put the test

00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:30,030
live whether you're gonna have a good

00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:31,890
result so what we normally start with

00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:33,870
when we go to your customer or we start

00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:35,280
helping out an existing customer is

00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:37,650
start with the judgment list an

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,630
adjustment list is a list of judgments

00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:41,700
where judgment is a relevancy mapping

00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:44,760
between a product and a search term you

00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:47,640
can boil down to a question is this

00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:49,620
product relevant for this search term so

00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:51,240
we can make these judgments by looking

00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:53,520
for instance at our top hundred queries

00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,230
and we have some regressions queries

00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,620
that we know are sometimes a bit iffy

00:07:55,230 --> 00:08:00,420
within this engine and we go over the

00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:02,460
result page and we go through each

00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:04,560
product and say yes I think this product

00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:07,110
is relevant or this product is

00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,610
irrelevant for certain query now

00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:11,330
discussion lists allows you to do a

00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:17,040
couple of things one of them is start

00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:19,650
with offline testing where you can run a

00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:23,040
test and compare two versions and see if

00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:26,100
your search is actually improving for

00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:27,930
instance if we go to the next slide then

00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:29,760
what you see here is our each shop that

00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:31,560
we built with luminance and on the left

00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:33,150
side you can see three product rows and

00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:37,320
on the right side you see three product

00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:39,570
works now each row is a part of a

00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,640
different engine so on the right side we

00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:44,580
improve the query by adding fuzziness

00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:46,650
and now we can use our judgments the

00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:49,560
green and row underlines on the each

00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:52,350
product which defines is this product

00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:53,940
relevant yes or no now if we compare the

00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:56,170
metrics on top then we see that on the

00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:58,600
right side precision is lower then

00:08:56,170 --> 00:09:00,550
the left side and we get more hits so we

00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,709
could actually learn that the change

00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:05,620
that we did adding fuzziness is that

00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:07,540
it's not a positive effect so we don't

00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:09,519
even have to give you any details now

00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:13,690
this makes us our release cycle a lot

00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:15,040
shorter so if we can go to the next then

00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:17,709
the lesson would be if you start with

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:20,019
this judgment list up front and maintain

00:09:17,709 --> 00:09:22,089
them and keep evolving them you can use

00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:23,410
them to do more offline testing and make

00:09:22,089 --> 00:09:29,290
sure that your changes actually are

00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:32,110
verified before you put somebody ok when

00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:33,670
I usually when I comment a new customer

00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:36,399
especially if it's the customer where I

00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:38,529
will be for a longer period of time the

00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,300
first thing I check is where is the

00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:42,300
coffee and how is the coffee because

00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:46,360
coffee is important to me

00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:48,699
Wow very very common is that you have

00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:51,100
very bad input for the coffee machine

00:09:48,699 --> 00:09:52,870
which is instant coffee and if you're

00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,910
lucky and there are being such input for

00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:57,240
the coffee then still the machine

00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:59,829
doesn't always make it and good coffee

00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:02,440
well with search it's not really

00:09:59,829 --> 00:10:04,089
different with search if you have bad

00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:06,550
content that comes into your search

00:10:04,089 --> 00:10:09,490
machine your search solution then it's

00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:13,949
very hard to also create good results to

00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:16,300
your users so if you have bad content

00:10:13,949 --> 00:10:17,740
the problem is that you use is most

00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:20,279
likely will not find what they're

00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:23,140
looking for and you have to do very

00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:25,839
advanced things in your queries and have

00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:28,510
to be very large and very and a lot of

00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:31,060
exceptions to at least make them work

00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:33,760
and give some relevant content to your

00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:36,970
users of course there is a solution to

00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:39,279
that and that is improving your content

00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:42,250
there's a number of ways that you can

00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:44,860
improve your content first is for

00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:48,279
instance adding domain knowledge so if

00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:49,959
you know the categories of your system

00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:52,690
you can recognize them in the content

00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:57,550
you can make them very explicit maybe

00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:59,649
there is a mismatch in the categories

00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:02,529
from your supplier and that you have so

00:10:59,649 --> 00:11:04,899
be very thorough in to determining that

00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:07,300
categories and add them to your content

00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:09,550
it could also be that your supplier

00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,000
delivers you items that you don't even

00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:12,970
want to

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,860
so of course you could add a flag to the

00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:16,660
item and then filter it in your clearly

00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:19,570
but it's even better not to import them

00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:21,820
at all another thing that is very good

00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:22,930
habit to do is to learn from bad

00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:25,330
performing content

00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:28,450
Biron already talked about analytics

00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:30,730
that you can use like items that were

00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:32,920
found but never clicked and items that

00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:34,570
were clicks but never bought these are

00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:36,670
indications that there is something

00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:38,860
wrong with your content it could be that

00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:41,140
there is too many search terms in the

00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:44,050
content that people try to get into be

00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:45,580
always in the result list so then it

00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:48,010
doesn't say anything about the product

00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:51,910
it's just a matching thing it could also

00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:54,040
be that it's lacking a lot of terms why

00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:56,020
and therefore it's it's not really

00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:58,480
clicked because maybe there is no

00:11:56,020 --> 00:12:00,280
picture in there or the name is very

00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,170
strange and you can learn a lot from

00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:05,650
this content as well by just looking at

00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:07,690
analytics and of course if you see these

00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:09,730
errors and these content are coming for

00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:12,460
your suppliers you can fix them yourself

00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:14,350
but it's even better to ask them to fix

00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:16,180
it because then you have less energy to

00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:19,030
put into it and they can really think

00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:20,980
about their own content and help you in

00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:25,510
getting their products better into your

00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:27,790
search engine this is an example that I

00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:31,300
have on a Dutch website so the search

00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:33,370
terms are in Dutch and why did I take a

00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:36,070
Dutch example well one because I'm Dutch

00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:38,290
but the other reason is that in the in

00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:40,990
Holland we use compound words a lot so

00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:43,930
if you look at aftershave it's not very

00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:46,000
strange to put it in as two words or to

00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:49,140
use it as one word but in this search

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,180
engine you see that they give back

00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:54,550
different results so if you write them

00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:56,680
down as two words then you get 37

00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:59,620
matching products and if you write them

00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:01,060
down as one word you have over 70 hits

00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:03,430
and there are completely different

00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:05,050
products but most likely this is not the

00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:05,530
experience that you want to give to your

00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:08,980
user

00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:11,140
so by improving the content and picking

00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:13,750
one of these two categories in your

00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:17,890
content then most likely you will get

00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:19,660
better results to your customers so the

00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:22,630
lesson in this case is that you have to

00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:24,910
be in control of your content process

00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:27,279
if you're not in control we will lose

00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:31,540
the result to your critics and in the

00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:34,149
end you will lose your customer well of

00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:37,329
course there's more to it I mean even if

00:13:34,149 --> 00:13:39,009
your content is great then still you can

00:13:37,329 --> 00:13:41,889
have an engine that doesn't work at all

00:13:39,009 --> 00:13:44,079
and these days there are a lot of

00:13:41,889 --> 00:13:46,149
engines that you can use some open

00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:48,190
source on closed source and they come

00:13:46,149 --> 00:13:49,990
with all these nice bells and whistles

00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:52,690
that you can use and they all promise

00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:56,440
you the easiest way out to get the best

00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:59,019
experience for your user but it's not

00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:01,240
always the case I have a number of

00:13:59,019 --> 00:14:04,540
customers where they were using a

00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:08,110
machine learning model to give back

00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:10,540
results to all the users and the the

00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:12,430
trend for these new solutions was that

00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:14,769
there were very strange results getting

00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:17,920
back to the users so it wasn't really a

00:14:14,769 --> 00:14:21,160
textual match but the the trend model

00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:23,170
thought that by entering a certain term

00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:25,529
that people would most likely like that

00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:27,759
thing as well I'm not saying that

00:14:25,529 --> 00:14:29,350
artificial intelligence or machine

00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:31,899
learning is wrong in the search area I

00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:34,870
think is it's getting there and it's

00:14:31,899 --> 00:14:36,730
used being used a lot these days but you

00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:38,769
have to be very careful to start out

00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:40,959
with this trade model before you

00:14:38,769 --> 00:14:44,350
understand what your search is doing and

00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:46,839
how your users are behaving so the

00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:49,050
symptom here would be that fancy options

00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:51,870
don't always improve search results and

00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:56,019
it could be that users see straight hits

00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:58,029
maybe no results at all or they see no

00:14:56,019 --> 00:15:00,519
results where they would expect them and

00:14:58,029 --> 00:15:03,550
this could all be by miss tuning your

00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:05,439
search engine so the solution to this

00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:08,410
would be that you should not trust

00:15:05,439 --> 00:15:09,939
out-of-the-box configurations so you can

00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:12,069
look at these bells and whistles of

00:15:09,939 --> 00:15:13,870
course you should look at stemming but

00:15:12,069 --> 00:15:16,319
in different languages the results of

00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:18,490
the stemming are quite different and

00:15:16,319 --> 00:15:20,939
default out-of-the-box timing could be

00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:23,380
worse than for instance using hung spell

00:15:20,939 --> 00:15:25,180
expansions and and try to AdWords

00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:27,279
yourself if you see that a lot in the

00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:30,100
analytics you also have to be careful

00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:32,139
with stop words just like I mentioned in

00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:34,209
the beginning of this presentation where

00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:36,370
Miss configuring stop words could even

00:15:34,209 --> 00:15:37,660
cause not using the

00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:40,960
specific words that you should

00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:42,700
definitely use in your query another

00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:44,890
thing to think about is using synonyms

00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:47,080
synonyms are misused a lot to make

00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:49,480
everything work that doesn't work but

00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,920
the tricky bit is that you turn out to

00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,870
have like a hundred thousands of

00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:55,120
synonyms nobody understands them anymore

00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:58,300
and nobody dares changing them because

00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:00,580
they don't know the effect and the last

00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:02,920
one I want to stress out here is the use

00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:06,220
of engrams engrams are used quite a lot

00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:08,410
as well and of course they can be handy

00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:10,900
but the tricky bit with engrams could be

00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:13,930
that you have a lot of matches again if

00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:16,060
you make them small enough that almost

00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:18,520
everything matches and it's naughty not

00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:21,220
hard to give as many matches as you need

00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:23,400
but then what is your relevance of these

00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:26,830
matches this can become a lot harder

00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:28,630
when using all the boosting options that

00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:31,570
you have in your environment or in your

00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:33,550
engine so this was one of the examples

00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:35,589
of a customer that we had where on the

00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:37,240
left side you see the old situation and

00:16:35,589 --> 00:16:39,460
on the right side you see the optimize

00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:41,860
that is now in production on the left

00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:44,170
side where we were looking for M&Ms 10%

00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:46,360
was taken out by the standard analyzer

00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:50,110
and suddenly when looking for eminence

00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:52,390
we see X apparently some customers

00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:53,980
thought it was a good idea but we know

00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:56,290
from the analytics that these eggs were

00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:57,970
actually bought sometimes but whether

00:16:56,290 --> 00:17:00,100
that's good search behavior

00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:02,050
well that's questionable on the right

00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:03,940
hand side you see that we did something

00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:05,740
different in the analyzers and now the

00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:07,959
search engine is a lot better tuned and

00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:13,870
now you actually see or M&M products in

00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:16,240
there even M&M peanut butter so the

00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:18,250
lesson here would be that of course you

00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,110
can use advanced features but you should

00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:25,449
use them to your own advantage and not

00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:27,160
just because you can all right mmm I

00:17:25,449 --> 00:17:30,100
think over the last few years the

00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:33,130
question that I received the most when

00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:35,920
consulting at a company was why is this

00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:37,510
product about this product or why is

00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:40,450
this product not there because I

00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:42,910
expected it there and it actually boils

00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:46,420
down to one of the problems that happens

00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:48,790
a lot the next slide is that it really

00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:50,200
hard to understand why certain results

00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:51,789
pop up

00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,230
that is not just for developers or

00:17:51,789 --> 00:17:55,240
people that are working directly on the

00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:56,620
system but these questions also pop up

00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,690
from other people inside the company

00:17:56,620 --> 00:18:01,120
than or actually maybe maintaining a

00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:03,309
category or that our product managers

00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,960
they will want to know why certain

00:18:03,309 --> 00:18:07,960
products are not in the spot that they

00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,399
expect them to be so not knowing how

00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,929
this comes makes it really hard to

00:18:09,399 --> 00:18:12,730
explain these management results and

00:18:10,929 --> 00:18:15,190
also there's no really easy way of

00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:16,779
checking in which order products are or

00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:20,320
how they come that that order has been

00:18:16,779 --> 00:18:23,080
made up so what we like to do actually

00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:26,470
almost on every project that we go to is

00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:28,320
to use or create the right tooling in

00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:30,429
order to help us get this information

00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,110
now maybe some of you has been to the

00:18:30,429 --> 00:18:35,110
workshop yesterday from Eric Johannes

00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:38,799
bar Rene about towards an open to source

00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:40,090
set for e-commerce the tools prescribed

00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:42,840
there is something that we could also

00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:45,760
use but mostly we check with clients

00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:47,769
what their purpose removed is so it

00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,600
could be that they that we could use the

00:18:47,769 --> 00:18:50,980
open-source tooling but sometimes it's

00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:54,340
not possible and then we will create our

00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:56,610
own tooling around it and what it allows

00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:58,809
you to do is to really dig into your

00:18:56,610 --> 00:19:01,389
essentials of how your search engine is

00:18:58,809 --> 00:19:04,240
working and help figure out why certain

00:19:01,389 --> 00:19:05,860
things work as they work the most

00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,539
important part is that if you create

00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:09,429
these insights you can start sharing

00:19:07,539 --> 00:19:11,289
them with non-technical people as well

00:19:09,429 --> 00:19:13,840
meaning that they won't have to come to

00:19:11,289 --> 00:19:15,820
you every time to ask why am I not

00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:19,720
seeing my product or why is this product

00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:21,549
here at all one of the steps you could

00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:24,190
take after that is after opening that up

00:19:21,549 --> 00:19:26,110
is create these kind of screens which

00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:28,149
gives this explanation and maybe even

00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:30,549
give control to the non-technical people

00:19:28,149 --> 00:19:31,960
to influence these kind of things so for

00:19:30,549 --> 00:19:34,389
instance here on the left side you see a

00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:35,830
breakdown of the first three products

00:19:34,389 --> 00:19:38,440
that are returned for the search of the

00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:40,630
coffee table and the blue bars actually

00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:42,460
explain why the match or why the ranking

00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:44,919
is what it is

00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:47,590
so which terms have matched if it was

00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:50,409
match because of a synonym and so on and

00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:53,710
so on and on the right side we see what

00:19:50,409 --> 00:19:55,510
happens to our search term when we when

00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:57,850
we analyze it so how does our analysis

00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:59,740
chain work this will really help to

00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:02,289
figure out okay if I search this term

00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:03,640
why is it matched is it match because of

00:20:02,289 --> 00:20:05,950
the synonym

00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:07,570
or is it because for instance on the

00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:09,730
left side of the analysis chain you see

00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:12,940
at the end that we have combined the

00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:14,350
coffee table word into one term because

00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:18,220
we have a lot of these compound issues

00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:21,070
that yet already shared before so I

00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:23,290
think the key takeaway from this is that

00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:25,120
you should open up search as fast as

00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:26,620
possible to non-technical people because

00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,480
it really helps create that mutual

00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:30,610
understanding of how the engine works

00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:34,180
and it really helps other people to come

00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:40,240
up with ideas to even improve and make

00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:41,860
the whole solution better alright I'm

00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,900
not sure if some of most of you who

00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:45,250
maybe notice image this was an image

00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:47,020
from two weeks ago

00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:50,170
the historic launch the crew dragon

00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:52,720
missile that delivered our astronauts to

00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:54,160
the ISS two weeks ago and you might be

00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:57,490
wondering what does this have to do with

00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:58,840
search but we actually use missiles as

00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:01,030
an analogy when we're talking about

00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:03,820
search because the problem we're seeing

00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:07,210
a lot is that a lot of people try to

00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:11,260
build their engine with one big query so

00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:12,280
if you have that next slide so a lot of

00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:14,680
people that started out with search

00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:16,750
tried to do everything in one query they

00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:18,880
want to do full matching they want to

00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:21,630
have partial matching they add some

00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:24,070
fuzziness in case someone makes a typo

00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:25,720
but the downside of these approaches is

00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:28,420
that you for instance for the fuzzy part

00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:31,480
also get really irrelevant products back

00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:33,730
in your normal search so coming back to

00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:37,330
the spacecraft we like to break this up

00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:39,730
by doing multiple step queries and now

00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:41,740
you don't always have the ability to do

00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:43,420
this because maybe you have search it

00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:45,100
comes with a solution that you are using

00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:49,120
which means that you don't have any

00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:50,920
personal control for it so that could be

00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,720
a hard thing to start with

00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:55,000
another thing about this big query that

00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,470
it's really hard to tune especially when

00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,120
it comes to ranking because you have so

00:21:56,470 --> 00:22:00,730
many tiny components that actually

00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:02,440
handle how search is working and of

00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:04,330
course it's really hard later to add

00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:07,360
stuff on top of that if it's already one

00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:10,240
really big monster so what we generally

00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:12,310
recommend if possible create a wrapper

00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,410
search service around your search engine

00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:16,420
which allows you to intercept and adjust

00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:17,500
search terms before executing them you

00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:21,180
can add your own own

00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:24,220
giganto extract entities in categories

00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:25,900
start a name a be test and the logging

00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:27,460
of your search and responses so you can

00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:31,330
use it later on to see how people are

00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:34,210
actually using your system so for

00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:36,790
instance as an example

00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:38,200
this site is something we use for

00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:40,180
looking up images for for our

00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:42,220
presentation and we notice actually that

00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:44,620
we made a typo while while searching for

00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:46,570
some some images and you see that there

00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:49,990
are no results now no one is really

00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:52,390
helped by an empty result page but you

00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:53,950
could say what some but this company

00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:55,930
could have done is actually take this

00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:57,190
multi-step approach and say okay first

00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:59,740
we're gonna try and match everything

00:22:57,190 --> 00:23:01,840
there is like they do now but in case

00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:03,790
there are zero results fall back to

00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:07,990
either partial matching or fuzzy

00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:09,820
matching or swapping an operator which

00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:11,350
would still get results I would still

00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:12,670
allow the customer to actually find

00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:17,980
maybe the product that they were looking

00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:19,480
for so lesson would be is to use

00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:21,310
multiple queries through a service

00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:24,040
record because it allows you to have

00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:25,810
this fine-grained ability to have more

00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:29,040
control over what you're executing and

00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:29,040
what you were returning to the user

00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:37,270
alright so I think in any case it would

00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:38,920
be the most ideal shopping experience

00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:41,350
you could have you don't have to leave

00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:43,060
your house you turn on TV you talk to

00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:45,880
someone you say I want to have a pair of

00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:47,950
pants now asking for a pair of pants is

00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:49,990
pretty generic and freaking rods could

00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:52,750
be any pen so the person across from you

00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:55,750
would ask what kind of pens for what

00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:57,340
occasion you start a conversation and I

00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:59,050
think that is something we're not doing

00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:01,240
enough with inserts right now and it's

00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:02,980
really something we should strive for to

00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:04,420
create this online experience as if

00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:05,890
you're having a conversation with

00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:08,500
someone in a store that's helping you

00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:12,130
out to find your the product you're

00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:14,470
looking for so we just talked about

00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:16,300
creating the survey right before doing a

00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:18,070
lot of backend stuff which is more in

00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:19,480
the background but now we have to think

00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:21,760
about the front end about the user

00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,960
experience and we see a lot that a lot

00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,510
of companies are not really helping

00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:27,820
their users in trying to formulate their

00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:30,010
query so what are you exactly looking

00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:31,110
for in the case of pans if I search for

00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:34,440
pens

00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:36,929
then there is no no one asking me what

00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:39,030
occasion we need it for where do you

00:24:36,929 --> 00:24:41,429
wanna what kind of color do you want

00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:43,040
mostly it's up to the user to go and

00:24:41,429 --> 00:24:45,210
find the products they're looking for

00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:47,580
but they could be that customers don't

00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:49,320
find the products so they keep trying

00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:50,700
they keep endlessly browsing for their

00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:53,910
products and in the end they don't find

00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:55,230
it and leave so what you want to do is

00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:58,200
you want to start as early as possible

00:24:55,230 --> 00:25:04,500
by thinking of ways to help your user

00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:06,720
formulate their query so the solution

00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:08,790
would be to find new ways and first step

00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:11,280
would be offer filters like search is

00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:12,750
more than a search bar if you give uses

00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:15,630
filters they know how they work we can

00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:17,190
actually drop down and find more

00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:19,110
fine-grain narrow down what they're

00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:21,630
looking for but the next thing will be

00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:24,299
start a conversation dare to ask people

00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:26,190
in a way that fits within your user

00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:27,960
experience to help them narrow down the

00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:29,760
request and even think about other

00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:32,460
interventions because right now the

00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:34,710
world more and more people are doing

00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:36,179
online searches and e-commerce is

00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:38,730
getting bigger especially in these times

00:25:36,179 --> 00:25:41,850
so find a way to engage with your user

00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:44,220
and one example of that is a company in

00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:47,820
the Netherlands that for instance on the

00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:49,799
left side if you search for LG OLED it

00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:51,929
already shows you product it gives you

00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:54,390
product recommendations give suggestions

00:25:51,929 --> 00:25:56,760
on the search term but at the bottom it

00:25:54,390 --> 00:26:00,299
actually says compare this TV with this

00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:02,010
TV so it already knows that these are

00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:03,570
the most common TVs that people are

00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:06,320
thinking about and already giving an

00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:09,390
option to fulfill my information need of

00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:12,150
which one should I choose and on the

00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:14,429
right side we see for instance a pop-up

00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:15,840
modal that got opened when you click on

00:26:14,429 --> 00:26:18,120
the information button next to look

00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:20,130
facet and what this does it explains

00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:22,820
what the facet is what options it gives

00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:26,190
and it helps you narrow down your

00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:28,919
searches for instance it's a screen

00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:30,600
diagonal which diagonal is good for your

00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:31,890
house so these are questions you will

00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,330
get answered when you're in the store

00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:35,220
and I think it's something you should

00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:40,050
really try for to doing that as well in

00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:42,179
your online experience so guide a would

00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:44,280
be lesson a would be guide to your users

00:26:42,179 --> 00:26:44,850
to what they are looking for either by

00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,440
the convent

00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:53,130
methods or think about new ways to

00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:54,779
interact with users it's apparent Biden

00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:56,929
was already talking about shopping

00:26:54,779 --> 00:27:00,090
experience and it happens to be that

00:26:56,929 --> 00:27:03,299
well during my study I was working in a

00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:05,580
record store and well of course we

00:27:03,299 --> 00:27:07,440
luckily had customers back then and they

00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:09,149
would come to the counter and start

00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,490
asking questions well these questions

00:27:09,149 --> 00:27:15,690
could be very diverse it could be like

00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:18,570
give me a city that has is a rock or it

00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:22,529
could be a city in which they said well

00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:24,120
give me City from the Beatles if it if

00:27:22,529 --> 00:27:27,240
it's like one of these two then you

00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:29,100
think okay oh I'm not that old that the

00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:31,529
Beatles had only one CD so there were

00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:33,570
multiple so what would they actually be

00:27:31,529 --> 00:27:35,399
looking for so then I would generally

00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:37,009
walk with them walk to the place where

00:27:35,399 --> 00:27:39,870
the cities of all the Beatles are and

00:27:37,009 --> 00:27:41,519
just just show them and ask if they can

00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:43,559
find what they what they're looking for

00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:46,049
if they have additional information if

00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:47,879
they need other answers but it's a quite

00:27:46,049 --> 00:27:50,909
different experience from someone that

00:27:47,879 --> 00:27:54,000
comes in tells me I want to have the

00:27:50,909 --> 00:27:55,830
city of YouTube or at Oldham but then I

00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,289
know exactly what he wants I can just

00:27:55,830 --> 00:28:01,070
pick it and he pays for it and it says

00:27:58,289 --> 00:28:03,929
and he's gone so these are two quite

00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:06,779
different experiences were in the first

00:28:03,929 --> 00:28:09,570
experience someone is actually getting

00:28:06,779 --> 00:28:11,279
inspired he wants to learn more about

00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:13,049
what he needs lots of give a little bit

00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:15,480
more information maybe he doesn't really

00:28:13,049 --> 00:28:18,120
know what but we can help him and in the

00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:19,860
other scenario he just nobody wants and

00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:24,149
you want to buy it and he wants to be

00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:26,399
gone the center in a lot of e-commerce

00:28:24,149 --> 00:28:29,429
websites and other websites is that all

00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:31,440
searches are treated the same so it

00:28:29,429 --> 00:28:34,379
doesn't really matter if you're doing a

00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:38,129
very broad term or if you going for a

00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:39,870
very specific kind of query and of

00:28:38,129 --> 00:28:42,570
course there is a solution to that as

00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:45,570
well but first we need to recognize

00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:49,110
whether as a query is actually a browse

00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:52,200
or abroad query or a very specific

00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:53,940
theory one way to do that is to compare

00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:57,120
the clearly for instance to a category

00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:58,300
tree because we see that if people type

00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,340
in very broad term

00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:03,310
that they usually resemble one of the

00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:04,990
categories that we sell it could be that

00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:07,000
it's one of the main categories it has a

00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:10,630
lot of subcategories and then we can try

00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:12,490
to ask the user if he might be searching

00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:15,490
for one of these subcategories and then

00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:19,140
pointed to well for more specifically

00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:22,210
shows another way is to just gather

00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:24,370
information about all the results that

00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:26,710
you get check the categories that all

00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:29,920
these products or or our items are in

00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:31,990
and then calculate some entropy value if

00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:34,330
this entropy is constant among a lot of

00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:36,400
categories then is most likely a broad

00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:38,680
search that they're doing but you don't

00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:40,990
know really in what category the product

00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:43,000
is then most likely it's a broad search

00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:44,890
and then you can present again a

00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,740
different experience where the user is

00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:49,120
just challenged in giving more

00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:52,060
information about what he's actually

00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:54,000
looking for if the enthalpy value is

00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:57,040
very high in just one or two categories

00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,080
then the chances are big that it's much

00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:01,900
more as Pacific search and then you can

00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:04,720
just dive into those categories and and

00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:08,140
present with very specific results to

00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:10,030
the user so the trick here is that you

00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:12,490
need to have more context from the users

00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:14,680
so you could show them obvious

00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:17,830
categories that that night matches is

00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:20,650
creating but we also saw in the

00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:22,780
cool-blue case that if you start typing

00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:24,940
that we could already say like maybe

00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:27,010
you're searching for this term in this

00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:29,130
category then users don't even have to

00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:31,600
go to the search and then they already

00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:33,040
immediately in their interface can tell

00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:36,130
you what they're actually looking for

00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:40,230
and a final solution that I want to

00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:44,290
point out is to diversify results and

00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:46,750
the trick here is that if you know that

00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:50,020
search returns multiple categories that

00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:52,150
you that you implicitly show the top

00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:54,460
result from each category so we don't

00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:56,920
really focus on one or just the foot

00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:59,520
ratio because it's hard to think about

00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:02,590
top results if the terms are very broad

00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:04,390
an example that I wanted to show is from

00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:06,760
the Nike workshop where you search for

00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:09,790
shoes this is what you get presented

00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:12,090
it's mostly soccer shoes but you're not

00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:13,650
really inspired to give more info

00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:16,410
that you're actually looking for a

00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:17,910
completely different kind of shoe of

00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:19,950
course there are filters on the left

00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:22,770
side but that you have to have to look

00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:25,500
at it yourself and it would be easier to

00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:27,210
just have some form of styles here where

00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:30,870
you could get more specific information

00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:37,920
and help and guide the user to a

00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:40,410
different experience so this lesson is

00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:41,610
that you have to give browser searches a

00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:44,700
good experience

00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:47,040
don't try to treat them as one because

00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:48,420
they are different and and most likely

00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:51,210
they are looking for a different

00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:53,160
experience and it's not not that hard to

00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:55,070
accomplish this if you know what you're

00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:58,850
doing

00:31:55,070 --> 00:32:02,730
so we're already at the final lesson and

00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:05,190
in this lesson I want to point out that

00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:07,470
we discussed quite some lessons that

00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:10,230
were not technical when we talked about

00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:12,960
the business we talked about the content

00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:14,970
we talked about analytics we talked

00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:18,570
about user experience and we talked

00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:21,900
about technology this is intentional I

00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:24,240
mean the reason is that it's very very

00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:27,620
important that you get these disciplines

00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:30,450
in make them work together as one team

00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:32,160
but if they work as a team then the

00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:33,990
chances are the biggest that you will

00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:37,140
get the experience that you're looking

00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:39,390
for with the right performance with

00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:42,110
impact on the business so that in the

00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:45,450
end you will have a prosperous company

00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:47,220
the tintin is that search is treated as

00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:49,920
a technical problem that you just fix

00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:51,840
once I mean with the customer that I

00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:54,630
talked about before he couldn't really

00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:57,180
understand that it wasn't only the

00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:59,460
search engine that needed an upgrade I

00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:01,470
mean it was the whole process it was

00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:04,740
that they needed to think about

00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:06,660
analytics and whole organization needs

00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:09,270
to understand the importance of search

00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:11,250
for sales for instance and maybe it's

00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:13,170
not important at all and then if you

00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:15,420
learn from the analytics then maybe you

00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:18,840
shouldn't have search at all which could

00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:20,700
also be a solution but often the tech

00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:22,530
guys get to say everything in this case

00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:25,570
they are just being told to give me a

00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:28,330
search they implement a search and

00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:30,640
then they leave it like that and if they

00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:31,930
have some time less maybe their credit

00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,330
but that's about it

00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:35,980
usually the users will leave because

00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:39,130
they experience the smoke water looking

00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:42,760
for the solution in this case would be

00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:45,460
to create a team make the business

00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:48,100
involved by together forming KPIs

00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:49,750
reporting about these KPIs and be honest

00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:53,110
that if you have this nice cool feature

00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:55,030
and you test it and it shows up to be

00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:57,430
less working

00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:59,320
worse than it was before then just throw

00:33:57,430 --> 00:34:01,840
it away again and try something else and

00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:04,120
it's very important to include the user

00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:06,310
experience guys in this part as well

00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:08,320
because you want to be sure users and

00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:10,390
without a good user experience you can

00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:12,280
show the results that you that you can

00:34:10,390 --> 00:34:14,650
but there will still be me because I

00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:16,030
don't like the experience at all and you

00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:18,370
have to monitor the analytics to

00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:21,010
understand your users without

00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:23,200
understanding your users then yeah you

00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:25,630
can still try to create the best engine

00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:28,780
that you think but still it nobody likes

00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:30,850
it then you still have the problem the

00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:33,220
final bit here is that you need to keep

00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:35,680
improving search by learning from your

00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:38,410
users and you have to keep improving so

00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:40,090
it's not one a one-time fix it's

00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:44,050
something that you have to do and keep

00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:46,750
on doing but the lesson here would be to

00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:52,030
create a dedicated multidisciplinary

00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:54,370
team to solve your search challenge so

00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:59,500
we have about three minutes left I think

00:34:54,370 --> 00:35:00,880
pirates or rip it up alright so this is

00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:03,280
the overview of the ten lessons that we

00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,990
just gave if you would have asked me 10

00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,760
years ago and this would be the list

00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:09,160
that I would come up here with ten years

00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:10,750
later I would've thought you were weird

00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:13,630
because I would have thought it was

00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:14,890
purely mainly technical list but over

00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:16,420
the years you start to really learn that

00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:19,990
that yeah it's a multidisciplinary

00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:22,030
effort that you need to take so I really

00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:25,480
wonder how this list will look like in

00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:28,440
ten years from now so yeah thank you

00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:28,440
and do you have any questions

00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:40,890
back to you Charlie I fantastic thank

00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:42,510
you so much for your talk guys I must

00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:43,980
admit my neck is aching somewhat because

00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:48,540
I was nodding so much all the way

00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:50,940
through a mind any of those any of your

00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:56,010
ten questions so yes we do have some

00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:57,900
questions from the slack we'll actually

00:35:56,010 --> 00:36:01,080
a point here I mean I'm gonna start here

00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:02,610
with Dominic's point who found that it

00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:04,470
could be dangerous to turn to many zero

00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:07,650
results queries into fuzzy or relaxed

00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:09,480
queries perhaps you've got something to

00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:13,770
say about you know the sweet spot for

00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:16,050
this kind of query relaxation yeah I

00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:18,480
think I can answer that I think it

00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:20,880
really depends which is the most common

00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,470
answer to everything of course I think

00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,940
it really depends on your use case I

00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:25,410
think I saw in the comment that it said

00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:26,850
like you don't want to give the you

00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:28,290
users the impression that you always

00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:31,860
have an answer to everything and I

00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:33,960
really feel that so I'm not a big fan of

00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:37,020
fuzzy queries but I think you can try

00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:39,480
and fix the most fuzziest term fix that

00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:41,340
one specific and instead of opening up

00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:43,260
Pandora's box by saying okay we're gonna

00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:45,630
look through everything buzzing so

00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:47,130
there's also in there like a multi-step

00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:49,440
approach you could do by not just

00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:51,390
turning on fuzzy as a whole but for

00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:55,230
certain cases try and fix that fuzziness

00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:56,820
on a small level first so yeah that

00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:59,310
answers the question yeah this could

00:36:56,820 --> 00:37:02,610
also well be that you just make your 404

00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:04,020
page a bit richer by explaining to them

00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:05,790
that you don't understand what they're

00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:09,690
looking for but just give them options

00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:11,460
to to an amount a query or do something

00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:14,280
else maybe give them some like top

00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:16,170
searches or most most both items or

00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:18,830
whatever but it's and it's something

00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:22,170
that you can test using analytics

00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:26,700
fantastic thank you so our next question

00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:28,740
Ivy rapper who is a report asks online

00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:31,080
reference interviews I didn't spot that

00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:32,760
in your talk but she says they had been

00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:35,660
tried unsuccessfully for decades but

00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,660
maybe with an agent

00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:44,980
I'm not sure I quite understand the

00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:46,930
question have you got may-maybe I'm not

00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:49,779
sure I mean if you're looking into the

00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:54,039
direction of evaluating search

00:37:49,779 --> 00:37:55,809
interfaces with with tools maybe looking

00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:57,609
at people using your product of course

00:37:55,809 --> 00:37:58,809
those kind of things I'm not sure if

00:37:57,609 --> 00:38:01,630
that's the way but yeah definitely

00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:03,609
that's being used as well but it's more

00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:06,009
for the user experience I think I think

00:38:03,609 --> 00:38:08,440
it's less used for the relevance okay

00:38:06,009 --> 00:38:11,529
okay let's move on

00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:13,359
Zeenat asks wouldn't using the entropy

00:38:11,529 --> 00:38:16,180
of results to recognize a broad query

00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:17,890
tell that your results are chaotic rot

00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:21,569
in the query intent being broad how

00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:21,569
reliable would this be as a metric

00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:26,920
that's an interesting way I was I was as

00:38:25,269 --> 00:38:34,119
the to say buyer you can have this one

00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:36,220
but yeah could I say four oh four I

00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:38,170
don't really have an answer to this one

00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:40,359
I think but I agree

00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:41,230
I mean it's of course it's tricky I

00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:45,489
think

00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:47,769
again you have to be careful but I also

00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:49,989
think that you have to be a bit sure

00:38:47,769 --> 00:38:51,970
when when you're doing a user experience

00:38:49,989 --> 00:38:54,940
where you're directing people to a

00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:57,309
certain area that you have to be quite

00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:59,170
sure about it and if you're in if you're

00:38:57,309 --> 00:39:01,359
in doubts then just give them the

00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:04,059
results they figure it out themselves or

00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:06,249
maybe do both maybe just show them the

00:39:04,059 --> 00:39:09,099
results would also give them ways to to

00:39:06,249 --> 00:39:11,200
fine-tune their query but I agree it

00:39:09,099 --> 00:39:16,569
could be it could be tricky to do that

00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:17,980
yeah and he actually asks Randi web asks

00:39:16,569 --> 00:39:22,779
how do you actually calculate this

00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:26,650
category entry well the easy way is is

00:39:22,779 --> 00:39:30,509
by just counting them and and doing sort

00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:33,489
of an average so if you have on average

00:39:30,509 --> 00:39:34,839
you have a category with for instance a

00:39:33,489 --> 00:39:37,569
thousand products and you have a

00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:39,670
category with a hundred products then at

00:39:37,569 --> 00:39:42,160
the moment that you get back results and

00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:43,900
there are ten from the thousand and one

00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:48,009
from the hundreds then they're kind of

00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:49,299
similar so it's in relation to the

00:39:48,009 --> 00:39:51,099
amount of products that you have in the

00:39:49,299 --> 00:39:54,239
category you just check the amount

00:39:51,099 --> 00:39:57,640
products that come out of that category

00:39:54,239 --> 00:40:01,479
yeah and then you compare the numbers

00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:04,450
yeah that's the easy way okay

00:40:01,479 --> 00:40:06,460
and our last question from Carlos how

00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:08,200
much do you think that phonetics can

00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:10,869
help solve zero results somebody can

00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:14,640
solve search issues where you can't

00:40:10,869 --> 00:40:16,809
spell but can help with zero results

00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:18,400
yeah I think sometimes it could help

00:40:16,809 --> 00:40:20,140
because it allows you to find typos that

00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:22,509
you wouldn't have found if you're not

00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:25,269
using fuzzy so I think it gives another

00:40:22,509 --> 00:40:27,849
way but matching with some cases where

00:40:25,269 --> 00:40:30,819
it actually works well but I've done

00:40:27,849 --> 00:40:33,369
some research on that in the past and on

00:40:30,819 --> 00:40:35,019
some big ecommerce clients and I think

00:40:33,369 --> 00:40:36,910
the downside of e-commerce is that you

00:40:35,019 --> 00:40:38,499
only search with one term or two terms

00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:39,940
at max three unless you're really

00:40:38,499 --> 00:40:42,279
specific into what you're looking for

00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:43,869
and it could happen that if you have

00:40:42,279 --> 00:40:45,700
mixed language contents that the

00:40:43,869 --> 00:40:47,470
phonetics is like you really need to set

00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:49,739
it up well and it's not a guarantee of

00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:52,299
fixing these these zero results or

00:40:49,739 --> 00:40:53,529
improving rankings so I think it can be

00:40:52,299 --> 00:40:56,499
hard I think there was a talk yesterday

00:40:53,529 --> 00:40:58,019
that that shed more light on better

00:40:56,499 --> 00:41:00,999
experiences that you could do without

00:40:58,019 --> 00:41:04,319
phonetic so I've never seen the real use

00:41:00,999 --> 00:41:06,880
case phonetic and e-commerce just yet

00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:10,869
thank you and I'm gonna squeeze one more

00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:13,150
question in from th Ito what search

00:41:10,869 --> 00:41:14,920
analytics metrics or kpi's do you prefer

00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:19,299
to assess search engine quality and app

00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:21,219
ongoing basis yeah I think I think a few

00:41:19,299 --> 00:41:25,299
of them we mentioned the zero results of

00:41:21,219 --> 00:41:27,880
course but that they're just I liked the

00:41:25,299 --> 00:41:29,229
one with the zero conversion because the

00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,880
zero conversion is of course in

00:41:29,229 --> 00:41:32,499
e-commerce land is it's always about

00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,719
conversion everything is about

00:41:32,499 --> 00:41:36,279
conversion and but what makes it

00:41:34,719 --> 00:41:38,619
interesting is that we actually found

00:41:36,279 --> 00:41:41,170
some queries that were just giving

00:41:38,619 --> 00:41:44,140
around like 10 15 20 sometimes even

00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:46,479
100th results that were just because we

00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:48,969
didn't understand that there was like a

00:41:46,479 --> 00:41:51,279
metadata in there somewhere that just by

00:41:48,969 --> 00:41:52,749
coincidence resembles the query but it

00:41:51,279 --> 00:41:54,999
doesn't have anything to do with it and

00:41:52,749 --> 00:41:57,819
then we didn't find them with the zero

00:41:54,999 --> 00:42:01,539
results but using the zero conversion we

00:41:57,819 --> 00:42:03,099
did find them yeah especially if you

00:42:01,539 --> 00:42:04,930
just start creating your matching and

00:42:03,099 --> 00:42:06,400
you start to evaluate a new

00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:08,290
version of your engine the zero

00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,880
conversion really finds that blind spots

00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:11,950
that you forgot while setting up you're

00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:16,089
setting up your engine so it's a really

00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:17,559
nice one to look at fantastic we've got

00:42:16,089 --> 00:42:18,700
another couple of questions I'm afraid

00:42:17,559 --> 00:42:20,589
I'm gonna have to refer you to the

00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:21,940
breakout room which will be running

00:42:20,589 --> 00:42:24,030
after thought because we have another

00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:27,550
talk coming up soon for America lesson

00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:30,309
so I'd like to thank yet Roe and Byron

00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:32,190
for your fascinating and talk again very

00:42:30,309 --> 00:42:33,819
much agree with everything you said

00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:36,220
that's a good thing

00:42:33,819 --> 00:42:37,960
and thanks again chaps and I'm sure the

00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:39,400
guys will be around the rest of the day
