Imagine a shopper searches for "coffee". The search results mindlessly repeat brand name, ground coffee over and over. Technically relevant. But not very useful. Not mixed in are results appealing to a different kind of "coffee" searcher:  organic coffee, whole bean, espresso, or related coffee equipment. 

Beyond relevant results is Result Set Diversity: providing not just technically correct answers, but a diverse (though still relevant) view of what's possible in the search system. Showing our grocery searcher that we might, after all, have something they want.

In this panel, we'll discuss Result Set Diversity in search. We'll hear from teams working to summarize for users the diverse array of options available to them given their query. An ideal search experience helps provide next steps, broaden the user's understanding of the content related to keywords, and cover the user's possible, unspoken intent.

Join host Doug Turnbull and search practitioners, Andreas Wagner, Felipe Besson, and Lev Gershenzon, as we hear experiences measuring & solving Results Diversity, with a panel discussion on the Result Search Diversity problem.

	00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:13,340
today we're going to be talking about

00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:16,670
search results diversity which is a

00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:19,340
topic near and dear to my heart we have

00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:21,140
three talks that are gonna cover this

00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:24,260
from a couple different angles for about

00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:27,050
25 or 30 minutes then I'm going to lead

00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:31,429
a discussion on this for the most part

00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:34,130
we sort of I'm gonna pitch the questions

00:00:31,429 --> 00:00:35,510
to the panel but if you do have some

00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:39,010
additional questions feel free to put

00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:42,739
those in the haystack TV select channel

00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:44,270
just really quickly so this this topic I

00:00:42,739 --> 00:00:45,920
think is really interesting and I'm just

00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:49,160
gonna I'll talk about it for a little

00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:51,250
bit so I've been interested in of course

00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:53,840
search relevance for a long time and

00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:55,699
having written relevant search and and

00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,070
been part of open source connections

00:00:55,699 --> 00:00:59,510
it's been a big passion of mine to try

00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:01,940
to figure out ways that we can help

00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:03,649
users deliver sort of more accurate

00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:07,400
results that answer and support their

00:01:03,649 --> 00:01:09,440
information need I feel like maybe at

00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:13,460
the beginning of the 2010s a lot of

00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:15,140
people were putting together maybe a

00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:17,330
solar application or elasticsearch

00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:18,950
application they'd ship it and only

00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:21,619
realize after they've shipped it that

00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:23,570
hey these search results are no good and

00:01:21,619 --> 00:01:26,180
I think the awareness of that has really

00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:30,409
increased over the last decade which has

00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:32,329
been really exciting and as as we

00:01:30,409 --> 00:01:34,240
continue to evolve and it sort of

00:01:32,329 --> 00:01:36,770
improve our practice of search relevance

00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:39,920
another problem or another challenge

00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:41,950
that you might argue counterbalances the

00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:46,250
search relevance or maybe it doesn't

00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:48,200
starts to creep in for me personally I

00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:51,439
started to see this search result

00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:54,219
diversity problem when in some of our

00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:56,719
earlier learning to rank projects we

00:01:54,219 --> 00:02:00,680
started doing learning to rank with

00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:03,320
elasticsearch in 2016 and one of our

00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:06,229
first clients for for doing this was a

00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:08,780
job search company and what was really

00:02:06,229 --> 00:02:10,340
interesting about that experience is for

00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:12,260
some of the queries we started do a

00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:14,060
stream like the results were arguably

00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:17,210
extremely relevant like we couldn't

00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:20,270
really make them any more close to what

00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:21,319
the user seemed to need by their query

00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:25,069
that

00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:26,409
and then then that then we couldn't

00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:29,959
improve that anymore

00:02:26,409 --> 00:02:33,319
but what we started to notice was when

00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:35,659
we look across the queries there's so

00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:38,209
much duplication and so many things are

00:02:35,659 --> 00:02:41,090
really extremely similar so if you

00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:44,510
search for something like a cook job all

00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:47,510
you would get were the same ten Chipola

00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:49,280
jobs in the top 10 search results when

00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:52,549
really if you're searching for a cook

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,980
maybe you want to understand your entire

00:02:52,549 --> 00:02:59,239
options and what the menu so to speak of

00:02:54,980 --> 00:03:01,069
this of this query might be and this

00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:03,319
this is a fairly interesting and

00:03:01,069 --> 00:03:05,269
challenging problems because a lot of

00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:07,189
our search engines as we'll see are like

00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:09,349
solar elasticsearch they're pretty

00:03:07,189 --> 00:03:11,079
heavily biased towards okay can you get

00:03:09,349 --> 00:03:15,319
the ranking and scoring function right

00:03:11,079 --> 00:03:17,389
the question of can you give people a

00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:21,199
broad set of results that are also

00:03:17,389 --> 00:03:24,769
relevant but kind of draw a wide enough

00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:26,659
net to show them a top many maybe many

00:03:24,769 --> 00:03:28,370
different senses of the query or many

00:03:26,659 --> 00:03:31,099
different possible directions the user

00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:32,840
might go that's still not really

00:03:31,099 --> 00:03:35,780
something baked into our search engines

00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:38,180
right now so I think this is a pretty

00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:40,040
challenging topic but I think

00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:42,259
increasingly a lot of teams are seeing

00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:44,329
that it's not just enough to get the

00:03:42,259 --> 00:03:47,090
right results but it's important to give

00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:49,729
people all the right possible options

00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:53,419
and interpretations of their intention

00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:56,229
as people enter in search keywords so

00:03:53,419 --> 00:04:00,290
with that sort of framing of the problem

00:03:56,229 --> 00:04:04,159
I'm going to introduce our speakers one

00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:08,959
at a time and let them kick off cook off

00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:15,919
their talks so first up we have we have

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:18,919
Lev and Lev is let Gerson's on for over

00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:20,419
15 years Lev has been working on it as a

00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:21,620
team leader private owner of various

00:04:20,419 --> 00:04:24,020
projects in the field of natural

00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:26,000
language processing and search he was

00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:27,979
the head of news aggregation of the news

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,380
aggregation service and vertical search

00:04:27,979 --> 00:04:33,110
and Yandex and after leaving the company

00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:34,910
six years ago founded detective a SAS

00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:36,140
provider of search recommendations and

00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:38,720
vacation solutions for e-commerce

00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:41,140
companies live holds a master's degree

00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,730
in theoretical and applied linguistics

00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:45,320
four of the Russian University for

00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:51,040
Humanities Moscow

00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:51,040
so leva is going to talk to us about

00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:55,970
where is your talk title it's going to

00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:59,800
talk about how to deal define measure

00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:59,800
and maintain search diversity e-commerce

00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,160
