Description: 
	Ever wonder how Watson beat all comers in Jeopardy or how Siri or Google Now work?  Thinking about deploying Question Answering (QA) technology in your application? QA and NLP technology have finally hit the mainstream and are making information access easier and more personalized every day. 

The best part? Open source technologies make it easier than ever to build and deploy question answering technology.  In this talk, we'll lay the foundation of building a next generation QA system using open source like Apache Solr and various open source NLP libraries as well as demonstrate a working system able to answer real natural language questions.

great thanks Thomas she said my name is

00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:13,389
granting us all I'm the CTO and

00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:14,100
co-founder of lucid works we're

00:00:13,389 --> 00:00:16,830
primarily a guy

00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:20,810
you build we've seen a solar and build

00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:23,910
stuff on top of that a little bit of a

00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:27,600
advertisement first and awesome

00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:31,640
everything crashed so I'll just stick to

00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:35,309
hear let me bring keynote back up and

00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:37,800
hopefully we'll be good they were just

00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:46,290
warning me that uh there was issues with

00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:48,589
keynotes so hopefully this will work

00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:55,170
otherwise I'll have to export to PDF

00:00:48,589 --> 00:00:57,449
real quick so a little bit of quick

00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:59,670
advertisement if you like we've seen and

00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:02,580
solar and you want to go to austin texas

00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:04,470
which is a great little town in Texas

00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:07,290
we're doing leucine solar revolution

00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:10,020
this year in October it's a great time

00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,240
to come visit the US and visit texas so

00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,040
with that let's get into you've got

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,110
questions we've got answers how many

00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:20,700
people here are working on actual

00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:23,100
question answering systems one person

00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,869
all right you get to leave because this

00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:27,329
is all more beginner level all right

00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:28,740
we're going to introduce what is

00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:31,229
question answering we're going to take a

00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:33,570
look at some working examples and we're

00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:35,909
going to talk about some of the details

00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:38,369
that go into building a question

00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:40,380
answering system and I'm going to put

00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:41,789
some caveats along the way and so at the

00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:44,909
end of the day what I'm going to say is

00:01:41,789 --> 00:01:46,740
mostly true all right it's up to you

00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:48,990
then to figure out what works for you

00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:50,460
and your real system but I think what

00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:52,259
you'll find is that if you go and look

00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,939
at what I'm talking about you compare it

00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:56,189
to the state of the art there's going to

00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:58,649
be some gap there but the concepts and

00:01:56,189 --> 00:02:00,539
the ideas are about right and then you

00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:04,590
can take and decide how much effort you

00:02:00,539 --> 00:02:07,170
want to put in to other things so with

00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:11,100
that how many people saw Watson play

00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:13,080
jeopardy okay so you guys are at least

00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:14,790
familiar with a lot question answering

00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,680
is if you're familiar with search you

00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:19,319
know we're usually returning 10 blue

00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:22,080
links with question answering as the

00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:25,050
name implies I want to return the answer

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,930
who is the current prime minister of

00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:29,700
Germany give me that exact answer and

00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:31,799
got to be contextual right because I

00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:34,349
can't just say who is the Prime Minister

00:02:31,799 --> 00:02:36,659
10 years ago or 20 years ago or whatever

00:02:34,349 --> 00:02:39,420
it is I need to take into account all

00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:41,040
kinds of hints and information about who

00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:43,290
i am and where i am and all of these

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,609
kinds of things okay and so that's kind

00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:47,579
of the end goal and if you think about

00:02:44,609 --> 00:02:50,159
search in general what most users are

00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:51,959
after our answers so would it be great

00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:54,329
if we could actually give them answers

00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:57,209
so in some sense like question answering

00:02:54,329 --> 00:02:59,730
is the future promise of search and you

00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:02,629
see more and more search engines or at

00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:05,939
least offering answers in select

00:03:02,629 --> 00:03:08,480
circumstances okay like things like

00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:11,519
specific facts that they know or or

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:14,669
answers to questions that people ask

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,829
every day day in day out hey instead of

00:03:14,669 --> 00:03:19,079
doing a search why don't we just put up

00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:21,719
the answer for that and so let's start

00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:26,069
off with a little demo and in this demo

00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:28,980
it's based off of some code that I've

00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:30,689
written based off of a book that I've

00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:32,010
written called taming text we'll talk

00:03:30,689 --> 00:03:35,129
about that a little bit more in the

00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:36,989
minute but the idea here is that I'm

00:03:35,129 --> 00:03:39,930
going to take some set of information

00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:41,519
and I'm going to add some NLP on top of

00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:43,889
it I'm going to mix it in with search

00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,650
I'm going to do some fancy scoring and

00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:50,069
I'm going to come back with an actual

00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:52,319
result and so I've got a query that I'm

00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:55,229
sure all of you are thinking about right

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,609
now what is tri methyl benzene right

00:03:55,229 --> 00:03:58,979
this is at the forefront of your

00:03:56,609 --> 00:04:00,930
imagination I'm sure but I'm going to

00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:02,340
actually go and run that after I make

00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:05,639
this a little bit bigger can you see

00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:11,220
that back there I'm going to go and run

00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:13,049
that and what you'll see is if I make

00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:15,659
that a little bit bigger is I actually

00:04:13,049 --> 00:04:17,489
did this is going to hitting solar it's

00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:20,729
doing a bunch of question parsing and

00:04:17,489 --> 00:04:27,000
all that stuff and you can see that it's

00:04:20,729 --> 00:04:29,400
actually returning here an answer 124

00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,409
tri methyl benzene is a colorless liquid

00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:35,520
with chemical formulas eh it is

00:04:31,409 --> 00:04:37,770
flammable flammable aromatic hydrocarbon

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,200
with a strong order so pretty good

00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:41,639
answer right now of course hey you know

00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,680
the power of demo I'm up

00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:45,810
here on stage of course I picked one

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:50,729
that makes sense but we can also ask

00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:55,169
other types of questions like who is 10

00:04:50,729 --> 00:04:57,240
minute warning and you can see that i

00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:59,460
can get back answers here as well

00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:02,099
ten-minute warning was a hardcore punk

00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:05,039
band from Seattle Washington they became

00:05:02,099 --> 00:05:08,639
famous locally and if I scroll down here

00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:11,520
a little bit you can see that here

00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:14,490
indeed is the supporting content that I

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:18,539
derived that answer from so if you were

00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:24,060
doing raw search you would get back this

00:05:18,539 --> 00:05:28,289
if you're doing question answering you

00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:30,060
can get back something like this which

00:05:28,289 --> 00:05:31,590
one's better depends on what you're

00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:34,379
looking for but I think you know for

00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:36,240
most of us the quicker faster answer is

00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:37,680
usually the better if I'm really into 10

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,039
minute warning maybe I want to know all

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,419
of their background but in this case you

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,009
know I don't know a lot about them i'm

00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:45,990
actually i don't know any of their music

00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:48,389
anybody know 10 minute warning in the

00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:51,449
audience here one person get that guy a

00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:52,800
gift card I think he he wins the prize I

00:05:51,449 --> 00:05:56,610
think you're the only person where I've

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:59,360
given this talk that knows this band but

00:05:56,610 --> 00:06:08,189
I could also ask other questions like

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:10,939
what is Berlin buzzwords doesn't work

00:06:08,189 --> 00:06:13,649
what happened the system's broke right

00:06:10,939 --> 00:06:15,629
well in reality will explain what's

00:06:13,649 --> 00:06:18,089
going on here and that's the kind of the

00:06:15,629 --> 00:06:19,860
power and the promise of question

00:06:18,089 --> 00:06:21,870
answering and also some of the

00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:23,699
shortcomings of it is that it doesn't

00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:25,500
always work and so we have to be smart

00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:27,659
about how we think about question

00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,789
answering and and you know how we

00:06:27,659 --> 00:06:31,979
integrate this into our system and and

00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:33,810
feedback loops and all of that kind of

00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:36,629
stuff so that's kind of a gentle

00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:38,969
introduction basic idea of those I want

00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:41,009
answers and as you saw by the types of

00:06:38,969 --> 00:06:43,169
questions that I was asking in this

00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:46,199
particular context and this in my book

00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:49,889
and in in the code that I've written

00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:52,889
it's primarily geared around fact-based

00:06:49,889 --> 00:06:54,330
questions I'm not asking what were the

00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:56,879
causes of

00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:59,009
you know the u.s Civil War what you know

00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:01,050
when did you know some complex thing

00:06:59,009 --> 00:07:03,810
that you could go do a whole PhD on

00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:06,180
right we're just asking for facts and of

00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:07,889
course you can build things on top of a

00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:10,020
fact-based engine to ask more

00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:12,240
interesting questions find me all the

00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:14,669
content that compares and contrasts the

00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,199
u.s Civil War for instance or whatever

00:07:14,669 --> 00:07:18,599
your fancy is like you can start to

00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:20,969
layer on more complex things but in this

00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:23,219
particular code set of examples it's all

00:07:20,969 --> 00:07:26,250
about can I find that little snippet of

00:07:23,219 --> 00:07:27,930
data that says this is the answer to

00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:30,389
this question or at least this is the

00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:31,979
likely answer to that question so all of

00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:33,960
this stuff is kind of based off of work

00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:36,479
that I get to do when I put my CTO hat

00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:38,940
on it loose it works as well as in the

00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:41,870
book taming text the book itself is a

00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:45,120
little bit out of date but it's

00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:47,550
primarily geared towards people have

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,529
never built their engineers like

00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:51,000
yourself you probably know Java or some

00:07:49,529 --> 00:07:53,610
other language but you've never

00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,979
necessarily worked on search or worked

00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:58,080
on NLP before and so the idea is I'm

00:07:55,979 --> 00:07:59,940
going to walk you through in a gentle

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,409
way what are the concepts behind these

00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:05,400
things and they show you working

00:08:01,409 --> 00:08:07,979
examples using open source open source

00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,870
code that either we the authors wrote or

00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:12,930
based off of popular open source

00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:17,069
projects like leucine solar about open

00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:19,199
NLP all of those kinds of things so with

00:08:17,069 --> 00:08:22,379
that I always like to start when we

00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:25,319
think about NLP by taking a step back

00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:27,599
and I just want to warn you like

00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:29,550
everything that you've done in your

00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:32,610
engineering career if you haven't worked

00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:34,469
on these kinds of problems is going to

00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:37,709
start to make you feel squirmy and a

00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:38,880
little uncertain of yourself and the

00:08:37,709 --> 00:08:41,370
interesting thing is like when you start

00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,979
to think about text it's filled with all

00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:46,709
kinds of different characters right

00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:48,839
there's a lot of evil people or evil

00:08:46,709 --> 00:08:51,660
kinds of texts out there there's noise

00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:53,300
there's bad data there's a mixture of

00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:56,459
good and bad data there's mixtures of

00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:58,440
languages all in one document there's

00:08:56,459 --> 00:09:01,350
people believe it or not on the web who

00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,089
actually published lies so what are you

00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:04,800
going to do about all that stuff this is

00:09:03,089 --> 00:09:05,699
going to be your job if you want to be

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,319
an NLP engine

00:09:05,699 --> 00:09:09,689
here you're gonna have to spend a lot of

00:09:07,319 --> 00:09:11,489
time fighting these guys so I like to

00:09:09,689 --> 00:09:13,649
think about is how can we go off and do

00:09:11,489 --> 00:09:15,299
this there's people who are gestures

00:09:13,649 --> 00:09:17,699
there's people who they say things that

00:09:15,299 --> 00:09:20,119
look like they're actually serious but

00:09:17,699 --> 00:09:22,739
they're not it's called sarcasm right

00:09:20,119 --> 00:09:25,230
there's people who are really good at

00:09:22,739 --> 00:09:27,139
language the Hemmingway's the Faulkner's

00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:30,629
all these guys there's people who write

00:09:27,139 --> 00:09:32,549
sentences that go on for multiple pages

00:09:30,629 --> 00:09:35,129
and people actually think those

00:09:32,549 --> 00:09:37,379
sentences are beautiful how do you train

00:09:35,129 --> 00:09:42,929
a computer to detect a sentence that

00:09:37,379 --> 00:09:44,790
spans 27 pages that's your job as an NLP

00:09:42,929 --> 00:09:46,470
engineer and then I'll by the way

00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:49,410
there's other things like there's

00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:51,629
unicorns there's really rare stuff in

00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:54,869
fact you're a unicorn the fact that your

00:09:51,629 --> 00:09:57,959
name probably who you are if you show up

00:09:54,869 --> 00:10:00,299
in text chances are that's a pretty rare

00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:02,699
event for most of us you know we're not

00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:04,709
world famous all of us are the odds of

00:10:02,699 --> 00:10:06,839
any one of us showing up in texting a

00:10:04,709 --> 00:10:08,699
machine be able to say oh that's Bob

00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:11,369
Jones right there this Bob Jones that's

00:10:08,699 --> 00:10:13,649
sitting right in the front row not very

00:10:11,369 --> 00:10:15,089
high likelihood that we would be able to

00:10:13,649 --> 00:10:17,129
determine that and yet you're often

00:10:15,089 --> 00:10:20,549
asked when building these systems to be

00:10:17,129 --> 00:10:21,779
able to do this kind of stuff right the

00:10:20,549 --> 00:10:23,429
cool thing though is at the end of the

00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:25,529
day we all get to be the heroes because

00:10:23,429 --> 00:10:28,499
we get to work on this stuff but most

00:10:25,529 --> 00:10:31,259
importantly just remember no system will

00:10:28,499 --> 00:10:33,149
be perfect here's the other caveat when

00:10:31,259 --> 00:10:34,859
it comes to dealing with this stuff I

00:10:33,149 --> 00:10:38,189
want you to everybody know the English

00:10:34,859 --> 00:10:39,809
idiom take it with a grain of salt again

00:10:38,189 --> 00:10:41,369
that kind of goes back to well it's

00:10:39,809 --> 00:10:44,789
mostly true but don't believe everything

00:10:41,369 --> 00:10:47,579
you hear hear I think when a lot of us

00:10:44,789 --> 00:10:49,439
think about NLP and machine learning we

00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:51,569
think about all these fancy algorithms

00:10:49,439 --> 00:10:53,999
you know support vector machines or deep

00:10:51,569 --> 00:10:56,609
learning or all of these kind of really

00:10:53,999 --> 00:10:58,350
cool things neural networks etc you're

00:10:56,609 --> 00:11:00,569
going to spend a whole lot of time on a

00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:02,399
whole bunch of crap work pardon my

00:11:00,569 --> 00:11:05,100
french there right you're going to spend

00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:07,350
time dealing with things like PDF

00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:11,100
formats anybody tried to extract text

00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:14,610
from PDF before raise your hands been a

00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:16,949
good experience for you know why not

00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:19,500
it's because it's a proprietary format

00:11:16,949 --> 00:11:21,570
we're using open source tools to get it

00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,460
Adobe doesn't publish this pack all of

00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:25,950
that kind of stuff you have to pay for

00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:27,330
it well there's all kinds of those kinds

00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:28,830
of problems and you're going to spend a

00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:30,390
lot of your time on those kinds of

00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:33,330
problems things like pre-processing

00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:35,550
feature selection sampling doing

00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:36,660
validation and testing and all that

00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:38,730
you're going to spend a little

00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:40,950
itty-bitty time on the core algorithm

00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:42,780
itself and guess what in most situations

00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:45,420
the algorithm is only going to move the

00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:47,130
needle by a tiny little bit and so I

00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:49,380
always like to try to warn people ahead

00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:52,410
of times that you need to start simple

00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:54,180
use tried-and-true approaches also keep

00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:57,570
in mind what is the bang for the buck

00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:59,220
for you and your company right a lot of

00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:01,080
people want to add for instance really

00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:03,240
fancy NLP of their search algorithms

00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:06,030
when in fact they would be a hundred

00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:08,010
times better off just simply adding

00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:11,700
something like autocomplete to their

00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:13,800
search box right so you may as an

00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:16,440
engineer want to go do NLP because

00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:18,540
that's really cool but autocomplete

00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:20,070
which is basically an engineering task

00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:21,780
at this point of adding a couple more

00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:23,730
servers and being a little bit smart

00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:26,490
about certain things but you mostly get

00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:29,280
it for free from modern search engines

00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:31,790
way better bang for the buck so until

00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:36,030
you've done those easy things first

00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:38,700
don't bother here yet okay that being

00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:41,880
said it won't be a talk if I just quit

00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:45,720
right now so let's dig in and look at a

00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:48,300
really simple q a workflow okay so over

00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:51,570
on the left kind of one of the premises

00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:53,430
of most modern QA systems and Watson is

00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:56,070
no different here being you know kind of

00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:58,500
the most famous QA system and probably

00:12:56,070 --> 00:13:00,690
the most popular and well-known they're

00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:05,339
all based off of taking in a bunch of

00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:07,980
content from the web Wikipedia etc and

00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:11,010
so if that content doesn't have the

00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:13,800
answer or has conflicting answers or

00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:16,170
whatever you have to deal with that

00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:18,630
right so when I ask the question where

00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:20,339
or what is Berlin buzzwords and it came

00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:22,380
back with no answers now you guys know

00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:25,440
why because what I was doing was

00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:27,150
indexing a snapshot of wikipedia from I

00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,250
don't know three or four years ago

00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:30,870
whatever I have on my laptop in fact i

00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,810
was actually indexing a subset of

00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:36,800
wikipedia something like 10

00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:39,770
thousand records so the facts that i can

00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:42,800
answer are all based off of what i see

00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:45,320
in that core content right so classic

00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,300
case a garbage in garbage out or in this

00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:49,250
case if there's no garbage in I'm

00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:52,040
definitely not getting any garbage out

00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:53,980
right and so one of the things I've got

00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:56,720
to do is here on the left hand side

00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:59,360
basically as my content is flowing in

00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,160
whatever it is I want to do some really

00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,990
simple things and so this is what's

00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:05,270
baked into the code you could add other

00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:08,029
layers here but the first thing I do is

00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:10,310
detect sentences which is basically you

00:14:08,029 --> 00:14:12,620
know I'm just splitting on periods and

00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:14,930
things like that open NLP actually comes

00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:17,089
with a pretty decent sentence detection

00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:18,680
and the grand scheme of NLP kinds of

00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:21,500
things sentence detection is actually a

00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:24,560
pretty easy problem at least for Latin

00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:27,230
based languages if you get into Chinese

00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:30,050
Japanese Korean etc then it gets a bit

00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:32,690
harder as just just dealing with the

00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:35,540
character sets and all that and then

00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:37,100
what we do is we go and do named entity

00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:38,990
recognition I'll cover a little bit more

00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:42,080
what that is and then we just add those

00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:44,570
documents into solar so now at indexing

00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:48,170
time I've got a solar index or leucine

00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:51,020
index that contains essentially some

00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:52,910
annotated content it's the raw original

00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:55,490
content that whole big document on 10

00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:57,980
minute warning but it has some extra

00:14:55,490 --> 00:15:00,200
things added into it and those extra

00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:02,630
things will then allow me a query time

00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:05,420
to do interesting things and so a lot of

00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:07,640
the work happens at query time obviously

00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:09,890
the the natural language question comes

00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:11,690
in notice I wasn't doing like if you're

00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:14,540
familiar with leucine and solar I wasn't

00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:17,120
doing you know ten and minute and

00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:19,400
warning you know and putting in like

00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,839
boolean operators or parenthesis or any

00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:23,630
of that kind of stuff I was actually

00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:25,640
just letting the person type in real

00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:27,380
questions just like you would in this

00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:29,720
particular case English ones but you

00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:31,730
could go and train this for German or

00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,740
French or whatever you want to go and do

00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:35,810
so first off we've got to go and parse

00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:37,790
that query we've got to split that up

00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:39,770
into tokens and we've got to find out

00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:41,810
interesting things about it I'll talk a

00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:44,240
little bit more about what those are and

00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:46,220
then this really is the crux of the the

00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,670
process here on the query side is I

00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:48,650
wanted

00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:50,660
terming the answer type we'll get into

00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:52,280
that here in a minute and then so on

00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:55,430
down its kind of the rest of it is

00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:57,710
pretty easy after this or these next two

00:15:55,430 --> 00:16:00,320
steps basically how do I convert that

00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:02,420
answer type and the query and a leucine

00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,830
or solar query and then last but not

00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:05,000
least I get a bunch of candidate

00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,500
documents so if you're familiar with

00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,780
Lucy in the solar they just return back

00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:10,940
the raw documents I've actually got to

00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:13,790
do something to score within those and

00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:15,650
that's what this whole ranking passages

00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:17,990
and you can get really complex about

00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:20,150
this if you read for instance the Watson

00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:22,460
paper they go and do some really

00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:24,380
advanced ranking around tiebreakers and

00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:28,760
different data sets and all that kind of

00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:30,920
stuff so far so good so that's a very

00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:32,660
high level very simple workflow there's

00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,700
a lot of room for improvement here I

00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:36,200
will talk a little bit about some of the

00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:38,180
room for improvement at the end of this

00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:42,410
talk but let's dig into what are the

00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:44,300
building blocks here so in the book this

00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:47,420
is all in chapter 2 this is kind of in

00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:49,910
those grain of salt categories sentence

00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:51,860
detection part-of-speech tagging parsing

00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:54,230
these are all kind of the core building

00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:56,990
blocks of NLP how many people remember

00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:58,940
their high school grammar class verbs

00:16:56,990 --> 00:17:01,480
and nouns and adjectives how many people

00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:04,760
like their high school grammar class

00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:07,130
nobody well okay so you're an NLP

00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:11,420
engineer you can you know come talk to

00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:12,890
me afterwards we'll get a job for you so

00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:16,580
the idea oftentimes though is that

00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:18,350
you're building out structures like this

00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:22,280
anybody remember diagramming sentences

00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:24,620
in high school really fun exercise nod

00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,850
your heads yes your English teacher your

00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:27,650
German teacher or whatever language

00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:29,750
would be really proud of you so in this

00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:32,330
particular case like I've got this

00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:35,150
sentence the Minnesota Twins my hometown

00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:37,720
baseball team the 1991 world series

00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:40,640
champions are currently in third place

00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:44,330
we parse that out this is a noun phrase

00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:47,060
the minnesota twins that whole thing the

00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:49,850
1991 world series champions that's also

00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:52,160
a noun phrase together to noun phrases

00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:55,550
make a noun phrase starting to come back

00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:57,440
to you painful memories English you've

00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:59,440
got your verb phrase over here we got

00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,899
verb in an advert

00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,360
adverb phrase are currently in third

00:18:01,899 --> 00:18:06,250
place the cool thing is something like

00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:09,340
open NLP actually will do this whole

00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:11,379
structure for you and so now we can

00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:14,320
start to think about how can we leverage

00:18:11,379 --> 00:18:15,970
those in that information right you can

00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,590
start I think if you're paying attention

00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:19,480
you're thinking about okay I've got this

00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:22,120
answer type on the query side and I've

00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:25,240
got the structure content over on the

00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:27,429
documents I think about how you can fit

00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,960
together those puzzle pieces but before

00:18:27,429 --> 00:18:30,759
we do that let's take a little aside

00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:34,090
everybody familiar with named entity

00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:36,009
recognition all right this is that whole

00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:38,110
problem of how do I know Bob Jones is

00:18:36,009 --> 00:18:39,879
really Bob Jones or or whether Bob Jones

00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:44,409
is actually a person or a thing or

00:18:39,879 --> 00:18:47,259
something of interest if your yahoo user

00:18:44,409 --> 00:18:48,519
a lot of web news sites these days may

00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:51,309
be a little hard to read in the back

00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:53,220
there but on this particular image like

00:18:51,309 --> 00:18:56,549
Sarah Palin everybody's favorite

00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:59,200
presidential candidate and I'm sure is

00:18:56,549 --> 00:19:01,120
underlined and this system is actually

00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,759
underlining and highlighting named

00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:06,879
entity named entities in the text

00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:09,460
apologize for the outdated us slide but

00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:10,960
it's still relevant and the ideas then

00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:12,340
you can they're hyperlinked and you can

00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,730
click on it and get more information

00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:18,490
about that person so NER is this process

00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:20,080
of extracting proper names and there's a

00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:22,779
couple different approaches we can do

00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:25,210
rule based approaches like look for see

00:19:22,779 --> 00:19:27,460
certain key words together like you know

00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:30,279
mr. Bob Jones so anytime you see the

00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:33,549
word mr. then chances are the thing that

00:19:30,279 --> 00:19:35,080
follows up after it is a person right so

00:19:33,549 --> 00:19:36,909
you can build out these rules but even

00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:38,169
better we can apply machine learning to

00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:40,629
these kinds of things and that's really

00:19:38,169 --> 00:19:43,450
how the modern approach is done to it

00:19:40,629 --> 00:19:45,429
but even there right you see already one

00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:49,539
of the hard problems how is mr. usually

00:19:45,429 --> 00:19:52,570
spelled Mr period right what ends a

00:19:49,539 --> 00:19:53,919
sentence in English anyways period right

00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:56,049
so you sure that's not the end of a

00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:58,809
sentence and then in Bob Jones is the

00:19:56,049 --> 00:20:00,759
beginning of the next one maybe it is

00:19:58,809 --> 00:20:02,559
maybe it isn't right so again you start

00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:04,269
to think about how all of these play

00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:06,759
together and really at the end of the

00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:09,129
day this any our stuff is a pretty

00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:11,440
critical aspect because it turns out in

00:20:09,129 --> 00:20:12,650
question answering most people when

00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,240
they're looking in these fact

00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:16,610
systems they're interested in people

00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:20,210
places things they're interested in

00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:22,610
named entities so digging in after that

00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:24,920
let's think a little bit about search in

00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:27,680
this context because most of the work

00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:29,600
like a said happens a query time the

00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:31,910
documents indexing side that codes

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,680
pretty straightforward all of its built

00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:36,020
out in the book code you can go and try

00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:38,600
it really easy the search side is really

00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:41,180
where it gets interesting and what we do

00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:43,190
in the book is take a custom query

00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:45,050
parser so solar makes it really easy for

00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:47,090
you to plug in your own query parser so

00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:49,010
that's all we did was take a plug-in one

00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:50,960
that can handle natural language and

00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:52,730
then the key thing that you've got to be

00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,190
able to do is retrieve what's called a

00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:57,080
candidate passage fact this is what

00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:58,940
Watson does it does it across lots of

00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:00,320
different data sets it's really fast at

00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:02,600
it and it's really fast at combining

00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,070
them together that whole combining them

00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:06,140
together is that I've got these

00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:07,640
candidate passages i need to go score

00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:09,980
them the interesting thing that's

00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:11,990
different here from search in most cases

00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:16,160
when you're just showing 10 blue links

00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:18,490
is in most searched systems you just

00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:21,320
need to know that there was a match

00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:23,660
right you don't need to know where it

00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:25,520
occurred in a QA system I need to know

00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:28,580
where it occurred so I can go look

00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:30,080
around it at the context right and so

00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:32,150
that's one of the trivial or one of the

00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:34,220
key things that's underlying this turns

00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:36,230
out lucena solar have support for this

00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:39,800
it's called they're called span queries

00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:41,780
or position based queries they're not

00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:43,040
really greatly support I mean they're

00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:45,500
supported but they're not necessarily

00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:47,360
first-class citizens but as they just

00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:50,360
gave me they are getting better has that

00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:52,520
been committed okay so on the latest

00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:55,160
Lucy never mind all that like positions

00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:57,140
and all of this where did it occur or is

00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:59,320
now a first class citizen which is great

00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:01,850
because before it was kind of clunky and

00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:04,280
so that's one of the key things that we

00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:05,900
need to be able to do the other key

00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:08,540
thing we need to be able to do like i

00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:10,670
said is determine that answer type well

00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:13,940
the answer type is essentially doing a

00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:16,370
categorization of the users question

00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:19,100
what is this person looking for what is

00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:21,500
their intent right and in this case

00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:22,910
we're doing certain kinds of answer type

00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:25,220
so in the book we just use four

00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:26,840
different answer types but there's

00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:29,300
hundreds depending on

00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:31,910
who you want to talk to and what your

00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:33,890
system wants you can go after a lot more

00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:35,990
of these so a few examples i'm

00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:39,200
interested in a person or a location or

00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:40,820
an organization or a time point so you

00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,620
might ask the question when is Grant's

00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:44,330
talk at Berlin buzzwords wouldn't that

00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:45,980
be great if instead of looking on the

00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:47,870
schedule you could just say into your

00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:50,120
phone when is Grant's talk at Berlin

00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:52,490
buzzwords I would be really nice feature

00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:55,490
to have and so what we're then doing is

00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:57,890
there's a two-part process to this we're

00:22:55,490 --> 00:23:00,890
going to train an NLP classifier on a

00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:03,080
bunch of questions and then at query

00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:05,300
time all we have to do is feed that

00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:07,100
question into that model that was

00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:10,790
created so we do the training offline

00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:13,580
and then we look up and ask the model at

00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:15,440
runtime so for example here's actually

00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:18,230
one of the training questions it's

00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:21,260
labeled with a p4 person it says which

00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:23,840
French monarch we all know that we're

00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:25,670
looking now for a person reinstated the

00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,740
Divine Right of the monarchy blah blah

00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:30,950
blah you can tell academics came up with

00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:32,060
these examples so you know it's

00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:33,980
obviously something you know you

00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:35,720
wouldn't necessarily see on your core

00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:37,610
website but you would do the same kind

00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:40,520
of thing when is grant talking at Berlin

00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:43,460
buzz words or who is grant or whoever

00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:46,070
you could train based off of those kinds

00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:49,390
of examples so now we've got a way of

00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:51,860
searching we've got this answer type

00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:54,050
there's a little bit of magic there and

00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:56,150
asking the right kind of question but if

00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:58,250
you remember at document indexing time

00:23:56,150 --> 00:24:00,110
worry we're overlaying things like the

00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:02,480
part of speech and all of that stuff so

00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:04,550
we're we're overlaying onto the document

00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:07,460
things like this is a noun phrase or

00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:08,930
this is a named entity now a query time

00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:10,700
I can say oh this is looking for a

00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:12,890
person that means I want to look for

00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:14,960
named entities within the scoring

00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:17,840
passage and so then it becomes a

00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:20,030
question of how do i do scoring on this

00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:23,720
in the book we present a really simple

00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:25,610
scoring approach but it works decent

00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:28,040
enough for you to get started and

00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:29,990
feeling like you're making progress I

00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:31,880
won't claim that we invented this is

00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:36,530
actually in the early days of question

00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:38,060
answering back in the 90s AT&T published

00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:40,650
this in one of their question answering

00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:42,210
papers pretty simple though is

00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:44,760
again now all of a sudden you can see

00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:46,170
why I need to know where the match was

00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:48,000
because I'm going to look at the

00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:50,340
matching terms and then I'm going to

00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,580
look at various size windows around

00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:56,040
those matching terms right so what is

00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:58,440
trying methylbenzene finding the word

00:24:56,040 --> 00:25:00,360
tri methyl benzene and then looking at

00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:02,220
around it and then doing some scoring

00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:07,110
based off of in this particular case

00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:09,930
it's a really simple scoring so far so

00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:11,580
good so it turns out then that we can

00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:14,130
actually do some really interesting

00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:15,810
things with this beyond I'm just going

00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:18,810
to give another little quick demo

00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:20,760
assuming that I started it properly in

00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:23,610
this particular case looking at some of

00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:26,730
the work that we're doing shoot I forgot

00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:29,160
to start it let me fire that up some of

00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:31,170
the work that we're doing in loser works

00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:33,990
fusion fusion is just our product that

00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:35,160
sits on top of leucine and one of the

00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:37,020
things you start to think about is that

00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:39,660
well if I'm doing this answer type stuff

00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:41,700
I don't have to just use that for

00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:44,670
question answering I can use that really

00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:48,420
to try to categorize a user intent and

00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:50,370
so what we've been done is build into

00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:54,120
our mechanism into what we call our

00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:58,200
pipeline stages this ability to say that

00:25:54,120 --> 00:26:01,110
I want to do things like to tech what

00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:03,860
the what the answer types are and then

00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:07,050
feed that into downstream applications

00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:09,120
so let me just see if that's done

00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:15,420
starting up otherwise I'll come back to

00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:17,280
it almost done so here we go just pop

00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:20,790
over to this other window so in this

00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:23,820
particular case what uh what I've done

00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:25,850
is let me just skip right to my window

00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,850
here

00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:41,180
sorry search and I'm going to choose my

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:44,000
collection questions and I'm going to

00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:46,310
get back a bunch of content here let me

00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,550
just make this window bigger not sure

00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:51,620
what's going on resolution size there

00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:53,780
you can see what I've got in here is a

00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:56,510
bunch of tax questions so this is

00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:58,550
generated off of user forms for us taxes

00:26:56,510 --> 00:27:00,650
hopefully European taxes aren't as

00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:03,050
archaic is US taxes but people spend a

00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:05,600
lot of time in the US on taxes and so

00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:07,250
for instance in these this faq if you

00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,650
will you can imagine applying this to

00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:11,240
any faq system which people ask

00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:14,030
questions like where do I take a

00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:15,140
deduction for a home office right I

00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:16,880
don't know if that's a thing over here

00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:19,220
but it's a thing in the US and you can

00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,660
get money back for it and so what we've

00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:22,100
done is we've taken all of those

00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:25,880
questions those are essentially are

00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:27,710
training our training examples and you

00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:31,130
can see for instance the second item

00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:33,820
here that's my label that's my answer

00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:36,140
type you remember the P in the

00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:38,720
organization person organization will in

00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:41,720
this particular case whoever built this

00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:43,190
faq has also assigned labels to them and

00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:45,260
so you can see here i'm actually just

00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:47,240
searching all I put all this content and

00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:51,020
solar itself and so then I can build my

00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:55,070
model off of it and so we can come in

00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:58,190
and then I can ask questions like if I

00:27:55,070 --> 00:28:06,580
can remember their my exact syntax how

00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:10,660
do i take the home office deduction and

00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:13,670
good lord willing live demos it works

00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:16,430
okay and so the interesting thing here

00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:18,800
that i did is obviously i'm getting

00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:20,960
matches on the questions themselves but

00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:23,990
i've also done this categorization of

00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:26,240
the question itself and that's allowed

00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:28,850
me to do what's called the landing page

00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,260
infusion or a best bet if you're

00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:32,840
familiar with that in most search

00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:34,280
systems here the idea being that in this

00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:36,020
particular case and i'll show you what

00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:38,240
the pipeline looks like i've done a

00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:41,210
categorization or a classification of

00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:43,850
the question and then I've marked that

00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:46,970
in my processing steps before I even

00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:47,340
query solar and then I've fed that into

00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:49,020
this

00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:52,140
any page thing that just says oh if

00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:54,540
there's a if I see this type of category

00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:57,030
for the answer type then just

00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:59,280
automatically attached to my results

00:28:57,030 --> 00:29:01,500
this landing page or this page that I

00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:03,780
would redirect to so for instance like

00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:06,330
if you're on the apple website and you

00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:10,020
do a search for iphone does this show

00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:11,850
you 100 blue links on iphone now it just

00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:14,610
shows you it takes you right to the

00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:16,770
iphone landing page same kind of idea

00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:18,540
here what is this user looking for what

00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:20,250
is their intent well if we know then

00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:22,740
let's just take them right to the answer

00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:24,420
and then I can also add in obviously all

00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:26,550
the question answering stuff that I do

00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:28,080
too but you'd be surprised at how many I

00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:30,450
bet if you went and looked in your logs

00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:32,070
how many people come to your website and

00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:33,540
ask the same question over and over

00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:36,570
again chances are you're already

00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:39,060
curating them anyways so what does this

00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:43,080
look like real quickly in the pipelines

00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:45,320
just pop over to this other tab here I'm

00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:47,820
going to go look at my questions and

00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:49,980
literally with the way of fusion works

00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:52,050
you can just drag and drop different

00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:54,960
pipeline stages in there in this

00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:57,690
particular case on the I'm in the query

00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:01,590
pipelines I'm doing my searches against

00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:03,090
solar I setting up what searches or what

00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:05,160
fields I want to search and then I've

00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:08,310
got this little NLP classifier that

00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:11,670
literally is just outputting to a

00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:14,220
specific label this category field and

00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:16,590
using a model that I have stored on my

00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:18,450
local system this is all prototype code

00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:22,710
right now something that we're working

00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:26,100
on for the near future here and so out

00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:28,350
of that then comes a category label if

00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:30,000
it can label it and then the next stage

00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:33,390
I have is one of our landing pages

00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:38,220
stages and it literally just says if

00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:40,830
I've got a match on the category label

00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:45,000
in this case deduction home office then

00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:48,270
I want to redirect to this exact URL and

00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,640
you can apply different strategies to

00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:52,830
matching and all that right so that's

00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:55,020
not so much it's not so much about doing

00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:57,360
this with landing pages as that's an

00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:59,190
example of how you could go do this and

00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,659
in fact all of these stages will get

00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:02,580
that context passed in

00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:05,849
and then you can see the very last one

00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:07,409
here is go and do solar but so for

00:31:05,849 --> 00:31:09,869
instance i might based off of the

00:31:07,409 --> 00:31:13,289
category i might choose different

00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:15,450
faceting options right and then have it

00:31:13,289 --> 00:31:17,039
automatically display those facets

00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:18,929
that's a big problem in e-commerce so

00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:21,320
again like how can I take this user

00:31:18,929 --> 00:31:23,399
intent and then turn that into something

00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:26,129
interesting and then like I said of

00:31:23,399 --> 00:31:28,139
course we can go and build proper QA

00:31:26,129 --> 00:31:34,200
systems and all of that underneath the

00:31:28,139 --> 00:31:37,950
hood just get back to my slides so I

00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:40,529
think pretty quickly showed you some of

00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:42,509
the basics that go into QA it's

00:31:40,529 --> 00:31:44,159
obviously kind of a trivial situation if

00:31:42,509 --> 00:31:46,109
you've ever written a book you realize

00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:48,029
that the whole thing is about writing

00:31:46,109 --> 00:31:50,070
the simple examples that demonstrate the

00:31:48,029 --> 00:31:51,840
idea without you know giving you know we

00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:53,909
get to wave our hands a lot as authors

00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:56,580
so a real production system obviously

00:31:53,909 --> 00:31:59,639
has to do a lot more I've put up here a

00:31:56,580 --> 00:32:01,889
number of different ideas around next

00:31:59,639 --> 00:32:05,039
steps as some things that are

00:32:01,889 --> 00:32:07,679
interesting that you could do even in my

00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:09,359
you know my little solar demo there

00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:11,580
where I'm getting back and showing you

00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:13,979
those actual answers if you really dug

00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:16,440
in on that you would see that it's not

00:32:13,979 --> 00:32:17,759
really yet the answer like I think in

00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:19,919
some of them I had you know I have that

00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:21,629
window but chances are you could

00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:24,450
probably narrow it down even less than

00:32:21,629 --> 00:32:26,940
that and and say it's this exact kind of

00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:28,830
piece to it so extracting the actual

00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:32,009
answers there's a fair bit of work that

00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:34,739
goes into that doing things like dealing

00:32:32,009 --> 00:32:37,080
with duplicates or conflicting answers

00:32:34,739 --> 00:32:38,970
or all of those kinds of things that's

00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:41,159
really a critical part especially if

00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:43,619
you're taking in the world's knowledge

00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:46,169
if you will or a really large volume of

00:32:43,619 --> 00:32:48,539
content you're going to have people who

00:32:46,169 --> 00:32:50,999
disagree how do you decide which one so

00:32:48,539 --> 00:32:53,460
you know I think a lot of what IBM did

00:32:50,999 --> 00:32:55,470
was take and figure out good ways of

00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:58,559
learning the weights of which systems

00:32:55,470 --> 00:33:01,080
which data sources to trust and why and

00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:04,200
win and that in itself is a machine

00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:05,669
learning problem as well you can do

00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,200
other things like you know obviously

00:33:05,669 --> 00:33:09,960
there's a whole bunch of more answer

00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,820
types training data is needed on that I

00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:13,499
think some of the deep learning stuff

00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:14,610
that's going on could really help in

00:33:13,499 --> 00:33:16,260
terms of the features

00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:18,210
election and all these kinds of pieces

00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:20,850
and then last but not least one of the

00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:23,309
things like we do in fusion as we allow

00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:25,230
you to very easily capture clicks and

00:33:23,309 --> 00:33:26,970
feedback mechanisms from your user and

00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:29,790
then feed that back into your search

00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:31,410
results and so being able to do those

00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:34,770
kinds of things where hey this user

00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:37,140
actually clicked on that answer or you

00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:38,760
know grabbed a snippet of it and copied

00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:42,179
it somewhere else like giving you an

00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:44,820
indication that that is the actual right

00:33:42,179 --> 00:33:46,530
answer then you can feed that back into

00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:48,750
your system right and you're learning

00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:50,730
now from what your users are doing and

00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:54,150
then obviously over time your answers

00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:55,679
should get a lot better right we could

00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:58,410
go on and on here there's all kinds of

00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:00,960
low-level engineering questions to be

00:33:58,410 --> 00:34:02,850
answered and all that stuff there's lots

00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:05,160
of you know for instance I use open and

00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:08,070
LP in the book but there's things like

00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:09,750
Stanford NLP and various other natural

00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:12,359
language processing libraries that are

00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:14,580
good if not better and so depending on

00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:18,240
you know your penchant for doing all

00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:20,580
those things your mileage may vary so

00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:22,679
that's it I think we've got what five

00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:24,960
minutes for questions so I'm happy to

00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:27,780
answer any questions i do have at the

00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:30,179
end of the slides here quick on how to

00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:32,639
get started and run the demo that i

00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:38,149
showed you otherwise happy for a few

00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:38,149
questions thank you guys thank you

00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:41,520
