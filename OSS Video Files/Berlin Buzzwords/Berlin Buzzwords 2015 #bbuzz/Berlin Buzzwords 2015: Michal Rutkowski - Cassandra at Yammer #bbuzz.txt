Description: 
	The Apache Cassandra database is the right choice when you need scalability and high availability without compromising performance.

That may very well be true, but it took us a year to get there and that road was dotted with site’s lowered availability and compromised performance.

In this talk I am going to share the insights we gained when we migrated parts of the Yammer’s messaging pipeline from a custom storage solution backed by Java BDB to Cassandra. Covering topics like:

- Why we decided to move to Cassandra from our proprietary Berkeley DB backed database 
- Modeling data and capacity supported by metrics
- Zero downtime production rollout
- How things started falling apart after three months of seamless operation 
- How to diagnose and fix things later on
