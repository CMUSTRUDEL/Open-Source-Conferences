Title: Gunnar Morling & Hans-Peter Grahsl – Change Data Streaming Patterns in Distributed Systems
Publication date: 2021-06-30
Playlist: Berlin Buzzwords 2021 #bbuzz
Description: 
	Microservices are one of the big trends in software engineering of the last few years; organising business functionality in several self-contained, loosely coupled services helps teams to work efficiently, make the most suitable technical decisions, and react quickly to new business requirements.

In this session we'll discuss and showcase how open-source change data capture (CDC) with Debezium can help developers with typical challenges they often face when working on microservices. Come and join us to learn how to:

* Employ the outbox pattern for reliable, eventually consistent data exchange between microservices, without incurring unsafe dual writes or tight coupling

* Gradually extract microservices from existing monolithic applications, using CDC and the strangler fig pattern

* Coordinate long-running business transactions across multiple services using CDC-based saga orchestration, ensuring such activity gets consistently applied or aborted by all participating services
