Title: Daniel Guagnin – There is no such thing as bias-free tech. How models shape our world.
Publication date: 2021-06-23
Playlist: Berlin Buzzwords 2021 #bbuzz
Description: 
	Since prominent cases of racist and sexist „artifical intelligence“ have got medial attention, the term of biased algorithms is more widely discussed. However the term bias sometimes is understood as something that can be overcome easily by gaining more or „better“ data. I want to argue why the term „bias“ and its implication of potentially „unbiased“ technology is fundamentally misleading. For that I will connect the concept of model and modelification from computer science with sociological insights from science and technology studies. This illustrates how individual conceptions and necessary limitations of concrete use cases lead to restrictions of the models underlying the further technical development, which are rarely contested later on.

After that, drawing on sociology of technology, I will discuss how technology shapes individual action and society at large in order to stress the importance of evaluating and rethinking technical configurations and the specific biases and shortcomings of the models algorithms and technological are based on.

For the illustration of how specific values shape the development of software and the software shapes its users, I will revisit empirical examples of the linux communities Arch, Debian and Ubuntu. As a second case I will discuss model assumptions of the Android permission management which strongly frame possibilities of app developers and the personal privacy management of the users.

Based on empirical examples the talk illustrates the politics of technology and explains the underlying mechanisms in order to underline the responsibility which follows process of construction.

	00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:15,200
good evening i'm very glad

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:18,080
to be here what's this talk about

00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,960
the word bias makes us think there is

00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,400
such thing as

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,240
unbiased data or technology but i want

00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,599
to argue that rather it is about the

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,439
abstraction

00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:29,199
and the conscious or unconscious

00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:32,079
implications we inscribe

00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,440
into the models the models we use to

00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:37,920
build our technologies

00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:40,320
in the process of construction

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,520
finally our perspectives of the world

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,399
become part

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,680
of technology that in the end shapes our

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,320
perception

00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,640
and behavior and the working of the

00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,640
world

00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:57,600
who am i um this is not me

00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,719
but i might have looked similarly

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,000
irritated

00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:05,119
when one day i opened ebay and i was

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,479
advertised hipster fashionware

00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:10,880
for a moment i really started to think

00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,720
is this what i am have i become a

00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,920
hipster without realizing it

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,479
or am i a wannabe hipster do i want to

00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,240
be one

00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:20,080
there are nice classes and has offered

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,560
here then

00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,200
the analytical self came up is the data

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,040
wrong

00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,799
what did i look for that makes ebay

00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,560
think i'm hipster

00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:35,040
or was my flatmate on my computer or

00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,040
do they target our common ip address

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,479
i still don't know but the crucial point

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,159
is

00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:43,360
tech is not perfect data models make

00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,720
errors

00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:48,479
but still this affects us

00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,079
in my case it brought me to

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,360
self-reflection and

00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:55,840
made me think if i should be more open

00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,840
to fashion

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,799
but more sure than about my fashion i'm

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,520
about my profession

00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:08,800
so i did some research on data

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:12,000
protection privacy since 2010

00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,920
consultancy since 2017 i've got a

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,160
computer science background

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,440
and i did a doctoral thesis about

00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,599
sociology

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,680
about open source software communities

00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:24,319
in sociology of technology

00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,319
and science

00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:32,480
so back to the biases besides

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,280
my targeted advertisement advertisement

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,599
experience

00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,200
there are more severe cases of wrong

00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:40,080
data models

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,599
just some headlines to illustrate some

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,640
prominent cases

00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,640
you might heard from

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:51,680
amazon's crabs secret ai recruiting tool

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:54,640
that showed bias against women

00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,720
predictive policing algorithms are

00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,680
racist

00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,319
microsoft shuts down ai chatbot after it

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,640
turned

00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:07,840
into a nazi we see

00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:10,319
technology is promising and useful but

00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,319
we may face dysfunctional effects of

00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:15,440
technology design

00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:18,800
illegitimate automated decisions

00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:21,920
questionable incentives to act and

00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:24,400
to behave and

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,319
importantly technology is often

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:30,319
conceived as neutral

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:32,879
such as mathematics and the combination

00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,879
of a neutral perception and strong

00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:38,000
technological efficiency

00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:40,080
can bring injustice which is inscribed

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,400
in the model

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,400
and comes to a large scale

00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,280
but what's the matter with broken data

00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,280
models

00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:55,439
data models are shaped by the selection

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,040
of data by the availability of data what

00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,799
can be measured in the first place for

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:02,400
instance

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:04,400
by validity or by history since data

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:08,319
always is taken from the past and

00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:10,720
real life is often already unfair

00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,599
there might be others i don't want to go

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,120
much

00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:17,359
uh too much too deep into that

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,120
what can be the solution more data

00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:21,199
better data

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,759
i propose a more reflexive technology

00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:26,800
construction

00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:30,080
because it's not only the data models

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:33,680
it's more than that models can be very

00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:35,600
concrete like a crash test dummy

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,199
a model of the human body with a

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,800
standardized shape

00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:43,040
and weight of a man

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,320
it turns out that this model taken from

00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,280
a standard man

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,840
led to safety design which makes cars

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,759
less

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:53,280
safe for women many implications are

00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,280
kind of unconscious

00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,680
often we just use an eye methodology to

00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:01,280
conceptualize the working of technology

00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:04,880
and unconsciously include our subjective

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,320
worldview and

00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,360
to illustrate what i mean with

00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,840
subjectivity i brought to you

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,840
an example

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,960
it's an example taken from michel

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,520
foucault's

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,479
order of the things a quote from an

00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:24,080
ancient

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:27,039
chinese encyclopedia encyclopedia sorry

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,320
which offers an anthology which is very

00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:32,080
hard to accept for

00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:35,680
us today here

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:39,280
let me read aloud animals are divided

00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:43,840
into a belonging to the conqueror

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:48,639

l etc m having just broken the water

00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,840
pitcher

00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,960
and that from a long way of look like

00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,199
flies

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,319
if you had a love i hope i hope you had

00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,960
a love sorry

00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,360
i find it always a bit disturbing also

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,000
but

00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,479
this entology used to seem logic for

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,919
people

00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:35,039
of a certain culture in a certain time

00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:38,160
so

00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:39,280
ontology logic our perception of how

00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:44,560
things

00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:44,560
are are deeply cultural

00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,880
but there are also decisions and

00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,680
limitations made on purpose

00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,479
these limitations often are helpful to

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,919
fulfill

00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,960
a specific goal in the process of

00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,759
modeling

00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,880
assumptions are made decisions are taken

00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,720
between options

00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:07,440
which limit future possibilities

00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:10,160
in the process of modeling an important

00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:12,720
question is also who has to say

00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,440
in taking decisions on which basis

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,479
decisions

00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:19,360
are made these models here are useful to

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:21,919
demonstrate the construction of a boat

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,840
or to measure the flow resistance but

00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:27,280
they cannot necessarily swim

00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:29,759
they are not the product itself

00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,120
so during the process of technology

00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,840
construction the assumptions and

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,479
decisions

00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,840
of the model will be challenged and

00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:38,639
reconsidered

00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,639
at a later time

00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,599
here you see how a development team

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,479
simulates

00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:48,960
situations for a detection algorithm

00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:52,720
they build a model for the situations

00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:55,199
for the recognition of falls of seniors

00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,440
in such scenarios developers define

00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:00,560
which situations should be significant

00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:03,199
for an alarm which requires thorough

00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,080
reasoning since those definitions are

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,479
key

00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,800
for the recognition rate and the use of

00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:12,400
the technology in the end

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:17,120
it might even risk or save lives

00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:17,120
to recognize a fallen senior or not

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,000
models in it conceptualize key parts of

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,080
the software

00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,599
like the data structure or classes of

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,879
programs

00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:32,479
they later become become part of the

00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:35,519
software

00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:38,159
other than the ship models we saw before

00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:40,399
those models are already an integral

00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:43,680
part of the end product

00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:45,839
limitations and abstractions implicated

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,959
will often not be challenged again but

00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:54,959
flow directly into software code

00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:58,160
the model is already the product here

00:08:54,959 --> 00:09:01,040
let me now come to how technology can

00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:04,320
take effect on behavior

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:06,959
consciously beyond implicit assumptions

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,839
and necessary limitations for models

00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:12,080
technologies

00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:14,480
also be designed to script behavior

00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,240
let me give you two very illustrative

00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:19,200
textbook examples of science and

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,200
technology studies

00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:27,440
speed bumps are a technology

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:29,279
which leads people to drive slowly

00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,360
not because they take care of playing

00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:33,920
children but because they take care of

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,920
their car

00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:41,200
a very funny object is the berlin keys

00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:44,880
it's a simple object but a great example

00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:48,800
of how technology can script a whole

00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:51,440
user choreography it's a key

00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:53,279
which sticks in the door while the door

00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,839
is open

00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,560
so once the door is opened you can't get

00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,600
out

00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:02,640
your key you

00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:06,399
have to push the key through the hole

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:09,760
go inside and shut the door again

00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:11,760
to get back your key otherwise you don't

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:15,279
have the key

00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:18,640
so this is designed to

00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:22,480
take care that the door of a house

00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,480
stays closed

00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,399
it's a very simple object but a very

00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,839
complex

00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:34,160
choreography which is designed in

00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:37,200
technology so back to the digital

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:39,760
at least the beginning of the who knows

00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,760
dvds

00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:46,560
these many many might

00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,800
these video discs shipped with region

00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,200
keys in order to enforce the publication

00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,920
date of movies

00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,079
dvds from us for instance could not be

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,959
played on a european dvd player

00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:00,800
because the region code did not fit

00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:03,440
today digital rights management is much

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:07,760
more elaborated in streaming services

00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:09,360
but it shows how behavior or how the use

00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,399
of technology can

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:16,560
be shaped by its design

00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:20,399
another example for nudging users

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,399
you can find in cookie banners

00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,320
at least in europe you are confronted

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,360
with so-called

00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,720
dark patterns on a daily basis since

00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,800
companies are obliged

00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,360
to oblige to limit the use of personal

00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,920
data they try to nudge users

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,839
to consent to a broad range of data

00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,360
collection

00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,279
i know this is no black or white but

00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,240
from a user perspective this is

00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:45,680
really a pain these are examples of

00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,640
influencing users

00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,200
in their way of using technology but

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,160
this is

00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,760
conscious modeling of user action or

00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:57,839
scripting the way

00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,839
people interact with technology

00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,959
with a number of sociologists i worked

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:08,320
on a concept

00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:09,600
on conceptualizing the science and

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,519
technology studies

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,519
idea of moral inscription

00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,399
if we think of influencing user

00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,760
interaction

00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:23,040
we have two opportunities to change her

00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:26,160
aims

00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,160
or her opportunities

00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:34,240
the first way for changing users aims

00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:39,200
is just information in order to change

00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:43,040
her interpretation for instance we can

00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:46,240
give information why cookies make sense

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:48,079
and give a better user experience but we

00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,600
can also change the resources and give

00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:52,000
an inducement

00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,800
cookies cookie banners for instance who

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,519
are

00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,040
ignored and just stay until you accept

00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,200
and until you accept

00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:02,720
you can't see anything from the page

00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,720
you're visiting at the moment

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:08,800
then we can change the resources

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,320
through offering or not offering options

00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,040
for instance

00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:15,120
that would be the provision of resources

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:18,800
you can have loads of options or

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:22,959
can offer to to opt in every

00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:27,600
one of the thousand cookies

00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:29,440
or everything at one click for instance

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,200
so the cookie itself is a resource for

00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,079
interaction

00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,639
and question would be if you can only

00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,480
proceed

00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,920
after you clicked accept or if you just

00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,040
have one single button

00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:42,160
saying okay in the example of a cookie

00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,360
banner

00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,680
this shouldn't makes too much of sense

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,760
but

00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,720
i experienced banners which seem to keep

00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:53,680
me in the loop until i finally accept it

00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:56,560
there might be no option to not accept

00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,560
in some cases

00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:04,160
what is cast now can be illustrated as a

00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:06,480
constructionist model

00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,519
together with a colleague pola i drafted

00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,440
a concept

00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,199
to combine the computer science view of

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,160
models with the sociological view of

00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,000
inscription

00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,440
to illustrate the way we bring

00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,639
limitations and assumptions in

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,560
technology

00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,920
and shape the world through its

00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,000
application

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,040
models are an abstraction of the problem

00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,399
with a purpose

00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,399
and a plan for a solution

00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,839
in the process of construction this

00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:33,519
materializes

00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:34,560
into artifacts like protocols code or

00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,399
libraries

00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,000
each of these bricks entails again

00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,240
assumptions and limitations

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,839
step by step the technologies combined

00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,079
by parts and bricks with limitations and

00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:46,160
assumptions

00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,440
finally these become invisible in the

00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,199
final product

00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,480
but the system takes effect in its

00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:53,600
application

00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,600
into the world

00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,240
so let me get more practical as promised

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,920
in a talk description

00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,000
let me very shortly give you two

00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:06,000
examples of my empirical work

00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
the installed routines of three linux

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,639
distributions tell a lot about their

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,639
user view

00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:17,920
um they may be

00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:20,000
a wizard which let you install the

00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:23,519
system without any hassle

00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,880
or they may be the installer may be a

00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,839
simple menu which gives you

00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,839
loads of options

00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:32,160
or you have the whole power of the

00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,079
command line but you need to learn

00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,199
how to get the single steps of the

00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:38,959
installation

00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:38,959
done on your own

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,560
um remarkably this different modeling of

00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,440
of the user

00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,959
and the user experience um is already

00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,680
implicated in the

00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:51,680
in the slogan of of the distributions

00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,560
debian comes as the universal operating

00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:56,800
system

00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:59,600
ubuntu is the linux for human beings

00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,480
and our clinox comes as a simple

00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,600
lightweight

00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:08,240
distribution you can also find this

00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:10,160
in what i call the rdfm policy

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:13,199
which you can find in the community

00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:16,720
practices and the policies

00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:17,440
for instance users might say saying rdfm

00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,639
is not cool

00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:22,399
not following the code of conduct or

00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:25,040
the project leader says when the code is

00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:28,240
public rtfm is the proper answer

00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:31,600
document it properly afterwards

00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:36,079
or people might say rtfm helps

00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:38,720
the noob you can also find

00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:41,519
this uh in the social structures of the

00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,839
community that i have to skip that

00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,839
for reasons of the time another

00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:48,079
illustration of the power of models can

00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:51,199
be found in the android permission model

00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:54,320
which changed in android 6.

00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:55,519
in the old model users could see all

00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,839
permissions of an app

00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:59,759
before the installation install time

00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:02,079
permissions

00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:05,039
in the new model users could opt in

00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:08,400
every single permission

00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:10,160
wait every single permission no

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,079
part of the new model was that a number

00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,319
of permissions were defined as

00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:15,199
normal permissions which need no

00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:17,360
interaction

00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,600
for instance the internet access of the

00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:23,120
app is always granted

00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:25,360
which research found to be a category

00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,959
user's experience is sensible and would

00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,039
like to control

00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,240
since internet access means the app can

00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:34,080
also transfer

00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,080
sensible data to remote service

00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:39,280
interestingly by now while in our

00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,400
project we worked on making permission

00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:45,440
dialogues easier to understand

00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,679
apple came up with new dialogues

00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,440
also interesting is that our research

00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:51,200
showed that people were

00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,679
surprised to realize how much

00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,240
information the location data exactly

00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,919
meant

00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,679
when they saw the illustration of their

00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,440
movements on the map

00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,840
so information awareness can make a

00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,840
difference here

00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:10,400
and let me add the model

00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,400
of the permission model

00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,320
is a strong definition of what you can

00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:20,240
do as an

00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:22,080
application developer still you can

00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,679
write something in the dialogues but the

00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:27,039
permission model is

00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:30,880
already fixed by the model

00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:33,600
of the ecosystem so

00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,559
in conclusion ids ideas become

00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,679
materialized

00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:40,559
into models and implemented or

00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:42,160
inscribed into technology it's much more

00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:44,480
than biased data

00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,160
it's our view on the world it's

00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,799
assumptions and limitations in every

00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,840
brick

00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:52,080
of the technology it's the culture of

00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,760
the developers

00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,440
all this shapes technology and takes

00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:58,480
effect on the world

00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,640
through user interaction but also

00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,559
through computations and decisions

00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:05,280
which are made or suggested by

00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,280
algorithms

00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:12,240
it's a continuous process to keep in

00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,520
mind the responsibility of technology

00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,799
construction

00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:19,840
and find ways to reflect and challenge

00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:22,720
assumptions limitations and the effects

00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:24,720
it takes in every step of development

00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,440
thanks for listening i'm looking forward

00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:39,840
to questions

00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:39,840
and the paper will follow soon

00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,600
