Title: Megan Byrd-Sanicki – Be The Leader We All Need
Publication date: 2021-06-29
Playlist: Berlin Buzzwords 2021 #bbuzz
Description: 
	Open source crossed the chasm into mainstream with users in all industries. Maintaining the users’ trust and sustaining innovation is key to open source’s success. However, in a world where communities are passionate, multicultural, and primarily use online communication, it is challenging to move communities towards a shared vision in a frictionless, sustainable way.

Community challenges can impact innovation, putting user adoption at risk and even more importantly, hurting community members. Stronger open source leadership can address these challenges and there is a call for more leaders in every project.

Good news! Every contributor is a leader either through self leadership, leading others, or leading the community, yet most people have never been trained on how to lead. This talk provides the leadership training you need and covers: - What is leadership and why strengthen open source leadership - Key leadership and emotional intelligence principles - Practical ways to lead in order to create a diverse, thriving community especially in today’s extreme ambiguity and change.

have you ever felt like

00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,040
screaming and pulling out your hair and

00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,720
saying would someone

00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:22,000
just lead or just get people working

00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:22,000
better together i know i have

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,920
but what if you could be the leader that

00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,480
you need and that you didn't have to

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,599
rely

00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:32,480
on someone else to make this happen

00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,680
so today i want to share how you can do

00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,559
this

00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,559
but first i want to thank you for making

00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:41,280
time for today's talk

00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:42,879
because good leadership is so important

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,280
for your projects

00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:47,200
to be healthy with collaborative

00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,160
productive interactions and good

00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,280
outcomes so i'm really grateful that

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,800
you're taking the time

00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,520
to learn about leadership and how to

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,280
strengthen your skills

00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,719
so today that's exactly what we're going

00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,199
to focus on

00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,480
what is leadership how do you strengthen

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,559
leadership skills

00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,320
and i want to go a little bit further

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,600
and talk about how we help

00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,600
projects have more diverse leadership

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,040
how do we get people of underrepresented

00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,600
groups to

00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,680
step in and take on more leadership

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,720
roles as well

00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:23,200
so hopefully that sounds good and let's

00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,439
go ahead and dive in with the story

00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,439
that helps kind of explain what

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,880
leadership is especially

00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,880
in the world of open source

00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,280
so a couple years ago i was working on a

00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,040
project

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,119
where we wanted to improve the

00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,640
contributor experience and for an open

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,920
source project

00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,360
and we started by interviewing a lot of

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,920
community members about

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,600
their contribution journey that first

00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,920
experience and we wanted to see where

00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:55,200
the friction was

00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:58,240
and there was one story that really

00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,759
stood out to me as a great example

00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:05,280
and um it was about this

00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:08,319
uh this one guy

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:12,720
who was new to the project and

00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:15,440
wanted to make their first contribution

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,800
pretty standard right but unfortunately

00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,040
there was a problem

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,080
this person was looking in the forums

00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,840
for help

00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,680
and was watching the issue cues and

00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,720
watching everyone interacting

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,800
and he felt it was really intimidating

00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,000
uh the interactions weren't exactly

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,480
positive and

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,480
they kind of made newcomers feel a

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,200
little dumb for not

00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,640
knowing how to do things the right way

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,000
and of course when you're new you don't

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,160
know these things

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,040
and he really wanted to make this

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,239
contribution

00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:48,560
but he waited a whole year just watching

00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,560
to see well now can i jump in or do i

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,640
feel comfortable now and

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,400
it took a whole year for him to finally

00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,760
say i really want to do this but i need

00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,640
a new approach

00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,319
and he reached out to the mentor

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,480
somebody in the community who

00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,159
was more of a veteran and said i'd

00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,879
really like to do this

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,080
um and i don't know how and i'm feeling

00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,800
a little intimidated

00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,400
would you help me and this person said

00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,480
i'd be happy to mentor you

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,760
and this is you know volunteer time at

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,840
night or weekends

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,360
and the person gave up their time and

00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,800
helped out this

00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,120
person who wanted to make their first

00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:26,959
time contribution

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,799
and fortunately it worked out

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,959
this person did make their first

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:33,680
contribution and because they have a

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:36,799
learning mindset

00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,280
they were able to contribute again and

00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,879
again

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,799
and again and today this person is one

00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,920
of the top contributors for the open

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,840
source project

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,840
which is just an amazing outcome

00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:54,080
but it's also really unfortunate

00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,439
i mean how many contributions were lost

00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,239
because this person waited

00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,120
a whole year well if you look at this

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,680
person's

00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,920
contribution record they lost 400

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,280
contributions that year

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,120
that's what they were at they are

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,200
averaging and that's a lot of

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,879
contributions to lose

00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:15,439
and that how many contributions are lost

00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,160
because people didn't push through and

00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,959
figure out

00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,919
how to get started on that contribution

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,199
journey

00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:25,280
and the answer is just too many too many

00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,440
people

00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,120
and it's a shame because it doesn't have

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,040
to be this way

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,240
you know people in open source they want

00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,400
to get involved they

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,840
want to help that is what open source is

00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,160
all about

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,280
but sometimes when people step in to

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,880
help

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,360
they don't realize that they're actually

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,120
stepping up into leadership roles

00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,000
these roles aren't defined as leadership

00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,160
roles there's no training for leadership

00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,040
in general but specifically an open

00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,120
source

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,600
and they don't realize that when they

00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,240
start in these roles

00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,919
their way of working sets the tone for

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,560
how others work so if they are not

00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,520
having

00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,720
positive productive interactions others

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,919
probably aren't either

00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,919
because that's just what they're

00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,199
modeling and

00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,080
you know these newcomers they're

00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:14,479
watching they're seeing all of this

00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,360
and so it is just really unfortunate and

00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:18,000
a shame

00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,160
that this is just a challenge in open

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,919
source but in so many aspects of life

00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,680
and this is why i like to give this talk

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,360
on leadership just so i can shine a

00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,880
light on this area we could all be a

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:31,120
little more self-aware

00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,120
about leadership and open source

00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:37,680
so let's dive into leadership

00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:40,800
and start to unpack a little bit

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:44,560
by asking who were the leaders

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:48,080
in this story the forum moderator

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:50,000
it's definitely a leader has a lot of

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,120
influence of what's happening in that

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,919
forum

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,840
and how people are interacting and the

00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:59,199
person managing the issue cues

00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,000
is also a leader they are not only

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:04,000
deciding

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,919
how what's going in to the code base but

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,240
how the interactions are happening in

00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:12,560
that arena as well

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:15,680
um the mentor is a leader

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:18,240
offering a whole new way of helping

00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,280
the project taking someone's hand

00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,720
helping them with their first time

00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:24,240
contribution

00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,919
and the contributor is also a leader

00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,160
which might be surprising

00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,440
because it's an individual but i'm going

00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,840
to kind of get into how

00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:34,800
and why that contributor is considered a

00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:38,240
leader

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:40,800
so what is leadership

00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,440
well there's actually no one definition

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,319
this one

00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:46,479
happens to be one i like the most by

00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,360
kevin cruz a leadership expert and it

00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,840
says

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,880
leadership is a process of social

00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,440
influence

00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,520
which maximizes the efforts of others

00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:58,400
towards the achievement of a goal

00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,880
so you see it's about influencing others

00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,319
and

00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,400
it's about getting people to come

00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:06,319
together to achieve something

00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,120
together and sometimes it's easy to

00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,440
describe

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,319
what something is by explaining what it

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,240
is not

00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:18,000
so leadership is not a title or a role

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:21,120
it is not about uh having been a ceo

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,120
or a manager at a company or a project

00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,840
lead in open source

00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,599
it doesn't require an actual title

00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:31,520
anyone can lead from

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:34,639
any role and it's not a personality type

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:36,639
some people think oh i'm not extroverted

00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,800
enough and gregarious enough

00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,639
to be a leader and that's not true many

00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,280
leaders and many good leaders are also

00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,280
introverts

00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:50,160
and leadership is not management

00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,720
management is making sure budgets are

00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,319
spent on

00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,879
on time and people are following

00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:57,599
processes and procedures correctly

00:07:54,879 --> 00:08:00,080
that is not what leadership is about and

00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:03,759
leadership is absolutely

00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:07,599
not about power or authority

00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:10,879
it is about influence and getting people

00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:14,240
inspired to want to move towards a goal

00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,240
and a vision that you have

00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:22,720
there are also three types of leadership

00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,879
there's leading organizations so

00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,960
in a company that leadership role might

00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:29,919
be the ceo

00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,720
in a project it could be a project lead

00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,760
and then there's

00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:36,959
leading others and this

00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:39,680
might be the form moderator or

00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:41,120
someone in charge of the mentor program

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,800
could be

00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:48,399
a director at a company and then

00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:51,519
there is leading yourself

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:53,920
and this is about managing yourself

00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,600
um through any kind of challenge any

00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,080
kind of interaction

00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,760
so that you get a desired outcome when

00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,560
you're working with others

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,720
and this is what the contributor and the

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,880
story was doing was leaving themselves

00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,959
they took an entire year

00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,880
trying to figure this out they were very

00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:14,000
overwhelmed and intimidated

00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:16,560
but then they kind of did a self-check

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,440
they signed in a new strategy and then

00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,519
they found

00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:25,120
someone to reach out to that could help

00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:28,800
and that that shift

00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,720
is that person leading themselves to

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,959
finally figure out a new way to make a

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:36,320
contribution

00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:36,880
and i'm going to focus on leading

00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,560
yourself

00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:42,959
because you can't lead others

00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,320
until you learn how to lead yourself it

00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,200
is so important

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,320
and that's because the more

00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,959
responsibilities you take on

00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,519
leading others leading organizations the

00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,560
more

00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:56,800
stress you're going to take on

00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,320
and you have to know how to really stay

00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,720
centered and calm

00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,760
and navigate through that so that people

00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:06,399
can follow you

00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,399
through it and achieve something

00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,720
and so i'm going to focus on

00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:13,519
self-leadership for this

00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,360
talk and it's also important because

00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,360
open source is about all of us as

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,320
individuals coming together

00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,120
we all have to learn self-leadership so

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,600
that we

00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:27,760
have the best interactions the

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,760
healthiest project we possibly can have

00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:36,800
so whether you're a ceo a project lead

00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:41,200
or an individual contributor

00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,200
what do leaders do well

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,240
they shape a vision so the contributor's

00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,600
vision was i'm going to make a

00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,440
contribution

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,360
it doesn't always have to be grandiose

00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,920
but you have to have a vision

00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,040
and then you need to have a strategy to

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,560
achieve that

00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,320
so how are you going to do that well

00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,760
waiting a year clearly didn't work for

00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,000
this person they had to come up with a

00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,720
new

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,200
strategy which was asking for help and

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,000
then

00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,120
you need to get people on board to help

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,800
achieve that vision

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,800
and that's exactly what that individual

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,959
contributor did he reached out to that

00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,320
mentor and said i really want this will

00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:17,680
you help me

00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:20,720
right and of course that person did

00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:24,800
joined the team and took time to

00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:27,120
make it happen and a leader focuses on

00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,399
measurable results not random acts of

00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,920
activity

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:33,279
focus goals measurable results

00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,360
for this contributor was one

00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:37,040
contribution not hard

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,920
of course over time became 400

00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:43,120
contributions with success

00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,160
and a leader fosters innovation and

00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,519
learning

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:50,800
so when they foster innovation they are

00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:52,240
using that learning mindset to

00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,079
you know take everything that they've

00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,959
learned from their successes and their

00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,839
failures

00:11:54,959 --> 00:12:00,000
and apply it to moving things forward

00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,680
thinking about new ideas

00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,680
looking for new ideas looking for

00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,160
diverse perspectives

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,440
that's what a leader does and of course

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,200
as they're doing all of this they're

00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,399
leading themselves and managing their

00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,240
emotions

00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,560
in order to get that outcome that they

00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,560
want

00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:20,399
and you need skills certain skills to be

00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,480
a leader

00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,440
and from harvard business review

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,399
research

00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,519
they identified these skills that are

00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,760
key

00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,120
for good leadership as you can see

00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,160
there's

00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:36,320
you know uh inspire and motivate they

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:39,440
have integrity and honesty

00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:41,519
they have drive they communicate

00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,720
they have good collaboration to build

00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,360
teamwork

00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,320
good relationships it goes on and on and

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,120
on and what

00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,639
you see here is that it is not about

00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,880
technical skills

00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:56,240
it's not about how great they know

00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:59,920
computer science or how to

00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:04,240
build something it is about

00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:07,040
interpersonal skills core skills

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,320
and these are really important to have

00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,920
if you want to lead

00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,920
including leading yourself

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,040
and so this might be a little bit

00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,720
surprising but leadership is actually

00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,079
two-thirds of leadership depends on

00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,240
emotional intelligence

00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,360
that is at the core of these leadership

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,440
skills

00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,040
and unfortunately this is not an area we

00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:31,279
get a lot of training

00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:33,279
uh you know in the us we joke that

00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,560
the last time we were taught emotional

00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:37,839
intelligence

00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:39,680
was in kindergarten at the start of our

00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,320
education where we're just taught to use

00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,320
our words

00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,839
don't punch don't punch other kids but

00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,639
use your words

00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:48,240
and you know there's just not a lot of

00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:51,360
systemic training

00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:53,600
in emotional intelligence

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,360
and unfortunately well actually let me

00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,279
just dive in and say that

00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,880
in case you don't know what it is

00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:02,720
emotional intelligence

00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:05,760
is simply recognizing understanding

00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:08,639
being able to manage your own emotions

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,680
so having control self-awareness

00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,800
self-regulation

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:16,160
control over your emotions

00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,600
especially when things are coming at you

00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,760
maybe certain emails that are

00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,320
frustrating you and you know and then

00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,839
it's

00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:26,480
deciding how you interact with others

00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,680
so recognizing understanding and

00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,560
influencing

00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:32,160
the emotions of others and how to tap in

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,920
so that you can

00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,800
work with that person and get a really

00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,800
positive outcome

00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,600
and unfortunately as a species we're

00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,639
just really bad at this

00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:48,160
um so dan goleman who wrote the book on

00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:50,320
emotional intelligence says only 36

00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,160
of people are able to accurately

00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:55,040
identify their own emotions

00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,240
as they happen and let's face it in open

00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,399
source things are happening

00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,880
all the time whether it's in github or

00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,279
twitter uh the issue queues wherever you

00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,880
are

00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,320
there's all there's just back and forth

00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:08,240
happening all the time

00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:11,279
and uh you know we are not always

00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,320
very aware of how we're feeling how

00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,399
others are feeling

00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,480
and being really strategic with our

00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:19,279
interactions with people

00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,680
uh that's just how we're wired

00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:25,360
unfortunately as humans

00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:28,880
but there is good news you can

00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:31,440
improve emotional intelligence

00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,480
and neuroscience found that emotional

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,000
intelligence

00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,759
can actually be improved with

00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,120
mindfulness

00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:43,199
and this is the act of settling the mind

00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:46,720
and being aware of the present moment

00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:50,399
you can achieve this through meditation

00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,360
journaling one person even gave me a tip

00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,720
that you should

00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,680
have a hot cup of tea we really need to

00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,240
slow down

00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,800
and that's because when something's so

00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,880
hot

00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,000
you have to slow down or you're going to

00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,079
burn yourself

00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,839
or you're going to burn your lips so

00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:08,320
just sit there with your cup of tea

00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:12,000
watch the steam slowly drink it and just

00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:15,040
be really mindful of that experience

00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:18,240
now personally when i heard this

00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:21,199
i thought no this is not for me i

00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,880
am not going to start doing this i

00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,000
really just want to work hard at being a

00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,399
better leader

00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,240
just give me the ten point plan and i'm

00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:32,399
going to do that

00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:35,519
but i did try this and i started to see

00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:37,519
some differences and i also um

00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,959
started to try this because google was

00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,720
saying yes this is

00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:42,320
actually true mindfulness helps with

00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,920
emotional intelligence

00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,440
they had started a program called search

00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,639
inside yourself

00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:51,040
which um really like leans into this

00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:53,120
neuroscience leans into mindfulness

00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,560
and it's a program that they're trying

00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,959
to give to

00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,399
googlers so become better leaders and

00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,839
they're sharing it with the world so

00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,120
definitely check out search inside

00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,120
yourself

00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,360
and they've also put meditation rooms in

00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:08,880
all of our buildings when we can someday

00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:11,600
go into a building but

00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,439
i took advantage of these different

00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:17,520
programs through google

00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:22,160
and i felt that i was

00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:25,199
doing better with my thinking

00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,240
my interacting with people and it's kind

00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,319
of hard to explain

00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,400
exactly why i did feel like i had more

00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:34,000
resilience

00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:37,360
i had more time to sit on my brain and

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:40,320
um have better thought process

00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,280
and um you know i really think tara

00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,679
brock

00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,720
a buddhist-based psychologist explains

00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,240
it

00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:51,280
the best and she says between

00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:55,360
stimulus and response

00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:57,440
there is a space and in that space

00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,360
is the opportunity to choose our

00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:02,080
response

00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:04,559
in our response lies our growth and our

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,559
freedom

00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:10,320
and that space is so important that

00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,760
space between stimulus and response and

00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,919
that space

00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,280
happens when you pause and it's

00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:16,720
mindfulness that

00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,120
gives you that resilience and that

00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,080
ability to pause when something happens

00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,320
to you

00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,520
whether it's an email that's upset you

00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,520
or just

00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,960
i don't know and someone told you that

00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:30,160
they didn't like

00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:33,600
what you submitted right

00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:36,160
and mindfulness gives you the chance to

00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,360
preserve that space so that you can be

00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,000
more strategic

00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:42,960
and how you respond so that you're not

00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:46,000
just reacting all the time

00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:48,240
and so i highly recommend that you

00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,320
check out some form of a mindfulness

00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:54,559
practice even if it's just

00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,559
slowly sipping a cup of tea every day

00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,840
and

00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:05,039
you know in open source we really need

00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,919
to work on our leadership our emotional

00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,720
intelligence

00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:10,000
and we need to build it with mindfulness

00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,960
and that's because

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,400
open source requires us to work online

00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,280
together

00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,559
and just that environment puts us at a

00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:22,080
disadvantage

00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:25,600
because our brains just have a really

00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:29,039
hard time with positive interactions

00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:31,440
when we're working online uh

00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:32,080
so when we collaborate in tools like

00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,200
github

00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:37,360
and slack and twitter we experience

00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,960
something called the online

00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,960
disinhibition effect

00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,559
there's a couple things that happen two

00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,600
main ones are that

00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:50,799
we lack eye contact

00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,600
see our brains are wired to read body

00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:55,360
language

00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:56,720
so we can pick up on cues and adjust our

00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,679
response

00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,960
accordingly and when there's no eye

00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:04,640
contact

00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:06,960
we can't do that and actually we reduce

00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:09,520
our ability to have empathy for the

00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,360
other person

00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,520
and someone might say well just use

00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,480
emojis well guess what that does not

00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,240
help our brains

00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,080
it actually doesn't bridge the gap we

00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:21,200
still need

00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:24,240
to meet that need to see people's

00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:26,720
body language so

00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,000
we have less empathy when we interact

00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,039
online

00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,840
and the other thing that happens is how

00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:33,679
we

00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,880
project a voice onto someone's

00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:38,159
communication

00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,360
we all do it and unfortunately when an

00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,520
email comes in

00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,720
or reading twitter or whatever it might

00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,919
be

00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:48,320
we are assigning a net more

00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,360
negative voice then what the person

00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:53,039
intended

00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:54,720
research shows almost always

00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:56,960
so when we're working in these online

00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,919
environments because the way our brain's

00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,799
wired

00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:01,760
we aren't as empathetic as we are in

00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:04,799
person

00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:06,480
and we assume the worst of what how

00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:10,240
they're communicating with us

00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,240
that really puts us at a disadvantage

00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:16,080
and that is why we all need to be as

00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,600
mindful as possible about our

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,679
interactions

00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,280
and we need emotional like strong

00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:24,159
emotional intelligence

00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,840
to help lead ourselves through our work

00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,200
in open source online

00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,360
it doesn't have to be open source now

00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:32,159
we're all working from home so it's

00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:34,960
you know just really for everyone that's

00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:37,440
in this virtual world

00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,840
mindfulness definitely is a practice to

00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:42,480
help strengthen in this area

00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:45,520
but that's not going to be enough it's

00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,799
good to also have strategies

00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,880
that can help you with online

00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:51,760
communication

00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,080
so here are just a few pro tips on how

00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,039
to

00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:57,520
reset when some things upset you so that

00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:59,600
you respond in a productive way

00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,200
rather than react and just make things

00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:05,039
worse

00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:08,000
so let's imagine you get this email

00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:09,679
and it's just really upset you you got a

00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,159
couple things you can do

00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:13,039
first be self-aware that you're having

00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:16,400
an emotion

00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:19,039
you're allowed to have an emotion

00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:21,600
you just don't want to react on it so

00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:23,039
one option is count to ten

00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,640
there's lots of science behind just

00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,520
counting to ten and giving yourself a

00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,760
chance

00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,679
for things to settle in your brain calm

00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,200
down maybe get that cortisol level to go

00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:34,799
down

00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:38,799
and you can start doing breathing

00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:39,679
um lots of breathing techniques out

00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:42,159
there that i

00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:43,360
recommend you look into but the act of

00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:45,760
breathing also

00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,760
helps regulate the brain and slows it

00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:50,480
down

00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,679
again you can sip hot tea can't really

00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,880
do anything if you're about to burn

00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:55,679
yourself

00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:57,440
and if it's really bad just take a walk

00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,960
just know when it's so bad just take a

00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,240
walk

00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:05,360
because it's not worth you know

00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:08,000
just fighting back you really want to be

00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:09,919
in the right place so you can respond in

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,120
a helpful way

00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:15,520
and then there are ways

00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,960
to respond that are more productive than

00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:20,320
others

00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:23,280
one is using the yes and technique

00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:25,200
and this comes from improv so perhaps

00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,679
someone has an idea

00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,240
and um yeah it's a good idea it's a bad

00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:32,159
idea

00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:34,240
instead of saying no i don't like that

00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:35,200
which really just puts the person on the

00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,320
defensive

00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:41,840
and is hard to build from

00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:46,080
um destroys trust in a communication use

00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:48,799
yes and yes that's a good idea and

00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:51,039
what about this that way you're building

00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:53,919
off of each other's ideas

00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:54,960
another approach is a design approach

00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:57,360
using i like

00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,400
i wish i wonder so maybe someone sent

00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,440
you a proposal

00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:04,480
and you can say i like this part of it

00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,960
i wish it had also covered another area

00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,000
and i

00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,440
wonder if you could talk to so and so to

00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,720
get a little bit more

00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:15,520
of this added into your proposal

00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,679
this way again you're building off of

00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,600
something and being positive and saying

00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:23,279
yeah there's a gap and i think there's a

00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,279
path forward for you to address it

00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:28,960
i also really encourage everyone to

00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,960
look into non-violent communication

00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,799
strategies and this is a whole talk in

00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,200
itself but there's just

00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:36,240
ways in which we can communicate where

00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,760
language

00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:42,080
is helpful some language is unhelpful

00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:44,480
learn what is helpful so check out

00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:46,960
non-violent communication

00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,600
i also really encourage in communication

00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,960
that you use

00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,960
active listening skills

00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:57,679
i use this a lot and it's simply

00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:00,159
somebody says something to you and you

00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:02,559
repeat back what you heard

00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:04,000
that way you can make sure you are all

00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:07,120
on the same page

00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,840
before you take the conversation to the

00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:11,840
next step

00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:14,240
so well sally i what i'm hearing you say

00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,600
is you would like to achieve this this

00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,679
and this is that correct

00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,279
okay great now that we're aligned here's

00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,600
what i recommend

00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:22,640
so active listening skills is just a

00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,200
really great way to

00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:27,679
check in before you jump off into a

00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:30,000
bigger conversation

00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:31,039
and then lastly because of the way our

00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,559
brains are wired

00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:34,960
if you're starting to see communication

00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:36,480
get tense just stop with online

00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,559
communication

00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,919
know when it's time to get on a video

00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:41,840
and make sure

00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,279
you're using the video i think we've all

00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,919
learned this year with covid

00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:46,960
the video makes a huge difference you

00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,440
really need to see the

00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:52,240
everyone's body language it helps your

00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,240
brain a lot

00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:57,279
so these are just some pro tips and

00:25:54,320 --> 00:26:00,000
they're for everyone

00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:01,600
and support um helping you learn how to

00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,760
lead yourself

00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,039
so that you have the best interaction

00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:07,200
possible

00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:08,799
at work in your open source project

00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,159
wherever you are

00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:13,200
but what about people of

00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:16,559
underrepresented groups

00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:18,320
you know there's just more to consider

00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:20,400
to help people from underrepresented

00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,840
groups learn how to lead and get into

00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,799
leadership roles

00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:25,760
and actually all of you play an

00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:29,200
important role

00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:29,200
in helping to make that happen

00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:33,600
you see it's not a surprise that people

00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:36,960
of underrepresented groups

00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:39,919
like women are well just

00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,320
very underrepresented as shown here in

00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,360
this

00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:46,559
2020 stack overflow survey only 80

00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:50,240
of women who were engaging in the survey

00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:52,640
identified as women and this is not okay

00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,480
and it's actually i think that's lower

00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:58,159
in this form than

00:26:54,480 --> 00:27:00,799
other tech stats that i've seen

00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:01,919
and we need to improve community

00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:03,760
diversity

00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,960
not only because it's the right thing to

00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:08,880
do

00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:13,679
but many perspectives simply create

00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:15,840
better solutions it's very pragmatic

00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:19,039
and you want better representation

00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:21,360
throughout your project

00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:22,320
and not just in the areas of code

00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,720
contribution

00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:27,360
or event planning but in leadership

00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,360
roles too

00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:32,240
and the main way to create a diverse

00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,919
community

00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:38,320
with diverse leaders is to understand

00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:39,760
the challenges and the blockers why

00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:42,080
isn't this happening

00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,120
because once you can understand this you

00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:47,600
can start building

00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:50,960
real solutions so for example

00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:52,880
women have certain headwinds that just

00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:56,480
hold them back

00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:58,720
and they're based on societal challenges

00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,640
this you know we may not be able to

00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:03,600
solve these societal challenges

00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:05,440
within our project but we can certainly

00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,200
understand them so we can find out how

00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:11,360
to bridge those gaps

00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:14,399
so here are eight of these headwinds

00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:17,279
one is women they simply just don't have

00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:18,320
as much time as others because they are

00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:21,760
balancing

00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:25,279
work and life they take on more

00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:27,600
um of the parental responsibilities

00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:29,600
so they're taking care of kids and we

00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,840
all know what happened during kovid

00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:33,600
this really impacted families and you

00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,399
started to see the systemic challenge

00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,640
there

00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:38,320
and if they're in addition to watching

00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:41,919
kids they might be doing elder care

00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,919
taking care of grandparents

00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:48,080
there's also just bias professional bias

00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:50,240
people think that women just aren't

00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:54,720
quite as capable

00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:58,000
um we have to prove ourselves a lot more

00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,520
there's actual um good women ceo

00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,279
research from harvard business review

00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:04,240
that says that it takes a woman

00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:05,600
four years longer than men to get into

00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,799
the ceo role

00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,240
and that's because they have to go

00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:10,559
through so many more steps to prove

00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:13,840
themselves

00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:16,240
also there's just less opportunity maybe

00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:19,039
it's because we don't have time

00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,159
to capture the opportunities out there

00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:22,320
or people just

00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:25,679
kind of didn't think about our training

00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:30,080
or mentoring us or giving stretch goals

00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:34,000
and so we have less opportunity

00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:36,960
and there's also this unfortunate

00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,799
thing that happens called a glass cliff

00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:41,120
the glass clip is when women are

00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:43,279
actually given a leadership role but it

00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:46,880
is for something that is doomed to

00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:48,880
fail projects just gonna go sideways

00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,799
and they often give those opportunities

00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,440
to women or people of underrepresented

00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:53,200
groups

00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,440
and they often take it because they

00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,240
think they have to save something it's

00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,240
like that

00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:00,640
nurturing nature kicks in and they have

00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,919
to save it they don't realize always

00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,840
that

00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:09,600
not taking an opportunity is an option

00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:13,120
and what happens is they

00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:15,760
uh often fail or the

00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:17,039
saving the project saving the situation

00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,559
comes at such a cost

00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:20,720
they're so tired and burnt out they

00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:22,960
can't really move forward

00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,480
um these are horrible outcomes

00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:28,159
especially for women

00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:30,080
women don't get the same fail forward

00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,279
opportunities right we don't get to fail

00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:35,200
forward

00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:37,039
that is not common in a woman's career

00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,200
and so then they just get less

00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:42,240
opportunities after that situation

00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,600
the glass cliff is worse than the glass

00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:47,360
ceiling

00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:49,919
so just keep an eye out for that and

00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,640
women tend to have more imposter

00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:52,640
syndrome

00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,159
people of underrepresented groups have

00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,159
more imposter syndrome

00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:58,480
second guessing themselves when a woman

00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:59,840
goes to apply for a job

00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,320
they think they have to be a hundred

00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:05,760
percent qualified for that job

00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:08,240
men they'll apply if they meet 60

00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,519
of the qualifications no problems which

00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,760
is great

00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:13,919
and uh but we're holding ourselves back

00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:16,799
because of that imposter syndrome

00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:18,240
we also don't self-promote very well

00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:20,640
we're taught

00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:23,039
to respect the team it's the team effort

00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:25,760
we really value these relationships

00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:26,720
and also we just don't want to come off

00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,720
as

00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,080
you know bragging how would people

00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,919
perceive us

00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,440
that's another issue is just how are

00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:34,720
people going to react if we act too

00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,480
ambitious

00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,760
um and so we kind of shut down we don't

00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:40,559
do it

00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:41,519
and we also just we don't dream big

00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:44,799
enough

00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:46,480
and a lot of times because we don't see

00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:48,720
women or people of underrepresented

00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:50,399
groups in bigger roles

00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:53,200
or we haven't seen all the opportunities

00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:56,000
we could have

00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,640
and so we hold ourselves back just

00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,120
because we

00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:01,760
we didn't even think that we could be

00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:03,600
something more than what we are

00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,039
so sally these are some headwinds

00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,080
they're not even all of them but just

00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:08,399
this is what you're

00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:10,480
dealing with in your project this is

00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:14,000
what a lot of the reasons why we don't

00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:17,200
have more representation

00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:19,440
and it's not okay right because there

00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:22,000
are actual solutions that i've seen them

00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,760
and they are so practical that i know

00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,640
that all of our projects

00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:29,200
if they are intentional can put them

00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:32,000
into pla into practice

00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,799
so the good news is i've seen this i've

00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,440
seen this

00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:36,559
very much in drupal where i worked for

00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,080
eight years

00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:40,000
and so i want to share some of these

00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:43,519
tips i've also learned a lot through

00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,279
research that i want to share as well

00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:46,640
so the first thing is you need to create

00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:50,480
psychological safety

00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:53,600
in your project and so when a newcomer

00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:56,000
is watching how a project interacts you

00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,679
need to have healthy interactions

00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,039
there is a reason i started with

00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:02,080
explaining what leadership is

00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:03,600
in self-leadership and how to have

00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:06,240
better emotional intelligence

00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:08,080
there's a reason i started with these

00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,120
strategies of how to have good

00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,679
interactions

00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,559
because people of underrepresented

00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:15,279
groups

00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:15,679
need to see this this is how you attract

00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:18,880
us

00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:21,919
we need to feel welcome and safe

00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:24,000
and actually women are more likely to

00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:25,519
encounter language or content that makes

00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,679
us feel unwelcome

00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:28,720
we're much more apt to bounce if we see

00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:30,559
something that's like yeah

00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,840
no i don't have time for this i don't

00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:35,120
feel safe here

00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:37,120
so i really encourage you all

00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:38,480
to play an active role and be very

00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:41,760
self-aware and mindful of your

00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,760
interactions in your project

00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:46,559
i also encourage you to do what drupal

00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:48,799
and other projects like go have done

00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:50,159
which is set values what do you stand

00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:51,840
for

00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:54,559
what kind of behaviors do you want your

00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:57,279
community to embrace

00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:59,039
and how does your community value

00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:03,039
diversity

00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:06,480
and how do you live that value

00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:08,800
this really sets the tone and helps you

00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,639
really think about gives you a lens as

00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,359
you kind of assess your community and

00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:14,079
how are you

00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:16,240
doing living those values and then

00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:18,480
finally you need a code of conduct

00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:20,079
and most projects have a code of conduct

00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,639
this conference has a code of conduct

00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:25,679
this isn't new

00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:26,079
but what i really strongly encourage is

00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,679
that

00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:29,200
you don't just have a code of conduct

00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:32,960
you immediately

00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:35,760
launch an enforcement policy

00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,639
so that people know what happens if you

00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,599
don't

00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:40,560
have appropriate behavior and what's the

00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:43,679
process

00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:45,919
that you're going to use so that

00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:47,040
no one is flat-footed when something

00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:49,359
goes wrong

00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:51,520
and no one is surprised in the community

00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:54,399
that a process took place

00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:56,240
and it is important to train the people

00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:59,280
who are going to have to

00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:01,359
enforce your code of conduct

00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,800
so that they are properly supported and

00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:05,839
know how to navigate this

00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:08,960
it takes a lot of core skills

00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:12,000
to manage a community so you need to

00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,000
really invest here

00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,640
and it's important to bridge the gaps of

00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:18,720
these headwinds

00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:20,960
and again i want to share some things

00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,920
that i saw in the drupal community that

00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,960
i think worked

00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:28,400
really well i highly encourage projects

00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:29,839
to um you know apply these

00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,440
there's more there's definitely more

00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:34,560
than these three

00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:37,440
but the first one is setting up a

00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:38,720
first-time contributor mentor program so

00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,920
again women or people of

00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,960
under-represented groups

00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:44,880
are less apt to just lean into

00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,760
you know the abyss of open source

00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:50,800
strangers and try to get started

00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:52,720
so be systematic about it start a

00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,079
first-time contributor mentor program

00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:57,440
make it easy

00:35:54,079 --> 00:36:00,320
for us to find and that way we have a

00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:03,520
smoother on-ramp that's designed really

00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:05,119
to meet us where we're at and then the

00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:07,839
next one is create easy

00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:10,839
networking opportunities people of

00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:13,599
underrepresented groups

00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:15,040
women they don't have the time to

00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:18,160
network

00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:20,400
they are less comfortable networking men

00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:21,359
tend to have more organic networking

00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:25,040
opportunities

00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:28,720
and networking opens you up to mentors

00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:32,400
and new ideas new areas to contribute

00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:35,359
peer support networking is so important

00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:37,839
to help you stay engaged in a project

00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:41,040
and so you want to make it really easy

00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:42,640
for women people of underrepresented

00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:45,680
groups to be able to network

00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:47,760
and drupal really does this well um for

00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:49,280
example at their conferences especially

00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:52,880
when we could meet in person

00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:55,599
they would have first time um attending

00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,920
networking events and newcomers could

00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:58,960
meet

00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:00,960
veterans leaders and they had a nice fun

00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:04,320
social way of doing this

00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:06,400
they had um women in drupal which was a

00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:10,400
social event during the week

00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:12,960
that allowed um really pure networking

00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,839
and lots of other kinds of networking

00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,000
events

00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:17,760
so it's you know we don't have to rely

00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,599
on that organic

00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,960
using our own free time to figure out

00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:23,680
who we should know in this

00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,720
giant global community really makes a

00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:28,000
difference

00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:30,240
and then also be intentional

00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,560
about creating diversity within your

00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:34,320
leadership team

00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,680
simply put this means look at your

00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:38,560
technical committees

00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:39,359
look at your foundation board seats look

00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:42,480
everywhere

00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:43,920
and what is your gender balance are you

00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:46,720
happy with it

00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:48,720
you want to be really intentional and

00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:51,119
start

00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:53,839
identifying how you can get people of

00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:56,960
underrepresented groups in these roles

00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:59,359
um which is a whole you know asking them

00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,640
and and grooming them and training them

00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:01,359
these are all things that are very

00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:03,119
important

00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:05,520
but at least starts aiming for some

00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:08,960
goals uh the drupal association

00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:11,040
board aims for a minimum of 30 percent

00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:13,119
women on the board and they're achieving

00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:15,359
it and i'm seeing it in other places

00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:17,280
i'm on the open source initiative board

00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:19,280
and we have more

00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:21,280
gender balance there as well and i'm i'm

00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,200
so happy to see this in other places

00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:25,680
but you have to be intentional and make

00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,680
it a goal

00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:32,000
but you can't simply invite

00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,520
a woman or a person of an

00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,359
underrepresented group

00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:37,359
into a leadership role i just think it's

00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:39,359
going to work because it's not

00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:40,640
they're going to have a very different

00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:44,720
experience

00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:46,480
research shows and experience shows

00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:48,000
that these people when they are in

00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:50,880
leadership roles get more

00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,920
pushback more pushback on the info on

00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:55,920
the authority

00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:57,920
and scope that they were given and when

00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,760
women people of under-represented groups

00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:02,800
start to feel this pushback

00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:04,720
they don't lean in and fight in the same

00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:07,440
ways as other groups do

00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:08,160
but they tend to go into a back channel

00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,920
and

00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,200
kind of work it out there with their

00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,680
peers

00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:15,200
and that's fine that feels safe that is

00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,480
not great for the project

00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,839
that does not create a shared

00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,480
understanding of what's happening it

00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:22,480
does not create a shared solution

00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:24,320
and i don't blame them i mean i have

00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:26,720
also found myself sometimes going that

00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:29,040
way instead of leaning in

00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:30,079
because it's exhausting and again we

00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:32,880
don't have the time

00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:33,760
or the comfort to deal with that and so

00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:37,680
it

00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:40,000
um is solvable and research shows

00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:41,119
in my experience has taught me that

00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,400
there are three

00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:47,680
key things that projects must do

00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:48,800
if they want diverse leadership

00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:51,280
one is they need to look at their

00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,400
governance and they need to make sure

00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,160
their governance

00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:56,720
includes these leadership roles that

00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:58,560
they're asking women to step into

00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:00,480
they need to make sure it's clear what

00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:02,400
the role scope is

00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:04,160
what that person's authority is how

00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:07,200
decisions are made

00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:08,240
and also how someone can appeal if they

00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:11,200
don't like a decision

00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:12,079
when is a decision final this kind of

00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,760
governance

00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:15,520
is so important because then when

00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:18,319
someone pushes back

00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:19,920
the the woman in this role the person

00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:20,560
from an underrepresented group in this

00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:24,000
role

00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:26,720
can say no no this is this is

00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,839
mine this is my call to make and it says

00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:31,280
so right here

00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:31,280
it gives air coverage

00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:35,119
and i have seen this in projects um

00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,960
several projects now

00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:39,040
and so i strongly encourage you to look

00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:41,680
at your governance

00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:43,520
then also leaders need to be allies

00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:45,920
other leaders

00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:47,680
you're going to see things in twitter

00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:51,280
and in forums

00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:54,640
within the community you need to step up

00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:56,800
and say no now none of us are getting

00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:59,359
stuck up in a tree somewhere

00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,800
as annie defranco says like you know we

00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:04,240
can take care of ourselves

00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:05,200
but we need allies and just by being

00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:08,240
intentional

00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:10,800
and speaking up pointing to

00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:12,079
that governance saying pointing to the

00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,640
values

00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:15,280
however you want to handle it we need

00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:18,319
you to speak

00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:21,040
up and get our backs and then

00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:22,400
lastly you need to invest in these

00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,640
leaders

00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,640
and

00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:29,440
i highly recommend you create cohort

00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:32,560
groups

00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:34,079
assign them to a coach an executive

00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:36,319
coach to be specific

00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:38,160
so that together they can start learning

00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:40,000
how to solve these problems

00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:41,440
and the coach is there to help them

00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,480
solve the problems too

00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:46,720
this is kind of a new concept but it is

00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:49,280
an open source but it is working very

00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:50,880
well in many other places

00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:53,119
so these are just a few ways to build

00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,480
diverse leaders and they're not hard to

00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:58,000
put into place

00:41:54,480 --> 00:42:01,200
you just have to commit to them

00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,720
so that's it that was a lot of content

00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:05,280
that we just covered

00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:07,200
so why don't we do a quick recap we can

00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:09,599
lead from any position

00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,960
you can't lead others until you can lead

00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:14,839
yourself

00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:16,480
and it requires strong emotional

00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:20,480
intelligence

00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:22,240
um you also need to think about ways to

00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:24,800
grow that emotional intelligence and you

00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:27,200
can use mindfulness to do that

00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:28,560
and there's lots of strategies that you

00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:31,599
can take advantage of

00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:33,839
so that you learn to reset

00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:35,280
when something's upset you and make sure

00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:37,520
you respond

00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:39,839
in a productive way versus just reacting

00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:43,599
and making the situation worse

00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:44,000
and that we don't just want leaders we

00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:46,720
want

00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:50,720
diversity of leaders and you have to be

00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:50,720
very intentional in how you do that

00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:55,119
so i want to thank you for going through

00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:57,760
this journey with me

00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:58,160
and for giving me your time today and if

00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:03,200
there

00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:06,400
is one thing to remember it is this

00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:08,960
newcomers women

00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:10,880
people of underrepresented groups they

00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,800
are watching your project

00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,920
and deciding if they want to invest

00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:17,920
their time

00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:21,040
with you and they have a lot to offer

00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:23,440
so you need to be mindful of how you

00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:25,839
are engaging with each other be mindful

00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:29,680
of how you feel when you're interacting

00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:29,680
choose to respond and not react

00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:33,280
because this is how you're going to get

00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:36,079
your next

00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:37,520
great contributor and your next great

00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:39,440
leader

00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:41,520
so i hope you choose to be the leader

00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:45,280
that we all need

00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:45,280
thank you so much for your time today

00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:50,160
thank you so much megan that was a great

00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:52,560
talk we had some comments in here and

00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:54,560
talking about how inspirational it was

00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:56,560
and i certainly learned a lot more

00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:59,359
strategies of how to

00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:01,200
react or respond rather than react to

00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:02,800
certain situations

00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:06,079
we have a few questions here so i'm

00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:08,720
going to go through them now

00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:09,680
the first one is uh from someone an

00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:12,079
anonymous one

00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:13,359
says thanks so much for your talk how do

00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:15,920
you usually promote

00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:16,960
and sell the value of diversity on all

00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,680
dimensions

00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:22,079
in the corporate world oftentimes i've

00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:24,560
seen a corporate commitment to diversity

00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:25,520
to the outside but not delivering

00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:28,160
anything

00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:28,800
uh diverse on the organization on the

00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:33,680
inside

00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:36,960
not in leadership nor in teams yeah

00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:38,400
uh yes there can be a bit of a gap

00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:40,640
between what people say and what people

00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,640
do

00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:48,240
and i am just going to be honest and say

00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:49,599
it starts at home it starts with you and

00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,319
actually all you can do is control

00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:53,520
yourself

00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:54,720
you can influence others and so as a

00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:58,000
manager

00:44:54,720 --> 00:45:01,119
i can control my outcome

00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:04,160
so it's not often that i have a

00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:06,240
free head count to fill but when i do

00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:08,079
i have a bunch of diverse candidates i

00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:10,400
have already identified that i would

00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:13,599
love to recruit and i've been nurturing

00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:14,720
that list of people and i seek them out

00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:18,000
in advance

00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:20,160
just build a network and that

00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,000
way when i get that pressure to fill a

00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,480
headcount before i lose it not that that

00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
happens

00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:26,480
often in google but it's happened in

00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:30,319
other places i

00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:31,920
can um move quickly

00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:35,280
talk to these candidates get them into

00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:37,680
the process i am very very intentional

00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:39,200
when it comes to hiring and so that is

00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:41,359
what i can do

00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:42,800
and then you know where do i have

00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:47,119
influence you know

00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:50,319
above me or with my peers um it's

00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:51,599
um calling them out letting them know

00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:54,160
i'm not okay

00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:56,000
if they don't have a diverse team and

00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:57,520
also giving them the resources letting

00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,079
them know i have a bench maybe it would

00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:03,119
help them teaching them how to do this

00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:05,200
right so it really does start at home

00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:07,839
in your own personal actions those are

00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:10,400
some that i take

00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:11,359
great answer um i have another question

00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:15,280
that's similar

00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:16,880
to um this topic and as this person says

00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:18,960
i can totally relate to how you

00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:21,839
described how women are treated

00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:22,720
and typecasted at work this has happened

00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:25,440
to me

00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:26,640
at the past work where i was unduly

00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:29,200
blamed for being

00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:30,240
a complainer as i was returning back

00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:32,400
from maternity

00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:33,359
and i was kicked out within first month

00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:36,240
of joining

00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:38,720
and also blacklisted in the company it

00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:41,040
is still a big trauma in my mind

00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:43,680
any suggestions on how i could have

00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:45,440
better dealt with that situation

00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:48,160
was i wrong to be worrying about my

00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:50,640
newborn kid

00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:52,400
oh first i just want to say i'm so sorry

00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,839
does that sound highly traumatic on so

00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:55,520
many levels

00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:58,319
also this happened during cova that's

00:46:55,520 --> 00:47:02,000
even like another layer of trauma

00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:03,920
so um uh you should never

00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,359
stop worrying about your kid family

00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,880
first

00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:08,400
uh and if you work somewhere that

00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:09,680
doesn't have a family first kind of

00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,440
concept or

00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:13,040
wanting to work with you as you're

00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:14,880
trying to balance everything you need to

00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:17,119
really think about where you're working

00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:18,240
just going to put it out there right now

00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:22,400
um i

00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:25,680
am fortunate um

00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:27,280
how many fronts for the kind of support

00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:28,800
that i've been getting and i'm happy to

00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:31,119
talk offline

00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:32,160
um about that because this is a bigger

00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:34,720
issue um

00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,720
there are

00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:39,839
there are strategies first i would say

00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:41,359
you may want to work with the trauma

00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:43,200
i'm a big fan of something called

00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:46,640
semantic experiencing

00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:48,240
it is learning how to heal trauma

00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:50,160
getting in touch with emotions it's used

00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,880
a lot in talk therapy but it is frankly

00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:54,000
better

00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:54,240
i think and it's being provided to a lot

00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,480
of

00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:58,640
leaders because it helps reset your

00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:01,920
nervous system faster

00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:03,359
so anyhow check out somatic experiencing

00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:06,319
the other thing i'd say in terms of

00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:06,720
strategies is it is okay to speak up and

00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:10,319
speak

00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:11,680
to power and that is hard but it is also

00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:12,960
important to do in a way that you're

00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,880
heard

00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:16,240
and i am not saying that you did

00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:19,040
anything wrong

00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:19,520
and i'm not even sure of your situation

00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:23,359
but

00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:26,720
there are um definitely approaches

00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:28,240
um one is getting others

00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:30,319
to if they're seeing this if it's a

00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:33,440
systemic issue coming forward

00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:36,240
in a group um or maybe it's just a

00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:37,599
change in your approach so it's more

00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:39,119
solution oriented

00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:40,720
or you know there's lots of different

00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:41,920
ways again your situation sounds

00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:43,760
incredibly hard

00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:45,200
and i'm so sorry you went through that

00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:46,400
um and i'm happy to talk with you

00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:48,720
offline

00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:50,640
you can see well don't tweet me i

00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:52,160
actually got off twitter sorry

00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:54,000
but i'll make sure we find a way to

00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:55,760
connect yes

00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,200
uh speaking of which if you would like

00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:59,200
to you can either direct

00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:00,880
message megan or also attend the

00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:03,599
breakout castle house room

00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:05,359
which she'll be in if you have any other

00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:05,760
further questions or would like to ask

00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:07,760
her

00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:09,440
outside of the scope of this little

00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:11,200
session right now

00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:12,880
i'm going to pivot slightly because i

00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:15,920
had a question while

00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:18,400
you were speaking and that was um you

00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:21,359
know since so much of open source is

00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:23,200
done online are there any kind of unique

00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:26,240
strategies that you've seen

00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:29,119
that helps kind of foster that human

00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:29,520
aspect of building a community so we can

00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:32,319
put

00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:33,680
you know pr templates and be very

00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:36,800
explicit about

00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:38,640
where they can get help uh or be very

00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:39,760
clear about how to contribute for the

00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:42,319
first time

00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:43,920
but are there alternative things like

00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:44,640
maybe weekly calls where you actually

00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:47,040
get to see

00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:48,720
people and talk to them or some other

00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:50,960
kind of thing like that that helps

00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:53,599
foster that human aspect when it comes

00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:57,200
to open source projects

00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:59,000
yeah absolutely um

00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:00,480
well i think you know you just bring up

00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,960
documentation and

00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:05,520
documentation actually really bridges

00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:08,880
gaps and helps projects be more diverse

00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:10,240
both in terms of making it easier to

00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:13,760
make that first contribution

00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:15,440
right um so you know just

00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:17,440
meeting people where they're at and

00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:19,520
giving explicit instructions of how to

00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:22,559
be part of this community

00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:23,839
what's expected of each other um

00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:27,440
these are really helpful tools

00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:28,880
documentation is incredibly important

00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:31,280
for starting to give people an

00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:32,240
understanding about a project and how to

00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:36,640
engage

00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:39,440
but in terms of human interactions

00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:40,160
um yeah i mean i think the more that you

00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:43,520
can do

00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:46,480
to connect at a human level

00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:48,319
um whether it's video and not always

00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:50,720
about the work if you can find ways to

00:50:48,319 --> 00:50:50,720
connect

00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:56,559
um you know maybe it's around an event

00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:57,920
um and the social activities that you

00:50:56,559 --> 00:50:59,680
bring into them

00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:01,040
so even for this kind of a conference

00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:03,440
it's online

00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:04,640
you can still connect with people and

00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:06,800
start building those

00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:07,760
relationships because at the end of the

00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:10,160
day teams

00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:12,559
really have three kinds of conversations

00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:14,559
they have relationship conversations

00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:16,720
they have conversations about the

00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:18,960
opportunities they can create together

00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:20,400
and then they have conversations about

00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:23,440
action

00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:25,200
and what research shows is that if you

00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:27,359
have a limited amount of time the place

00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:28,640
to focus most is on relationship

00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:30,800
building and getting to know each other

00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:35,040
as humans not work robots

00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:36,640
um because once you have this foundation

00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:38,319
the opportunities and the action

00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:40,559
conversations they just happen

00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:42,400
they will just start to flourish so

00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:45,760
anything that you can do

00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:48,640
to connect um and get to know each other

00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:50,079
even if it's like a heat check before

00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:51,520
you dive into the work

00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:54,720
and getting to know how someone's doing

00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:56,559
at a human level really goes a long way

00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:59,119
i can totally relate to that and that's

00:51:56,559 --> 00:52:00,800
a great answer i joined my company at

00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:01,599
the start of the pandemic so there are

00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:04,160
many

00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:05,040
co-workers i have not even met yet in

00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:08,319
person

00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:11,200
and so a really big part of

00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:13,280
helping the team connect is to do you

00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:14,480
know like a once a month kind of gaming

00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:16,240
session with each other

00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:17,839
or just doing something that's not

00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:19,839
related to work and i can

00:52:17,839 --> 00:52:21,599
totally attest that those are super fun

00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:22,960
and a great way to kind of learn more

00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:25,839
about your co-worker

00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:26,720
outside of the scope of work but i think

00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:33,839
that can apply

00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:33,839
to this scenario as well

00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:52,160
