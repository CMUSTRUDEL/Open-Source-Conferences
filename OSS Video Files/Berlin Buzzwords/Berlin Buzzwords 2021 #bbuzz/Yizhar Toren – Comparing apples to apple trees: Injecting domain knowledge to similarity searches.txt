Title: Yizhar Toren – Comparing apples to apple trees: Injecting domain knowledge to similarity searches
Publication date: 2021-06-24
Playlist: Berlin Buzzwords 2021 #bbuzz
Description: 
	Image & text similarity problems have plenty of textbook ML solutions. However in the wild, these solutions often fail. In this talk I'll present a use-case about inferring product similarity from multiple sources of data (images, text, etc) and discuss how we developed a practical & scalable approach using our understanding of domain knowledge.
