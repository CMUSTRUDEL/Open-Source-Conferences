Description: 
	Built and maintained by people like you, open source software powers the global economy. Sustainability of this ecosystem is pivotal to accelerate human progress; yet many organizations focus their community building efforts as a sales pipeline, or a program to deflect requests for support. 
In this talk I’d share tools to engage your communities in a positive, nurturing way; with a servants approach to building community and centered on creating advocacy, loyalty, and ultimately business value.
