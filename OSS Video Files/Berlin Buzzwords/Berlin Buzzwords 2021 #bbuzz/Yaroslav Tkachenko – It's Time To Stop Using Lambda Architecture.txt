Title: Yaroslav Tkachenko – It's Time To Stop Using Lambda Architecture
Publication date: 2021-07-01

Description: 
	Lambda Architecture has been a common way to build data pipelines for a long time, despite difficulties in maintaining two complex systems. An alternative, Kappa Architecture, was proposed in 2014, but many companies are still reluctant to switch to Kappa. And there is a reason for that: even though Kappa generally provides a simpler design and similar or lower latency, there are a lot of practical challenges in areas like exactly-once delivery, late-arriving data, historical backfill and reprocessing.

In this talk, I want to show how you can solve those challenges by embracing Apache Kafka as a foundation of your data pipeline and leveraging modern stream-processing frameworks like Apache Flink.
