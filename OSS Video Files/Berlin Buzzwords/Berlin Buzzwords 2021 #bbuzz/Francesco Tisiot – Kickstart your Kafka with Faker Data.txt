Title: Francesco Tisiot – Kickstart your Kafka with Faker Data
Publication date: 2021-06-24
Playlist: Berlin Buzzwords 2021 #bbuzz
Description: 
	We all love to play with the shiny toys, but an event stream with no events is a sorry sight. In this session you’ll see how to create your own streaming dataset for Apache Kafka using Python and the Faker library. You’ll learn how to create a random data producer and define the structure and rate of its message delivery. Randomly-generated data is often hilarious in its own right, and it adds just the right amount of fun to any Kafka and its integrations!
