Title: Amanda Brock – Commercial Models and Open Source: How Revenue Generation & Open Source Fit Together
Publication date: 2021-06-30
Playlist: Berlin Buzzwords 2021 #bbuzz
Description: 
	An overview of the commercialisation of open source and a review of the potential revenue models and their interface with open source, from the first study into this in 2008 to the recent shift by Elastic away from open source to the SSPL licence. Amanda is the editor of Open Source, Law, Policy and Practise with over 20 authors, to be published in September and as the author of the chapter on commercial models and open has spent some time researching this area. She has spent over 13 years working in and around open source software and its commercialisation.

	00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:12,719
what is

00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:14,160
open source software it's software

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,640
where the source code is freely

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,880
available and where it's distributed

00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,000
under an open source initiative or osi

00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,840
approved license

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,760
that complies with the open source

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,599
definition or osd

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,960
and that's something that i bet very few

00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,640
people listening today could actually

00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,880
recite to me

00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,399
it's also a licensing model a

00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,239
socio-political movement and a

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,559
development methodology

00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,480
and it's definitely absolutely the

00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:40,559
development methodology that's preferred

00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,800
by young developers today

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,879
it allows innovation and it runs our

00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,920
internet our clients our databases and

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,640
ai

00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,320
and according to titleist 2020 survey

00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,879
over 90 percent of stacks actually

00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,680
include open source software and over 70

00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:57,280
of them

00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:59,600
is open source as someone said to me

00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,480
when i was working on open uk's state of

00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,879
open report

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,600
phase one was published back in march

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,000
it's like

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,400
gravity it's all around us it's

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,479
everywhere there's no escaping it

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,320
marc andreessen of andreessen horowitz

00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:14,080
famously said that software is eating

00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,080
the world back in 2011

00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,360
and jim zemlin of the linux foundation

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,000
retorted

00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,360
with uh open source's eating software's

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
lunch

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,680
people see open source in the way that

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,680
they've experienced it

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,240
so if you've experienced it as a couple

00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,240
of people setting up a project

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,280
building a community building a company

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,280
on top of that

00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,759
maybe hiring the community along the way

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,240
maybe like a hashicorp or a mongodb

00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,079
that's how you think of it if you're an

00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,840
individual developer who scratched a

00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,840
niche created something like the linux

00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,159
kernel attracted over 15 000

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,240
contributors in the last 30 years

00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,200
created uh software that's changed

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,600
society

00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,719
that's how you view it if you've been

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,920
part of a company's

00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:59,439
non-differentiating non-permanent

00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,360
collaboration through something like

00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:03,200
openstack the linux foundation or

00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,320
eclipse or one of their projects

00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,399
that's how you view it

00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,399
whichever model you've experienced will

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:14,160
impact your view and open source

00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:16,239
and how it works open source today

00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,800
is part of technology and everything

00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:22,000
that it's trying to achieve

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:24,239
back in 2008 i joined canonical and that

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,440
was my experience my first experience of

00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,280
open source

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,560
and i joined as the head lawyer i was

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,800
general counsel

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,400
and i spent five years there working on

00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,160
the commercialization and business

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,160
models around open source

00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,720
i was a point of escalation and most of

00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,560
the deals

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,319
i want to think a little bit about that

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,360
right now of course

00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:47,280
in that five years things changed and it

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,120
changed dramatically where we moved from

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,000
a world where software was generally

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,360
distributed

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,239
and worked on prem to a world where

00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,159
most software was utilized in the cloud

00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,680
or the platform economy

00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,680
now i'm going to introduce you to open

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,879
source underdogs which is my favorite

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,120
podcast

00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,800
and let's start by seeing canonical's

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,280
founder mark shuttleworth

00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,959
and hearing what he has to say there's a

00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,440
real sort of double challenge

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,159
in starting a tech operation that is

00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,239
open source

00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,000
starting a tech operation is always hard

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,400
because you want to do something new and

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,080
that's

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,599
surprisingly difficult you genuinely

00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,599
have to do something different

00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,040
if you want to be successful you know

00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,920
from a technology point of view and most

00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,319
of the people

00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,239
who would have that kind of open source

00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,840
view there's there's a technology angle

00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,799
to it right there there's something new

00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,400
that they want to do

00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,680
and it's hard enough getting that right

00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,360
with open source you need to think about

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,360
the fact that you're enabling

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,959
your own competition it's the blunt

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,239
truth of it you're enabling people to

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,519
compete with you

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,840
with the benefit of all the things that

00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,720
you've done and that can be both

00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,440
financially

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,400
and emotionally very daunting but at the

00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,480
end of the day

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,879
i don't see any other model for software

00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,319
which is spreading as fast across all of

00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,319
the kind of categories

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:02,159
of software out there today if you're

00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,760
not going to be open source

00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,640
you're almost certainly going to be

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:09,920
niche now that may be satisfying

00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,920
for you but i doubt it

00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:15,760
what mark clearly sets out there is the

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,799
business consequence of open sourcing

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,199
your code

00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:20,160
and that's a combination of licensing

00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,759
and enabling

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,600
your competitors with your own

00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,199
innovation and that's the business pain

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,960
of using open source

00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,960
now i've seen lawyers who've suggested

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,560
that you can exclude that you can stop

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,759
others from using your code commercially

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,160
in open source

00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,000
and that's just simply not the case i

00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,520
often think that confusion comes from

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,840
creative commons which is designed for

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:42,479
documentation and which does allow that

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,280
there is a non-commercial usage license

00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,080
there

00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,600
and the reason open source cannot have

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,120
that exclusion

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,520
is the open source definition and

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,520
definition six which requires

00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,800
that there is no discrimination across

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,800
fields of endeavor

00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,240
you may not restrict the program from

00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,840
being used in business

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,919
now there's no restriction on making

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,840
money from open source

00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,840
and of course you can choose to exclude

00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,759
other people from using your social code

00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,199
but if you do that your code is

00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,440
proprietary and it's not

00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,120
open source and that fact is really

00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,039
rather binary

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,440
when i left canonical i worked for a

00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:20,000
while advising startups

00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,680
and they would come to me understandably

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,280
to talk about open source

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,280
and i came up with a little theory a

00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,320
very simple theory a very simple three

00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,479
questions

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,479
and that's the what-if theory what if

00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,000
someone else takes your code and uses it

00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,280
well most people are okay with that

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,800
that's kind of what they're expecting

00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,320
with open source

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,400
what if they take your code and they

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:41,759
make money from it

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:44,000
less keen what if they use your code and

00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,639
they make a lot of money from that

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,080
and you make nothing or very little or

00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,080
significantly less

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:53,120
and at that point i would often not hear

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,080
from them again commercializing open

00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,280
source

00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:59,120
requires balance it requires the balance

00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,919
between the the scale that can be

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,840
created

00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,520
and the adoption that comes from open

00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,800
source

00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,720
and you know you're developing code

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,280
that's not niche and that has to be

00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,759
balanced against the price of

00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:12,720
non-discrimination

00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,520
which must be allowed by all i repeat

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,400
that all

00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:19,039
open source licenses now at this point i

00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,960
could show you a variety of snippets of

00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:23,039
founders who've clearly not understood

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,039
that when they've open sourced the code

00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,560
but i don't really see any benefit in

00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:29,280
calling them out in that way

00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,039
instead let's focus on the advantages

00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,560
and the business models

00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,720
and i think we should go to shannon

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,600
williams founder of rancher co-founder

00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,319
of rancher

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,880
which was sold to suze for 600 million

00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,919
dollars

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:45,919
in 2020. it's at the root of our success

00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:48,160
so by open sourcing the code we enabled

00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:50,240
you know a startup with relatively you

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,080
know with no name recognition obviously

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,280
to come into in a lot of ways what's a

00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,360
very crowded market

00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,639
we made rancher fully open source and

00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,039
free because

00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,199
we felt that it was the best way to get

00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,639
adoption to plant seeds and

00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,919
organizations that would need this

00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,560
technology

00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:09,120
shannon's not alone in recognizing that

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,360
rapid adoption of open source

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,039
and i'd like now to go to james waters

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,160
co-founder of pivotal

00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:19,919
which was sold for 2.7 billion

00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:22,800
to vmware also in 2020. i really do

00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,919
enjoy working on open source projects

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,360
because

00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:29,840
they can have a breadth of impact

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,280
that's pretty unimaginable to something

00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,039
that you have to commit a sales

00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,840
transaction and for software before

00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,160
someone can use it

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,160
these are the kind of impacts that open

00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,319
source can have

00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:42,720
worldwide deep into developer

00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:45,280
developer impact that you could never do

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:48,720
with a you know closed source only

00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:50,720
enterprise sale only product i think

00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,319
just the unimaginable breadth that open

00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,000
source can get to you and the ubiquity

00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,400
that it can get to in the modern world

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,879
is

00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,520
is is stunning so that's humbling to

00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,360
work on

00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,599
i think the challenge then is like well

00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,280
how do you make sure that the largest

00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,960
you know 5 000 organizations in the

00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,960
world are contributing to that

00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,520
and that's where i do have a passion for

00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,960
enterprise monetization of open source

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,879
and finding ways of partnering with

00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,240
those organizations and packaging and

00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,680
pricing things

00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,080
such that they feel that there's good

00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,280
value in partnering with these open

00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,199
source companies

00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,199
and making them their most meaningful

00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:26,000
platform

00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:29,199
so that marketing and growth advantage

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,199
which is the developer's ability in 2021

00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,399
to go to github gitlab or any other

00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,959
public repo

00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,159
and to take open source code introduce

00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:38,880
it to their business

00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:41,519
and avoid a procurement process that's

00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,519
an ability to scale your code your

00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,880
your open source that proprietary just

00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,320
cannot compete with

00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,640
and it works really well in a

00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:52,240
developer-focused business model

00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:55,040
okay business models so back in 2008

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,560
matt asley under the auspices of 451

00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,480
created what's the

00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:01,360
probably if not definitely the first

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,440
report on open source business models

00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,440
and one of the key findings then was

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,480
that vendors must choose

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,800
complementary development licensing

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,320
and revenue strategies in order to

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,279
maximize revenue generation

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,120
opportunities

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,959
and he identified the bottom line and

00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,839
the bottom line was that open

00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:21,839
source is not a business model it's a

00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:24,160
development and distribution model that

00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:27,120
is enabled by a licensing tactic now

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,519
matt wrote that 13 years ago and some

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,760
things

00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,440
haven't changed much the list of revenue

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,480
generation models he gave isn't very

00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,560
different today

00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,080
and he started with support and we see

00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,240
support as one of the least popular

00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,080
models today because it's hard to scale

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,240
at the same time we see successful

00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,360
businesses like rancher and percona

00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,680
using that

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,680
another is subscription a little like

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,519
support often including support but with

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,640
other services bundled around it maybe

00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,920
indemnity

00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:56,320
maybe updates and that's red hat's model

00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,640
which we saw lead in 2019 to the biggest

00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,120
tech

00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:01,279
transaction in history red hat sale for

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,200
34 billion dollars

00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:05,600
now whether that is something that's

00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,440
replicable really remains to be seen

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,600
and i think you need to be close to the

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,279
key technology for it to work and in

00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,200
red hat's case they're very close to the

00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:15,120
linux kernel

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,640
we will see whether it's repeatable

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,640
because suse which

00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,120
uses the same model and which describes

00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,800
itself as the biggest independent vendor

00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,440
of open source today

00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,480
is going to ipo in june so watch this

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,959
space

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,120
another is open core you're probably

00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:33,360
surprised to find that 2008

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,279
asla identified that most companies were

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,880
using both proprietary and open source

00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,399
in their businesses

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,480
and they were doing that he said to

00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,000
balance a higher cost of development and

00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,480
marketing

00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,320
now that when aslet wrote that that was

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,360
2008 way before we had

00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,920
gate before we had a github economy and

00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,680
this marketing advantage didn't exist at

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,440
that time so these costs today are much

00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,320
more balanced and there's less need to

00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,959
balance that

00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,000
yet we still see open core particularly

00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,880
for the vc-backed

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,079
bay area companies as a popular model

00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,240
and we have others like

00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,440
systems integrators and managed services

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,760
providers who will

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,959
generally provide services across a

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,640
multitude

00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:14,000
of products whether those are all open

00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,120
source or a mixture of open and

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,800
proprietary

00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,640
and the key issue that we're seeing

00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,600
today seems to be

00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,640
single product companies single product

00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,200
vendors

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,800
companies which work with a single

00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,240
product are obviously putting all their

00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,399
eggs in one basket

00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,079
and this seems to be much more difficult

00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,320
and much more susceptible to the

00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:36,000
problems in the cloud environment

00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,440
we see something different with

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,680
multi-product vendors

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,600
and whether or not that a single product

00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:45,600
vendor will survive as a model

00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:47,440
remains to be seen if you think about

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,240
you know how many projects you want to

00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,959
take on like say mongodb is a fairly

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:55,279
focused company you know one core thing

00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:57,839
elastic a fairly focused company

00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:59,680
but you get into the platform world

00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:02,000
companies like hashicorp

00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,880
are very successful doing multiple

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,959
projects

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,079
i think pivotal is probably one of the

00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:08,240
broader

00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:09,680
breadth open source companies out there

00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,399
certainly red hat has a pretty broad

00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,880
breadth

00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:15,120
you hit a point where you become the

00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:17,600
platform provider of choice

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,519
for their next generation of design and

00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,800
actually the pressure comes to do more

00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,560
and more and more

00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,399
one of the biggest pressure points for

00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,399
us was always like okay we love this as

00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,160
an application platform now provide us

00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,120
the whole universe of data services on

00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,639
the platform

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,760
and so you have to achieve a certain

00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:36,160
critical mass to to have the scale to

00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:39,200
invest like that but i do think that in

00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:41,680
enterprise segmentation it's powerful

00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,360
when you can start to have people accept

00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,200
the offerings you do have

00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,760
and then the biggest pressure is and now

00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,360
add this so i can have one coherent

00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,399
approach and i think that that's

00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,680
something that's really important for

00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,920
open source companies to think about it

00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:56,000
like if you look at how amazon operates

00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,440
they are not a federation of hundreds of

00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
little hosting providers all coming

00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,680
together

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,680
they really have that sort of single

00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,720
point of interface to all of their

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,000
abstractions

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,600
so i think that's the interesting

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
dynamic in the world right now of open

00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,920
source

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,760
is like how broad you should go in your

00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,920
portfolio do enterprise

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:15,200
buyers favor that is it better to be

00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:18,320
lower end single product

00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:20,160
interestingly both pivotal and rancher

00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,120
like many successful open source

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,920
companies

00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,760
are in the kubernetes the cloud space

00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,480
but success doesn't just come in that

00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,560
space

00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,560
we've also seen success success in the

00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,600
database space with companies like

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,360
bracona

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,600
and precon is quite famous for not

00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,519
having vc backing or funding

00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,720
so let's hear from founder peter

00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,839
zeisteff

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:44,560
so if you look at where we started

00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,720
we started with essentia consultant and

00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,720
especially consultant focused on

00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,480
the high performance applications for

00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,360
mysql and

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,160
and mysql alone and this gradually

00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,199
extended

00:13:54,160 --> 00:14:00,240
both in terms of the services we offer

00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:01,440
so right now we have support management

00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,440
services and

00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,560
professional services such as consulting

00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,800
and training

00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:09,440
and in terms of technologies we cover

00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:13,120
right so right now we also cover

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:15,760
mysql postgresql mongodb and

00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,760
and marietv right so really the value

00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,920
proposition changed from essentially hey

00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,120
you know what we can optimize your mysql

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,279
performance to

00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,560
what percona helps you to run mysql

00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:27,560
postgresql

00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,880
one could be best as it warned us in

00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:31,120
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,240
that increased use of commercial

00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,600
licensing

00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,839
could create tension between the

00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,800
expectations

00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:40,720
of potential customers and commercial

00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,760
reality now asleep could not have

00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,199
understood

00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:46,959
how or why in 2008 this could come to

00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:48,720
fruition in the way that it has

00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,800
and in the last few years we've seen a

00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,560
small number of apparently successful

00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,839
companies based on open source with

00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,920
communities

00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,199
moving away from their open source

00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,920
licenses to

00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:02,079
proprietary alternatives and this has

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,320
sometimes been called a bait and switch

00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:06,320
tactic and one of those companies has

00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,000
gone so far to say that it viewed open

00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,040
source as nothing more than a marketing

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,120
tool

00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,120
and this included companies like redis

00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,680
mongodb inelastic

00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:19,040
and we've seen a move to licensing like

00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:21,760
the commons clause and sspl licenses

00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,639
so back in 2018 redis commissioned the

00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,240
commons clause

00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,399
and it was drafted by lawyer heather

00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,639
meeker and the commons clause is an

00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,120
add-on clause which is added to an open

00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,519
source

00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,279
license to exclude others from

00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,639
commercial usage to exclude the

00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:37,199
competitors

00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:39,360
and as soon as you add a clause to an

00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:41,440
open source license an additional clause

00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,920
to an approved open source license

00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:47,040
that license is invalidated because it's

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:49,440
no longer an improved license

00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,279
and uh we saw redis move to it the open

00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,720
source community greeted it with nothing

00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:55,360
short of horror

00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,720
and then in 2019 red has moved again and

00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,399
this time they moved to a new

00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,920
proprietary license called the reddest

00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,959
source available license

00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:06,639
so let's hear from redis although

00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:09,519
agpl provides a little better protection

00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,920
than bsd because you need to contribute

00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,079
back

00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,360
basically any enhancement that you do to

00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:16,399
the software

00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,600
we didn't feel that this is a show

00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:20,639
stopper for

00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,800
our cloud providers to adopt a

00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,759
successful open source projects and i'll

00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,240
explain

00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,920
so what happened in recent years is as

00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:31,680
the cloud business grew

00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:34,639
cloud providers such as aws are adopting

00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,759
any successful open source project

00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,160
making it

00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,800
a fully managed service and selling it

00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,519
for

00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,199
tens of millions in the case of reddis

00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:46,320
hundreds of millions of dollars

00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:49,040
per year so what is

00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:51,279
redis talking about well strip mining

00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:54,320
strip mining is a very us-centric

00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:56,959
term and it's an analogy from a federal

00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:59,360
law created in the mid-1970s

00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:01,759
which was designed to stop abuses of the

00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,360
land with companies strip mining coal

00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,760
from the land

00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,160
and this alleged strip mining came to

00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:11,280
public attention in 2019

00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:13,199
in a new york times article where it was

00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,199
reported that a number of open source

00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,799
founders companies that were running

00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,679
open source and distributing their code

00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:20,400
open source

00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:22,480
had gotten together to complain about

00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,880
some of the hyperscalers some of the

00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,679
cloud companies including aws who made

00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:29,440
the headline

00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:30,320
unsurprisingly amazon was equally

00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,880
vociferous

00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,720
in its response to this and while strip

00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,600
mining call might be illegal

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,160
under federal law at least using code

00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,720
which

00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:43,120
the originator has freely chosen to

00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,320
license under an open source license is

00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,559
entirely

00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,520
legal and that was clearly pointed out

00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:50,960
by aws

00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,600
as andy gutmann elastic actually took

00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,760
matters

00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:56,160
further by instigating litigation on a

00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,600
trademark infringement basis against aws

00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,120
that that seems to have disappeared

00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,000
nobody can quite tell me what's going on

00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,600
with that one

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,000
but on january 14th 2021 shy bannon

00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,600
founder of elastic made headlines by

00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,480
announcing they were doubling down on

00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,720
open

00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:13,120
confusingly doubling down on open by

00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,600
moving from an open source apache 2.0

00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:18,000
license to the sspl

00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,799
open source and business using open

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,720
source has

00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:22,320
clearly because of all of this been in

00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,640
the eye of a storm

00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,320
for the last few years and some in the

00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,200
open source community would describe

00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,640
this as font

00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:32,799
deliberately confusing and the sspl

00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,640
is clearly not an open source license

00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,000
but the confusion caused

00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,919
has meant that the open source

00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,160
initiative the osi has felt the need to

00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:42,640
come out and state this publicly

00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,360
and new terms emerged and that's faux

00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,160
pen

00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:48,000
where non-open source software tries to

00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,679
pass itself off as open

00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,120
when it's licensed under something like

00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,520
the sspl

00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,760
and mongodb commissioned heather miko to

00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,440
draft the sspl a few years ago

00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,280
but when they did that they took it to

00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,600
the osi they went through the approval

00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,880
process but before it could be rejected

00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,600
i think they might have seen the writing

00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,480
on the wall

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,679
they withdrew it from the process now an

00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,760
interesting

00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:12,080
structural fact about open source's

00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:14,160
shared nature and its licensing

00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,200
is that a community always has the

00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,240
opportunity

00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:20,000
to lift the code and move away in a fork

00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,400
and that's exactly what's happened to

00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,080
elastic a little bit confusing because

00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,640
elastics moved to a proprietary

00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,640
model it appears that elastic is the one

00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,320
that's managing a proprietary fork and

00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,160
the original code

00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,919
under the open source license is now

00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,039
being maintained by others including

00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:37,120
ivan

00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,400
it's often where it's really struggled

00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,080
and we've seen a struggle is when

00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,480
organizations haven't had a great

00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,919
business plan or route to market or they

00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,200
haven't been able to commercialize their

00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,640
own product

00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,200
and then all of a sudden it gets

00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:51,280
embedded into something larger and then

00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,440
the only monetization of it happens in

00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:55,200
the cloud to me that's business right

00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,120
that's something that's going to happen

00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,200
in any space whether it's open source or

00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,520
not and yes in our world people can take

00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,440
and

00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,720
build on it very easily but that's what

00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,919
you you know you know what you're

00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,120
getting into when you start an open

00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:05,760
source software business and if you

00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,440
don't

00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,280
you really should research it a little

00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,120
bit more this is the knife that cuts

00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,880
in many ways from a business perspective

00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,559
and i certainly would look at the world

00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,400
and i certainly wouldn't call foul

00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:18,640
if that happened to an open source

00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:21,919
project

00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:24,960
so how do we transition through this

00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:26,799
difficult cloud-based time well

00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,240
i would suggest that we do it with great

00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:30,320
care because

00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,159
carelessness and this world of open

00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,679
source a lack of understanding of

00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:36,240
licensing in the osd

00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:38,159
could so easily break this beautiful

00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:41,520
thing that we've created

00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:42,919
and leave us back in a world where open

00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,760
source may be

00:20:42,919 --> 00:20:48,240
regurgitating the proprietary code and a

00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:50,799
nasty mess of binary and we lose

00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,960
what we've created now some have

00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:55,120
suggested there's a third way

00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,720
and you you'll have noticed that i've

00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:59,280
explained very clearly the difference

00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,640
between open source and proprietary code

00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,640
and they've suggested that there's a

00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,840
third way an alternative that could be

00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,159
created

00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,080
and that that third way might be public

00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:11,039
or shared source

00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:13,039
where source code is shared but the code

00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:14,320
distribution doesn't have an open source

00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:16,480
license and it doesn't meet the

00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,280
standards of the osd potentially

00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,200
allowing it to

00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,720
exclude innovation being used by one's

00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,960
competitors

00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,559
personally that i don't think that's the

00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,840
solution and i don't think it's the

00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:28,159
solution because i don't think there's

00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,039
the appetite for it because to create it

00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:32,320
would require

00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:34,159
three things and it would require energy

00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,760
it would require funding and it would

00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,679
require engagement

00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,960
and having seen heather meeker try to

00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,799
defend the

00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,880
commons clause to a room full of open

00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:44,559
source lawyers in 2019

00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,640
there might be one or two who'll support

00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:49,600
it but i think there are very very few

00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:52,640
there was no real appetite for this

00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:54,799
personally i think there's a fourth way

00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,480
now currently emotions run really high

00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:58,640
there's a lot of money at stake as there

00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,080
was i have to say 10 years ago when i

00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,679
first came across this problem at

00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,280
canonical

00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:05,360
and in time to come we will see

00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:08,640
different problems we will see

00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:10,559
further issues with different business

00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,679
models whether it's in the internet or

00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:13,679
ai

00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:15,760
and we'll see more disruption coming

00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:18,080
from open source and

00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,280
incumbents never loved disruption in

00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,360
fact if we think back

00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:23,440
10 years ago we saw similar problems

00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:26,320
around operating systems and those were

00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:28,880
solved by antitrust cases and

00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,640
regulation so how do we get over this

00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,840
strip mining how do we get over this

00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,480
current problem

00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,480
we look with the lens of the future and

00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:39,039
the learning of the past

00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,000
already since 2019 we've seen google

00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:42,480
doing deals with

00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
open source companies to share revenue

00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,720
in 2020 with

00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,799
companies like grafana aws was also

00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,400
public and starting to do these

00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:52,240
some even allowed credits from the

00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:55,280
hyperscalers to be used to buy

00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:57,520
open source services and i expect that

00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:59,360
this particular bump in the road

00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:01,440
i expect that it will be resolved not

00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:04,559
the regulation although it might be

00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:06,799
but i think by negotiation

00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:08,159
remember at the beginning i said open

00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:11,280
source is all around

00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:13,440
us it's like gravity you can't escape it

00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:16,000
well today this problem isn't just open

00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,400
sources it's societies and it applies

00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,280
across

00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,880
all technology across all infrastructure

00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,400
and that means all businesses and

00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,480
government today

00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,240
i started by thinking about what open

00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:29,600
source is and one thing

00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:31,200
it is not as a business model and as i

00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,840
come to the end of my time with you

00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,760
today

00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:36,000
let's look at mark shuttleworth again

00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:38,240
reflecting on 15 years in

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,919
canonical some things really haven't

00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,720
changed it is about

00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,600
enabling people to go faster with open

00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,080
source

00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,679
to drive down the cost of open source

00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,960
drive down the friction

00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:53,440
of open source i don't see any other

00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,000
way of organizing software that seems

00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,039
poised

00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,200
to beat open source

00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:00,320
bruce didn't come down from the mountain

00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,840
with the osd

00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:05,279
carved in stone you know it is no 10

00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,760
commandments but the whole of society

00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:10,320
today

00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:12,720
relies on code that's distributed under

00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,080
software licensing that relies on that

00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,400
definition

00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,080
and we must take great care of it of

00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,400
course we must keep it under review

00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:22,159
and we must also make sure that the osi

00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,120
its guardian is well funded and well

00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:26,080
managed

00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:28,960
but we must also remember that open

00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:31,039
source works to make the best software

00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,279
when it comes to business we must look

00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:35,520
to business models and the ever-evolving

00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:36,559
ever-changing technologies that impact

00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,799
them

00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:41,039
open source will not bend to this but

00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:47,840
rather these have to evolve to allow

00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:47,840
open source to thrive

00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:13,440
open uk is the industry body for the

00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,919
business of open technology

00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,840
in the uk if you're not familiar with

00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:20,400
that term open technology

00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,919
it's open source software open hardware

00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,400
and open data

00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:25,039
and we work to a vision to develop and

00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,640
sustain

00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:31,440
uk leadership in open technology

00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,640
that falls under three pillars community

00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,000
legal and policy

00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:37,760
and learning in community we showcase

00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,360
the uk's amazing

00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:44,240
open technology community through awards

00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:46,559
honours lists and the like we use the

00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,000
impact and the power of that cohesive

00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:51,520
visible community

00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,440
to influence laws and policy we do that

00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:56,480
through an extremely knowledgeable

00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:59,120
legal group of around 18 lawyers

00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,799
who respond to legislation in the uk in

00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,880
europe and beyond

00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:04,799
submitting an amicus brief in the google

00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,440
v oracle litigation

00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:09,039
the only non-us-based organization to do

00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,600
so

00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:13,840
it didn't take long in 2020 thanks

00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:16,080
partly to that group for open uk

00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:19,679
to be recognized by the commission as

00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,679
the actor in their space

00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:24,480
we use our community strength to

00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:25,600
influence legal and policy but there's a

00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,520
third pillar

00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,919
learning building the community of the

00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:32,240
future teaching good practices

00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:32,960
and governance and knowledge around open

00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,360
source

00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:37,279
around open technology to the

00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,200
technologists of the future

00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:41,679
through things like her kids camp and

00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,679
course this was in fact

00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:45,520
in its first year the runner-up and the

00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:47,520
gnome community challenge

00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:50,080
and this year we'll be teaching kids the

00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,840
10 aspects the 10 elements of the osd

00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:55,440
the 10

00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:57,279
requirements as part of 10 fun lessons

00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,799
all of that feeds into the work we're

00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:59,360
doing and building a community of the

00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,919
future

00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:04,000
in open technology in the uk and we've

00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:06,400
recently brought on board

00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,279
the wonderful matt barker of jet stack

00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,600
as our first

00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:11,279
entrepreneur in residence and matt's

00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:14,000
role is going to be to help

00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:15,440
shape our founders forum to help support

00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,320
and influence

00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,640
startups and scale-ups in the uk working

00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,240
in the open technology space

00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,159
we're an inclusive organization and

00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,720
we're there for everyone to participate

00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:26,480

and we launched our belonging letter on

00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,000
valentine's day this year

00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:31,840

thanks very much that was a very

00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,640
interesting talk

00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,480
um thanks amanda and thanks for being

00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:59,760
with us now here live

00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:02,640
in the stream hello hello uh greetings

00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:05,760
from a very sunny london

00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:08,880
yes it's also very sunny in berlin um

00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:11,520
let me have a look at the chat i think

00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,360
there are no questions right now in the

00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:16,240
chat maybe they will come

00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:17,360
they will come but let me say i

00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,919
especially liked

00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,880
what you said that um those um issues

00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,799
with the um

00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,559
new licenses now tried out by some

00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:27,679
companies will be resolved by

00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:29,120
yeah simply negotiations in the end

00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:31,679
i think that's one right i think what

00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:33,440
we've seen is um

00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:35,840
it's almost like what we saw 10 years

00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,200
ago in the operating system space

00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,840
you know there's going to be constant

00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,760
development evolution and change in tech

00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,279
and we have to move with those business

00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,320
models and adapt with those business

00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:46,240
models

00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:48,399
but we can't sort of go back to the

00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,760
fundamental nature of open and reinvent

00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:52,720
that every time

00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:54,799
and ultimately the operating system type

00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:57,200
issues were resolved by a combination

00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:58,720
of i think regulatory and competition

00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:02,880
authorities

00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:03,840
and also um negotiations and contracts

00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,200
and deals

00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,360
and i think that's where we'll get to

00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,200
but i think a lot of the tech sector and

00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,080
the the companies involved in the cloud

00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,120
space

00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:14,320
will want to avoid if they can having

00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,159
regulation

00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,520
so that's why i think we will see a lot

00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:20,960
more negotiation and

00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:22,880
the short term and we've seen

00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:25,760
since we recorded this actually we've

00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:27,840
seen grafana also

00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:30,399
shift and rather than shift to one of

00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:32,559
these non-open source licenses one of

00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:33,840
these new type of license that really is

00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:36,559
proprietary

00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:38,480
we've seen grafana move with the same

00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:41,039
goals i've talked to them about it

00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,080
what they've tried to achieve is staying

00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:43,919
open

00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,159
as they move to something that they hope

00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:47,919
will force the hyperscalers into deals

00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:51,679
with them

00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:54,399
yeah very interesting um we have one um

00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:55,360
question from marcus egan he asked does

00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:57,360
open uk

00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:00,240
pay any of the companies that produce

00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:04,279
important open source libraries

00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:06,000
um open uk is a not-for-profit

00:30:04,279 --> 00:30:09,200
organization

00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,200
which works to represent organizations

00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,880
creating those open source software

00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,520
libraries and other

00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:17,760
uh open source products we work to

00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:20,559
represent them through policy

00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:21,760
through making sure the laws are as good

00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:24,399
as they could be in the uk

00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:26,640
for open source and also bringing that

00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:28,080
community of engineers developers and

00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,279
everybody else around open because

00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,840
there's a lot of us

00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:33,679
who spent um summer noon someone spent a

00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:36,720
lot of time in open like me

00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:38,399
who are not engineers but all contribute

00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,200
in our own little ways to the overall

00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:42,960
picture

00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:45,039
so what we do is we help to

00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:47,360
promote enhance an advocate for open

00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:51,840
source we don't pay anybody for any

00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:51,840

00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,559
