	Keynote: After 25 Years, Where Are We? [E] - Dr. Thomas Di Giacomo, Chief Technology Officer, SUSE

Last year we celebrated 25 years of Linux (oh, and by the way SUSE is also turning 25 in 2017). The IT and industry landscapes have changed significantly during the last two decades: open source and Linux in particular have been extensively adopted across all industries, which in turn has also inspired many new open source projects to start and develop.

Today, one of the challenges enterprises face to adopt open source technologies, besides test, set-up, security and long term support, is the integration of these different open source projects. Now more than ever, communities and companies have to work together across projects to facilitate this integration.

Another important change compared to 1991 is that infrastructure and development have come a lot closer together. With DevOps principles and technologies like containers, not only do we have infrastructure- and development-related open source projects, but blurring borders and tight coupling between them.

As an example, today SUSE will announce the release of a new product, rooted in communities and in partnerships, at such a cross-roads of open source software-defined infrastructure and cloud native development.

good morning that just ow shine how and

00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:16,800
run chin way your way jsow so as it's

00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,750
probably not very understandable neither

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,240
for English speakers and no for

00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,609
Mannering speakers I was just trying to

00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:27,170
say good morning everyone it's an honor

00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:27,170
for me to present in front of you today

00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:33,030
some of you might know and remember that

00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:36,750
last year we've celebrated the 25th

00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:40,770
anniversary of Linux Suzhou is also

00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:43,469
turning 25 years old in 2017 which makes

00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:45,629
us one of the order if not the oldest

00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:48,539
company focused on open source and Linux

00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:50,370
and while we cannot really have with us

00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:52,410
right now we hope to spend some time

00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:55,710
with you later today or during the

00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:58,670
remaining of the year so besides eating

00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:01,199
cakes and peach dumplings in China

00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:05,210
singing and drinking what are people

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:07,979
doing whenever celebrating anniversaries

00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:10,740
well sometimes they watch with nostalgia

00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:13,729
some old family pictures to remember the

00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:16,170
past and see how things have changed

00:01:13,729 --> 00:01:18,689
this is a picture from one of the very

00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:21,540
first Linux conferences held in Germany

00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:24,360
and they are probably familiar faces on

00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,880
that picture so you might recognize the

00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,680
person in the middle sitting on the left

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,259
shoulder of the arendelle

00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:35,070
we're both speaking here this morning on

00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:37,850
stage 23 years later on that picture

00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:40,560
from Suzy we also have our last year of

00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:42,710
VP Linux Enterprise research and

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,409
development wearing a yellow shirt and

00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:49,350
Ralph's AXA or president of engineering

00:01:45,409 --> 00:01:50,759
wearing a purple shirt and to comply

00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:53,399
with the linux foundation code of

00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:55,470
conducts i cannot really comment on how

00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:58,110
the body of ralph has changed over that

00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:00,990
time but i can still make a little bit

00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:08,129
fun of how i was wearing some shots back

00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:10,319
then so in the last 21 decades software

00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:11,580
hardware and networking are drastically

00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:13,350
evolved

00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,600
with the development of the worldwide

00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:18,540
web of cloud of the authorization and a

00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,220
lot of technologies ideas changed

00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:22,410
dramatically as well thanks to the mass

00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:24,930
adoption of open source in general and

00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:28,380
of Linux in particular across all

00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:31,470
industries and use cases for example in

00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:33,300
high-performance computing it has

00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:34,950
progressed a lot thanks to open-source

00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:38,490
and also thanks to the innovation coming

00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:40,830
from China at suzer we have witnessed

00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:43,260
and fuelled firsthand such an adoption

00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:46,440
and even for highly critical

00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:48,300
applications and data I would say

00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:50,460
especially for them and so enterprise

00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:52,170
use actually where a security the

00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:54,510
stability and the flexibility that

00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:59,130
open-source can provide I've helped them

00:02:54,510 --> 00:03:00,870
a lot so now that open source as one now

00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:04,260
that the open source doors are opened

00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:06,720
widely open to large blue skies or to

00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:08,670
large blue oceans as the gentleman from

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,270
where we fell to yesterday during his

00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:11,640
keynotes

00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:13,650
we should continue to keep working

00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:16,700
collectively and making sure that we

00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:19,320
limit what could be obstructing the door

00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:22,110
because in human history there are

00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:24,390
unless examples of great concepts that

00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:26,820
have been misused and bent for complying

00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:28,830
with individual girls ultimately

00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:33,240
corrupting if not destroying the

00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:34,800
concepts most of the time being involved

00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,990
with open-source should not only be

00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:39,290
about consuming the available pieces of

00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:43,350
codes but about contributing to rates

00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:47,700
this is about sharing both getting and

00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:49,440
giving even if our near leader and it's

00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,000
not about simply contributing but

00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,550
contributing in an energy and

00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,770
constructive way to help the projects

00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:59,970
and their respective communities rather

00:03:55,770 --> 00:04:02,670
than contributing for oneself this

00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:05,760
should be about building enabling and

00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:07,709
sustaining communities and powering them

00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,160
rather than having them controlled by

00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:12,870
single companies companies should

00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:15,120
collaborate as peers with other

00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:17,549
companies and individuals we should be

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,010
working together at collectively solving

00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:22,440
short and long term generic problems

00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:25,530
that the problem that the projects are

00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:28,139
addressing rather than focus

00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:30,300
incorporate specific requirements when

00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:31,590
trying to build unique selling points or

00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,510
trying to differentiate from the

00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:35,730
competition

00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:37,860
if this needs to be done it should be

00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:40,020
done when creating products and

00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:42,360
solutions downstream or when building

00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:44,880
and wrapping services around them and

00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:48,650
not inside the project driving and

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:51,240
dragging them to one-sided directions

00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:53,910
because this leads to fragmentation of

00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:56,550
the efforts these kids to decrease

00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:59,630
interest of communities as well as to

00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:02,430
some sort of vandal lurking

00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:05,370
so while nowadays a lot of contributions

00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:08,220
are coming from companies and with that

00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:10,530
comes a focus on solving and user needs

00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:12,990
as well which is certainly a good thing

00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:15,510
for projects we should still aim at

00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:17,790
having communities come first are

00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:21,870
transparently opening up to partners and

00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:24,419
individuals and overall the responsible

00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:27,930
cooperates open source contributors no

00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:30,510
matter which company we work for only

00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:32,550
having the code available is not enough

00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:34,890
in itself to ensure long-term viability

00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:37,410
of open source we need to keep working

00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:40,710
and fostering inclusive environments for

00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:42,390
everybody to contribute to and last but

00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:43,860
not least we need to keep having fun and

00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:48,300
solving technical challenges together

00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:50,700
for the negative gates to come if we

00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:53,370
also look at where we are today compared

00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:55,650
to 25 years ago it's also very clear

00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:57,930
that the number of open source projects

00:05:55,650 --> 00:06:00,930
is very high as Jim mentioned yesterday

00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:02,780
morning during his keynote too and there

00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:04,590
is a lot of logo on that slides

00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:06,840
representing the current Linux

00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:09,600
foundation projects there's even more

00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:11,010
when considering other foundations let

00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,590
alone the millions of projects and

00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:16,169
github and that's absolutely a good

00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:19,260
thing by no means should one try to

00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:20,850
restrict or control that assuming one

00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:23,400
will have the power to do so which is

00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:25,380
luckily not the case it's a good thing

00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,450
but it's creating potentially some

00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:30,150
challenges for the adoption of open

00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:31,950
source in enterprise because it can make

00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:34,080
it more complicated for a company to

00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:36,300
assess which projects to look at

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,770
specifically for their needs which

00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,810
projects to participate and contribute

00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:43,220
to

00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:44,810
which wants to use in production there

00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:46,250
are some interesting new work being done

00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:48,710
in the Linux Foundation in the

00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:50,180
networking space for instance you might

00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:53,000
have heard about that yesterday during

00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:55,880
the keynote of dev worlds the open

00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,919
networking umbrella idea is to try

00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:59,540
organizing all the efforts that are

00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:02,030
being done in networking together

00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:03,830
it was also presented here in Beijing

00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:09,169
last week during the OPN a visa meet

00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:11,660
actually so with more and more projects

00:07:09,169 --> 00:07:14,900
being around and most of them growing

00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:16,700
faster than ever one key aspect to

00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:20,180
consider is how to continuously

00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:23,150
interface them and this is not only a

00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:25,669
theoretical engineering exercise it's

00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:27,890
very common to see many different

00:07:25,669 --> 00:07:31,160
projects having to coexist in real-life

00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:34,640
IT architectures they have to be able to

00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:37,430
be installed and configured together to

00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:39,440
work and run together to evolve together

00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:41,780
even though they might have specifics

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:45,470
and different release and life cycles

00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:48,530
I just wanted to illustrate here one of

00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:50,630
the frequent scenario that we see we are

00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:52,490
Linux is involved virtualization and

00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:54,169
container Software Defined Networking

00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:57,440
and storage as well as

00:07:54,169 --> 00:07:59,240
OpenStack and cloud foundry there's also

00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,830
a PN IV in a different color on that

00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:03,200
slide because I wanted to take the

00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:05,450
opportunity to state again that OB nav

00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:08,210
is not only about networking but it's

00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:10,130
also about integrating and testing those

00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:12,320
kind of diverse scenarios involving

00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:17,120
multiple projects together and

00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:19,550
contributing back to the projects so

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,460
this means that today as communities as

00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:25,550
companies as individuals more than ever

00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:28,130
we have to work and collaborate

00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:30,710
efficiently together and that's not only

00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:34,370
in single project but across many

00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:37,039
different ones and unlike 25 years ago

00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:41,089
where a single developer could make a

00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:43,400
difference alone we now have to embrace

00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:46,100
and facilitates the diversity and

00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:49,009
collaboration in our communities it

00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:54,139
as important as making sure that smart

00:08:49,009 --> 00:08:56,029
IDs are implemented so as user well

00:08:54,139 --> 00:08:57,829
we've started with and continue to focus

00:08:56,029 --> 00:09:01,009
on Linux and core open source

00:08:57,829 --> 00:09:03,290
technologies we've noticed early on that

00:09:01,009 --> 00:09:06,529
facilitating the coexistence of multiple

00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:09,589
projects was very important because

00:09:06,529 --> 00:09:12,110
enterprises are existing pieces of IT to

00:09:09,589 --> 00:09:14,720
be accommodated they also have new needs

00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:18,470
that require the Junction's of visible

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:20,899
projects together this is why we for

00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:22,880
instance worked and contributed to the

00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:25,310
use of Ceph as a back-end forward in

00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:28,190
stack to the expansion of the Cloud

00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:29,870
Foundry cloud provider interfaces and to

00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:33,800
the integration of kubernetes in

00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:36,440
OpenStack magnum for instance this all

00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:39,199
has to run together and even further

00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:41,029
than that an open source based

00:09:39,199 --> 00:09:43,910
software-defined infrastructure as

00:09:41,029 --> 00:09:46,279
represented here needs to work nicely

00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:49,370
when swapping any pieces of the stacks

00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:51,939
with as many past present and future

00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:54,579
technologies and products as possible

00:09:51,939 --> 00:09:56,750
this is about freedom of choice and

00:09:54,579 --> 00:10:01,819
accommodating the different software and

00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:04,009
our wealth setups that are there open

00:10:01,819 --> 00:10:06,529
source for enterprise IT is definitely

00:10:04,009 --> 00:10:08,449
not only about the infrastructure it's

00:10:06,529 --> 00:10:11,899
also about enabling developers and

00:10:08,449 --> 00:10:14,120
applications that are both driving the

00:10:11,899 --> 00:10:16,610
enterprise business and also running on

00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:19,819
orbital running with infrastructure

00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:22,160
itself together with the evolution of

00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:24,949
how infrastructure is today abstracted

00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:27,439
automated and consumes there are changes

00:10:24,949 --> 00:10:29,660
in the tools processes and culture of

00:10:27,439 --> 00:10:32,540
how software development is

00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:35,569
architectures performed and continuously

00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:37,639
delivered into production and that's a

00:10:35,569 --> 00:10:42,500
large extent irrespective of the target

00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:46,880
infrastructure so we are clinics can lc3

00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:49,730
with corrugated container con containers

00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:53,060
obviously a great way to facilitate such

00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:54,649
a transformation and while containers

00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:57,889
have been around for a while with Linux

00:10:54,649 --> 00:11:00,910
now only having a container engine is

00:10:57,889 --> 00:11:03,290
not enough for enterprise use

00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:05,150
because aspects like ease of

00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:08,450
provisioning ease of management

00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:10,850
automation security container image

00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:14,450
scanning signing and listing and or

00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:18,020
elles are needed this is not enough

00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:20,660
father price to rely on public partially

00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:22,870
anonymous images for the level of trust

00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:26,930
they expect their business to run on

00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:28,760
it's not enough for the price to expect

00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:31,580
timely patching for the level of

00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:34,160
security that they need it's also not

00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:38,650
designed for simple seamless large-scale

00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:41,450
production news so today here in Beijing

00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:43,880
we are extremely happy to announce a new

00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:46,760
Souza product called suzer container as

00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:48,410
a service platform and if you have

00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:51,620
listened to the keynote of the Kay cloud

00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:53,240
CEO yesterday then we realize that we

00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:55,280
should have probably called that cluster

00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:59,150
as a service platform we might patch it

00:11:55,280 --> 00:12:02,060
for v2 we've been working on it as usual

00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:04,190
within communities and projects and with

00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:08,150
our partners some of them being in the

00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:10,190
room so this product comes with a

00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:12,770
container optimal optimized host

00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:15,080
operating system the container

00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:17,900
management and automation framework as

00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:20,600
well as additional related tools such as

00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:23,930
a role based private registry should it

00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:27,380
be needed if not because they are

00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:29,870
already existing pieces in place in a

00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:33,830
given set up it can also integrate with

00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:36,350
what's running more specifically to the

00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:38,500
container as a service platform comes

00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:41,540
with includes kubernetes

00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:44,030
for automating and scaling the

00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:46,610
development deployment and operation of

00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:51,260
application containers across large and

00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:54,320
mixed clusters it also includes a new OS

00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:57,830
called Suzhou micro OS which is a

00:12:54,320 --> 00:13:01,580
purpose-built transactional upgrades Lin

00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:03,440
operating system and finally it comes

00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:04,270
with a container engine and an

00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,200
integrated

00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:10,760
configuration of the cluster nodes

00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:11,120
followed by the sole projects so the

00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,740
berm

00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,839
it's a version of that products has been

00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:16,940
in public beta since a couple of months

00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:20,029
already so everyone can download it and

00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:21,830
set up a cumulative cluster with that it

00:13:20,029 --> 00:13:23,960
should just take a couple of clicks to

00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:26,779
have it up and running completely from

00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:29,600
scratch we received a ton of feedback

00:13:26,779 --> 00:13:32,660
and interests which helped us to improve

00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,190
the beta version into a v1 which will be

00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:40,160
available in the next couple of weeks

00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:42,620
now to conclude and to illustrate the

00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,960
previous points of having multiple

00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:46,480
projects being needed and being stronger

00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:49,130
together

00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:51,260
v1 already includes a few projects

00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:53,600
together that we are working on a v2 and

00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:55,880
v3 for to be released before the end of

00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,279
the year to also support public

00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:00,640
different public clouds OpenStack cloud

00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:03,650
foundry and other open source projects

00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:05,930
because as we've discussed those

00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:08,240
projects technologies have to work

00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:10,010
seamlessly together irrespective of

00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:17,410
where they are sitting and how they are

00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:23,360
used can share that jar through that jar

00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:25,310
yo how may they hn but this was even

00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:28,000
world and introduction so thank you for

00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:31,000
attention and have a great conference

00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,050
[Applause]

00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:37,160
Thank You Thomas thank you

ah hold on are you up so we can download

00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:43,010
the container a service platform today

00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:46,220
so you can just go on to the CCA website

00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:48,260
for free Delta website and you can get

00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:50,779

that alright so check it out go down to

00:14:50,779 --> 00:14:54,890
sue say download the container as a

00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,370
service platform and check it out for

00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:58,160
yourselves

00:14:55,370 --> 00:15:00,740
thank you everyone we're going to take a
