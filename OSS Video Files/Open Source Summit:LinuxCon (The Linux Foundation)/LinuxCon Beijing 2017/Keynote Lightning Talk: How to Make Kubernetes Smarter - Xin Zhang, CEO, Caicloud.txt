	Keynote Lightning Talk: How to Make Kubernetes Smarter - Xin Zhang, CEO, Caicloud

The declarative design pattern presents the central tenet of Kubernetes; combined with various control loops, the mechanism results in great automation of container, service, and node management. While a lot of ongoing efforts in the community focus on making Kubernetes more automated, scalable, reliable, and versatile, we explore ways to make Kubernetes "smarter".

In this talk, we will share our work on transforming Kubernetes' computing power and agility into intelligence, and show how to make Kubernetes more data-driven and excel at mining the value of data.
