good morning good morning and welcome

00:00:01,469 --> 00:00:08,929
everyone welcome to our first annual

00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:13,380
Linux Foundation

00:00:08,929 --> 00:00:17,880
l-3 event in China I am so happy to be

00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:21,570
here what an amazing group we have we

00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:28,590
have over 2,000 people here today so

00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:32,610
welcome to everyone we have seen

00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:34,559
incredible support here in China in

00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:37,980
particular from the sponsors of this

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:40,770
event I want to thank our sponsors in

00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:45,570
particular our strategic sponsor Huawei

00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:48,300
ah let's hear from Huawei our diamond

00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:51,510
sponsors Alibaba cloud Microsoft and

00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:54,239
sousei our platinum sponsors KY cloud

00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,920
and our gold sponsor the cloud native

00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:00,719
computing foundation in Red Hat let's

00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:03,539
thank our sponsors again I also want to

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:07,100
welcome a few new members to the Linux

00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:09,689
Foundation you know in China a

00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:12,510
participation from Chinese companies in

00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:18,659
the Linux Foundation in the last year

00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:20,189
has grown 400% the number of companies

00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:23,580
from China participating in our

00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:27,390
organization has grown up four times and

00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:33,140
our newest members are China standard

00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:35,850
software MN $0.10 and then finally

00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:37,439
Alibaba cloud has upgraded to our gold

00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:43,829
membership please thank our newest

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:49,530
members so I thought I would start out

00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:55,200
today by talking about the state of open

00:01:49,530 --> 00:02:00,600
source so open source has really started

00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:03,030
to grow into more than just small group

00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:06,500
of developers working on a small group

00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:10,110
of projects to really a new phase and

00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:13,110
the question I want to ask today is are

00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,870
you all ready for that now it's

00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:17,769
important to

00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:20,290
remember that Linux is the biggest most

00:02:17,769 --> 00:02:22,150
successful most widely distributed

00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:26,290
platform in the history of computing

00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:29,019
look at these numbers it's amazing but

00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:32,680
you know my favorite number aren't these

00:02:29,019 --> 00:02:37,060
my favorite number is this 10,000 lines

00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:41,260
of code are added to 5,000 lines of code

00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:44,940
are subtracted from and about 1,800

00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:50,739
lines of code are modified in Linux

00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:53,349
every single day 365 days a year

00:02:50,739 --> 00:02:55,660
it's the fastest moving fastest

00:02:53,349 --> 00:02:58,269
developed project in the history of

00:02:55,660 --> 00:03:01,359
computing and many of the core

00:02:58,269 --> 00:03:04,810
developers of Linux including leanest

00:03:01,359 --> 00:03:09,569
Torvalds are here this week we're very

00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:13,620
very happy to have them that's right and

00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:16,390
the Linux Foundation continues to grow

00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:20,169
today the Linux Foundation has over 800

00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:22,540
members we gather tens of thousands of

00:03:20,169 --> 00:03:25,870
developers all over the world at

00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:28,959
hundreds of events like this the

00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:31,540
combined value of the projects that we

00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:35,019
host at the Linux Foundation it's worth

00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:38,190
billions of dollars and the software

00:03:35,019 --> 00:03:42,910
that the Linux foundation hosts runs

00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:45,040
most of global society most of the

00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:47,739
world's stock markets most of the

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:51,370
world's embedded devices most of the

00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:53,620
internet it is tremendous to see the

00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:56,799
growth that we're experiencing at the

00:03:53,620 --> 00:04:01,239
Linux Foundation and today the Linux

00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:05,470
Foundation is much much more than Linux

00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:09,129
as open-source becomes an important part

00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:11,079
of every modern computing system the

00:04:09,129 --> 00:04:14,440
Linux Foundation has expanded into new

00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:17,949
areas of technology new sectors of

00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:20,380
computing with projects like hyper

00:04:17,949 --> 00:04:23,200
ledger which is our blockchain

00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:26,469
initiative many many members from China

00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:27,080
in that effort how many people here who

00:04:26,469 --> 00:04:29,659
heard

00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:34,460
kubernetes on repair know kubernetes

00:04:29,659 --> 00:04:36,740
right one of our newest projects we have

00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:40,520
a huge number of projects in the

00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:42,830
networking sector in particular the open

00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:46,400
network automation platform own app

00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:49,639
which is a combination of a project

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:52,729
called ecomp from AT&T but more

00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:56,780
importantly a project called open o

00:04:52,729 --> 00:05:01,060
which was started here in China by China

00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:04,210
Mobile and Huawei and is now the biggest

00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:07,759
network management orchestration of

00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:12,020
project in the world started in China

00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:14,360
and now expanding all over the world no

00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:16,219
js' is one of our projects Cloud Foundry

00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,469
is one of our projects we have an

00:05:16,219 --> 00:05:20,960
automotive project called automotive

00:05:18,469 --> 00:05:24,050
grade Linux which is being rolled out

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:28,009
into millions of production vehicles

00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:30,770
from companies like Toyota this year so

00:05:28,009 --> 00:05:35,380
we've come a long way as an organization

00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:39,940
and it's not just the Linux Foundation

00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:43,940
we are entering an entirely new phase of

00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:46,849
software development you know in the

00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:49,669
first phase of open source in the early

00:05:46,849 --> 00:05:54,979
days of open source open source projects

00:05:49,669 --> 00:05:58,069
tended to copy existing proprietary

00:05:54,979 --> 00:06:02,090
software copy the functionality that is

00:05:58,069 --> 00:06:04,400
so a database you know sort of my sequel

00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:05,389
was an open source version of Oracle

00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,090
database

00:06:05,389 --> 00:06:10,430
you know Linux was competing with

00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:14,389
proprietary operating systems but what's

00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:16,909
happening is three alternatives to

00:06:14,389 --> 00:06:20,539
expensive proprietary software we're

00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:22,960
sort of shrinking the market right sort

00:06:20,539 --> 00:06:28,279
of creating more efficiency by

00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:34,389
commoditizing those markets today we are

00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:37,399
entering an entirely new phase today new

00:06:34,389 --> 00:06:40,370
economies are being created from open

00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:43,850
source projects today

00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:47,800
open-source projects aren't copying

00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:51,680
existing technology they're leading new

00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:54,050
technology with projects like tensorflow

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:57,160
in machine learning and artificial

00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:59,419
intelligence hadoop in big data

00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:04,040
kubernetes and Cloud Foundry in the

00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:07,900
cloud all creating completely new ways

00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:12,010
to think about technology and creating

00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:15,590
completely new multibillion-dollar

00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:19,660
economies around these open-source

00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:25,729
projects it's an entirely new phase in

00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:29,260
fact today nobody builds any technology

00:07:25,729 --> 00:07:32,270
product or service without open source

00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:35,020
you know in the past organizations might

00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:38,889
use a little bit of open-source but

00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:40,130
today there's so much software in

00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:43,190
anything

00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:46,460
whether it's an automobile a consumer

00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:51,139
electronic device whether it's the

00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:53,720
Alibaba cloud whether it's a shammy cell

00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:55,729
phone there are millions and millions

00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:59,660
and millions of lines of code in

00:07:55,729 --> 00:08:03,440
anything there's just too much software

00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:07,460
to be written for any one organization

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:11,150
or person to write it by themselves and

00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:13,340
so today most organizations the vast

00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:16,910
majority of the code in any product or

00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:19,400
service is open source and companies

00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:21,500
instead only focus on the small

00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:25,070
percentage of code that actually adds

00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:29,690
value to their customers that they know

00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:33,650
best and so we believe at the Linux

00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:35,570
Foundation that if you don't harvest if

00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:40,300
you don't take advantage of this shared

00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:43,760
R&D you won't be able to compete

00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:46,310
organizations that aren't good at taking

00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:49,310
open source software bringing it into

00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:51,890
their organization modifying it for

00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:52,810
their needs and then creating products

00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:54,820
and services for the

00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:58,120
customers with that open source if you

00:08:54,820 --> 00:09:01,060
can't do that we don't think you'll be

00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:03,910
competitive so the question for all of

00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:07,600
you today the question for all of you to

00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:11,910
think about this week is are you ready

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:15,790
for this new phase in open source are

00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:17,980
you able to get to market faster by

00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:21,820
leveraging shared rnd like the Linux

00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:25,080
kernel or kubernetes or tensorflow do

00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:28,390
you understand how to bring code in

00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:30,670
modify it and then share it back with

00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:32,860
your competitors if you can't do those

00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:34,900
things what we think at the linux

00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:39,550
foundation is you won't be able to

00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:43,210
compete the good news is the good news

00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:46,990
is there's lots and lots and lots of

00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:48,460
open source software millions and

00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:52,540
millions and millions of open source

00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:56,760
projects on github alone there are 64

00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:59,440
million open source repositories the

00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:00,970
Apache Software Foundation has hundreds

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,640
of projects the Eclipse Foundation has

00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:06,640
unders the Linux Foundation has dozens

00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:08,470
and dozens of projects and so the good

00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:11,500
news is that there's lots of open source

00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:16,000
for you to use the question you should

00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:21,040
ask yourselves is which open source

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:24,660
projects really matter what are the open

00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:27,880
source projects that have the most value

00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:31,030
and have the most developers that solve

00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:33,280
the biggest problem that are used in the

00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:36,370
most products that are used for the most

00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:40,030
critical infrastructure and at the Linux

00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:43,810
Foundation we think about this question

00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:45,520
all the time how do we identify the most

00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:48,220
important open source projects in the

00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:52,209
world and then how do we create a

00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:55,270
sustainable ecosystem around those

00:10:52,209 --> 00:10:57,370
projects we think that the most

00:10:55,270 --> 00:11:00,010
important open source projects in the

00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:02,290
world are those that have sustainable

00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:02,920
ecosystems code that solves a big

00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:04,959
problem

00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:06,550
that's used to create value and

00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:09,459
commercial products and services

00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:12,850
is that value is that invested back into

00:11:09,459 --> 00:11:15,250
the project which gets more code which

00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:17,110
forgets more products and services which

00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:22,480
begets more value reinvested back in the

00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:25,750
project it looks like this at the Linux

00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:30,029
Foundation our goal for every project

00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:34,180
that we work on is to create this a

00:11:30,029 --> 00:11:37,750
trusted structure where anybody from any

00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:42,339
company from any country from any

00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:44,410
government can come in and use open

00:11:42,339 --> 00:11:49,180
source code from one of our projects to

00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:53,230
create services to create products that

00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:56,110
create profit that create value that

00:11:53,230 --> 00:12:00,130
gets reinvested back into the project

00:11:56,110 --> 00:12:05,860
and that software you can count on for

00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:08,350
five 10 20 years the Linux kernel is the

00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:10,720
best example of this in the world but

00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:16,480
today there are lots of other projects

00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:19,300
such as nodejs such as kubernetes such

00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:24,730
as hyper ledger that are just starting

00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:27,610
to enter this loop and we think that

00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:30,579
these projects are not just important at

00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:33,310
the kernel level at Linux but we're

00:12:30,579 --> 00:12:36,459
working on projects up and down the

00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:38,550
entire technology stack whether it's at

00:12:36,459 --> 00:12:41,079
programming frameworks like nodejs

00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:43,089
networking technology like open network

00:12:41,079 --> 00:12:45,480
automation platform data playing

00:12:43,089 --> 00:12:49,089
services with DPD KFD i/o

00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:53,370
we're creating value creating a complete

00:12:49,089 --> 00:12:56,370
stack but we think we can do even more

00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:59,320
because not only are these projects

00:12:56,370 --> 00:13:03,399
sustainable and important but we think

00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:06,070
we can lend best practices across all of

00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:08,620
these projects so today we have

00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:12,040
initiatives like the core infrastructure

00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:14,740
initiative which is applying security

00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:18,550
best practices across all open source

00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:19,310
projects secure coding practices better

00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:21,860
test

00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:24,980
frig responsible disclosure policy

00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:28,510
shared security knowledge across all

00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:30,140
open source projects we're building

00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:32,870
foundations that create a

00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:34,850
decision-making structure best practices

00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:36,920
around how to grow developers in your

00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:40,940
community across all open source

00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:43,870
projects we're creating the intellectual

00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:46,490
property sharing frameworks that allow

00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:48,650
organizations and any open-source

00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:51,760
project to share what they want to share

00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:55,420
and keep what they want to keep and

00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:58,250
finally we're providing training

00:13:55,420 --> 00:14:01,220
training in the form of developer

00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:04,190
courses developer testing and

00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:06,890
certification so that we can train the

00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:09,230
next generations of developers on this

00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:12,470
new technology and grow our communities

00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:19,940
even bigger no matter what community it

00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:22,850
is and so we are here in China at this

00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:25,460
event for the first time to work

00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:28,970
together with the incredible community

00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:30,830
here you know China is home to some of

00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:35,060
the most innovative technology companies

00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:37,190
in the world you know 10 15 years ago

00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:40,070
people used to say oh well Chinese

00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:42,490
companies they just sort of copy what

00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:46,520
American companies or other companies do

00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:49,130
that's not China anymore Chinese

00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:51,410
companies are innovating here creating

00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:53,890
incredible original products and

00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:57,110
experienced companies like wall way

00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:58,670
leading Network technology provider in

00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:59,030
the world and services company in the

00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:01,220
world

00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:04,900
companies like 10-cent Alibaba Baidu

00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:08,980
many many others and we think that as

00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:12,709
the companies and people here in China

00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:15,020
grow the in technology industry that big

00:15:12,709 --> 00:15:18,320
open source efforts will come out of

00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:22,990
China and join the rest of the globe in

00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:27,320
this shared innovation and like I said

00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:30,440
the Linux Foundation has grown 400% in

00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,910
the last year here in China look at all

00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,230
these companies that are participating

00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:37,210
in the land

00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:40,550
Foundation and we would love any

00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:42,890
individual any organization you don't

00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:46,280
even have to join to come and

00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:50,990
participate in our projects but most of

00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:54,080
all I do want to thank Huawei you know I

00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:57,620
met with huawei's management team their

00:15:54,080 --> 00:16:00,080
CEO Eric Chu many years ago and Huawei

00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:02,900
made a strategic bet on open-source and

00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:04,790
became the first platinum member of the

00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:07,310
Linux Foundation and now sits on our

00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:09,080
board of directors Huawei is a great

00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:11,930
example of a company that's leading the

00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:13,820
way in open source that is ready to

00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:16,790
harvest and is currently creating

00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:18,290
tremendous value from open source

00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:23,270
technology and we're going to hear from

00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:26,240
Huawei today and finally we are

00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:29,960
expanding here in Asia and the Linux

00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:32,690
Foundation is committed to China I've

00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:38,210
been coming to China for over 20 years

00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:40,040
and we are this year making a big

00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:42,410
commitment to China we're opening an

00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:45,380
office in Hong Kong we will be holding

00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:48,170
this event every year we're committed to

00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:50,570
working with organizations in China to

00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:54,320
deliver training to deliver content and

00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:56,600
to help organizations succeed with open

00:16:54,320 --> 00:17:00,080
source in China because we know

00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:03,680
something from years of working on open

00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:06,320
source and that is if individuals in

00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:10,990
China succeed if companies in China

00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:14,780
succeed with open source everyone

00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:18,020
succeeds no matter what country no

00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:20,870
matter what company and we think that is

00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:24,680
a great thing and that is what we are

00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:27,770
here to support so thank you so much for

00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:32,950
having us here today we look forward to

00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:36,100
working in China for decades to come

00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:36,100
