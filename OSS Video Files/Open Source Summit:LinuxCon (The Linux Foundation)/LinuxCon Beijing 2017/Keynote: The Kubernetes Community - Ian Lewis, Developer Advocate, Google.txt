Description: 
	Keynote: The Kubernetes Community [E] - Ian Lewis, Developer Advocate, Google

Kubernetes has emerged as a leading container management platform not just because of its technical capabilities, but also because of the tremendous open-source community that has powered its development. How did Kubernetes reach the top 0.01% of all Github projects based on stars analysis? In this talk, we will describe how the Kubernetes community organizes and runs the project, and some of the principles that the community has learned over its 2.5 years of rapid growth have been critical to its success.

thanks a lot so I'm here to talk about

00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:08,280
the covariance computer community so on

00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:11,040
as we all know Carini's is a very

00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:13,380
important project to Google and to a lot

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,049
of other folks in the open-source

00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:18,390
community so today I want to talk a

00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:22,529
little bit about the kubernetes project

00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:25,080
as a community project and how that the

00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:28,199
community of project is run and why is

00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:31,349
that successful and how that contributes

00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:36,540
of that to the success of kubernetes

00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:39,750
itself as a technology so kubernetes is

00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:43,620
a as we all know is a container

00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:46,020
orchestration system it's essentially

00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:49,469
what we like to call container centric

00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:51,360
infrastructure so not just deploying any

00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:53,640
different any type of application

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:57,030
this is focused directly on containers

00:00:53,640 --> 00:01:02,809
and is container native from the very

00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:05,339
beginning it's inspired by Google's own

00:01:02,809 --> 00:01:07,740
experience deploying systems using

00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:12,090
container technology Google has been

00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:15,270
doing deploying containers in at Google

00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,210
for about 10 years so all applications

00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:21,930
at Google are deployed using containers

00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:23,369
everything from search to Gmail etc so

00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:25,619
crew Varney's is also a really good

00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:27,630
project in the sense that we we've had

00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:30,090
experience of building things like that

00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:32,310
for the last 10 years and we want to can

00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:35,909
bring that out into the open source

00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:37,799
community it runs pretty much anywhere

00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:39,600
so it can run in cloud environments as

00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:43,649
well as on-premise on your own data

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:46,799
centers it was open source in 2014 and

00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:50,070
instead of keeping this project just to

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,720
Google we created the cncs which is the

00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:56,460
cloud native computing foundation in

00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:58,110
order to host kubernetes and to promote

00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:02,670
communities as a project in the

00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:04,920
open-source community the velocity of

00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,990
kubernetes is pretty astounding so what

00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,629
we have here is a graph showing the

00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:11,550
number of commits to the project and the

00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:13,270
number of the releases this is a little

00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:16,780
bit of a dated graph

00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:20,380
we have a huge velocity over the last

00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:23,620
three years but right now with after

00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:28,450
we've released 1.6 we're at well over 15

00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:30,280
or 50,000 commits so we're continuing on

00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:32,520
this trajectory and we're continuing to

00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:39,040
like get more and more product to

00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:41,830
commits and contributors the community

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:45,130
growth is quite large so we can see that

00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:48,040
the number of active contributors to

00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:50,200
communities this is a weekly graph so

00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:54,190
like a week over week I think that dip

00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:56,380
there is Christmas but we can see that

00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:57,850
even some people are committed are

00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:59,290
committed to cuber needs well enough

00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:01,650
that they're committing over their

00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:04,540
Christmas holiday but we have well over

00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:07,530
15,000 for tribute or 1,500 contributors

00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:11,740
to the kubernetes project itself and

00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:13,750
that spans over 15 time zones so that

00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:17,140
means that pretty much any time zone

00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:21,630
that you happen to go to would you know

00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:21,630
have a communities contributor in it

00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:28,090
also very important to the project is

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:31,080
the the composition of the community if

00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:34,210
this was a 100 percent or a very largely

00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,800
Google driven project then we don't see

00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:37,690
it think that it would succeed as an

00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:41,400
open-source project it's a very

00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:44,080
important that we have other developers

00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,970
contributing to the project and even

00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,660
develop contributing more than Google

00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:52,510
does so we can see here that before 1.0

00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:56,200
that Google was about 3/4 of all of the

00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:59,500
commits to kubernetes but between 1.0 to

00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:02,170
1.5 we actually have more commits via

00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:04,270
other people in the community so we can

00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:08,890
say on aggregate

00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:12,010
even over 1.0 to 1.5 Google is not the

00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:13,540
highest contributor so we can say this

00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:17,170
actually even goes further nowadays

00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:18,970
which we're on Google is actually not

00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:21,580
the top contributor it's actually

00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:23,800
individual contributors so essentially

00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:25,540
the long tail of individual developers

00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,010
that are contributing to communities is

00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:29,800
actually the largest

00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:33,910
group of contributors rather than any

00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:36,700
one single company so what drives this

00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:38,560
kind of success this is a this is

00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:40,540
something that has been a core part of

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,720
the kubernetes project from the very

00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:46,210
beginning that we do everything in the

00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:48,190
open so everything in the communities

00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:49,780
project is done in the open all the

00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:53,440
development is done we open all the

00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:56,140
design work all of the decisions for

00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,690
which new features to include is all

00:04:56,140 --> 00:05:00,490
done in the open this is something that

00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:04,510
we felt was very important for the

00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:07,300
success of the project so we see this as

00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:10,480
a kind of like a very large community

00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:13,150
that we need to grow and and to and to

00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:18,360
do that we read to be very engaged so we

00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:20,770
think so we encourage users to develop

00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:23,800
communities of their own in local areas

00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:28,060
by creating meetup groups and sharing

00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:31,240
information with local developers and -

00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:33,130
as well as helping not just users but

00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,800
developers that want to build things on

00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:38,770
kubernetes there are now over 4,000

00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:41,140
projects based on kubernetes so things

00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:43,540
that use the kubernetes api to build on

00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:45,670
top of kubernetes these improvements or

00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:47,860
some projects include things like you

00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:50,650
know like open shift and other these

00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:52,920
other type of past solutions as well as

00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:55,960
many other different types of projects

00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:57,790
all of the projects that are all the

00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:00,610
pieces of kubernetes are also open

00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:02,500
sourced so things like the UI dashboards

00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:05,860
and things like that are all open source

00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:07,900
projects based on kubernetes and then

00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:11,740
where the users and the developers in

00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:14,320
the wider community are not able to fill

00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:18,150
a particular need we work with vendors

00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:21,420
and other companies too in order to

00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:24,960
essentially plug the holes in where

00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:28,450
kubernetes this week so things like

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:30,400
providing support and providing ways of

00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:33,430
development like starting new clusters

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:36,070
easily things like that can be developed

00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:38,830
by vendors so these are the types of

00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:40,529
this type of ecosystem of just not just

00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:42,649
users and

00:06:40,529 --> 00:06:45,059
users but developers as well as vendors

00:06:42,649 --> 00:06:47,189
creates this virtual cycle that allows

00:06:45,059 --> 00:06:50,309
us to develop to grow the community and

00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:56,579
create a much more robust and good

00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:59,789
project and this project this community

00:06:56,579 --> 00:07:03,479
is made up of all of these companies

00:06:59,789 --> 00:07:06,629
that you see here and more so companies

00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:11,159
like like not just Google but you know

00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:13,109
Fuji to Huawei Red Hat core OS many of

00:07:11,159 --> 00:07:15,469
these companies are contributing to

00:07:13,109 --> 00:07:17,639
kubernetes and working in the community

00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:19,349
building projects around Carini's

00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:23,039
building products around kubernetes

00:07:19,349 --> 00:07:26,519
building supports support systems and

00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:30,389
support solutions on top of kubernetes

00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:39,779
and essentially building a much more

00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:41,759
robust and in stable community but

00:07:39,779 --> 00:07:43,379
building an open-source community comes

00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,919
with a lot of challenges and there's a

00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:48,809
lot of costs to companies like google

00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:50,879
contributing to open source and putting

00:07:48,809 --> 00:07:53,969
their their weight behind a particular

00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:56,429
project so many of the things that you

00:07:53,969 --> 00:07:59,189
can kind of imagine are on here but some

00:07:56,429 --> 00:08:01,079
are a little less obvious so things like

00:07:59,189 --> 00:08:02,759
the fact that it's time-consuming it's

00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:05,419
very time consuming for developers in

00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:09,989
the project of at Google to spend time

00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:11,939
supporting and nurturing and building

00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:14,189
the community around Carini's rather

00:08:11,939 --> 00:08:15,569
than just committing code right we think

00:08:14,189 --> 00:08:17,699
that it's important to grow the

00:08:15,569 --> 00:08:20,399
community as well as building code so we

00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:23,219
actually think that it's worth it to

00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:26,039
spend this time cultivating the

00:08:23,219 --> 00:08:28,169
community it's also 24/7 so that means

00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:31,559
that even though many of the developers

00:08:28,169 --> 00:08:33,750
are based in the US we still have things

00:08:31,559 --> 00:08:35,939
going on around the world so when we

00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:39,079
need to have a more robust community in

00:08:35,939 --> 00:08:43,379
order to allow that to continue on a

00:08:39,079 --> 00:08:47,660
24/7 basis and have local community

00:08:43,379 --> 00:08:51,540
resources within individual time zones

00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:54,329
so another thing is that that tools are

00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:56,869
very difficult to deal with at a lot

00:08:54,329 --> 00:08:59,999
when you get to a large project and

00:08:56,869 --> 00:09:02,069
these can be like a fairly large drag on

00:08:59,999 --> 00:09:05,970
the velocity all the things that I've

00:09:02,069 --> 00:09:07,679
talked about above also when you really

00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:10,649
start to build a project like this many

00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:12,869
of the other companies and the the

00:09:10,649 --> 00:09:15,329
members of the community can feel that

00:09:12,869 --> 00:09:18,269
they don't really have to contribute and

00:09:15,329 --> 00:09:19,739
don't get anything out and basically get

00:09:18,269 --> 00:09:21,769
all of the benefits out of it this is

00:09:19,739 --> 00:09:26,040
essentially the tragedy of the Commons

00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:27,749
but building a very nurturing community

00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:30,269
and a community where it's easy to get

00:09:27,749 --> 00:09:32,399
started and to contribute kind of helps

00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:37,739
with this and allows more people to to

00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:39,299
contribute so how do you you know

00:09:37,739 --> 00:09:41,819
address all these problems and how do

00:09:39,299 --> 00:09:44,069
you make a community like this work so

00:09:41,819 --> 00:09:46,799
one of the most important things is

00:09:44,069 --> 00:09:49,829
inclusion so inclusion means including

00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:52,879
as many different types of people in the

00:09:49,829 --> 00:09:57,110
project as possible we do this by

00:09:52,879 --> 00:10:01,499
creating a safe place or a safe

00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:04,259
community where people can do things and

00:10:01,499 --> 00:10:07,470
build the community build communities in

00:10:04,259 --> 00:10:09,149
a more constructive way so this means

00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:13,110
that we have things like a code of

00:10:09,149 --> 00:10:16,739
conduct and we make it clear that that

00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:18,749
people should not be engaging in things

00:10:16,739 --> 00:10:20,160
like harassing behavior as part of the

00:10:18,749 --> 00:10:24,319
project and that makes it much easier

00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:27,209
for for new people to join this project

00:10:24,319 --> 00:10:30,089
we also have cross organizational teams

00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:31,619
so within so the criminis project

00:10:30,089 --> 00:10:34,459
includes many many people who are

00:10:31,619 --> 00:10:37,169
working at companies that are and

00:10:34,459 --> 00:10:39,660
contributing to kubernetes as well as

00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:42,269
individual contributors and so we need

00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:44,339
to have a way of communicating with all

00:10:42,269 --> 00:10:47,429
of these different stakeholders in

00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:48,989
different parts of that are working on

00:10:47,429 --> 00:10:50,819
different parts of kubernetes and so we

00:10:48,989 --> 00:10:56,009
have these cross organizational teams

00:10:50,819 --> 00:10:59,189
and those are essentially called special

00:10:56,009 --> 00:11:01,049
interest groups that can be then can

00:10:59,189 --> 00:11:03,720
focus on a particular area of kubernetes

00:11:01,049 --> 00:11:06,689
so that means that that makes it easier

00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:08,250
to scale up kubernetes where developers

00:11:06,689 --> 00:11:10,170
can focus on the area of

00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:13,200
where they have the most expertise and

00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:17,990
the most knowledge and not get bogged

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:20,760
down in the overall churn of the project

00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:23,340
next is transparency so transparency is

00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:25,920
also very huge part of developing an

00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:27,530
open-source project we elected to do

00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,210
everything in the open

00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:38,010
including the deciding which features to

00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:39,450
build and which um and the kind of doing

00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:42,660
the discussion of all the design of

00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:44,940
those features out in the open and this

00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:48,870
we think can take takes a little bit

00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:52,200
more time to actually break that down

00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:55,200
and come in to get a design worked for a

00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:57,180
new feature but by doing it it

00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,610
transparently in the open we end up

00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:01,950
getting better solutions we come up with

00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:03,420
better I we get better ideas included

00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:07,910
even though it takes a little bit more

00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:10,830
time to get things yet things decided

00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:13,080
also like you know ownership goes along

00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:15,900
with these these cross and relational

00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:20,610
teams so like these the teams each own

00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:22,560
different parts of kubernetes and you

00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:24,089
know learning together is also the one

00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,820
of the most important parts of making

00:12:24,089 --> 00:12:28,530
things doing things out in the open many

00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:32,430
open source projects that are kind of

00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:33,990
backed by companies are done in a way

00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:36,810
that they do the new feature

00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:39,300
developments or a new feature deciding

00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:41,790
which features to build in a closed way

00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:43,470
and then just releasing the code we

00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:45,450
don't think that this is the right way

00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:48,900
of doing things we think that people

00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:50,630
will learn much better and get much more

00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:53,160
out of the project by learning together

00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:55,470
collaborating together talking about the

00:12:53,160 --> 00:13:00,210
idea the ideas these ideas in the open

00:12:55,470 --> 00:13:02,760
and developing these developing the

00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:04,740
project and allowing it to move in a

00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:06,680
direction that best fits the community's

00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:08,940
needs

00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:11,700
so I mentioned special interest groups

00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:14,100
this is an example of what those look

00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:16,080
like so special interest groups include

00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:18,300
many different companies or folks from

00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:21,570
many different companies and as well as

00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:26,570
independent developers many of them meet

00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:30,060
weekly and have over the the internet VC

00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:33,780
meetings to talk about the sort of the

00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:35,510
new features and and and hash out what's

00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:39,390
going on recently and things like that

00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:41,600
and so two of these examples one is

00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:44,220
cluster life cycle that's essentially

00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:47,220
talking about how to make communities

00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:49,560
easier to install and focus on how to

00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:52,970
get a cluster up and running and then

00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:55,110
the service catalog which is another

00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:57,570
special interest group that is focused

00:13:55,110 --> 00:14:00,390
on developing the the service broker

00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:01,560
there was many other servers in special

00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:03,630
interest groups

00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:05,820
so not just cluster lifecycle and

00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:07,820
service catalog we have apps which is

00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:10,850
focused on how on deploying applications

00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:13,620
to kubernetes we have things like

00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:16,580
on-prem which is focused on on-premise

00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:20,670
workloads we have things like windows

00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:22,830
running containers on windows as well as

00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:24,450
contributor experience so even things

00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:26,550
that are not technologically oriented

00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:29,310
but more how to make it easier for

00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:31,380
kubernetes developers to contribute to

00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:33,450
the project are also things like are

00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:36,450
also created special interest groups

00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:40,470
which focus on that area and makes a

00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:44,610
project a better make it a better

00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:47,850
project for for new contributors so this

00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:50,550
is a really key part to how to make the

00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:56,220
project scale to a larger size and as

00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:58,020
well as well as keep it successful so

00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:01,860
next i want to talk a little bit about

00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:03,240
transparency so the main thing that most

00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:04,920
people think about when they talk about

00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:07,620
when you think about transparency is the

00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:09,690
actual get hos github issues and and

00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:12,960
proposals as well as the commits for the

00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:16,950
code but it's not really just about that

00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:19,320
it's a whole range of things we found

00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:21,240
that just creating an open-source

00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,340
project and and sending out the codes

00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:28,350
and keeping the into the issues open is

00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:32,160
not the the not sufficient to having a

00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:34,020
good transparent project so we added

00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,430
things like these cig meetings so these

00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:38,880
community meetings

00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:41,490
turn down meetings for projects to to

00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:44,910
kind of assess how well the project went

00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:50,370
things like developing a new roadmap

00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:53,850
process so we used we started building a

00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:55,770
way to discuss which features that we

00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:57,839
wanted to add to the project in the

00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:59,850
future not just creating github issues

00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:02,910
but creating we created a whole new

00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:05,970
separate repository with with feature

00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:07,910
issues that people can talk about and

00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:10,709
comment on and then the next release

00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:12,630
when the next release comes around we

00:16:10,709 --> 00:16:14,220
can figure out exactly which features we

00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:16,350
want to have in these next the next

00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:20,130
release so we know where the developers

00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:21,360
can focus their attention so all doing

00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:23,070
all of these things in the open is

00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,380
important as a project so that everybody

00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:28,010
knows how things are decided knows how

00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:31,170
what things are going on knows how to

00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:33,300
how to contribute where things are where

00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:40,170
things are being decided things like

00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:43,830
that so I talked a little bit about the

00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:47,160
road map so we have like a semi-annual

00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:50,250
kind of unconference with cig groups to

00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:52,500
kind of figure out things like the

00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:56,400
themes and priorities and have a kind of

00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:58,620
a top-down plan and this gets kind of

00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:00,180
done at the start of each release so we

00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,920
have this the features repo as I

00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:04,140
mentioned and at the start of each

00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:06,689
release that gets populated with the

00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:09,059
features that that folks want to include

00:17:06,689 --> 00:17:13,559
in the race and then that's basically

00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:15,780
frozen about two weeks before two weeks

00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:18,809
into the into the development of that

00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:20,429
release so that each and then each and

00:17:18,809 --> 00:17:25,620
each issue is required to get sig

00:17:20,429 --> 00:17:30,690
approval so for on for the launch label

00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:34,140
to add it to the to the launch so this

00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:37,080
serves as a kind of like public way a

00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:39,960
public place to look and see it the new

00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:42,570
features that are being added to the to

00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:47,120
kubernetes and and see the design and

00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:47,120
how it's working it's being fleshed out

00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:53,110
so it is also added helped to add

00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:54,610
improvements to to documentation and

00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:58,120
blog coverage which is like really

00:17:54,610 --> 00:18:00,010
important too but challenging in open

00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:02,170
source we know when we create a new

00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:03,700
project or we create a new release we

00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:07,120
know exactly which features need

00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:13,410
attention in documentation and how to

00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:13,410
best explain those to to the developers

00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:20,140
so lastly we like we have wells so next

00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:22,900
we have ownership so ownership is

00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:24,460
essentially how to kind of progress in

00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:27,400
the project so you start as a

00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:30,700
contributor so contributors are actually

00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:32,680
programmers so and then we have product

00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:38,260
managers which work at individual

00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:40,960
companies and try to influence how what

00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:44,320
sort of features are added to kubernetes

00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:47,410
and help to integrate with their with

00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:51,370
the individual companies as well as cig

00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:53,170
leaders and release managers and each of

00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:55,150
these kind of OPA own like different

00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:57,340
parts of the of the project right so cig

00:18:55,150 --> 00:19:00,280
leaders kind of help coordinate a cig

00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:03,130
and the release managers actually do

00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:04,930
releases and contributors actually write

00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:07,810
the code so each of these can kind of

00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:09,220
work on their specific area and don't

00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:13,000
have to worry about all of the other

00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:15,130
things going on and individual

00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,130
contributors can also like kind of rank

00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:21,340
up in their involvement with the project

00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:24,370
and grow in responsibility so just being

00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:26,620
a developer that adds code to the

00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:29,410
project as a member you can then become

00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:31,600
a reviewer to review other patches to

00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:34,570
the project eventually you can become an

00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:37,420
approver somebody who can approve PRS to

00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:38,950
the via to the project and then finally

00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:46,360
an owner of a particular area of the

00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:48,160
project so finally like we when I talked

00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:49,300
about like that we learned together one

00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,680
of these things like we talked about

00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:52,750
burn down meetings and we talked about

00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:57,790
other different types of meetings that

00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:59,620
we can have like we definitely don't

00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:01,450
know like everything about how to where

00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:04,659
in a project but we know that the

00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:08,139
types of doing these meetings very often

00:20:04,659 --> 00:20:10,120
and and kind of evaluating how things

00:20:08,139 --> 00:20:13,269
have run in the past and how things are

00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:15,299
doing housing how we can improve things

00:20:13,269 --> 00:20:20,139
in the future has really helped us to

00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:22,210
evolve the project so here's some user

00:20:20,139 --> 00:20:24,429
feedback on the project so not just from

00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:27,429
end users and developers but also like

00:20:24,429 --> 00:20:29,260
you know companies that are that feel

00:20:27,429 --> 00:20:31,419
that not just the technology but the

00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:34,179
fact that the open source project itself

00:20:31,419 --> 00:20:39,010
is so successful when gives them

00:20:34,179 --> 00:20:45,220
confidence in how to move to that in the

00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:47,919
future so I'm so we've seen that like

00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:50,169
from user feedback that that import open

00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:54,639
source is very important over half are

00:20:50,169 --> 00:20:56,740
very important or critical and that

00:20:54,639 --> 00:20:59,470
these types of projects the fact that

00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:02,500
they are they are have a good community

00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:06,850
that's easy to get involved in and and

00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:08,649
is able to be scale properly it's very

00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:11,950
important to the actual success of the

00:21:08,649 --> 00:21:15,940
project and whether users and companies

00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:21,669
adopt it so here's some kind of sample

00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:25,929
talks from from coupon sorry and that

00:21:21,669 --> 00:21:28,899
you can kind of check out but um I just

00:21:25,929 --> 00:21:30,549
want to like close by saying that that

00:21:28,899 --> 00:21:33,100
it's very easy to join the kubernetes

00:21:30,549 --> 00:21:36,690
project just go to github slash

00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:39,970
kubernetes and check it out as well as

00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:42,100
you know join the the slack channel so

00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:44,200
from the kubernetes website there's a

00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:46,870
slack you link and you can check that

00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:48,399
out in order how to get more involved

00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:52,679
with this special introduce groups and

00:21:48,399 --> 00:21:52,679
