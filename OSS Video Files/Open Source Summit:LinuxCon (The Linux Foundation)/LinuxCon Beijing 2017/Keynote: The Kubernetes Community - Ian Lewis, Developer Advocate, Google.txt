	Keynote: The Kubernetes Community [E] - Ian Lewis, Developer Advocate, Google

Kubernetes has emerged as a leading container management platform not just because of its technical capabilities, but also because of the tremendous open-source community that has powered its development.

In this talk, we will describe how the Kubernetes community organizes and runs the project, and some of the principles that the community has learned over its 2.5 years of rapid growth have been critical to its success.
