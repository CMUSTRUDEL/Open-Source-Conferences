	Keynote: OpenStack Playing for an Open World - Jonathan Bryce, Executive Director, OpenStack Foundation [E]

About Jonathan Bryce
Jonathan Bryce, who has spent his career building the cloud, is Executive Director of the OpenStack Foundation. Previously he was a founder of The Rackspace Cloud.

He started his career working as a web developer for Rackspace, and during his tenure, he and co-worker Todd Morey had a vision to build a sophisticated web hosting environment where users and businesses alike could turn to design, develop and deploy their ideal web site â€“ all without being responsible for procuring the technology, installing it or making sure it is built to be always available. This vision became The Rackspace Cloud. Since then he has been a major driver of OpenStack, the open source cloud software initiative.

good morning everyone it's really nice

00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:09,150
to be here in Beijing and to be able to

00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:12,540
speak with you at this first lc3 event

00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:19,740
in China to start with how many of you

00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:22,380
are familiar with OpenStack okay I have

00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:25,859
a couple of slides on OpenStack that I

00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:26,900
can get to for those of you that didn't

00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:29,580
raise your hand

00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:32,219
OpenStack as Jim mentioned is an

00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:36,660
open-source project and as you heard

00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:40,500
from from our previous speaker it's used

00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:43,820
as software that can create clouds can

00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:46,260
create private clouds public clouds and

00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:48,660
and what that means is that you can take

00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,940
all of the servers and the storage in

00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:53,670
your data center put an API on them and

00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:55,890
then automate it and build lots of

00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:59,219
products and services on top of that so

00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:01,800
that's a that's pretty useful and in a

00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:05,309
lot of different areas when we ask

00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:07,340
people why they use OpenStack these are

00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:10,260
the top three reasons that they tell us

00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:14,189
they're able to reduce their costs

00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:16,170
they're able to be more efficient in

00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:19,680
their operations and they're able to

00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:21,390
move faster and as we heard from some of

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,909
the previous speakers that last one is

00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:27,509
especially important in today's economy

00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:29,700
and it's something that is on the minds

00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:33,000
of everyone in business and and really

00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,439
in every organization how do you go

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,689
faster and how do you accomplish your

00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:37,740
goals more quickly and I think that one

00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:41,970
of the things that's really interesting

00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:45,210
about where we are in in technology

00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:48,600
right now is that software has become a

00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:50,250
really key part of meeting all of our

00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,439
organization's goals I want to talk a

00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:54,960
little bit more about that in a bit but

00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:56,850
first of all so who's using OpenStack in

00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,189
these ways a lot of companies across

00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:01,920
many many industries and you'll notice

00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:05,460
some leading companies from China up

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:09,959
here as well like China UnionPay state

00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:13,290
grid JD comm Dongfang motors and others

00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:13,990
and all over the world we have we have

00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:16,810
OpenStack

00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:21,940
users who are you can OpenStack for all

00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:24,250
kinds of youth cases if you go to to our

00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:27,430
website at OpenStack org slash users you

00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:30,490
can find lots of examples of what people

00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:32,260
are doing with it and how they are you

00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:37,270
know using OpenStack to build clouds and

00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:38,560
their businesses when I say that a lot

00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:40,750
of people are using OpenStack that

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,350
includes big companies like fortune

00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:46,360
fortune 100 companies over half of them

00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:49,050
have OpenStack deployed but it also

00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:52,330
includes many many small companies

00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:55,300
universities research institutions and

00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:58,570
around the world there are over 5

00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:01,090
million physical cores of computing

00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:03,970
power that that we've been able to track

00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:06,670
that that are managed by OpenStack so

00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:12,250
that's pretty cool to think about 5

00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:15,070
million cores of capacity all in these

00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:17,590
clouds and all being used to accomplish

00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:18,780
different kinds of research and business

00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:22,690
goals

00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:25,390
now as Jim mentioned I'm from the the

00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:28,120
OpenStack foundation which is similar to

00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:30,250
the Linux Foundation we are an

00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:33,160
organization that manages the community

00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:35,500
of software developers who create

00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:37,600
OpenStack and also the users that

00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:40,180
consume it and build clouds with it and

00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:42,220
the OpenStack foundation has strong

00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:44,860
support from many companies around the

00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:46,630
world these are just our Platinum and

00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:48,670
Gold members and again you'll notice

00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:51,520
that we have a lot of representation

00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:53,620
from China in here and and it's actually

00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:56,100
been the fastest growing area of the

00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:59,710
world for us over the last two years

00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:03,640
companies like Wally are very involved

00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:05,920
in OpenStack both in terms of developing

00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:08,800
the software but also in creating

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:11,410
products and in helping companies all

00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:14,290
around the world to use OpenStack and we

00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:17,410
also have a number of startup companies

00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:20,920
who are here in Beijing and also in

00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:23,860
Shanghai who have created new businesses

00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:25,100
around OpenStack companies like easy

00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:27,980
stack

00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:31,100
easy stack recently raised 50 million US

00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:33,830
dollars in venture funding and there

00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:36,800
they're based here in Beijing United

00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:43,100
stack 99 cloud and others as well as

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:47,120
very big companies like VTE and and h3c

00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:49,940
and others so the the China community

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:53,960
with an open stack is very strong and

00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:56,000
growing and and so I here in Beijing

00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:58,480
this week and I'll actually be coming

00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,370
back in a month for another event and

00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:04,540
overall it's a very large global

00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:07,640
community that that makes up OpenStack

00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:09,920
so how does this community work you know

00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:12,290
if you are interested in being part of

00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:14,390
open-source as we've heard about a lot

00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:16,940
today what are the things that you need

00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:19,100
to do that you should should try to do

00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:21,110
well being at an event like this is a

00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:23,500
great step to getting involved in

00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:26,420
open-source as we've heard there are

00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:30,380
leaders from the Linux community as well

00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:33,740
as exciting new projects like kubernetes

00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:36,920
and hyper ledger and others all here and

00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:38,990
so this is a great event to come to to

00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:41,330
meet people who are contributing to the

00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:44,090
software and to be able to find out how

00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:48,050
you can get involved and then once you

00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:51,580
do that then all these open-source

00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:54,950
communities they use many tools online

00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:56,960
in order to to collaborate and that

00:05:54,950 --> 00:06:00,830
sometimes that can be a difficult thing

00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:03,830
and can be kind of frightening at first

00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:06,680
to get involved in but as you begin to

00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:10,220
participate in these communities you'll

00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:12,740
find that it is it's very rewarding to

00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:14,150
work with with very smart developers

00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:16,640
from all over the world and from many

00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:18,680
companies in many industries together as

00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:22,460
you as you build this software together

00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:24,740
and in the OpenStack community OpenStack

00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:29,780
was started in the US but very quickly

00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:31,880
we had developers from from China as

00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:34,730
well as other countries that started to

00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:37,160
get involved and those developers have

00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:38,840
helped our community become more

00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:42,949
friendly and

00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:44,360
more welcoming to two companies and two

00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:46,729
developers from all over the world and

00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:49,819
so if you join a community you know

00:06:46,729 --> 00:06:52,430
participate and also help them

00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:54,800
understand you know what we can do to

00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:58,279
better serve you and our communities

00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:01,059
things like having meetings in a time

00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:04,639
zone that is a you know better for you

00:07:01,059 --> 00:07:06,650
making sure that we put effort into

00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,629
translation you know these are all

00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:10,580
things that software projects need and

00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:15,860
there are ways that you can have an

00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:18,499
impact in Native communities OpenStack

00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:19,909
this is a chart of the contributions

00:07:18,499 --> 00:07:21,349
that have come in to OpenStack over the

00:07:19,909 --> 00:07:23,689
last few years and you'll see that it

00:07:21,349 --> 00:07:27,110
continues to grow over a hundred

00:07:23,689 --> 00:07:30,800
thousand change sets from 3,500

00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:34,520
developers in 2016 was was what we had

00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:38,300
and we added 1600 new developers last

00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:40,339
year about 250 of those new developers

00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:46,069
were from here in China so it's a very

00:07:40,339 --> 00:07:47,870
big area of growth and our process we

00:07:46,069 --> 00:07:51,770
work on a six-month release process and

00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:53,180
then every six months we have a new

00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:56,029
release of OpenStack and then that gets

00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:59,749
turned into products and services that

00:07:56,029 --> 00:08:02,930
the companies can consume and and build

00:07:59,749 --> 00:08:05,509
their businesses off of so that's a

00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:08,990
little bit about OpenStack and what I

00:08:05,509 --> 00:08:10,610
wanted to talk about to finish up it's a

00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:12,740
little bit more about open source

00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:16,580
overall I've been involved in open

00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:19,279
source for a couple of decades now and a

00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:21,379
lot of the things that we heard Jim talk

00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:24,889
about that we heard professor we talked

00:08:21,379 --> 00:08:29,209
about I also believe very strongly open

00:08:24,889 --> 00:08:32,560
source I believe is absolutely about

00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:35,419
freedom about sharing but it is also

00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:38,029
about a better way to create

00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:41,510
intellectual property and I think that

00:08:38,029 --> 00:08:45,060
this is a motto that we have in the

00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:47,580
OpenStack community collaborate or die

00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:49,890
and I think that this is the reality for

00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:51,990
all of us now whether we are in an

00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:54,990
open-source community whether we are in

00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:57,960
a business or a research institution but

00:08:54,990 --> 00:09:01,020
we have to share information and we have

00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:03,900
to share the work as we create new

00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:06,180
intellectual property and why is that

00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:09,420
why is that well I think that it

00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:14,550
fundamentally has to do with the state

00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:16,020
of computing and information today this

00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:23,600
is a picture of me with my first

00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:27,270
computer I was a I was always a dork

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:29,400
that computer was this isn't in the 80s

00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:33,710
and that computer was a very powerful

00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:38,460
computer for the time and it cost about

00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:40,350
five thousand US dollars and so it was a

00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:43,080
you know it was the computer that I

00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:46,280
learned to program on and that I started

00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:49,770
to to kind of begin my career in in

00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:53,520
computer science however that computer

00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:55,770
is a not very powerful by today's terms

00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:59,160
you know the phone I have in my pocket

00:09:55,770 --> 00:10:01,500
is about three times more powerful as

00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:04,890
about three thousand times more capacity

00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:07,370
than that computer that I that I first

00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:09,720
started using so I'm walking around with

00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:12,960
millions of dollars of computing power

00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:15,660
in my pocket and it's not just our cell

00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:19,140
phones we know that there are smart home

00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:21,240
devices smart cars and basically what

00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:24,150
that means is that we are surrounded by

00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,800
supercomputers you know everyone has a

00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:29,220
supercomputer in their pocket

00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:31,200
a supercomputer in their car and and

00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:33,480
just incredible amounts of computing

00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:37,800
capacity and data centers around the

00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:40,170
world and what that is doing is it's

00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:42,990
enabling us to take on new challenges

00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:47,160
that we never would have thought about

00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:50,130
before so this is a picture from a

00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:52,560
keynote that was given in at the

00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:56,100
OpenStack summit in Barcelona by dr.

00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,800
Rosie Bolton dr. Bolton is a physicist

00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:02,120
who studies the universe

00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:06,140
and the picture behind her is a radio

00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:09,680
telescope image of a galaxy that's a far

00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:13,250
out in space and so what what she works

00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:16,010
on is is a new project that's called the

00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:20,149
Square Kilometre Array has anyone heard

00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:23,060
of the Square Kilometre Array yes okay a

00:11:20,149 --> 00:11:27,620
few people so the Square Kilometre Array

00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:31,070
is a radio telescope that is in the

00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:34,459
desert in South Africa and in the desert

00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:38,089
in Western Australia and it is a 50-year

00:11:34,459 --> 00:11:40,790
project to create the biggest science

00:11:38,089 --> 00:11:43,310
instrument that we have ever created in

00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:45,500
human history and with it

00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:49,519
we will be able to look out farther into

00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:52,310
space than ever before see larger pieces

00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:56,000
of the universe than we ever have before

00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:59,329
and better understand you know the

00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,709
nature of the physical world that that

00:11:59,329 --> 00:12:06,950
the physical universe that we live in

00:12:02,709 --> 00:12:10,100
however this creates a massive computing

00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:13,870
problem because the Square Kilometre

00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:20,510
Array when it comes online will generate

00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:24,290
5,000 petabytes every day of data 5,000

00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:26,959
petabytes and within its first decade of

00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:30,890
operation that will grow to 100,000

00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:33,649
petabytes per day and so they need more

00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:35,120
and more computing capacity but they

00:12:33,649 --> 00:12:38,060
also need better and more advanced

00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:41,510
systems to be able to analyze that

00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:44,720
interpret it and handle it and so as you

00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:47,089
look at all of the progress that we're

00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,370
going to make as humans you see that

00:12:47,089 --> 00:12:52,490
more and more human achievement is

00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:57,949
directly linked to our ability to make

00:12:52,490 --> 00:13:01,579
use of computing power and software is

00:12:57,949 --> 00:13:04,790
the key to unlocking that computing

00:13:01,579 --> 00:13:06,320
power and when software is now strategic

00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:08,240
to every organization that are out there

00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,800
I think that really changes

00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,209
fundamentally the way that we should

00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:13,670
create software

00:13:11,209 --> 00:13:15,740
that we should use software and that we

00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:19,100
should build ecosystems of companies

00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:21,079
around it and that is really why I

00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:26,209
believe so powerfully that open source

00:13:21,079 --> 00:13:29,329
is a better model for or creating this

00:13:26,209 --> 00:13:31,160
intellectual property and software and

00:13:29,329 --> 00:13:35,410
to go meet those goals like the Square

00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:37,879
Kilometre Array and and other massive

00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:40,850
movements that that we're working on as

00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:44,209
humans so you know open-source is really

00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:46,970
key to to this kind of thing I think

00:13:44,209 --> 00:13:49,339
that if you look at just one simple

00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:51,649
reason why and this is something that

00:13:49,339 --> 00:13:53,779
I've seen many technology companies go

00:13:51,649 --> 00:13:58,009
through a shift over the last few years

00:13:53,779 --> 00:14:00,740
with that open-source puts the user it

00:13:58,009 --> 00:14:03,589
puts the requirements directly in the

00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:06,319
middle of the software development

00:14:03,589 --> 00:14:08,089
process and that enables these

00:14:06,319 --> 00:14:10,629
communities to move more quickly and to

00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:13,369
solve the right use cases

00:14:10,629 --> 00:14:15,829
Jim earlier talked about ecosystems and

00:14:13,369 --> 00:14:19,429
how sustainable ecosystems are key for

00:14:15,829 --> 00:14:22,220
open source and when when we look at the

00:14:19,429 --> 00:14:24,230
ecosystem and open source and OpenStack

00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:26,809
a lot of times we talk about three

00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:29,269
forces of an ecosystem you have to have

00:14:26,809 --> 00:14:31,999
the technology you have to have users

00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:33,829
and you have to have that that ecosystem

00:14:31,999 --> 00:14:35,600
of companies who are building products

00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:39,619
and services and reinvesting in it and

00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:41,299
if you get those in alignment then you

00:14:39,619 --> 00:14:43,879
have a sustainable ecosystem that can

00:14:41,299 --> 00:14:46,819
create great technology for years and

00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:51,049
decades to come the other trends that I

00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:52,939
think we're seeing too is this idea that

00:14:51,049 --> 00:14:55,160
that technology is being developed as

00:14:52,939 --> 00:14:57,589
open-source first again Jim touched on

00:14:55,160 --> 00:15:00,110
this so I won't belabor the point but if

00:14:57,589 --> 00:15:02,529
you look through the hottest areas of

00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:04,339
technology today with things like

00:15:02,529 --> 00:15:06,879
artificial intelligence and machine

00:15:04,339 --> 00:15:12,970
learning you'll see that companies are

00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:15,350
not developing the systems in their own

00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:17,269
organizations without sharing anything

00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:20,049
they're actually from the beginning as

00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:23,320
open-source sharing systems like

00:15:20,049 --> 00:15:26,589
tensorflow and torch

00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:30,100
and on and on Kafka and others and it's

00:15:26,589 --> 00:15:33,279
an incredible time that we live in where

00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:35,410
we can all have access to the technology

00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:38,320
that Google is building and that Huawei

00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:39,699
is building and that the scientists who

00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,589
are creating the Square Kilometre Array

00:15:39,699 --> 00:15:44,170
are building we can all have access to

00:15:41,589 --> 00:15:46,870
it and help them to develop the next

00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:49,000
wave of this so you know if you look at

00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:50,500
something like machine learning you have

00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,389
to have infrastructure for that you have

00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,649
to have an application management layer

00:15:52,389 --> 00:15:56,589
you have to have the machine learning

00:15:53,649 --> 00:15:58,329
tool itself if you go back a couple of

00:15:56,589 --> 00:16:01,240
decades this probably would have been a

00:15:58,329 --> 00:16:03,670
proprietary stack but today you can have

00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:06,310
open stack projects you can have

00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:07,870
kubernetes you can have tensor flow you

00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:10,600
can have all of these systems working

00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:12,790
together to solve these problems in open

00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:15,730
source so yes I agree that open

00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:17,740
sustainable ecosystems are really the

00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:19,660
future of how technology gets developed

00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:21,810
and when you look at what we're all

00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:25,389
trying to do together I think that

00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:27,880
rather than infrastructure for roads and

00:16:25,389 --> 00:16:29,970
airports and trains we were actually

00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:33,160
creating infrastructure for ideas and

00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:37,149
that is why compute and human

00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:39,790
achievement are so interlocked so it's

00:16:37,149 --> 00:16:43,089
great to to be here at this first Lenox

00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:44,760
Khan event in China and I'm so happy

00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:47,620
that all of you are joining us too and

00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:49,120
hopefully you're already involved in

00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:51,370
open source and if you're not you can

00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,990
take this great opportunity to find

00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:54,880
different projects and start to get

00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:56,410
involved and help build this

00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:59,110
infrastructure for ideas and move

00:16:56,410 --> 00:17:00,730
everything forward one last thing before

00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:03,760
I go

00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:05,679
in this the China National Convention

00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:07,839
Center here we are going to have an

00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:12,069
openstack event in just about a month

00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:15,010
and called OpenStack days China and if

00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:18,699
you are interested in learning more

00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:20,679
about OpenStack and cloud foundry and

00:17:18,699 --> 00:17:23,079
kubernetes and these users that I've

00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:24,520
talked about many of those projects and

00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:27,459
users will be back here in about a month

00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:30,100
and you can you can come join us then as

00:17:27,459 --> 00:17:32,409
well but thank you very much for for

00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:34,590
having me and look forward to a seenu's

00:17:32,409 --> 00:17:34,590
week

00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:38,099
