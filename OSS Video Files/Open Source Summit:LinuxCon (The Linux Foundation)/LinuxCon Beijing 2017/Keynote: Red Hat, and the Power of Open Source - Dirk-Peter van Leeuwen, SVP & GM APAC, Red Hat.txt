	Keynote: Red Hat, and the Power of Open Source [E] - Dirk-Peter van Leeuwen, SVP & GM APAC, Red Hat

Red Hat is the number one provider of commercial IT products and solutions based on open source. How did we get here? It all started with an operating system, a community, and a guy in a red cap.

The operating system was, of course, Linux--the reason that many of you are here. But the real star of the show isn’t the guy or even the red hat, it’s the community that continuously identifies the best new ideas--and then improves on them. Open source communities brought us the technologies that have transformed our world:  the internet, cloud computing, containers, and more.

Hear how Red Hat and its partners, customers, and contributors are helping build and strengthen the source of IT innovation--today, tomorrow, and for the future.

it is great to to be here I'm really

00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:09,929
really honored it's the very first time

00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:13,170
that I get to present and Linux come and

00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:16,440
I got to tell you a little bit of a

00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:19,560
personal story about that when I was 16

00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:22,769
years old from all the money I saved I

00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,359
bought my first computer and it was and

00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:29,939
I don't think many of you will know it

00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:33,600
but it was a zx80 from sinclair and now

00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:35,700
you know about how old I am and the nice

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,579
thing about it was that it had one

00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,870
kilobyte of memory and you can imagine

00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:42,270
what you can do with one kilobyte of

00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:44,460
memory all right now you can do nothing

00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:46,469
with the kilobyte of memory but at the

00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,270
time I managed to squeeze out as a

00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:49,649
youngster with not much money to buy

00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,039
anything more than one kilobyte of

00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:51,989
memory

00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:55,620
I managed to squeeze out a lot of this

00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:57,840
little machine I did it through coding

00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:00,270
not so basically even though that was

00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:05,090
the language which was supplied on the

00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:09,030
year on the zx80 I coded in assembly and

00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:11,250
I taught myself assembly and from

00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:16,320
assembly I told myself see and then I

00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:19,759
told myself C++ and many years later I

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:23,280
found myself and heading a technology

00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,900
department in an IT company writing

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:29,729
device drivers for Unix

00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:31,619
and then for Linux and I couldn't be

00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:34,890
happier to even though I'm no longer a

00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:37,530
developer I'm no longer the guy who

00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:39,479
works with the codes but I'm still in

00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:42,450
technology I'm still working with source

00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:44,000
code and I'm working for what I believe

00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:48,299
the most awesome company in the world

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,890
which is red head what I'm going to do

00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:52,159
today is I'm going to talk to you about

00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:55,610
red head I'm going to talk to you about

00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:59,460
why red head has been successful on

00:01:55,610 --> 00:02:01,170
making money with free software and why

00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:03,149
am I saying it so explicitly because

00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,820
I've heard this question being asked

00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:08,489
many many many times in the last few

00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:10,560
days most of the people here in the

00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:12,330
audience who I spoke to so far have

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,770
asked me so ok how do you make money

00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:17,170
with open-source

00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:19,330
so I'll tell you how we do it and I tell

00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:23,110
you why we are very committed to the

00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:25,720
principle of open source and and why we

00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:30,160
would want you to be - if you think you

00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:32,800
can monetize open source but first of

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,510
all let me let me brag a little bit

00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,120
even though that's not something we

00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:38,890
normally do amongst developers right but

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,650
bringing is okay friend of mine told

00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:44,770
told me if you telling something which

00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:46,600
is actually true so one thing we are

00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:50,980
very proud of his red head is that we

00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:55,360
have had sixty six zero quarters of

00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:56,830
consecutive growth and isn't it

00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,380
surprising to know that there is no

00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:01,720
other company in the world that has

00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:05,560
shown 60 consecutive quarters of

00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:09,070
consecutive growth not one quarter was

00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:13,210
less than the one before it's an amazing

00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:15,580
result but it's in my mind not just

00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:19,060
about the dollars that we made it's a

00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:22,230
reflection of open source adoption if

00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:28,330
you look at how these results stagger

00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:31,990
from 2003 to 2007 teen I was I joined

00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:33,940
redhead at the end of 2003 and if when I

00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:35,709
talk to a customer about open source

00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:38,230
when I talk to my customers right open

00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:41,920
source this was about the level of

00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:44,610
excitement we got if I now go to my

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:47,170
customers and I talk about open source

00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:50,590
this is the level of excitement I get

00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:52,959
and this level of excitement about open

00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:55,810
source has been growing and growing and

00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:59,440
growing with simply a reflection of it

00:03:55,810 --> 00:04:05,950
but this is why open source is such a

00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:08,680
great way of developing software so this

00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:11,170
numbers speak for themselves and the

00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:13,510
fact that we've made a solution at and

00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:16,209
monetized a business model around open

00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:17,919
source is something that really works it

00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:22,240
really works for us it can work for you

00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:25,270
too but it's all about being very very

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,200
committed to open source and we've been

00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:31,130
extremely committed to open

00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:33,740
we believe that everything we do needs

00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:37,630
to be contributing to the upstream

00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:40,460
community and the upstream community is

00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:42,500
extremely extremely important when it

00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:44,960
comes to making open source successful

00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:47,150
you can't do stuff in isolation you

00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:50,060
gotta have meritocracy you gotta have

00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:54,560
agreement about how software is being

00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:57,200
created written and deployed so it's

00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,419
therefore not about being the first it's

00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:02,120
about doing the right thing and that's

00:04:59,419 --> 00:05:04,280
what we very much believe in and by the

00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:06,919
way we also make mistakes we were

00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:09,200
probably not the first company to adopt

00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:10,520
OpenStack but when we realize how

00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:13,100
important it was going to be for the

00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:15,500
community we very quickly changed our

00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:19,400
minds and invested in it and now we're a

00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:21,050
leading player in OpenStack other things

00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:25,280
we did as you can see we did many

00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:27,260
acquisitions for example we acquired a

00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,960
company that was very strong in cloud

00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:33,950
management platforms which was manage IQ

00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:38,090
a proprietary solution only supporting

00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:40,760
VMware and what we always do and what

00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:43,630
we're very very committed to is when we

00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:47,090
acquire software that is not open source

00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:49,340
we will open source it as a matter of

00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:51,830
fact most of the due diligence we do

00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:55,880
about acquisitions of the companies we

00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:57,820
acquire is around how easy it is to open

00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:00,590
source the software that we do require

00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:02,919
so in the case of manage IQ there is now

00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:06,320
a product called Red Cloud forms and

00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:09,680
that has a community which is called the

00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:12,169
manager IQ community so the best proof

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,240
of all these things is actually also

00:06:12,169 --> 00:06:17,030
that we work not upstream alone would

00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:20,330
also look at downstream for example

00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:23,450
centerís when the center is people join

00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:25,310
redheads it gave us the ability to

00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:27,560
better understand the needs of our

00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:29,930
customers and it gave the center eyes

00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:32,330
community to better connect with redhead

00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:38,390
so we connect both upstream and

00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:41,690
downstream so upstream first

00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:45,190
is what is really all about making sure

00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:47,540
that whatever you do has the full

00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:51,800
commitment and acceptance of the

00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:54,080
open-source community so we've been

00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:56,150
collaborating and committing to hundreds

00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:59,350
and hundreds of projects upstream in the

00:06:56,150 --> 00:07:03,670
community the kernel docker

00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:08,120
OpenStack in kubernetes etc etc

00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:10,130
collaboration drives innovation the nice

00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,650
thing about this and that's what I

00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:14,780
firmly believe in is that with the

00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:16,910
business model we've created we've

00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:19,370
really become the first disruptor in the

00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:21,680
industry you can think about it redhead

00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:24,140
we had no intellectual property we don't

00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,900
only intellectual property yet we have a

00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:29,000
profitable business model this

00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:30,710
disruption is because of collaboration

00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,560
and collaboration that drives innovation

00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:37,430
and as we very very very strongly feel

00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:39,710
about we don't believe however in in

00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:42,710
committing half you can't be half

00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:44,270
pregnant right you have to be hundred

00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:47,480
percent committed to open source so

00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:49,370
things like open core models are not

00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:52,760
hundred-percent committing to open

00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:57,410
source and we want to be pure and clean

00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:59,810
about that 100% open source we also

00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:01,760
guide our customers in pockets in this

00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:03,470
direction I'll give you some examples of

00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:05,180
that later but customers and partners of

00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:07,460
red head often have questions around it

00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:09,800
how do you do it how do we contribute

00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:11,540
how can you help us and in the spirit of

00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:16,550
collaboration we're always happy to do

00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:20,390
so so here's our recipe this is how we

00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:24,800
do it this is how we make a product that

00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:27,200
we can commercially benefit from from an

00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,870
open source community if you look at

00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:32,630
this the open source community has many

00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:35,740
many open source projects from the

00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:38,120
projects you see many different

00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:40,640
distributions being created like fedora

00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:42,530
ohman hiq and all the others and from

00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:45,260
the distributions we create products

00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:47,660
like Enterprise Linux and those products

00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:48,670
we sell as a subscription to our

00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:51,430
customers

00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:53,680
and the way we summarize a subscription

00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:56,770
or subscription really is a subscription

00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:59,440
to a stream of innovation and it really

00:08:56,770 --> 00:09:01,150
covers all the risks that an enterprise

00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,250
customer would potentially have with

00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:06,220
using open source and we covered it the

00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:07,600
way I tell my mother sometimes is when

00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,950
she asked me what is what are you

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,320
actually selling because she thought

00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:12,850
about selling drugs I said no it's

00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:16,120
actually a subscription which I think

00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:18,310
and it is about and like an insurance we

00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:21,300
insure our customers they can use open

00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:24,010
source by adding the right value to it

00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:26,410
so building upstream distributions for

00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:29,500
commercial offerings is where you bring

00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:31,150
products together it's like making a raw

00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:34,360
offering like Fedora upstream

00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:38,440
israel--and over at upstream is is

00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:42,610
virtualization etc etc productizing

00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:45,880
things is a very viable subset of making

00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:47,590
solutions and of course making sure that

00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,630
the long life cycles that our customers

00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:52,080
need and the documentation and all the

00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:54,400
other value is there is important

00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,840
bringing this them to market is

00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:58,360
something that we don't do in isolation

00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:00,100
either we like to collaborate on all

00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:03,010
fronts so we do this through

00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:05,620
partnerships we got very many important

00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:07,500
valuable partnerships first of all in

00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:12,400
the clouds I like with Microsoft Azure

00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:14,350
AWS as well as Google cloud but also

00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:16,240
technology partners are very important

00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:17,980
because ultimately there is so much

00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,540
technology out there that needs to

00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:21,820
software solutions that it needs to

00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:23,590
connect well we have very important

00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:26,200
technology partners like Intel who is

00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:28,810
our oldest partner in that sense but to

00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:31,360
keep it local here for China Lenovo

00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:35,560
inspir while we're été they're very

00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:38,790
important partners for us and then on

00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:40,810
the other end we need partners that use

00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:43,420
implementation services system

00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:45,040
integrators system integrators that

00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:47,560
actually really understand very well

00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:50,020
what customers meet and enhance the

00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:51,370
challenge to bring that to life with the

00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:53,620
use of open-source solutions

00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:55,660
so our system integrator partners are

00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:58,540
many many as well but just to name a few

00:10:55,660 --> 00:11:01,300
from China there is uses technologies

00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:02,050
they are for the last six years ranked

00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:05,649
as the number

00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:07,720
one banking and IT solutions company and

00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:11,380
they're present in almost every bank in

00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:13,720
China then there is UEC which is a

00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:16,000
leading SI in China's finance and

00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:19,120
commercial and government center for

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,380
over 10 years so these are important

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:25,029
factors and there's many many more

00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:27,490
partners that we work with but working

00:11:25,029 --> 00:11:29,200
in an open source community is all about

00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:31,720
giving back is about sharing information

00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,740
so the information we're sharing and

00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:38,769
what we're doing is investing in buying

00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:40,810
and sponsoring research that will help

00:11:38,769 --> 00:11:42,220
us as well as our partners to understand

00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:44,670
the opportunity you have with open

00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:46,570
source these are some great examples of

00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:49,149
phenomenal phenomenal business

00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:54,550
opportunities that open source has to

00:11:49,149 --> 00:11:57,399
offer moving on if you didn't see what

00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:59,829
kind of customers are willing to pay for

00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:01,209
open source again one of these questions

00:11:59,829 --> 00:12:03,370
that many of you have been asking who is

00:12:01,209 --> 00:12:07,420
paying for open source it's mainly

00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:10,089
enterprise customers 100% of the fortune

00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:12,640
500 companies in these industries that

00:12:10,089 --> 00:12:14,800
you see here are using red head a

00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:16,660
hundred percent of Airlines a hundred

00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,730
percent of telcos a hundred percent of

00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:21,339
healthcare providers and a hundred

00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:26,079
percent of commercial banks are red head

00:12:21,339 --> 00:12:30,130
customers VTE is a great example the NEP

00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:32,020
telecom industry solutions GTE 5g micro

00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:34,959
services platform is based on vented

00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:37,270
solutions it enables ZTE to deliver

00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:40,300
micro services platforms with extreme

00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:42,610
fast service delivery and it helps CTE

00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,949
to establish a leading position in the

00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:46,899
global technical technical

00:12:43,949 --> 00:12:48,579
telecommunications market another great

00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:51,070
example is one of my favorites here in

00:12:48,579 --> 00:12:53,589
China is the Shenzhen Stock Exchange

00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:56,260
Shenzhen Stock Exchange is using red

00:12:53,589 --> 00:12:58,690
head both Enterprise Linux as well as

00:12:56,260 --> 00:13:01,510
JBoss middleware to run a highly

00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:03,640
competitive solution with extremely low

00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:06,459
latency that they need to stay

00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:08,970
competitive in the market and there's

00:13:06,459 --> 00:13:08,970
many other examples

00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:14,350
so Linux is the foundation of the modern

00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:17,830
infrastructure let's talk a little bit

00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:19,870
why Red Hat Enterprise Linux both

00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:22,540
hardware and software ecosystems are

00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:24,700
save and important for customers we

00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:27,220
started with Linux when it was just a

00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:31,440
physical solution and then came

00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:34,690
virtualization in the form of KVM VMware

00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:39,070
hyper-v but also things like our VM or

00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:40,720
even z/os from IBM who are currently

00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:44,290
platforms on which you can run

00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:47,050
Enterprise Linux in the recent years

00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:49,540
through higher degrees of self-service

00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:51,640
and automation new subscription offering

00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:53,740
and support both for public and private

00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:55,990
clouds have been been requested

00:13:53,740 --> 00:14:00,070
we call it the open hybrid cloud

00:13:55,990 --> 00:14:03,550
solution of which of all of these

00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:06,550
solutions Linux is the foundation if we

00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:10,000
then look at containers you can very

00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:13,140
easily come to the conclusion that Linux

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,060
and containers are almost the same

00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:18,460
developers get a great experience by

00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:21,280
container rising their applications the

00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:23,260
ease of use combined of testing and

00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:25,330
reliable foundation up for developers

00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:27,760
creating an environment in which you can

00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:30,160
very easily and very quickly develop and

00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:32,800
deploy solutions is what containers

00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:37,980
offer and is based on latest technology

00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:40,750
I would like to say containers are Linux

00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:43,360
we obviously work upstream very closely

00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:45,970
with the community in projects like

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:48,190
origins and we have a commercialized

00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:51,040
solution which we called open ships an

00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:52,800
open ships is a container platform that

00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,210
combines docker and kubernetes

00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:58,330
distributions and really allows our

00:14:55,210 --> 00:15:02,830
customers to very efficiently deploy

00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:04,390
containers so our interesting kubernetes

00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:08,170
was one of these projects that we were

00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:10,270
very early on participating in we saw

00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:12,370
the opportunity that kubernetes offered

00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:14,950
to our customers and we actively became

00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:17,380
a participant in that community we are

00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:18,899
now the second largest contributor after

00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:21,449
Google of course

00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:25,680
and combining that word OpenShift this

00:15:21,449 --> 00:15:27,959
really offers a great solution now

00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:32,459
bringing this all together in a vision

00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:36,600
that we already had in 2007 is a vision

00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:40,499
called any app anytime anywhere

00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:41,910
and this is a really powerful message

00:15:40,499 --> 00:15:45,740
just think about it

00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:48,240
running any app at any time you want it

00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:50,519
anywhere whether it is some physical or

00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,499
in the cloud it's such a powerful

00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:55,249
message and ten years ago we saw this as

00:15:52,499 --> 00:15:57,689
a vision and now we see it as a reality

00:15:55,249 --> 00:15:59,819
through our open shift container

00:15:57,689 --> 00:16:02,490
platform we enable our customers to

00:15:59,819 --> 00:16:08,699
containerized solutions and run them

00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:10,649
anytime anywhere at any and any app so

00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:12,360
this is the best enterprise platform for

00:16:10,649 --> 00:16:17,309
getting your code into production and

00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:19,769
it's really awesome I promise you a use

00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:23,370
case and one use case that I personally

00:16:19,769 --> 00:16:26,129
really like is Macquarie banking it's an

00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:29,269
Australian banking and they had the

00:16:26,129 --> 00:16:34,709
challenge to become a commercial bank

00:16:29,269 --> 00:16:36,480
they were actually a large and a very

00:16:34,709 --> 00:16:39,449
large multinational Bank operating in

00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,949
over 28 countries but they saw that

00:16:39,449 --> 00:16:43,800
there was an opportunity for them to

00:16:40,949 --> 00:16:46,050
leverage themselves as a commercial bank

00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,759
and to compete because currently to

00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:51,240
compete you don't necessarily need all

00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:52,889
these branches with their solution and

00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:56,339
with their technology they actually won

00:16:52,889 --> 00:16:59,819
the 2017 record Innovation Awards for

00:16:56,339 --> 00:17:03,480
Enterprise transformation so what did

00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:06,390
they do the mission was to build a

00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:09,299
digital retail bank to access and

00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:12,059
complete new customer segments the first

00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:15,029
priority was to choose the platform for

00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:17,610
execution and they chose red head open

00:17:15,029 --> 00:17:20,850
ships contain a platform in combination

00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:23,270
with rather than the price Linux they

00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:26,010
integrated a natural language processing

00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:28,139
facility that basically allows you to

00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:31,080
talk to your app on your iPhone and ask

00:17:28,139 --> 00:17:32,580
the bank hey Bank how much money did I

00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,830
spend on WeChat this year

00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:36,779
and you get an answer so great

00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:39,299
technology for them it isn't so

00:17:36,779 --> 00:17:42,210
important because they need to stay in

00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:43,980
it ahead of their competition so

00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:46,830
therefore they need to be able to deploy

00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:49,440
new code very quickly at least faster

00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:50,669
than the competitors but also they had

00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,230
some other challenges they want to

00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:54,539
collaborate with Red Hat because they

00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:56,490
had developed some solutions that they

00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:59,100
really needed to be supported upstream

00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:01,140
in the community and in good

00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:03,659
collaboration we help them to get this

00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:06,720
code accepted in the upstream Jenkins

00:18:03,659 --> 00:18:08,220
community just an example of how we help

00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:13,679
our customers to also get things

00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:15,539
upstream so basically with all of this I

00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:18,450
am very happy to share with you today

00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:20,820
how proud Red Hat is to be part of this

00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:22,279
open source community our relatives to

00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:26,130
have been accepted as a commercial

00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:28,470
company that has created a model that is

00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:31,649
commercially viable and that helps

00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:34,500
innovation grow faster and faster in a

00:18:31,649 --> 00:18:37,169
world that really needs it so we're very

00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:39,990
proud to be here today and the one thing

00:18:37,169 --> 00:18:42,419
I wanted to tell you if you want to be

00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:45,929
successful with a commercial solution
