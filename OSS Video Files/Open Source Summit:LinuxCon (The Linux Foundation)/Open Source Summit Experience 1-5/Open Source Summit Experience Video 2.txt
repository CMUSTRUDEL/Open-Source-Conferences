00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:11,570
I love the keynotes because they

00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:14,120
actually talked about what I like the

00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:16,340
most about community building what's up

00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,630
in open source and they actually told

00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:20,050
that open source is just not for

00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:23,330
technology it's the mindset in gender

00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:25,940

00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:27,680
it's all about the people and making

00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:29,240
sure that you're hearing what other

00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,840
people are up to and that they know what

00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,840
you're working on now

00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:34,970
