00:00:05,439 --> 00:00:09,110
there's just so much you can learn you

00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,309
can talk to people who actually work on

00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:12,139
a lot of the technologies that you're

00:00:10,309 --> 00:00:13,849
using at work and then there's always

00:00:12,139 --> 00:00:15,230
the opportunity to meet really amazing

00:00:13,849 --> 00:00:16,219
people from all around the world so I

00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:18,220
love that as well

00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:19,750

00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:21,400
Linux Foundation events are a great

00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:23,800
opportunity to engage with the community

00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,850
see what they're looking for in our

00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,930
solutions as well as meet with

00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:27,130
developers that might join our

00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:29,890
open-source community and help extend

00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:30,820
our own project and so we wanted to want

00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:32,920
to be part of the part of the

00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:38,539
conversation and get that feedback

00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:38,539
