like this is an awesome event to not

00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:13,139
only work with my counterparts and get

00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,490
the hallway track but also get more

00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:17,130
information about what I need to know

00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:18,869
around diversity and inclusion and using

00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,600
open source methodologies within my

00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:23,550
organization I think Linux foundation

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,380
events provide an opportunity for

00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,689
participants to get the full context

00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:29,160
really go deep in understanding what's

00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:30,870
happening in Linux and open source as

00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:35,899
well as many Industry friends

00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:35,899
