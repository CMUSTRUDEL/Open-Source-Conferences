00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:11,099
what we like about the attendees here is

00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:12,330
a very technical audience it allows some

00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:13,679
of the development community in the

00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:16,560
linux space to come talk to our

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,119
developers the Linux Foundation events

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,730
tend to draw the people who are actually

00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:22,380
working on open-source projects so I get

00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,390
a chance to meet with people who are

00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:28,199
also working in upstream communities and

00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:30,860
people who are actually influencing the

00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:35,899
way open-source is developed

00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:35,899
