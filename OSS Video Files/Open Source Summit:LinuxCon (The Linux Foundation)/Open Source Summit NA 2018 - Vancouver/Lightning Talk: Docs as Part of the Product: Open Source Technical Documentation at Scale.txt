Description: 
	Lightning Talk: Docs as Part of the Product: Open Source Technical Documentation at Scale - Den Delimarschi, Microsoft

When someone says “documentation” they imagine a boring set of articles or API stubs hosted somewhere on a site nobody will find outside an occasional pointer from a search engine. Docs can be out-of-date, inaccurate or related to an old product version. What if we move away from traditional paradigms, to a world where creating and consuming docs is enjoyable, while making them more collaborative and interactive, ensuring there is always relevant sample code that works? Den covers the journey of swapping out the world’s largest technical docs site (MSDN), with a lean open-source cloud solution that scales for any platform, making it a key part of Microsoft products, with better reliability AND attracting a community of OSS developers helping make docs more useful for everyone. Den will also talk about ways in which products can grow their communities by encouraging contributions to docs.

hi everybody my name is Dan Delamar ski

00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,150
I'm from Microsoft I'm not the official

00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:12,030
spokesperson but Linux is awesome

00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:14,250
my team uses a lot of it so I'm

00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:18,060
personally part of the docs on my comm

00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:20,880
team we've done a lot of work to migrate

00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:23,640
our closed in close source solution to

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,590
an open one so this is a short talk

00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,980
about how we did it and some lessons

00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:31,019
learned so ducks part of the product so

00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:34,320
key principles that we could have

00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:35,640
established for ourselves as we grew and

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,250
as we were thinking about moving from

00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,780
MSDN to this new solution number one we

00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,940
wanted to go where the community is if

00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,670
we would open source our documentation

00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:46,680
this means we want to go where people

00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:49,230
are and it so happened that people are

00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,600
in github but we'll get to that the

00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:54,180
other one was relying on standards and

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,010
tooling that is actually used in the

00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,449
industry we did not want to reinvent the

00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:59,760
wheel we did not want to create stuff

00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:01,170
that is used just within Microsoft we

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,199
wanted to listen and respond to feedback

00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:06,659
we wanted to automate things and above

00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:08,610
all we wanted to be the ones that also

00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:10,049
consumed that system so it's not just

00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:13,590
something that we just push out to the

00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:15,630
world and let it just be out there so

00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:17,610
going where the community is we like to

00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:19,950
think of our team as we were using

00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:22,799
github before we acquired github it's

00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:25,740
the one place where open-source software

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,479
happens community is there a lot of

00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:29,549
people that use github they know how to

00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:32,250
use it they know how to fork repos and

00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:34,140
know how to issue PRS those the perfect

00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:38,100
place to grow the documentation system

00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:40,470
on top of so content management at scale

00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:42,540
so when it comes to us documenting many

00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:44,070
many many open-source products that we

00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,799
have and even products that are not open

00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:48,450
source it's very easy all you need to do

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,310
is just create a new repository and it's

00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,750
right there

00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:53,759
contributions are also easy it's very

00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:55,110
hard to point someone in this room and

00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,329
find somebody that doesn't know how to

00:01:55,110 --> 00:02:00,240
use github so like I said for Cori PO

00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:03,960
edit submit PR will review the change

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:06,180
and it will merge it relying on standard

00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,099
formats and tooling that was key to us

00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:10,050
we did not want to remain the wheel we

00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:12,950
did not want to create another flavor of

00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:14,930
flavor of XML or JSON or

00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:16,520
anything that's specific to us we wanted

00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:19,069
to use something that a community uses

00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:21,019
so markdown again going back to the

00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:23,450
history of github you know what a

00:02:21,019 --> 00:02:25,160
markdown was used very widely so that

00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:27,650
was our foundation as well so we use a

00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:30,260
common mark compliant flavor of markdown

00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:32,540
any extensions anything that we build on

00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:34,750
top of it clearly documented anybody can

00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:36,290
reuse it tools to auto-generate

00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:38,330
documentation we wanted to make sure

00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:40,790
that any api that we document is not

00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:43,910
documented by hand so in the days of on

00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:46,010
Sdn everything was handwritten tens of

00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:47,959
thousands of Doc's were created manually

00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:50,060
so brightest would you know toiled day

00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:51,170
and night and create them it was very

00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:54,530
cumbersome and very it was very

00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:56,269
cumbersome to edit modify remove and

00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:57,980
sunset and so on so we decided to

00:02:56,269 --> 00:03:00,860
automate that process and also get to in

00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:02,989
a second we wanted to also listen and

00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:05,930
respond to feedback so one of the key

00:03:02,989 --> 00:03:07,700
failings of a lot of resources is when

00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:10,340
customers submit feedback they don't

00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:12,110
know where it goes if I report a type or

00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:14,120
a report an issue I want to know that

00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:15,920
the team accident so github was the

00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:18,230
appropriate place for that as well we

00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:21,920
moved all our feedback to github any

00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:23,150
comments on articles are now github we

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,389
want to make it easy to submit feedback

00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:28,040
so just log in on any article and you

00:03:26,389 --> 00:03:30,769
get the feedback right there as any

00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:32,900
comments section followup we make sure

00:03:30,769 --> 00:03:35,630
that for any issue that you open in the

00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:37,250
open on that github issue we comment

00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:39,500
whether we gonna do it we're now gonna

00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:41,600
do it we're gonna research it anything

00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:43,069
like that it's very easy and the

00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:45,230
community loves it because we're being

00:03:43,069 --> 00:03:47,569
transparent we're explicitly telling you

00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:49,910
what we're doing how we're doing and

00:03:47,569 --> 00:03:51,739
when we're doing it we want to recognize

00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:53,720
contributors so now it's easier than

00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:56,030
ever for us to look who contributes to

00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:58,370
Docs we no longer guess who submitted a

00:03:56,030 --> 00:04:00,170
typo report who submitted a new article

00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:02,030
we know exactly because we look at our

00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:05,959
git commit history and that makes it

00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:08,989
insanely easier for us Automation is

00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:10,819
your friend really it is we focus on

00:04:08,989 --> 00:04:12,769
delivering the experience and automating

00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:15,319
the rest so things like PR validation

00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:17,090
testing sample code things like SEO

00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:18,229
validation structure validation code

00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:21,140
generation making sure that all your

00:04:18,229 --> 00:04:23,539
articles in a table of contents all of

00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:25,590
that is automated so if things happen

00:04:23,539 --> 00:04:27,960
such as broken links or broken Ref

00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:29,970
says it's not us humans that catch it

00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:32,130
it's essentially automation systems so

00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:34,350
we have all those in place a huge step

00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:36,630
from us yet so as we move it over we get

00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:38,790
those benefits and at scale everything

00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:41,040
that is not automated is slowing you

00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:44,400
down so one thing that we learned for us

00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:46,740
is as we build our system we want to

00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,960
automate everything to the max where

00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:52,680
humans just focus on the experience and

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:55,020
the content and eat your own dog food

00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,699
we use our own systems so we build

00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:58,200
everything and we write our own

00:04:56,699 --> 00:05:00,900
documentation internally with our

00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:02,540
systems as well that's all I have thank

00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:06,389
you

00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:06,389
