	Lightning Talk: Docs as Part of the Product: Open Source Technical Documentation at Scale - Den Delimarschi, Microsoft

When someone says “documentation” they imagine a boring set of articles or API stubs hosted somewhere on a site nobody will find outside an occasional pointer from a search engine. Docs can be out-of-date, inaccurate or related to an old product version. What if we move away from traditional paradigms, to a world where creating and consuming docs is enjoyable, while making them more collaborative and interactive, ensuring there is always relevant sample code that works? Den covers the journey of swapping out the world’s largest technical docs site (MSDN), with a lean open-source cloud solution that scales for any platform, making it a key part of Microsoft products, with better reliability AND attracting a community of OSS developers helping make docs more useful for everyone. Den will also talk about ways in which products can grow their communities by encouraging contributions to docs.
