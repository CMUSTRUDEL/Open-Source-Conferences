00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,459
hi Lisa Parvati and we are here open

00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:17,060
source summit in Vancouver and today we

00:00:14,459 --> 00:00:19,140
have with us Anjali from rocket software

00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:21,539
until you can you tell us what exactly

00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:23,610
is open mainframe put herself mainframe

00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:26,520
has been around for many years it is

00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:28,079
very proprietary and a lot of the code

00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,969
that is written on the mainframe and the

00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:34,050
tools that are used are proprietary and

00:00:29,969 --> 00:00:34,680
there is a ageing workforce on the

00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:35,940
mainframe

00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,030
they are either retiring they have

00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,920
retired or they may no longer be with us

00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:42,270
and that is because the tools and

00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,050
technology that are used on the

00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:47,880
mainframe are old Scoob all its

00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:49,770
assembler and its technologies people

00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:53,840
don't want to use the interfaces are

00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:57,239
green you know there's no touchscreen so

00:00:53,840 --> 00:01:00,480
rocket came together with IBM and see a

00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:03,510
technologies and we've open-sourced a

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,549
platform which opens the mainframe to

00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:08,159
the modern generation so modern

00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:10,829
generation of end users and modern

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:14,219
generation of developers and we have

00:01:10,829 --> 00:01:17,670
provided them basically an

00:01:14,219 --> 00:01:19,740
infrastructure where they can build a

00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:22,020
modern user experience which can be

00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:26,479
touchscreen which is the web interface

00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:29,429
they are used to using html5 JavaScript

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:31,020
typescript III you know tools that they

00:01:29,429 --> 00:01:32,909
are used to languages that they are used

00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:36,149
to command-line interfaces which again

00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:38,639
they can script they can use Jenkins for

00:01:36,149 --> 00:01:40,740
their C ICD pipeline and also REST API

00:01:38,639 --> 00:01:43,799
so now everything is open and they don't

00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:48,389
have to know the older technologies and

00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:50,609
what that allows both end users and

00:01:48,389 --> 00:01:53,429
developers to do is a newer generation

00:01:50,609 --> 00:01:55,859
can adopt it and now have access to all

00:01:53,429 --> 00:01:58,649
the critical data which is in all these

00:01:55,859 --> 00:02:00,329
financial and retail and insurance

00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:02,700
systems which is still on the mainframe

00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:05,880
so the mainframe isn't going away and it

00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:09,239
is better to bring the new generation to

00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:12,750
the mainframe then try to move the

00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:15,599
critical data elsewhere so Zoe is that

00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:17,880
open source project and it is part of

00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:21,790
the open mainframe project and it is the

00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:24,010
first project ever done on

00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:27,939
the Z operating system so when you talk

00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:29,769
about Z there is Linux on mainframe but

00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:33,189
most of the critical applications are

00:02:29,769 --> 00:02:35,319
not on Linux they are actually on C

00:02:33,189 --> 00:02:38,680
operating system which is proprietary so

00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:42,310
this project has been built and we have

00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:44,620
open sourced it on z/os the first open

00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:45,970
source project and it is targeting the

00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:49,150
younger generation really college

00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:52,290
students high schoolers and we are

00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:55,150
providing them the tools the languages

00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:58,629
all the things that they can use and

00:02:55,150 --> 00:03:00,190
they can believe in and bring the

00:02:58,629 --> 00:03:02,139
mainframe to them so here you're talking

00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:04,420
about your kind of workforce but at the

00:03:02,139 --> 00:03:06,609
same time you also need a community

00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:08,230
around Zoe itself that's correct so how

00:03:06,609 --> 00:03:11,530
are you trying to get the community

00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:14,290
around it our plan is to do hackathons

00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:15,879
centered around Zoe so we can invite

00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:19,239
students and we can invite community

00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:21,489
people to learn how easy it is to use it

00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:23,200
we are working starting to work with our

00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:27,070
customers and this is the combined

00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:37,830
industry to get them more involved

00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:37,830
