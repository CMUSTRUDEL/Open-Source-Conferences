oh good evening one disclosure I worked

00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,440
for IBM and I'm also a member of the

00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:08,849
Apache Software Foundation so I

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,950
frequently find myself in a

00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:13,769
schizophrenic state of proprietary

00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:15,599
software versus open software what I'd

00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:18,690
like to talk to you about today is a

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,520
project that we've announced today there

00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:23,609
was a press release and the project is

00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,600
called Zoe and many people say what does

00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:26,430
that stand for

00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,710
it doesn't actually stand for anything

00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:30,539
we went through great strides to try to

00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:33,660
pick a name that did not was not an

00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:35,730
acronym and then when we explained that

00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,200
everybody tries to figure out what Zoe

00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:41,370
means and then they start making up

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:43,920
acronyms but the what Zoe is it's a

00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:46,350
project that we're hosting with the open

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,030
mainframe project it's related to the

00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,100
mainframe and how many people have or

00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:52,680
work with mainframes or know something

00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:56,910
other than the matrix version of a

00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:59,070
mainframe okay so just for for

00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:02,190
background the mainframe typically is

00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:03,809
referred to as it's an IBM Z platform

00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:06,540
it's Hardware runs a variety of

00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:09,360
operating systems and what we refer to

00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:12,000
when we're talking about Z and is we're

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,530
time at Z OS which typically means it's

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,720
a business platform so if you went to

00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:17,460
Starbucks or you had dinner and you used

00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,600
a credit card most likely part of that

00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,689
transaction went through a mainframe

00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,549
somewhere in the world now the mainframe

00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:26,430
has a little bit of a history a little

00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:27,750
bit of a culture and actually before I

00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:29,369
was coming out here I was reading the

00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,420
diversity standards and I thought wow

00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:32,759
you know we should talk about the

00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,530
mainframe in that context because people

00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:38,520
think the mainframe is this old outdated

00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:40,560
system but it's actually a culture and

00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,720
when you think of cloud cloud as a

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,610
culture it's a culture of agility the

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,329
mainframe is also going through a number

00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:50,430
of changes to be agile to be speedy etc

00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:53,189
and Zoe is intended to make the

00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:54,840
mainframe more accessible to people that

00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:56,670
are not familiar with that or haven't

00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,840
used it for the last 50 years so

00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:01,530
basically it's a set of technologies

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:04,020
that were brought together by IBM CA

00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:06,810
technologies and rocket software and we

00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:10,379
we said hey what can we do to raise the

00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:12,510
tide of z/os without doing proprietary

00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:13,470
software where everybody has competing

00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:16,230
products

00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:20,970
and we came up with this idea of CA had

00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:24,300
a technology there's a CLI IBM had some

00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:26,250
REST API s and rocket had a web UI and

00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,570
so what we want to do is if you haven't

00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,640
seen this before this is what we always

00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:31,500
refer to as a green screen this is

00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,840
typically how you would work with the

00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,850
mainframe you would interact you this

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,920
was an editor so it's not nearly as

00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:40,950
robust and constants that context

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:44,820
sensitive and so what we want to go is

00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:45,480
from this to this and what we've done

00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,910
with this

00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:50,340
zowie project is we've effectively open

00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:52,290
sourced three technologies a number of

00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,580
REST API s to enable access to the

00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:56,550
mainframe for administrative and

00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:58,650
development purposes we open source the

00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:59,790
window manager and so effectively what

00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:02,190
you're seeing is rendered in a browser

00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:04,530
it's not in an eclipse framework or a

00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:07,680
heavy fat Java client it's all browser

00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:09,240
friendly and we're introducing new

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,070
editors and things of that nature that

00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:14,280
are all context-sensitive and you'll

00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:16,440
talk about these very quickly the basic

00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,489
architecture at the very bottom we have

00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,500
the the mainframe

00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:21,239
which is where we have a set of Micra

00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,680
services that we're interacting with so

00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:24,410
we're in the process of really

00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:28,200
translating our proprietary software

00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:30,570
with other vendors into open standards

00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,250
we have a mediation layer so we want to

00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:34,350
be able to abstract away from the

00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:36,600
proprietary interfaces and get to a nice

00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:38,730
you know standard lingua franca that

00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,709
everybody can interact with and then we

00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:42,989
have two basic technologies that we're

00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:44,850
deploy where we have a command line

00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:46,920
which you see over there on the left and

00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:48,540
the command line interface runs actually

00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,459
in your desktop it's a note client and

00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:52,590
it interacts with REST API is to get to

00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:53,610
the mainframe and it allows developers

00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:55,110
to use tools

00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:57,330
patterns workflows that they're very

00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:59,370
familiar with and then over on the right

00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:03,540
we have the the desktop which is a

00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:05,130
familiar motif basically all REST API so

00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:07,880
I won't belabor that point to great

00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:11,070
detail but one thing to note with is UI

00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:13,530
it is something everybody sees every day

00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:15,300
if you're not a mainframe person you

00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:17,850
intuitively know exactly how to interact

00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:19,919
with this motif I go to the bottom left

00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:21,510
they see what programs or applications

00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:23,820
are installed I see my dock at the

00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:27,410
bottom and all of a sudden I didn't have

00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:30,110
to learn 3270 and MBS datasets and you

00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:32,300
and jazz and all the buzzwords that go

00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:35,870
along with the mainframe I can simply

00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:37,970
interact with it directly we also want

00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:39,950
to be able to engage developers so that

00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:42,590
they can choose the platform that makes

00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:44,840
the most sense for their application I

00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:46,430
think Mark Twain was was quoted as

00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:49,730
saying that rumors of my death are

00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:51,740
greatly exaggerated and the mainframe is

00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:54,590
still around and it'll be around for

00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:57,290
maybe even another 50 years because it's

00:04:54,590 --> 00:05:00,170
part of the ecosystem and so the zoe

00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:03,110
project is taking software written for z

00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:05,480
and we're turning it around making it

00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:07,070
available and developing in the open so

00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:10,730
we can make changes faster than we ever

00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:12,590
could before so we do have some links if

00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:15,150
you want to come take a look at it and

00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:18,490
thank you very much for your time

00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:18,490
