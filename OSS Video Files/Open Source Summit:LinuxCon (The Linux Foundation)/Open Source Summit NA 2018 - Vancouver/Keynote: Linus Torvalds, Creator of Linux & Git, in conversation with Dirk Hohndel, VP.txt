hello good afternoon right wow there's a

00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:10,170
lot of people here for a Friday

00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:12,030
afternoon this is nice to see I thought

00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:13,830
it was gonna be the two of us and nine

00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:16,440
people in front but this is nice

00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:19,529
so I'm Dirk haunt l'm the immersive

00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:23,519
open-source officer and you are and I'm

00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:25,260
linus torvalds and i don't like doing

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,449
public speaking because i get nervous

00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,939
and all stressed out about it so we've

00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:32,250
done this thing now for several years

00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:36,660
where I'm perfectly okay with q and A's

00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:39,079
and that takes the stress out yeah and

00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:41,969
and speaking of taking the stress out

00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:45,570
your your stress e two weeks are over

00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:50,550
for 19 March window how did that go

00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:54,590
uh yeah that wasn't so good though so as

00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:56,789
hopefully everybody knows we've had this

00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:58,530
release schedule where we have a

00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:01,410
two-week merge window and all the new

00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:03,989
code goes in and then we have six or

00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:05,549
seven weeks of calming down period when

00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:08,760
we try to find all the bugs in the new

00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:12,630
code and that's been going on for a long

00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:15,150
time and usually it's not a big deal I

00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:17,880
mean that two weeks of merge window is

00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:20,340
my busy period that's when I sit in

00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,530
front of the computer the whole day

00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,810
especially the first week and then

00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:26,670
usually by mid second week

00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:30,060
it's the stragglers and we're already

00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:32,970
starting to to fix bugs and and it's

00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:36,689
busy but it's not too bad except the

00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:39,060
last two weeks so 4.19 we had several

00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:40,950
issues like a new hardware security

00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,439
issue came out in the middle of the

00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:47,040
marsh window that just made it much more

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:49,590
stressful than it should be and maybe

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,270
it's me although I talked to Greg

00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:57,299
earlier today and it's definitely Greg

00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:59,310
too but it's it's particularly stressful

00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:01,500
when you have a business season anyway

00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:04,619
and then there are all these other

00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:08,300
things going on at the same time and we

00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:11,250
had we had the security issue we had a

00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:12,530
stupid bug that has been around for a

00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:15,709
while that

00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:18,290
that report came in just the wrong time

00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:19,880
too so so some merge windows are better

00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:21,800
than others and this was not a good one

00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:24,440
yeah you and I have talked about this

00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,150
many times where you say the best thing

00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:29,120
you can say about your job is when it's

00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:30,770
boring and so when I talk to you about a

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,780
week and a half ago and you were

00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:35,690
completely stressed out and clearly not

00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:37,910
happy so right now what are we doing to

00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:41,930
go back to boring well I think we're

00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:43,730
over the hump now the merge window for

00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:46,670
the mainline kernel was actually better

00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:49,100
off than than the stable kernels one of

00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:51,320
the issues we have is when we've had

00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:55,070
these hardware security issues and they

00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:58,489
kept happening now the last year they're

00:02:55,070 --> 00:03:01,130
kept under wraps so we knew about the

00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:03,290
issue for the last several months but

00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:05,239
because it was secret and we were not

00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:11,660
allowed to talk about it we couldn't do

00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:15,530
our usual open development model and we

00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:17,540
do the best we can and people really

00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:20,030
care deeply about getting a good product

00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:22,280
out but when you have to do things in

00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:24,829
secret and when you can't use all the

00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:26,570
nice infrastructure for development and

00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:29,480
for testing that we have for all the

00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:34,310
usual code it just is way more painful

00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:35,989
and it should be and and then that just

00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:39,950
means that especially when it then had

00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:42,890
when the information becomes public

00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:48,799
during what's otherwise a busy period

00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:51,340
anyway it's it's just annoying and and I

00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:55,280
have only myself to blame because if I'd

00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:57,920
not delayed 4.18 the timing would

00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:01,130
actually have worked out way better but

00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,870
but it is what it is I felt at the time

00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:05,420
that I really needed to delay another

00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:08,090
week the previous release but so you

00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:11,090
have alluded to to the security issue a

00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:12,829
couple of times now so what what do you

00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:13,519
think right now about speculative

00:04:12,829 --> 00:04:16,700
execution

00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,829
I still love speculative execution don't

00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:22,250
get me wrong I mean I I used to work for

00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:25,340
a CPU company we did it in software back

00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:26,180
when I worked there I I think a CPU has

00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:31,880
to do spec

00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:34,160
execution it's somewhat sad that then

00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:36,350
people didn't always think about or

00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,650
didn't always heed the warnings about

00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:42,440
what can go wrong when you take a few

00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:44,240
shortcuts in the name of making it

00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:46,580
slightly simpler for everybody

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,160
because you're going to throw away all

00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:51,590
that work anyway so why bother to do it

00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:53,389
right and that's one of the security Oh

00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:56,229
every single security problem we've had

00:04:53,389 --> 00:04:59,750
has been basically of that kind where

00:04:56,229 --> 00:05:01,789
where people knew that hey this is

00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:05,720
speculative work if something goes wrong

00:05:01,789 --> 00:05:10,039
we'll throw all the data away so we

00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:13,669
don't need to be as careful as we would

00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:16,220
otherwise and I think it was a good

00:05:13,669 --> 00:05:18,590
lesson for that for the industry but it

00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:22,070
was certainly not a fun lesson for for

00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:26,120
us on the OS side we're where we had to

00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:28,099
do a lot of extra work for for problems

00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:30,979
that weren't our problems it feels

00:05:28,099 --> 00:05:33,080
somehow unfair I mean when we have a

00:05:30,979 --> 00:05:33,860
secret security bug that was our own

00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:37,130
fault

00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:40,310
it's like okay it was us screwing up

00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:43,220
it's fair that we have to do all the

00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:45,500
work to to them fix our own bugs but it

00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:48,889
feels slightly less fair why don't you

00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:51,169
have to fix somebody else's but so we

00:05:48,889 --> 00:05:53,599
had the the first round of them in

00:05:51,169 --> 00:05:56,389
January then we had another round in May

00:05:53,599 --> 00:05:58,250
now we had another round in August so

00:05:56,389 --> 00:06:00,259
should we check our calendars and not

00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:03,380
book anything in early November for the

00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:06,199
next I don't know what the schedule is

00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:09,590
and if I knew I wouldn't be able to tell

00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:11,419
you the good news I mean they're really

00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:16,120
good news and I'm serious about this is

00:06:11,419 --> 00:06:22,370
that the the bugs have become clearly

00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:25,520
more and more esoteric so it impacts

00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:28,490
fewer and fewer cases and and clearly

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:31,789
Hardware people are at Intel and other

00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:34,940
places are now so we're of it that I'm

00:06:31,789 --> 00:06:38,150
I'm hoping we're really getting to to

00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:38,639
the dregs of the hardware security bugs

00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:40,979
and

00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:43,499
and going forward we'll have much for

00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:45,960
Europe so but but your expectation is

00:06:43,499 --> 00:06:47,909
that this is not gonna stay with us that

00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,860
we every three months get a new hardware

00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:52,289
bug this will peter out and we'll go

00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:55,770
back to you know the last 20 years

00:06:52,289 --> 00:06:57,479
before that we had what two significant

00:06:55,770 --> 00:07:00,419
hardware bugs that affected the kernel

00:06:57,479 --> 00:07:02,669
and now we had seven eight so far this

00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:05,520
year yeah I go back to the good old days

00:07:02,669 --> 00:07:09,659
I I hope so I I think we're going to the

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:12,150
better days when when a we got the bugs

00:07:09,659 --> 00:07:14,729
fixed and B people were thinking about

00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:19,409
them beforehand so we get to do our own

00:07:14,729 --> 00:07:22,229
bugs again good but so one of the things

00:07:19,409 --> 00:07:25,800
that that has been discussed a lot in in

00:07:22,229 --> 00:07:29,340
the context of why these bugs came to be

00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:32,430
and and how they are driven by a fun

00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:34,529
Norman machine being you know pushing at

00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:37,770
the edges of what the model allows you

00:07:34,529 --> 00:07:40,020
to do and so over dinner last night the

00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:43,020
conversation came on quantum computing

00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:45,180
is what what is what are your thoughts

00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:47,069
on that is that where this where our

00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:50,699
future will be your yeah I'm a huge

00:07:47,069 --> 00:07:53,819
unbeliever in that whole thing so I I

00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:56,610
don't think it will ever happen and how

00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:58,259
do you find if I'm wrong I'm pretty sure

00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:02,370
that I'll be long dead by the time

00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:05,550
people can prove me wrong so yeah so but

00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:10,979
I mean Google has now what 57 qubits

00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:14,069
that was the claim yeah what's the value

00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:16,199
what would wait where's the opportunity

00:08:14,069 --> 00:08:19,469
I think the value has a probably been

00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:21,539
more in physics and playing around with

00:08:19,469 --> 00:08:24,409
things and hey it has been known to

00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:28,500
happen that that I've been wrong before

00:08:24,409 --> 00:08:31,020
so so maybe the whole quantum thing is

00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:32,640
going to be a thing but I think if you

00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:36,209
actually look at where hardware is going

00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:39,120
today the much more relevant part is

00:08:36,209 --> 00:08:42,630
that even xxx I mean traditional

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:46,250
computers are not scaling and people

00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:51,360
really don't see a lot of realistic

00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:52,380
paths forward to to go on the hardware

00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,690
side and I

00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:56,600
I actually think that's probably healthy

00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:59,160
for the industry eventually and

00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:02,210
especially for us suffer people who have

00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:04,680
gotten kind of complacent knowing that I

00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:05,270
the saying used to be that every two

00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,830
years

00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:10,440
performance doubles and that has clearly

00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:13,020
not been very true lately and it's not

00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:16,020
going to be true going forward and I

00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:20,370
think that's good I am well maybe not

00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:24,870
fun but it means that it will maybe go

00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:27,630
back to the partly to the time where you

00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:31,010
cared more about performance on a suffer

00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:34,620
side and you had to be more careful and

00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:37,560
you can just rely on hardware getting

00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:39,150
getting better alter so I already see

00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:42,830
the headlines that are being typed over

00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:44,220
here at Leena's Torvalds the top toe is

00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:46,140
reached

00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,820
no more performance improvement in the

00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:50,790
hardware well I'm not really saying that

00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:52,920
but sounded like it I was going to help

00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:57,000
you some friends we address yeah it's

00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:58,980
it's pretty clear that that the whole

00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,540
Moore's Law thing is definitely not

00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:03,240
something you should take for granted

00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:04,740
anymore and it does I mean this very

00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,690
much impacts the hard work people but

00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:07,980
I'm saying it also impacts I think us

00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:11,310
software people and especially our

00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:13,950
system people where where it means that

00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:15,900
suffering itself has to be no it has to

00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:18,060
take that into account I think it has a

00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:20,430
huge impact because if you look at the

00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:22,950
bloat and the growth of more and more

00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:24,840
complex libraries and if you look at the

00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:27,480
the architecture that is increasingly

00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:30,960
commonly when we had this conversation

00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:34,410
with with with someone earlier where a

00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:39,710
hello world program is 120 megabytes and

00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:39,710
it prints hello world that's awesome

00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:44,460
obviously something's got to give and if

00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,530
the computer stopped doubling in

00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:48,510
performance then maybe we will need to

00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:51,930
start writing better software yeah no I

00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:54,330
think I think that's somewhat welcome

00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:56,040
change but but one thing that I was I

00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:57,870
was going to poke a little more ad and

00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,880
and since you dissed quantum computing

00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:01,860
we'll just have to invent something else

00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:04,649
for a quick you on stage because the

00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:07,350
question is what is the next thing

00:11:04,649 --> 00:11:08,910
after the the phenomen machine or is

00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:11,369
that really the end of the development

00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:13,470
where we are now so I mean I might

00:11:11,369 --> 00:11:15,389
suffer person so asking me about

00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:19,259
hardware it's kind of questionable to

00:11:15,389 --> 00:11:22,860
begin with I do it yeah I'm actually a

00:11:19,259 --> 00:11:24,809
huge believer in neural networks back

00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:28,470
way in the days when I was at the

00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:30,929
University and I was studying artificial

00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:33,949
intelligence and and the traditional

00:11:30,929 --> 00:11:37,379
kind of artificial intelligence and

00:11:33,949 --> 00:11:43,019
always felt that that was that was snake

00:11:37,379 --> 00:11:44,670
oil and that the real model of AI is to

00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:49,350
actually look at what we know works

00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:52,980
right and and I'm really happy to see

00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:58,220
that this is clearly the direction that

00:11:52,980 --> 00:12:02,100
the Industries has been going lately and

00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:04,139
neural networks don't need an OS well

00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:06,899
the network itself doesn't need an OS

00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:08,819
but part of it is also that they aren't

00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:11,309
really computers in the traditional

00:12:08,819 --> 00:12:13,499
sense at all and I actually think that

00:12:11,309 --> 00:12:16,290
will be in the situation that will will

00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:18,929
have the one Neumann model the

00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:21,149
traditional computer model for when you

00:12:18,929 --> 00:12:24,600
want to just give the computer commands

00:12:21,149 --> 00:12:26,490
and I think we've also known for decades

00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:29,910
now how operating systems are supposed

00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:31,920
to look so that is not going to go away

00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:34,319
and that's not really going to change I

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:37,019
mean the details will change and then

00:12:34,319 --> 00:12:40,620
we'll have the neural networks on the

00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:45,059
side the same way ten years ago people

00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:47,129
were so excited about GPUs and ten years

00:12:45,059 --> 00:12:49,199
from now maybe somebody comes up with a

00:12:47,129 --> 00:12:53,279
new model but but right now it's clearly

00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:55,799
AI that a lot of the industry is excited

00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:57,329
about and and it's interesting thirty

00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:57,779
years ago when you and I were both in

00:12:57,329 --> 00:13:00,929
college

00:12:57,779 --> 00:13:03,499
AI was the big new thing and now AI is

00:13:00,929 --> 00:13:06,360
the big new thing and eventually it will

00:13:03,499 --> 00:13:09,990
maybe even be the big new useful thing

00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:14,540
well eventually it will be just I at a

00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:16,799
point we're done there is that so um

00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:17,699
let's switch gears for a moment I I

00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:19,319
talked

00:13:17,699 --> 00:13:23,069
about us being in university we both

00:13:19,319 --> 00:13:25,049
actually did go to college but if I look

00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:27,329
at today if I look at the education

00:13:25,049 --> 00:13:29,759
system versus the people that are

00:13:27,329 --> 00:13:31,889
talking and to here at these events and

00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:35,339
and the people that I see being

00:13:31,889 --> 00:13:37,350
successful in an open-source it doesn't

00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:41,609
make sense today to get a college degree

00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:44,339
a master's a PhD or is is just being a

00:13:41,609 --> 00:13:47,329
good developer enough I wonder where

00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:51,169
that question is coming from um I

00:13:47,329 --> 00:13:54,629
actually I I enjoyed my college years

00:13:51,169 --> 00:13:55,769
immensely and I think they helped a lot

00:13:54,629 --> 00:14:00,839
too

00:13:55,769 --> 00:14:02,970
at the same time programming to me but

00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:06,779
this may be because of how I got into it

00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:09,359
is something you do on the side you

00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:11,489
don't learn it at university you do it

00:14:09,359 --> 00:14:14,759
while you're at university of learning

00:14:11,489 --> 00:14:17,279
other things so I don't think it's an

00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:21,299
either/or at all it's a combination of

00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:22,919
both and and I don't think I think

00:14:21,299 --> 00:14:25,410
you're setting the question up for a

00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:28,199
false dichotomy that isn't really there

00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:31,139
I I actually wasn't trying to set you up

00:14:28,199 --> 00:14:33,179
for anything this was a truly curious

00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:34,799
question because and two of your

00:14:33,179 --> 00:14:36,929
daughters are in college the third one

00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:39,299
is going I have a few more years before

00:14:36,929 --> 00:14:41,549
my daughter's get there but to me this

00:14:39,299 --> 00:14:43,139
is this is something is this always been

00:14:41,549 --> 00:14:46,769
something that I was interested in I

00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:49,859
know so many fantastic developers who

00:14:46,769 --> 00:14:52,230
don't have a computer science degree who

00:14:49,859 --> 00:14:56,549
have you know not finished high school

00:14:52,230 --> 00:15:00,089
or are veterinarians or in biochemical

00:14:56,549 --> 00:15:03,449
engineers or business majors or you know

00:15:00,089 --> 00:15:05,429
a great friend of mine it has a degree

00:15:03,449 --> 00:15:07,949
from Julliard and it's a fantastic

00:15:05,429 --> 00:15:10,799
device so that was my question how

00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:14,759
important is that college degree as a

00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:17,160
computer science or EE major so I

00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:19,109
actually think computer science is not

00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:21,749
like a science in the traditional sense

00:15:19,109 --> 00:15:24,889
because you can actually be self-taught

00:15:21,749 --> 00:15:28,709
and in many ways being self-taught is

00:15:24,889 --> 00:15:31,500
preferable in a way that you don't want

00:15:28,709 --> 00:15:35,670
your architects or your structure

00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:41,400
engineer to be self-taught there is a

00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:43,800
big difference there somewhere so you

00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:48,450
definitely can drop out of high school

00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:52,770
still and be a good programmer and it's

00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:55,950
not necessarily always a good idea to

00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:59,310
plan that way but I I think programming

00:15:55,950 --> 00:16:01,230
and software engineering is kind of

00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:03,060
special and not real engineering in that

00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:05,160
sense I I would absolutely agree with

00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:07,980
you that the idea of a self-taught

00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:11,640
dentist is not one of my favorite

00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:12,810
thoughts right now but III want to

00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,070
double down on this a little more

00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:17,220
because I think this is a really

00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:19,380
interesting direction to talk about you

00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:21,000
said being a software developer is

00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:24,510
something where you can be self-taught

00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:27,510
where experience plays a huge role where

00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:30,750
curiosity and and basically stubbornness

00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:33,240
I know the word is perseverance sorry

00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:35,550
persevere so much bass is really

00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:38,280
important and if I look around if I look

00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:41,220
at the the core kernel maintainer Ziff I

00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:43,260
look at some of the the the better known

00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:45,839
developers out there a lot of them

00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:48,480
aren't CS majors and that to me was the

00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:51,570
interesting part where I said is this a

00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:54,330
field where it's maybe different where

00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:57,180
the focus on you have to have your 8

00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:59,160
years of college to have learned all the

00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:02,850
basics and don't know all the Latin

00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:05,250
words or whatever it's this in it is

00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:09,300
this a field that is different and in in

00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:11,699
such is maybe more open to to

00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:14,730
non-traditional entry points and we had

00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:19,439
Van Jones talk here about the fact that

00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:21,089
we have so few african-americans in in

00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,620
this field and obviously if you look

00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:24,540
around and it's kind of hard to see but

00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:26,760
there aren't a lot of the audience all

00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:27,710
look very dark to me because bright

00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:30,530
light

00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:33,050
and and and so to me the question is

00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:36,920
could this be an advantage for our field

00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:39,140
that you can come in from from a broad

00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:41,600
variety of background and experience and

00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:43,400
educational paths I I see where are you

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:47,270
going and I don't I sadly don't actually

00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:52,360
believe you I do think there's a huge

00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:55,550
advantage to getting a CS degree I think

00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:59,450
you may partly be coming from I mean I I

00:17:55,550 --> 00:18:01,940
I know a lot of the kernel developers

00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:04,880
who never had a CS degree and part of it

00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:07,520
was purely historical when when we when

00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:10,610
we started not a lot of universities

00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:13,160
even had a CS degree so there were a lot

00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:17,030
of people who came in with physics

00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:19,610
degrees or came from math background and

00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:23,810
I I think that's still true that that's

00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:26,480
a very good way of getting into software

00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:29,810
engineering is by having a background in

00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,280
your problem space but that doesn't mean

00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:33,230
that you don't want to have a college

00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:36,980
degree necessarily it just means that

00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:40,010
maybe you shouldn't go for CES as your

00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:42,440
primary you could go for physics or

00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:47,870
biochemistry with a lot of biochemistry

00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:51,350
these days is computational and and you

00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:52,970
are still going to often want to have at

00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:56,030
least the four-year degree

00:18:52,970 --> 00:19:02,270
it's my gut feel that's what I tell my

00:18:56,030 --> 00:19:04,250
children don't drop out III I I'm kinda

00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:06,200
supported that you assumed that I was

00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:09,710
going to set you up to say drop out of

00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:11,600
school I was I was actually curious

00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:14,660
about your thoughts on this subject and

00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:17,000
and and thanks for enlightening me let's

00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:20,080
let's switch gears because this is only

00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,080
gonna get worse from here

00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:28,020
one thing that is interesting to me in

00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:30,120
as I as I go over to the exhibit hall

00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:32,430
and I talk to the Community Managers for

00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:35,910
many of the cool open-source projects

00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:38,720
that are over there and and Linux and

00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:42,480
get and this other project that you do

00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:47,340
none of them have community managers how

00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:52,860
come I don't know I never thought about

00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:55,320
that we particularly the kernel is kind

00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:58,350
of odd if you look at open source

00:19:55,320 --> 00:20:02,090
projects in general a lot of open source

00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:05,790
projects are very small there's like a

00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:09,360
handful of developers a lot of them

00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:13,350
started inside companies so you actually

00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:15,390
needed somebody to push the project to

00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:17,430
not be inside the company and I think

00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:21,090
that's where a lot of the community

00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:24,150
management comes in is that you you kind

00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:28,500
of need to be an evangelist and and and

00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:32,730
push the project out and the kernel for

00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:37,230
some reason never had that and yet is

00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:39,270
one of like we don't have a handful we

00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:43,490
have a handful of thousands of

00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:47,010
developers right and we never had

00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:48,870
community because we had several

00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:51,600
different communities people still

00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:54,420
almost nobody is on the kernel mailing

00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:56,910
list the kernel mailing list a lot of

00:20:54,420 --> 00:21:01,020
people consider to be an archival system

00:20:56,910 --> 00:21:04,430
not a discussion system and most of the

00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:08,880
development is done on much more

00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:11,880
targeted mailing lists you have 1 4 mm

00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:14,010
issues one for specific architectures

00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:16,320
things like that and then you CC the

00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:20,310
kernel mailing list just to see if

00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:24,990
somebody does a drive-by comment or so

00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:26,640
that it's there in the archive so the

00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:30,180
kernel in many ways is not a good

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:32,370
project to look at if you like want to

00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:33,179
look at open source in general because

00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:35,759
it is

00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:39,179
so different not just in technology but

00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:41,249
in in the whole community model and it

00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:44,219
always has been but the same is true for

00:21:41,249 --> 00:21:47,309
all three of your projects well you say

00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:49,559
three but let's face it the dialog

00:21:47,309 --> 00:21:55,830
software community is so small that we

00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:59,549
don't need a community manager yeah I

00:21:55,830 --> 00:22:01,499
don't know what I get and I do want

00:21:59,549 --> 00:22:03,539
whenever gate comes up in any public

00:22:01,499 --> 00:22:06,330
situation I always want to make it clear

00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:08,820
but yes I started the project and yes I

00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:11,669
took it to the point where it was useful

00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:18,210
but I have not maintained it for the

00:22:11,669 --> 00:22:20,549
last 13 years junior hamana has been a

00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:23,519
great maintainer and he deserves all the

00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:25,529
credit forget and apparently he didn't

00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:29,399
need to have a community manager either

00:22:25,529 --> 00:22:32,099
and I don't know why that has been true

00:22:29,399 --> 00:22:36,239
of Linux and yet but I do think that

00:22:32,099 --> 00:22:39,509
part of it is they did not come out of a

00:22:36,239 --> 00:22:42,299
company so then let's turn this around

00:22:39,509 --> 00:22:45,779
how should a project attract developers

00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:48,389
what what is what is your advice for a

00:22:45,779 --> 00:22:50,759
project that says we want to get more

00:22:48,389 --> 00:22:53,639
community more developers more

00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:56,700
participation so my advice is actually

00:22:53,639 --> 00:23:00,719
slightly negative in the sense that if

00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:04,830
you see the point of your project to be

00:23:00,719 --> 00:23:07,999
to grow and you and and you see your job

00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:12,289
as being to get more people involved

00:23:07,999 --> 00:23:16,739
you're not doing your job right as a

00:23:12,289 --> 00:23:18,749
maintainer of a project your job is not

00:23:16,739 --> 00:23:21,149
to find other developers your job is to

00:23:18,749 --> 00:23:24,169
make sure the project works as well as

00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:26,700
it can and your product job is to be

00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:30,450
responsive to the developers you have

00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:34,200
and if you do a good job at that and you

00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:35,519
make a good job project it's the if you

00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:39,450
build it they will come

00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:41,309
model of motivational speaking saying

00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:43,739
you don't you don't go out and look for

00:23:41,309 --> 00:23:45,090
developers you do so well that

00:23:43,739 --> 00:23:49,740
developers come and look

00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:51,780
you and that's my theory and I think it

00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:54,300
does match what we did in the kernel and

00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:56,690
what it has done you just said something

00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:59,480
very interesting you said you have to be

00:23:56,690 --> 00:24:02,280
responsive and this is something that I

00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:04,260
I had a couple of discussions here in

00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:07,680
the hallway I talked to Julia about this

00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:10,410
in the context of maintainer saying oh I

00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:13,140
can't respond to this thing within two

00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:15,210
weeks and my response to her was well

00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:17,340
that's a failure of the maintainer if

00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:20,610
you maintain a subsystem a two-week

00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:22,230
response time is just way too long maybe

00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:24,750
you need a second maintain and maybe

00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:29,100
agreed to do what is your point in that

00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:31,410
yeah no I I so I see my job as being I

00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:35,370
mean don't get me wrong I do not ask

00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:39,810
your email usually when you send me a

00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:42,090
patch if it's a good patch I will apply

00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:44,280
it and push it out and I generally will

00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:46,730
do that in a responsive manner but I

00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:51,570
will not respond to your patch and say

00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:53,640
good email applied normally but I do

00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:55,380
think that as a developer and I've been

00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:59,310
on the other side to not just as a

00:24:55,380 --> 00:25:01,290
manager but as a developer when you send

00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:04,860
out patches the last thing you want to

00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:07,050
do is not know where to send them and

00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:13,880
not know what happened to them once you

00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:17,790
sent them I don't so as a manager or

00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:20,610
maintainer of the project what I think

00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:23,580
the primary goal would is is to make

00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:27,230
sure your developers know whether your

00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:32,220
patches got accepted and if they didn't

00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:33,660
what should happen to them and and not

00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:36,660
on a two-week notice

00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:40,530
 I'm not saying 24-hour notice

00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:43,080
because nobody's there 24/7 but I try to

00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:44,820
keep my respond I tell people if you

00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:47,670
don't get a response and you expect one

00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:51,660
in 48 hours then resend that's what I

00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:55,140
used to just say of course I've also

00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:57,350
moved up the maintainer chain so now I

00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:59,390
don't deal with individual patches

00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:02,270
very much anymore at all and if you send

00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:05,150
me a patch the real maintainer for that

00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:09,200
area did a bad job of explaining where

00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:12,260
he should send the patch so most the

00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:14,929
time when it comes to the kernel we now

00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:17,150
have two or three levels of maintainer

00:26:14,929 --> 00:26:20,840
ship and that is definitely a way to

00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:24,620
solve the whole problem with one single

00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:26,870
person cannot keep track of even a

00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:29,299
medium-sized project but but we can

00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:31,370
quote you that you think a two-day

00:26:29,299 --> 00:26:33,740
turnaround time is a reasonable

00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:34,190
expectation yeah no that's that's what I

00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:38,150
do

00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:43,400
III go away occasionally for I mean

00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:46,520
usually it's diving but so I'm I'm not

00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:50,510
online all the time but I see my job as

00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:54,340
being making sure that when my sub

00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:57,620
maintainer send me a pull request I I

00:26:54,340 --> 00:27:03,049
answer or I usually do the pull within

00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:04,700
the day and that includes weekends and

00:27:03,049 --> 00:27:07,570
the merch window is special and

00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:10,730
everybody knows that because then I get

00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:13,340
basically a few hundred pull requests oh

00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:15,440
it's 150 pull requests in two weeks and

00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:17,450
then I spread them out and I don't try

00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:22,130
to do them all on Monday when they come

00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:24,799
in so but you talk about the fact that

00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:26,960
you respond on weekends and that you you

00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:29,870
drill down into the the heart problems

00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:32,990
and one of the things that I was curious

00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:34,730
about is what causes you to get sucked

00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:36,830
into a challenge and I'll give you an

00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:39,260
example of something where you didn't

00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:40,940
get sucked into a challenge so on the

00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:43,010
one hand we have Colonel box where you

00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:46,010
get completely in one of my neck and

00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:47,450
just never mind and and on the other

00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:50,210
hand we have that long ongoing

00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:52,549
conversation about glory fish but so

00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:54,770
photography where there is a challenge

00:27:52,549 --> 00:27:57,110
where you clearly did not get sucked in

00:27:54,770 --> 00:28:02,120
and did not try to get to perfection so

00:27:57,110 --> 00:28:07,309
what drives that oh I actually I claim

00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:10,809
that a part of any good driven strategy

00:28:07,309 --> 00:28:10,809
is knowing what to ignore

00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:16,550
it's one of the reasons why we have many

00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:19,010
many kernel maintainer x' it's because I

00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:22,520
was so open to saying this is an area I

00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:24,710
don't care about if you have any

00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:27,500
interest at all in this please come in

00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:31,550
and be a sub maintainer and quite often

00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:33,800
this was not explicitly said as such but

00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:36,710
it was I mean I was actively encouraging

00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:40,790
people to take over areas that I I'm not

00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:43,100
interested in and nobody has time and

00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:46,790
nobody has time especially for long

00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:50,270
periods of time of being there 24/7 for

00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:53,030
your developers that is not what I'm

00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:55,520
claiming you us and maintainer should do

00:28:53,030 --> 00:29:01,610
at all because that's you just burn out

00:28:55,520 --> 00:29:05,090
in in weeks so my solution has always

00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:09,140
been to know what I care about make sure

00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:15,440
I do concentrate on that part and find

00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:18,770
people and and give them rope when there

00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:20,809
are areas that I don't care about so

00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:25,760
when you're Amin sub maintainer for the

00:29:20,809 --> 00:29:28,460
kernel and you send me a bull request

00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:32,480
and I trust you I will not look at your

00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:37,040
code because by definition it's not my

00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:39,710
job it's your job what happens and what

00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:42,740
people sometimes react to is when I get

00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:44,570
a pull request and I have way during the

00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:47,360
merge window and I start complaining

00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:50,120
about some my new detail in that pull

00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:53,420
request and people sometimes think it's

00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:55,280
because I look at everything no it's

00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:56,960
because that maintainer sent me

00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:58,970
something that I was thinking that

00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:03,320
maintainer should not have touched that

00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:05,809
file why is he touching that file he

00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:11,660
does not own that code and then I start

00:30:05,809 --> 00:30:13,820
looking and and that's when I start also

00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:16,130
saying I'm not going to pull you from

00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:18,260
you because you should not have touched

00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:21,260
that file and when you did touch that

00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:22,740
file I found a glaring error from just

00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:27,330
scanning your patch

00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:31,560
and and at that point I'll go yep no not

00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:35,430
gonna happen so there's two sides to

00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:40,410
this one is give maintainer x' sub

00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:43,740
maintainer x' the the rope to hang

00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:46,320
themselves you are not supposed to

00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:48,770
micromanage them we call it empowering

00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:52,050
by the Oh empowering is that the

00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:55,530
business yeah term for give them rope

00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:59,160
yeah but the other part is you need to

00:30:55,530 --> 00:31:01,770
also keep track of who owns what and if

00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:04,380
people start doing on things you need to

00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:06,600
react to it and then look at it and and

00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:12,090
it's worked very well for the kernel I

00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:15,570
think obviously the teaching you should

00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:16,530
take away from this is once you get me

00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:18,510
to trust you

00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:21,840
you can do anything as long as you stay

00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:25,080
in your own area and it's true this is

00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:28,980
this is why the kernel maintainer ship

00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:31,560
works because I will mean when when

00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:34,230
you're a Greg Krogman when you're a

00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:36,930
David Miller you can send me stuff and I

00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:39,660
will not micromanage you unless you

00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:41,190
start going crazy right so and that's

00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:43,050
the only way to scale when you have a

00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:46,440
project with thousands of developers

00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:47,760
involved every single release I love you

00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:52,050
how you avoided talking about your

00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:53,820
photography skills but I implied right I

00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:57,270
implied some things I don't care about

00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:59,400
it turns out I suck as a photographer

00:31:57,270 --> 00:32:03,750
and I'm okay with that because I don't

00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:05,700
care and now I'll try to do the hard

00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:07,350
thing now I'll try to make sense of all

00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:10,460
of these questions that I've asked you

00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:13,920
which clearly surprised you earlier so

00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:16,650
if I look at the way is software is

00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:19,500
being built today if I look at the the

00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:22,290
insane complexity of many of these

00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:24,780
frameworks but look at the fact that as

00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:26,610
you said there are parts that you cannot

00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:29,490
possibly care about because you don't

00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:33,330
have the time were you being anybody and

00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:34,550
and how this becomes a more and more

00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:38,290
indirect warrant

00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:41,600
or layered more and more complex world

00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:43,610
aren't you afraid that we are we are

00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:46,310
dealing with a technology that we no

00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:50,540
longer understand that we aren't trained

00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:52,370
to to have a top to bottom view you have

00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:54,530
told me many times that one of the

00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:56,900
things that attracted you to the kernel

00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:59,090
was that you loved the interaction with

00:32:56,900 --> 00:33:01,700
the hardware and knowing how things work

00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:03,110
but then when I stick a step back today

00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:05,330
and they use a typical application

00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:07,910
whether it's on my phone or on a

00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:10,370
computer there are so many layers so

00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:12,950
many components that no one knows how

00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:14,330
all this works and so what is your

00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:17,330
thought on that on this on this

00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:19,330
explosion of complexity so I mean this

00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:21,920
is why I actually don't worry about

00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:26,030
technical issues in the kernel so much I

00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:29,840
mean I that may be phrasing Mis phrasing

00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:32,320
it I worry about them but I'm not

00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:35,660
worried about them in the long term

00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:39,050
because what I really worry about tends

00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:41,630
to be the flow of patches so the

00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:45,860
workflow to me is actually way more

00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:49,250
important than the code if you have the

00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:52,910
right workflow the code will sort itself

00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:56,750
out you if a bug happens you know how to

00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:59,450
deal with it and and this is actually

00:33:56,750 --> 00:34:01,400
why I think open-source I mean I've

00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:04,490
always been a proponent of open source

00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:08,450
obviously but I think this is also why

00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:10,610
open source is so fundamentally the

00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:13,929
right model of doing software

00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:16,520
development it's because when you have

00:34:13,929 --> 00:34:20,720
complexities like this you cannot manage

00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:25,700
it in in a closed environment you really

00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:28,940
can't it's you need to have the people

00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:32,210
who actually find the problems you need

00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:35,330
to give them the ability if they have

00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:38,030
the possible the ability to get involved

00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:40,250
and and help you fix them because it is

00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:42,200
a complicated world and when you're

00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:44,240
doing a complex project and the kernel

00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:48,200
certainly counts but it's not the only

00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:51,560
one the only way to deal with complex it

00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:53,810
is is by having that open exchange of

00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:56,510
ideas and having the code out there so

00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:58,160
that people can participate so let's try

00:34:56,510 --> 00:35:00,109
again for a perfect leanness site

00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:02,690
soundbite something that fits into a

00:35:00,109 --> 00:35:07,070
tweet so do you still understand the

00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:08,720
Linux kernel now there are there are

00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:12,349
certain areas that if you send me a

00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:14,900
patch you should react we expect way

00:35:12,349 --> 00:35:17,000
more reaction there's the the one area

00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:19,339
I've cared about pretty much since the

00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,250
beginning was the the virtual file

00:35:19,339 --> 00:35:25,790
system layer that's the only area I

00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:31,490
think in the kernel where I am still

00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:33,829
very active so that I will actually look

00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:37,820
at all pretty much all of the core

00:35:33,829 --> 00:35:40,329
patches certain parts of the x86

00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:43,760
architecture stuff I will also follow

00:35:40,329 --> 00:35:45,560
but when you have a project that how

00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:47,480
many schedulers also something that you

00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:50,530
can I don't worry about the scheduler

00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:55,880
anymore that I used to but there's

00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:58,730
thirty plus thousand files in however

00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:04,810
many ten million lines of code then

00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:07,310
nobody knows the whole kernel the one

00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:12,470
one thing I have is having looked at

00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:19,250
patches for a long many many years and I

00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:21,680
know the kind of big picture of pretty

00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:24,560
much all the areas in the kernel so I

00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:26,839
can look at a patch and I can often tell

00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:29,150
whether it's right or wrong even if I

00:36:26,839 --> 00:36:32,180
don't know that area in intimate detail

00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:34,190
and I then obviously know who to blame

00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:37,760
and who to approach when things really

00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:41,450
go bad and I say hey this is here's a

00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:44,300
bug report I know it's yours go off and

00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:46,849
fix it for me because I can't this is

00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:51,099
everyone's favorite git command get

00:36:46,849 --> 00:36:51,099
blamed damn it's my code

00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:56,730
so what worries you about the future

00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:59,250
then if you think that everything is

00:36:56,730 --> 00:37:01,800
going well maybe it's fine that things

00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:05,040
get more complex are the things that you

00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:07,230
say oh this this this is a problem um I

00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:09,780
still worry a bit about our maintainer

00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:11,760
ship I have no reason to worry about our

00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:15,210
maintainer ship we've we've been doing

00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:17,580
really well and and we have we have new

00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:19,680
people show up all the time and we have

00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:21,150
old people who still love what doing

00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,860
what they're doing so there is still

00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:27,750
sticking around and it's not because I

00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:29,130
held a gun to their head promise so so

00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:31,710
we're doing everything right and we

00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:38,240
haven't really had any issues but at the

00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:38,240
same time that is the one area where I'm

00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:43,770
sometimes looking at key people and

00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:46,320
saying oh that would be really really

00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:48,360
painful if he got hit by a bus but you

00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:50,370
the question I used to get that question

00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:53,010
like what happens if leanness is hit by

00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:54,900
a bus and nobody really cares anymore

00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:57,240
because there's always a maintainer for

00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:59,310
whatever subsystem where we got that

00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:02,670
covered but there's a few subsystems

00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:07,800
where where you have a bus factor that

00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:11,220
is pretty low and and there are a few

00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:12,350
people who I think are somewhat

00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:15,300
overworked

00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:18,570
and that that worries me a bit why are

00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:20,570
you bitching about Greg I expressly

00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:24,840
didn't want to know sorry sorry I

00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:27,510
misunderstood so so the last time we

00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:30,230
were in Vancouver I'm sure you remember

00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:30,230
No

00:38:30,549 --> 00:38:35,089
the last time we were in Vancouver I'm

00:38:33,499 --> 00:38:37,339
sure you remember we were driving up

00:38:35,089 --> 00:38:40,609
here we did our divemaster training a

00:38:37,339 --> 00:38:43,039
long time this was 2011 and we had the

00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:45,169
20 I've been here since them yeah well

00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:47,109
before the Linux event I mean come on

00:38:45,169 --> 00:38:49,819
help me out here

00:38:47,109 --> 00:38:51,799
so we had the 20 years of Linux

00:38:49,819 --> 00:38:55,009
celebration up here in Vancouver and was

00:38:51,799 --> 00:38:56,509
awesome and so I was thinking as this

00:38:55,009 --> 00:38:59,869
the closing question for our

00:38:56,509 --> 00:39:02,719
conversation how about we we cause

00:38:59,869 --> 00:39:06,229
problems for the Linux Foundation make

00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:08,900
Meg Angela really mad at us and create

00:39:06,229 --> 00:39:11,209
that perfect way to get off the stage so

00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:14,779
where would you like to have the 30

00:39:11,209 --> 00:39:17,390
years of Linux celebration because

00:39:14,779 --> 00:39:19,939
that's coming up 2021 I mean she already

00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:23,269
booked the 20 20 conferences so if we

00:39:19,939 --> 00:39:27,019
want to get ahead of the 2021 scheduling

00:39:23,269 --> 00:39:28,969
now is your chance leanness no no people

00:39:27,019 --> 00:39:34,849
are clearly for they they know how I

00:39:28,969 --> 00:39:36,709
work so for I think for 25 years it may

00:39:34,849 --> 00:39:41,150
have been Angela maybe it was Jim who

00:39:36,709 --> 00:39:43,729
had the great idea to to do it in

00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:47,289
Helsinki because the birthplace of Linux

00:39:43,729 --> 00:39:52,939
and I was like no let's do it in how why

00:39:47,289 --> 00:39:54,529
and that didn't work I don't remember

00:39:52,939 --> 00:39:59,809
where we actually did it I think it was
