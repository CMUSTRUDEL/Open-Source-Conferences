00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:14,590
I did some work in VR head open source

00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:16,600
summit in Vancouver and today we have

00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:18,369
with us our fifth game of networking a

00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,230
Linux Foundation first of all thanks for

00:00:18,369 --> 00:00:22,119
coming over to the show all excited to

00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:24,790
be here so let's talk about in all the

00:00:22,119 --> 00:00:26,800
last 12 months you know what happened in

00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:30,449
the networking space it has been a

00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:34,390
fantastic here you know we have seen a

00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:38,949
hundred and forty one-year-old telecom

00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:41,680
industry move to open source networking

00:00:38,949 --> 00:00:43,979
right with the Aleph networking we have

00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:47,559
now you know exceeded a hundred members

00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:50,559
we now have participation from almost

00:00:47,559 --> 00:00:54,129
70% of the global subscribers as enabled

00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:55,330
by the largest of the large carriers we

00:00:54,129 --> 00:00:58,180
have seen pretty much all the vendors

00:00:55,330 --> 00:01:00,519
active and over five hundred million

00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:02,949
dollars worth of software innovation in

00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:04,780
terms of value has been created in the

00:01:02,949 --> 00:01:06,010
open source community so we're really

00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:09,250
excited

00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:11,320
projects like onap which were launched

00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:14,890
almost a year ago have moved to

00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:16,810
production projects like tungsten fabric

00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:19,630
have moved into the ls networking

00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:24,010
umbrella so all the way up and down the

00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:26,890
stack we can now safely say that the

00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:30,250
telecom industry is going to use open

00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:32,560
source that is based out of Linux

00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:34,360
foundation for building their next

00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,280
generation networks so we talked about

00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:38,440
you know kind of in order over we are

00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:40,150
reflecting on 12 months now let's look

00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:42,640
at the future you know how do you go

00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:44,860
from here oh yeah yeah we'll continue on

00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,690
this path and it'll take you know two to

00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:48,970
five years for deployment

00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:52,680
so deployment is our main focus right

00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:56,350
now for what is next for LS is how

00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:59,650
networking enables what we call cross

00:01:56,350 --> 00:02:02,560
project collaboration okay cross

00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:04,960
industry collaboration cross community

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,210
collaboration and what do we mean by

00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,399
that and and I'm using the term

00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,959
harmonization to not all under like that

00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:13,530
umbrella but you know we can use any

00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,920
term but what that mean is how does

00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:19,220
blockchain impact teleport

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:21,260
how can telecom networks glow cloud

00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:23,270
native with kubernetes right so we

00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:25,640
showed a demonstration of own app

00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:29,200
running on kubernetes right

00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:32,150
all of those integrations right the most

00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:35,300
you know promising area that's coming up

00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:38,030
is a project called acronym which is an

00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:39,620
edge project so as you know the core

00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:41,180
problem has been solved now telecom

00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:44,060
networks come moving to the edge and

00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:46,070
edge cloud is a big area it you know by

00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:48,890
some analysts it's gonna be bigger than

00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:50,510
even the current cloud that that has

00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:53,660
shown up because it's distributed it's

00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:55,720
enabling 5g it's enabling IOT it's and

00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:58,670
only over-the-top applications right

00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:01,900
tons of new ideas are coming up because

00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:05,930
of edge cloud so how does edge and

00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:09,739
correlate how do how do we integrate

00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:14,120
edge with automotive grade Linux and 5g

00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:17,330
for autonomous driving right so in a

00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:19,610
nutshell the area for our for my

00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:23,209
personally my focus as well as Lennox

00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:26,060
Foundation is how do these communities

00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:27,910
of these projects come together and can

00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:31,340
collaborate so that there's more value

00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:32,959
to our end-users to our members and

00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:35,239
things like that so that's what we're

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,040
working on right now but if you look at

00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:38,930
Linux Foundation it's kind of giant

00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,060
umbrella you have all the split that

00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:41,959
you're talking internal II so how first

00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:44,030
of all did a lot of cross-pollination

00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:45,980
happens yes then you come to these

00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:48,850
events like that I mean everybody is

00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:51,320
here correct and that is exactly right

00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:53,510
however if you look at each of these

00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:56,480
projects they're building their own come

00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:59,209
examine individual what we're moving to

00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:02,480
a phase is how do these projects work

00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:05,540
together right work together so I just

00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:09,410
hosted a seminar with the executive

00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:13,579
director of CNCs Duncan right and what

00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:15,739
we discussed is in telecom we have this

00:04:13,579 --> 00:04:19,400
concept of virtual network functions and

00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:21,229
we enough right vnfs our actual services

00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:25,099
and applications that run on our telecom

00:04:21,229 --> 00:04:27,950
network how do you make vnf cloud native

00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:28,400
so we're calling we've created this term

00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:29,030
called

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,520
CN

00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:36,350
okay cloud native network functions

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:39,680
right so how do you migrate these vnf to

00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:42,020
CNF and there are technology things but

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,150
both communities kubernetes and own app

00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:46,880
community and networking community they

00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:48,600
have to work together right to solve

00:04:46,880 --> 00:05:06,259
this problem collectively

00:04:48,600 --> 00:05:06,259
