00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:14,320
I need some parking we are here at open

00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:15,730
source summit in Vancouver today we have

00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,390
me the sons again the tariffs from

00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:19,689
Comcast

00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:21,790
so tell us about open source at Comcast

00:00:19,689 --> 00:00:24,189
what's new going on there so since the

00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:26,759
last time I talked to you we've got a

00:00:24,189 --> 00:00:29,619
really good team of four people now

00:00:26,759 --> 00:00:31,989
focusing on community compliance and

00:00:29,619 --> 00:00:33,700
compliance engineering we are not just

00:00:31,989 --> 00:00:36,550
consumers of open source that you've

00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:38,950
actually contributed a great deal to

00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:41,260
open source so there are a couple of

00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:45,010
different types of contributions we make

00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:47,370
as a company one is clearly we when we

00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:50,110
consume a product we fix it and we

00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:51,430
contribute it back and we also enhance

00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:54,670
it and we make those types of

00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:56,260
contributions so we made roughly about a

00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:58,420
hundred and fifty contributions

00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:02,350
you know this year and then the second

00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:04,780
thing we've been doing swap is to also

00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:07,509
create original works you know things

00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:09,130
that we created inside the company to

00:01:07,509 --> 00:01:10,869
solve our problems and then to

00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:13,750
contribute those back into open source

00:01:10,869 --> 00:01:16,469
so contribution can come in the form of

00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:20,079
code in the form of financial support

00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:21,969
projects and you know just all of us

00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:24,579
being here in open source and

00:01:21,969 --> 00:01:29,979
evangelizing open source really helps

00:01:24,579 --> 00:01:31,270
share good practices with everybody so

00:01:29,979 --> 00:01:33,579
the project that you talked about two

00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:35,859
projects is it like Comcast you know you

00:01:33,579 --> 00:01:37,380
are maintaining it or you have kind of

00:01:35,859 --> 00:01:39,850
given it to some neutral foundation

00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:43,509
these are the two projects that we are

00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:48,130
actually maintaining for now and we are

00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:50,799
inviting contributors from all parts of

00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:53,289
the world to contribute to it we're

00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:55,840
seeing a great deal of diversity in

00:01:53,289 --> 00:01:58,569
contribution texture and vinyl DNS we

00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:01,079
just open sourced so it's taking off but

00:01:58,569 --> 00:02:04,299
you bring up a good point we do have

00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:07,029
traffic control which is our CDN project

00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:09,250
which is hosted at the Apache foundation

00:02:07,029 --> 00:02:11,230
and we're very grateful and the other

00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:13,090
good news is the Apache traffic control

00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:16,300
which used to be an incubation the last

00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:17,770
time I saw you has now graduated to a

00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:20,019
top two your project at the Apache

00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:21,330
foundation so we will be celebrating

00:02:20,019 --> 00:02:23,940
that as well at

00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:26,010
patek on and then we've also been known

00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:29,370
to create you know separate foundations

00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:32,000
like the RDK project which sits in its

00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:35,040
own foundation outside of comcast and

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,130
that is a collaborative effort across

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:41,010
the cable providers cable industry

00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:43,410
Oh II M's SOC providers like Intel

00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:45,600
Broadcom they're all involved in

00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:48,120
creating that project and you are also

00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:51,420
on Linux Foundation board I'm a director

00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:53,550
at large which means that I represent

00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:55,740
community and not company

00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:57,570
and one of the big lenses that I like to

00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:59,880
bring to the board is diversity and

00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:03,959
inclusion and so I've been focusing on

00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:07,110
working and partnering with Angela brown

00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:10,260
and the Linux Foundation on improving

00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:13,709
how we include people and events in

00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:16,080
training in projects because I think we

00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:19,440
have a great opportunity as a foundation

00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,270
to set some guidelines for the hundred

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,480
and fifty plus projects that are at the

00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:26,459
foundation itself but also to create

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,410
best practices for the community to

00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:30,810
follow you're also very much in the wall

00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:33,420
with diversity can you talk about your a

00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:35,850
first know that we're making and why why

00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:39,690
do you care about diversity why not the

00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:42,300
whole world is getting digitized and if

00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:45,330
we are recreating this world then we

00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:47,489
need to create it with people of all

00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:49,470
types otherwise we'll have a very

00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:52,170
monotone world we'll have a black and

00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:55,019
white world created by a few people with

00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:57,690
their biases that are embedded into that

00:03:55,019 --> 00:04:01,019
world and we cannot afford to do that

00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:04,440
that's one big reason from an economic

00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:08,820
perspective teams that are diverse are

00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:12,330
more innovative more impactful create

00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:14,740
better business results create you know

00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:16,480
more productive teams

00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:17,890
who wouldn't want that which business

00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:31,380
wouldn't want that

00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:33,440
