00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:21,320
today we're gonna teach kids in just a

00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:24,270
couple hours how to go from nothing to

00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:27,000
coders I've done it I've done it a bit

00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:37,290
before I do coding at school not really

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:42,510
I play roblox a lot have some experience

00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:45,690
but the majority don't really code well

00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:48,330
my kids are interested in Cody and it is

00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:52,200
a good opportunity to them to for them

00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:55,560
to learn about Lionel's technology I I

00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:58,140
go with HTML first because it's the

00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:01,110
easiest language and it's it's close to

00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:03,990
English and it's not like a hard thing

00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:06,750
with syntax to learn so we can squeeze

00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:08,490
these into like a day which gets them

00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:10,799
excited and makes them want to go home

00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:12,869
and do more and learn more on the out

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:16,140
after that you know you go up to maybe

00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:18,060
Python but hTML is so easy and they get

00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,490
a quick return by doing stuff with

00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,979
colors and and getting video and stuff

00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:25,650
and it's a real career in web design

00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:27,960
bill ready for career in the day we

00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:30,960
talked a lot about self motivation and

00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,850
so you can start a kid out and then you

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,890
want them to keep going on their own you

00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:36,360
know it's just like with a bike and you

00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,920
know you're gonna push them for a minute

00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,780
and then they're gonna be spinning the

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,790
wheels themselves and next thing you

00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:45,000
know you're riding the bike and you your

00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:46,890
bike next one the kids like it maybe it

00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,590
allows you to build websites maybe it

00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:52,530
allows you to create programs create

00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:54,990
games just you know I think it opens a

00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:58,650
whole new world it's not about learning

00:01:54,990 --> 00:02:00,750
to code so much just to be a coder it's

00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:03,409
learning to code so you understand how

00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,409
things work

00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:30,569
