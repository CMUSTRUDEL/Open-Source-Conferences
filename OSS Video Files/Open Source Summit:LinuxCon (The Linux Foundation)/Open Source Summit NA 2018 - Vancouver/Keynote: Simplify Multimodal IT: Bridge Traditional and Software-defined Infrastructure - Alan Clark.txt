	Keynote: Simplify Multimodal IT: Bridge Traditional and Software-defined Infrastructure - Alan Clark, Director, CTO Office, SUSE

Many organizations find themselves undergoing a journey of IT transformation. They have a traditional IT infrastructure with physical servers or virtualized servers, running monolithic or N-tier applications and use waterfall development processes. As they transform, some of the on-premise workloads and servers get moved to the cloud. The legacy apps are containerized directly or get converted to microservices. As a result, the organization finds itself using a mix of traditional infrastructure and software-defined infrastructure, which is essentially a multimodal IT scenario.
During the keynote, we will look at Multimodal IT scenarios, the challenges and needs of Multimodal IT and open source architectures that can help derive benefits from todayâ€™s mixed-IT deployments.
