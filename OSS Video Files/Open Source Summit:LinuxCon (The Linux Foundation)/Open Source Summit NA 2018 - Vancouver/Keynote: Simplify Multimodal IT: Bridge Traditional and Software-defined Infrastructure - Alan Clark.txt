Title: Keynote: Simplify Multimodal IT: Bridge Traditional and Software-defined Infrastructure - Alan Clark
Publication date: 2018-09-04
Playlist: Open Source Summit NA 2018 - Vancouver
Description: 
	Keynote: Simplify Multimodal IT: Bridge Traditional and Software-defined Infrastructure - Alan Clark, Director, CTO Office, SUSE

Many organizations find themselves undergoing a journey of IT transformation. They have a traditional IT infrastructure with physical servers or virtualized servers, running monolithic or N-tier applications and use waterfall development processes. As they transform, some of the on-premise workloads and servers get moved to the cloud. The legacy apps are containerized directly or get converted to microservices. As a result, the organization finds itself using a mix of traditional infrastructure and software-defined infrastructure, which is essentially a multimodal IT scenario.
During the keynote, we will look at Multimodal IT scenarios, the challenges and needs of Multimodal IT and open source architectures that can help derive benefits from todayâ€™s mixed-IT deployments.

well so thank you for the few minutes I

00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:09,800
have to talk to you today I want to talk

00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:12,269
about what we call multimodal IT so I

00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,769
really love this conference I really

00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:15,570
love the gathering we have here because

00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:18,180
we're here talking about all kinds of

00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,949
new technologies and how we're both

00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,350
technologies are going to change the

00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:25,920
world right so everything from machine

00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:28,170
learning to AI to robotics to Internet

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,240
of Things to edge computing to big

00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:32,279
analytics right we're talking about all

00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,649
these technologies and they are changing

00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,149
our world right and they're making

00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:38,790
things better we're getting things there

00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:41,129
the goals are to become much more agile

00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:43,170
in our services and our businesses and

00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:45,260
the types of services we're delivering

00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:47,850
to our customers and to our clients

00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:50,039
we're making those services better for

00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:53,430
them and the way they can consume those

00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:55,230
and we're able to deliver technology

00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,789
much faster today than we could before

00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:59,809
and I'll give you a couple examples here

00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:03,049
in a minute and also drive efficiency

00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:05,129
but the interesting thing about this is

00:01:03,049 --> 00:01:08,490
if you think about it from our

00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:11,040
perspective as users we're kind of like

00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:14,689
a hammer I love this picture because the

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:17,939
hammer in this picture is you and I our

00:01:14,689 --> 00:01:21,030
expectations for the types of services

00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:22,470
has gone way up every one of us has our

00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,869
little smart devices that we carry

00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:28,049
around right we're traveling around the

00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:30,720
world our expectations are way up here

00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:33,450
as to what those services are provided

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:36,060
to us through this little device right I

00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:41,850
expect the same serviceability I expect

00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:43,409
the same accessibility regardless of

00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:44,909
whether I'm sitting in Vancouver or I'm

00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:47,820
sitting in Berlin or I'm sitting in

00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:51,000
Beijing right so we've developed this

00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:53,450
hammer and beyond that we've got an

00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,820
inkling for the new things that are

00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:59,939
perhaps even possible right think about

00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:02,369
the voice-activated AI that we have

00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:03,840
today right we can ask our phone and

00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:07,290
it'll tell us all kinds of information

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:10,860
that starts to create these new ideas of

00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:13,360
what is possible and what we can do well

00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,830
us is a hammer

00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,950
all of a sudden that's putting a lot of

00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:19,720
pressure onto the IT departments and the

00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:21,820
businesses that are going to have to

00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:24,580
deliver those services and you can look

00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:27,460
at that to wait it's either a hammer and

00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:31,180
there a nail or you can look at it and

00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:34,000
say new great opportunities that can

00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:35,770
come about and the very interesting

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,840
thing and a lot of conversations I have

00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:40,390
with people is those new things are

00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:43,240
happening in open-source so it becomes a

00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:46,840
question and the answer becomes leverage

00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:48,520
open-source leverage open-source so to

00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,790
do that I want to give you an example

00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:53,440
and it's not just pulling an open-source

00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:55,239
piece or an open-source project

00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,459
and running on your way but what we're

00:02:55,239 --> 00:03:00,010
really finding is the power is to

00:02:57,459 --> 00:03:02,320
combine those technologies together and

00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:05,260
I just wanted to throw an example here

00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:07,930
through su says application rapid

00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:09,640
delivery platform okay everybody's

00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:11,709
familiar with Cloud Foundry particularly

00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:14,290
here today in this audience everybody's

00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:17,260
familiar with kubernetes the power is

00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:20,010
putting those together once I put those

00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:22,780
together I get that rapid application

00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:25,200
end-to-end deployment model right

00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:28,480
development model by combining with

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:35,680
kubernetes I've now made that much more

00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:37,600
easy to deploy the next step is as Susu

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,400
we've taken containers to heart

00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:42,010
so not only if we put those two

00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:45,299
technologies together but you add in the

00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:48,340
the latest notion of containerization

00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:51,100
I've now made that so it's a much more

00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:53,890
rapid deployment model I've made that so

00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:56,080
the footprint memory print all that is

00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:58,630
reduced which means my scalability goes

00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,220
up i've also increased my imported

00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:02,890
bility which means i can push that

00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:05,140
workload to wherever it needs to be ok

00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:07,750
so that's just an example of how we take

00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:11,010
these latest technologies by combining

00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:14,260
those together I can create much more

00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:16,959
diverse and powerful services to deliver

00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:21,459
to to my customers and try to meet those

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:22,960
expectations created by our hammer now

00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:26,080
if you look at this from an IT

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,250
perspective what this means

00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,919
is they've got to go through a

00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:32,650
transformation right those demands that

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:34,960
we're placing on them means that they've

00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:36,729
got to transform to meet that and it's

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:40,539
not just in the application delivery

00:04:36,729 --> 00:04:43,270
space it's there right but it affects

00:04:40,539 --> 00:04:45,729
the way they develop software it's a it

00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:48,400
affects the way the applications are

00:04:45,729 --> 00:04:50,919
architected it affects the way those

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:54,099
applications are deployed and it goes

00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:57,159
clear down to the very infrastructure of

00:04:54,099 --> 00:04:59,860
IT right going from a data center to

00:04:57,159 --> 00:05:02,229
cloud models going from physical servers

00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:04,509
to virtualized servers which we've been

00:05:02,229 --> 00:05:08,020
doing for years going to containerized

00:05:04,509 --> 00:05:11,889
or micro services going from monolithic

00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:13,690
applications to micro services even our

00:05:11,889 --> 00:05:16,150
development models right go into a much

00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:18,099
more agile model all of those are

00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:21,969
impacted all of those are affected

00:05:18,099 --> 00:05:26,259
that's quite powerful but it's also

00:05:21,969 --> 00:05:30,460
quite challenging so we end up in this

00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:34,979
state of what we call multimodal IT okay

00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:38,080
this is where IT has an existence of

00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:39,729
traditional infrastructure where they've

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,289
got what we now call and you're all

00:05:39,729 --> 00:05:45,039
familiar with the term software-defined

00:05:41,289 --> 00:05:47,620
infrastructure and rapid application

00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:49,750
oriented architectures right so I've got

00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:52,690
data center trying to live with cloud

00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:55,469
I've got physical servers I got virtual

00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:58,419
servers I've got containerized services

00:05:55,469 --> 00:06:00,639
I've got monolithic applications I've

00:05:58,419 --> 00:06:03,940
got micro services I've got n tier

00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:06,250
services I've got hopefully not too many

00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:08,169
waterfall development processes anymore

00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:12,789
but I've got a jold development

00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:15,520
processes and DevOps types processes how

00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:18,610
do I handle that I can either create a

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:23,169
bunch of silos or I can figure out how

00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:25,150
to make those work together and I want

00:06:23,169 --> 00:06:26,469
to give you an example here we've only

00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:29,110
just got a couple minutes so I can only

00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:31,870
take time to show you one to show you

00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:34,419
what I mean by multimodal okay so going

00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:36,449
back to my example here with with the

00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:39,910
smart phone think of a banking

00:06:36,449 --> 00:06:42,250
application for example it's very common

00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:43,500
most likely the apps that are running on

00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:46,870
your phone

00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:48,910
I've been developed using the latest

00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:52,510
development technologies right agile

00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:54,190
development micro services type style

00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:56,560
development breaking those app downs

00:06:54,190 --> 00:07:00,550
delivering fast delivering often

00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:02,620
updating often and so forth but on the

00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:04,840
backside those traditional services

00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:07,090
particularly like in a banking

00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:09,670
application you're going to find that

00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:12,180
that data your your financial data your

00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:15,010
paycheck are sitting in some traditional

00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:18,250
infrastructure particularly back on

00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:20,590
perhaps your employee data and so forth

00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:22,930
information sitting on some s AP server

00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:25,720
somewhere could be back on an Oracle

00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:30,540
server for example right so you have

00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:32,620
this mixture of both traditional and

00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:34,030
software-defined infrastructures and

00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:36,610
you've got to marry and meld those

00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:42,640
together otherwise you end up in a

00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:45,610
siloed scenario so what multimodal IT

00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:47,650
what the IT department needs is bridges

00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:50,920
right you could go for a rip and replace

00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:52,420
model can't happen overnight instead you

00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:54,700
want to leverage the strengths of both

00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:57,580
because there are strengths in both

00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:59,110
models and you want to be able to

00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:01,870
leverage those so you want to leverage

00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:04,030
and use containers for example in your

00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:06,640
data center how do you do that you want

00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:08,710
to be able to move your workloads for

00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:11,470
mom premise to the cloud makes total

00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:14,740
sense right you want to be able to take

00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:15,460
and make those workloads agile how do I

00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:18,040
do that

00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:19,390
well I haven't got time to go through

00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:21,100
the whole stack and explain the whole

00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:23,620
stack but I wanted to take just a minute

00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:25,090
talk about the very lowest level right

00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:27,220
we're here at the Linux Foundation we

00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:32,020
talked about Linux so let's talk about

00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:33,789
it at the operating system level and to

00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:35,849
really take advantage of this you need

00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:41,830
something what we call a multi-modal

00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:43,599
operating system now if you think a lot

00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:44,700
about Linux it's been around for 25

00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,900
years

00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:49,660
traditionally years ago what we used to

00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:52,020
do is and if you remember you could get

00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:54,240
Linux in a box right

00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:57,180
and in that box you have multiple DVDs

00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,820
and those DVDs contained everything in

00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:02,700
the Sun multiple desktops every hardware

00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:05,340
device you could think of all different

00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:07,980
types of software extensions that you

00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:09,600
could think of and the installation

00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:12,450
basically went through and installed

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,640
everything and then the IT manager had

00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:16,410
to go through and figure out how to pull

00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:19,020
things out that he didn't want turn off

00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:20,850
ports that they didn't need tie it down

00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:23,880
so that it was secure so it was very

00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:24,920
much install everything take out what

00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,240
you didn't need

00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:29,940
well we've quickly learned and with the

00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:31,590
advent you know the huge pipes we have

00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:34,170
on the Internet today we've been able to

00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:35,670
turn that around now begin with breaking

00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:38,790
things out trying to make things more

00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:41,210
modular we're to the point we are today

00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:45,300
and going forward in the future we've

00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:48,030
flipped that around so the notion today

00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:51,210
is let's install the smallest footprint

00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:53,790
that you need and add make it very very

00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:58,350
simple to add the services that you want

00:09:53,790 --> 00:10:02,550
okay so we call this a modular operating

00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:03,900
system and it turns out that it's a very

00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:08,040
purpose purpose

00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:11,100
excuse me tongue-tied therefore look

00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:14,760
perfect for a multi-modal environment

00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:16,470
and let me show you why okay so in a

00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,420
multi-modal environment you've got your

00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:20,010
traditional infrastructure you've got

00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:23,160
your software to find infrastructure

00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:26,010
what this means is I have devices that

00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:29,940
could be as fat as small as a Raspberry

00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:34,710
Pi right all the way up to devices that

00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:38,010
are as large as a supercomputer so the

00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:41,070
Raspberry Pi I want a very small very

00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:42,930
dedicated footprint up to the

00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:45,420
supercomputer where I'm going to have

00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:48,570
take advantage of a very large memory or

00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:52,050
and perhaps storage footprint but I want

00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:56,220
to tailor that so I can use my my small

00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:58,950
devices for edge I can install and and

00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:02,190
do very particular devices let's say for

00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:03,430
example running an HPC environment where

00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:06,550
I'm adding on machine

00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:09,730
learning right I can tailor that

00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:10,960
operating system and tune it so I can

00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:14,410
run it in a public cloud environment

00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:16,149
like Microsoft Azure I can tailor that

00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:20,350
environment for the latest constructs

00:11:16,149 --> 00:11:22,020
with memories of like nve or MDM where I

00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:26,140
can take advantage of that that

00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:29,170
non-volatile memory to run processes for

00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:31,149
data analytics for example I can take

00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:33,520
advantage of the strengths of the

00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:36,640
architectures in the mainframe to run

00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:38,920
those legacy of applications I can take

00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:41,290
advantage of of the scalability and

00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:44,560
store ability compute intensive power

00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:46,270
that you can provide through Linux all

00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,399
the way up to the supercomputing

00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:52,029
environment that's why you're seeing

00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:54,370
Linux spread across all those giving me

00:11:52,029 --> 00:11:56,680
that modularity where I can focus in

00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:58,810
tune Linux for those particular

00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:03,899
environments is the strength that we

00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:06,550
have now the second part of this is I

00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:10,029
could do that with different operating

00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:13,150
systems of course right but the power

00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:14,770
here is with Susan now we're delivering

00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:17,320
all of those all the way from the

00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:21,459
Raspberry Pi up to the supercomputer all

00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:23,410
in the same source code now you might

00:12:21,459 --> 00:12:25,540
not think that's too important until you

00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:28,150
start to think about spectra meltdown

00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:32,440
and all the other issues that keep

00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:33,910
popping up from an IT perspective I've

00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,260
got to maintain those I've got to

00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:38,050
understand my risk I've got to

00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:41,290
understand my footprint on each type of

00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:44,290
those devices and where I'm at so by

00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:45,880
maintaining that source code across the

00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:48,040
different architectures the hardware

00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:51,250
platforms and so forth makes it much

00:12:48,040 --> 00:13:00,990
more simple for me to maintain to manage

00:12:51,250 --> 00:13:03,070
and to grow so I often get the question

00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:05,860
that's going to be the next big thing

00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:08,170
right show that circle up in front and

00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:10,029
and I know when they ask the question

00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:11,589
they're wondering what's going to be the

00:13:10,029 --> 00:13:12,460
next big thing around machine after

00:13:11,589 --> 00:13:15,220
machine

00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:18,160
or after kubernetes or after containers

00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:22,420
or so forth and I'm sure there'll be

00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:24,700
some buzzwords pop up somewhere but I

00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:27,790
think for us right now the next big

00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:30,160
thing that's going to be the fun

00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:34,230
challenge for us that we need to focus

00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:38,020
on is the need for for agility and the

00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:40,660
speed to scale and for us to be able to

00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:43,210
do that requires that we have an

00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:45,340
operating system that enables us to do

00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:48,850
that and that's the way SUSE Linux

00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:52,360
Enterprise 15 which was just delivered a

00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:54,910
couple weeks ago enables us to do it

00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:58,900
gives us that platform to scale from the

00:13:54,910 --> 00:14:02,290
very small to the very large and gives

00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:03,790
us that bridge so that we can use it in

00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:07,060
the different environments all the way

00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:10,780
from a legacy environment to our latest

00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:13,840
agile development doing that gives us

00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:15,880
the speed to scale that we need gives us

00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:18,120
that mobility to develop those rapid

00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:21,490
applications into and to deliver those

00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:24,820
combined those technologies in a modular

00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:27,250
way where we can tune those we can

00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:29,460
tailor them and we can deliver the

00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:33,370
services that our customers are after

00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:36,030
and yet bring the simplicity that we

00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:39,820
need to support those in a secure

00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:42,400
adaptive environment and deliver those

00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:45,490
services that we depend on in a secure

00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:47,160
manner so I thank you your time and for

00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:52,890
your attention thank you

00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:52,890
