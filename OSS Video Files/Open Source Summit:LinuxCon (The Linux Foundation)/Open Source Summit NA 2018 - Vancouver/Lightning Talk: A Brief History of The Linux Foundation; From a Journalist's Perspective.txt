	Lightning Talk: A Brief History of The Linux Foundation; From a Journalist's Perspective - Sean Michael Kerner, eWEEK and Internetnews.com

The first time I met Jim Zemlin, the Linux Foundation didn't exist and he was speaking to a small room of fewer than 20 people in Toronto. Over the last 20 years, things sure have changed.

so who am i I started using Linux about

00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:07,259
97 so I'm a late bloomer a star writing

00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:08,880
on Linux in 2002 senior editor for a few

00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:11,070
publications eWEEK internet news server

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,769
watch enterprise networking planet and i

00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:15,509
run a small site called linux today comm

00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:18,240
and i recommend anybody that's

00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:20,340
interested linux to submit look and see

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,840
what we have going on there in the

00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,789
beginning the first time i met james

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,519
emmalin the executive director of the

00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:28,650
linux foundation was back in 2006 in

00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:31,019
toronto at a small event called linux

00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:33,149
world Canada long since gone at the time

00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:36,180
he was the leader of a group called the

00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:38,850
free standards group at the time in 2006

00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,920
he was speaking about fighting Linux

00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,719
fragmentation the free standards group

00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,850
was driven by an effort called the Linux

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,149
standard space which was a API and a set

00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,260
of baseline things that would enable

00:00:47,149 --> 00:00:51,690
software developers to target Linux as a

00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:54,510
platform as opposed to just individual

00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:57,050
Linux distributions the theory was that

00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:59,399
UNIX broke apart because of

00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:00,960
fragmentation and the whole idea was he

00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:02,910
was trying to prevent that with the free

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,979
standards group what he said at the time

00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:06,450
in this session in 2006 was that

00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:09,030
open-source is a development that ology

00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:10,890
choice is not guaranteed by that and you

00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,270
could still get locked in and that was

00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,890
what the free standards group is all

00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:15,060
about there was a rival group at the

00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,610
time called the open-source development

00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,720
labs and they were the home of leanness

00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:21,720
Torvalds at the time they ran into

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,540
financial trouble 2006 running out of

00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:27,509
money January 2007 the Linux Foundation

00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:30,840
was formed as a merger or a buyout of

00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:34,740
the OS DL and the free software group

00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:37,320
started out with about 70 members the

00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:39,329
Linux Foundation at the time defined

00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,850
itself is the new center of gravity for

00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:44,009
Linux because OS DL was the center of

00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:46,170
gravity for Linux and as all engineers

00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:47,820
know you cannot change the laws of

00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:50,790
physics I don't do a good Scottish

00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:52,649
accent and physics gravity always pulls

00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:54,000
things in this is the first tax return

00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:56,460
because of a journalist so I have to

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,710
hunt for turn returns and numbers that

00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:02,909
the Linux Foundation filed 2007 about

00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:05,549
7.5 million this is just after the OS DL

00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:06,960
was pretty much done at the tie a couple

00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:08,459
years later Jim said in the

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,229
collaboration summer 2009 one of the

00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:12,030
first events was that the role of Linux

00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:13,220
Foundation was about standardizing

00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,410
promoting and

00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:17,990
affecting Linux by focusing on those

00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:21,140
goals who could advance Linux and

00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:23,030
ultimately the OS market skip ahead a

00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:24,890
couple years 2011 that's the last time

00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:26,750
Linux con that's the predecessor event

00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:29,900
for this event was here in Vancouver and

00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:32,020
Jim said the lesson of Linux is that

00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:34,340
Linux is on the right side of history

00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:35,900
expect that you will hear him say that

00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:37,970
again tomorrow you heard that here first

00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:40,850
because he said that many times in the

00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:42,590
seven years since 2012 we talked a

00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:44,480
little bit about competition that the

00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:47,900
competition needs to embrace open source

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:51,380
and keep up and here we are 2018 and

00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:53,120
Microsoft has listened to him Jim has

00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:56,090
said the Linux is awesome more than once

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,890
in particular in 2013 I think that was a

00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:00,560
particularly great year that was the

00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:02,090
year that Steam decided to embrace Linux

00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,970
and for all you gamers out there that

00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:06,310
was fantastic in 2013 there was a big

00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:08,330
shift that's when the Linux Foundation

00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:10,340
started to be about a whole lot more

00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:11,959
than just Linux opendaylight projects

00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:14,090
started that's a first of a

00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:16,790
collaboration projects and was is a

00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:18,560
networking effort Jim at the time said

00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:20,330
that opendaylight relies on this

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,070
essential organizational framework and

00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:26,140
this is what the Linux Foundation can

00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:28,010
help to provide in the time since that

00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:30,680
opendaylight started there's been a

00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:33,670
whole lot of other projects and this is

00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:38,120
just a few and there's more that the

00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:40,489
Linux Foundation has added so many so

00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,590
that in 2014 Jim said that he's just

00:03:40,489 --> 00:03:43,940
leanness Torvalds janitor I mean he just

00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:45,910
cleans up and makes sure that the place

00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:47,780
is a good place for people to do

00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:49,670
development work which is really what

00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:51,410
the Linux Foundation is all about by

00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:52,519
2015 there was already conversations

00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:55,760
maybe the Linux Foundation should be

00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:59,450
renamed Jim said no because Linux has a

00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:01,519
brand name and a reputation by 2016 he

00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:03,410
was already talking about sharing and

00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,260
altruistic goals how it makes the world

00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:08,000
a better place and as everybody knows

00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:10,310
2017 was the year of the Linux desktop

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,209
no other year previous report or future

00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:16,940
will be and that was that there is no

00:04:14,209 --> 00:04:18,970
resistance we will all be assimilated

00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:21,049
and that is what it's going to be

00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:22,880
fundamentally the real question that the

00:04:21,049 --> 00:04:24,530
Linux Foundation asks Jim always says is

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,420
which are the projects that really

00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:29,150
matters which are the ones

00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:30,890
that will provide security agility and

00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:32,780
that will meet these requirements and

00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:34,580
the thing you have to have is

00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:36,710
sustainable ecosystems and that's what

00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:37,880
the Linux Foundation provides in the ten

00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,380
seconds I've got last the Linux

00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,910
Foundation has grown from the ashes of

00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:42,710
the OS DL and the promise of the free

00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:44,390
software group it's grown from 70

00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:46,220
members grown to many open source

00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:49,310
projects also grown from seven and a

00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:52,520
half million to about 61 million in 2016

00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:58,250
Linux is awesome thank you

00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:58,250
