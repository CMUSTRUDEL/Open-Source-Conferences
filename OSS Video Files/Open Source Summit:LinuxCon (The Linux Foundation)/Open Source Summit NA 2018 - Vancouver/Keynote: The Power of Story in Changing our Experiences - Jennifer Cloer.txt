hi everybody I'm Jennifer Chloe like Jim

00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:09,809
said I think my first slide is an

00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:11,639
example that I've been here before right

00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:13,740
I've actually been here since the very

00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:15,330
beginning like Jim mentioned but there's

00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,820
a picture of me in New Orleans I've had

00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,840
a few hurricanes if anybody's been in

00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,580
New Orleans I know exactly what I'm

00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,160
talking about I've had just a few right

00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,720
there and that picture and then the 20th

00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,519
anniversary of Linux which happened

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,890
right here in Vancouver seven years ago

00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:32,040
who remembers that party that was a

00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:35,219
party all right that was a party so I'm

00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,870
so so grateful to be back here today on

00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:38,550
stage on the keynote stage at the very

00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,170
event that I helped create so I'm

00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:41,750
grateful thanks to Jim and the rest of

00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:43,920
the Linux Foundation for having me back

00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:46,050
last year we actually premiered the

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,420
chasing grace trailer at the first ever

00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:49,800
diversity empowerment summit we're back

00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,570
this year to share an update on the

00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,250
project here on the keynote stage so

00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:56,670
again thanks to Jim and the rest of the

00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:58,620
team for having me I'm gonna start with

00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,270
a story because of the chasing grace

00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:03,180
project that's what we do we tell

00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:05,159
stories so I recently interviewed a

00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,360
woman who told me about her

00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:09,360
four-year-old daughter who was very

00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:11,280
enthusiastic about soccer and so she

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,450
signed her daughter up for soccer and

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,430
the first practice was two or three

00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:15,950
weeks away and the daughter every day

00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:18,119
morning noon and night

00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:19,320
couldn't stop talking about soccer what

00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:21,570
was it going to be like how many balls

00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,920
are on the field how do you play what

00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:24,900
are the rules who do I get to play with

00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,610
and when the first day of practice

00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,159
finally arrived she put on her pink

00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:31,140
princess dress and they went to soccer

00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:32,549
practice and the mom got to the field

00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,439
and the daughter just bolted out into

00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:37,110
the field and she stopped about halfway

00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:38,430
through and she froze and the mom

00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:40,770
watched as the daughter gazed to the

00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:43,380
other side of the field and all of the

00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:45,210
other kids were boys and they all were

00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:47,880
wearing blue and black shorts and

00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:49,740
similar t-shirts and the young girl four

00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,420
years old turned around and slowly

00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:54,030
walked back to her mom and said mom

00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:56,340
let's go home she's six now and she

00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:58,770
hasn't been back to soccer practice so

00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:02,850
this is a really poignant example of the

00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:04,380
importance of inclusivity when we don't

00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:07,200
feel like we belong we actually

00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:09,300
oftentimes give up there are magnificent

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,670
people in the world who don't but the

00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,080
masses usually do and this is one of the

00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:15,390
reasons why the data

00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,610
that women are leaving tech at double

00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:18,330
the rate as men I think that things are

00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,770
starting to change

00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:21,390
I talked to women and men every single

00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:22,950
day about this topic and so I think

00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:25,470
things are starting to change but we

00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:27,960
can't stop bringing attention to it

00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:30,000
talking about it so let's talk a little

00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:32,400
bit by about diversity so inclusive

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,910
environments actually breed diverse of

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,410
teams but diversity is not all about

00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:40,020
gender in fact it's about a whole hell

00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:42,690
of a lot more than gender it's about

00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:44,460
diversity of experience and diversity of

00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:47,880
thought that's really what it's all

00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:49,380
about but that is also why gender is so

00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:52,970
important to focus on and why we started

00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:52,970
there with the chasing Grace project I

00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:59,190
stand here before you as a woman in tech

00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:01,110
I co-created the chasing Grace project

00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:02,670
which is about women in tech but I

00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:03,600
really understand that the diversity of

00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:06,630
thought and experience is the most

00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:08,370
important thing to focus on but our

00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:10,080
community industry and society's pursuit

00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:11,700
must also be about diversity of thought

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,230
and experience and that's what we're

00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:15,390
focused on that's why jenner diversity

00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:17,130
is so critical and why we have the

00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:18,120
project chose to start there excuse me

00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,739
I'm repeating myself a little bit

00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,360
because I lost my place I don't usually

00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:25,620
give keynotes I usually prep people to

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:27,239
give keynotes let's talk about the

00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,800
chasing Grace project a little bit so it

00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:32,040
is a documentary series about women in

00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,239
tech it's number one mission is to

00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,769
recruit retain women for the tech

00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:37,200
industry I think we all know why that's

00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:40,800
so important we need women at the table

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,690
in the lab in the boardrooms we need

00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,800
them badly so that we can create the

00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:45,600
future there was an artificial

00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,980
intelligence talk artificial

00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,860
intelligence is a really good example of

00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:51,030
why it's so important that everyone be

00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,410
at the table informing the next

00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:54,060
generation of technologies because they

00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:56,760
will create our very existence are very

00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:58,410
experienced but there's a parallel

00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,970
mission for the project and that is to

00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:02,160
give women a platform to be seen and

00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:03,690
heard for their experiences just a few

00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:06,120
pictures of the women that have been

00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:07,530
sharing those experiences when we hear

00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,209
their stories we learn from them and we

00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:10,820
become more empathetic and we understand

00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:13,470
experiences other than our own

00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:15,150
women feel empowered and when they're

00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:17,040
empowered they're more likely to submit

00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:19,979
the patch raise their hand in a meeting

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,840
and ask for the promotion but for so

00:04:19,979 --> 00:04:24,570
long we haven't heard from women they've

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,320
been heads down they've been quiet just

00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:27,850
like that four-year-old girl

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,260
but things are changing women are

00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:31,290
starting to talk and share their stories

00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:35,020
men to about their experiences in tech

00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:37,480
and I think that it's actually helping

00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:38,980
women who are early in their career

00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,060
women who are mid-career and women who

00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:43,210
are in the twilight of their career not

00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:45,010
feel so alone and feeling alone may

00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:46,510
sound kind of soft like okay well

00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:48,040
whatever but I think us in the

00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:50,860
open-source community know more than

00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:52,840
anyone else how important it is to feel

00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:54,640
connected and like you're a part of the

00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:58,800
group because when you do you're more

00:04:54,640 --> 00:05:04,720
likely to build create debate write and

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:07,150
innovate excuse me while I reference my

00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,500
notes I'm really optimistic after

00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:10,810
spending a year and a half on this

00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,340
project because I'm hearing a lot of

00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:14,980
different experiences for men and women

00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:17,800
in tech today I have the pleasure to

00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:20,050
share for the first time one of those

00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:23,560
stories with you from a very important

00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:25,780
woman miss nithya ruff I think many of

00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:28,510
you know nithya she's a longtime open

00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:31,480
source contributor and participant I

00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:33,640
first met nithya about 10 years ago at a

00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:35,440
Linux con or collaboration summit some

00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:37,060
Linux Foundation event and we quickly

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,670
bonded over her excuse me over her

00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:41,350
jewelry she has a beautiful necklace on

00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:42,340
and the piece that I'm gonna show she

00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:43,420
actually designs and makes her own

00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:45,160
jewelry I don't know how many of you

00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:47,170
know that but it's pretty amazing but as

00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:49,180
we started talking more we started to

00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:50,590
bond over how to market and promote open

00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:52,630
source projects such an important

00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:53,500
component of the community and we've

00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:55,960
been friends ever since

00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,310
and she's been extremely instrumental in

00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,410
supporting the project she's one of our

00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:01,000
biggest advocates and recently she

00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:03,070
brought her company Comcast NBC

00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,260
Universal to the table and they are one

00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:06,460
of our newest partners very engaged and

00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:10,570
we're gonna have more to announce with

00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:12,010
them in the coming weeks nithya has been

00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,000
so forthcoming and sharing her stories

00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:15,130
and participate in the project that

00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,450
today is today she's the first woman to

00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:18,220
be featured in a new series that were

00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:20,500
releasing right now called meet the

00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:22,030
women of chasing grace we produced these

00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,680
episodes they're not available online

00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:25,120
yet you can only see them at screenings

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,160
because we are negotiating with

00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,690
distributors and because we can't sell

00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,950
them until we have a full body of work

00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:31,810
but there's been so much excitement for

00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:33,850
the project that we're talking about it

00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:35,169
we're sharing it as much as we can but

00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:37,210
we thought that with four to six months

00:06:35,169 --> 00:06:39,790
between episode premieres that we could

00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:40,180
release a series of shorts online so the

00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:41,289
first

00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:43,030
are going live today and then we'll

00:06:41,289 --> 00:06:44,979
release one every Friday from here on

00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:46,419
out and this gives you a chance to kind

00:06:44,979 --> 00:06:48,310
of get behind the scenes and see a

00:06:46,419 --> 00:06:50,770
little bit more from these women than

00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:52,419
you might see otherwise if you can't

00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:54,280
attend a screening I will give you a

00:06:52,419 --> 00:06:56,229
preview we are going to be screening

00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,520
episode 1 here directly afterwards in

00:06:56,229 --> 00:07:00,340
the sponsor showcase I hope you'll join

00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:03,400
us it's the full 22 minute episode of

00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:07,990
the first 22 minute episode of our very

00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:10,030
first episode about the pay gap so

00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:11,560
nithya story that we share today is just

00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:13,389
a couple minutes and it's about the role

00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:15,729
that her father played and kind of

00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:17,620
moving her into her past pathway in tech

00:07:15,729 --> 00:07:19,599
and it really shows I think the

00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:21,849
importance of male allies but also of

00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:23,919
all allies the importance of community

00:07:21,849 --> 00:07:25,630
and again feeling like you belong in

00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,039
creating an inclusive community and it

00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:29,229
all starts with the individuals in your

00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:34,690
life so with that let's roll nithya

00:07:29,229 --> 00:07:37,449
short profile I was born and brought up

00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:40,810
in Bangalore India which is now become

00:07:37,449 --> 00:07:45,820
Silicon Valley of India I grew up in a

00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:49,150
very middle-class household my dad was

00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:51,550
an engineer he actually hired a lot of

00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:54,610
women in his organization and in

00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:58,510
different capacities so he showed me

00:07:54,610 --> 00:08:01,090
that there were very strong careers that

00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:03,130
women can have in business and then

00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:05,500
every time we had visitors at home I

00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:08,800
didn't usually hang out with the woman

00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:10,180
in the back in the kitchen or in the

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,400
dining room

00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:15,250
separate from the guys he would always

00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:19,630
pull me into conversations with his

00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:21,460
visitors and so he really involved me in

00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:24,550
those conversations he treated me as an

00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:26,860
equal my mother was really anxious to

00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:29,800
get me married especially an arranged

00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:31,750
marriage it was he who said no I think

00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:34,000
she should really stand on her own legs

00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:36,130
she should have her own income she

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,289
should be an independent woman because

00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:41,440
we knew how that everyone respects you

00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:45,220
and everyone gives you you know equal

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:48,029
status and he insisted that I first get

00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:51,160
my education before I got married

00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:52,370
someone came to visit our house and they

00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,800
planted the idea

00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:57,950
of have you thought about going to the

00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,870
u.s. to study and it was my father who

00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:02,300
was very pivotal at this point in time

00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:03,980
and said to me you really got to get a

00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:05,690
degree in computer science if you're

00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:08,390
going to the u.s. do computer science

00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:11,570
because that's the future it's important

00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:15,320
to have people around us who sponsor us

00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:18,110
and mentor us and push us and many of

00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:20,780
the good moments in my life happened

00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:23,510
when someone believed in me and pushed

00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:31,910
me to do more than I could only believed

00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:33,500

project has grown so quickly over the

00:11:41,379 --> 00:11:44,829
last year and a half it's gotten much

00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:46,600
bigger than just the open source

00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:48,220
community but I just want to express my

00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,170
thanks because the open source community

00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:51,459
is also my tribe and it's where

00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:54,399
everything started and our very first

00:11:51,459 --> 00:11:57,040
supporters come from this community so

00:11:54,399 --> 00:12:01,060

keynotes and talking this year but this

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,110
one's probably the one that made me the

00:12:14,709 --> 00:12:18,870
most nervous right because this is my

00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:21,490
