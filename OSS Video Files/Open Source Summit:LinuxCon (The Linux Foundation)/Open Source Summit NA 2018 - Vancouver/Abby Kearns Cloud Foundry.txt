00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:15,610
how do somebody engineer here at open

00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:17,470
source summit in Vancouver today we have

00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:18,390
with us queen of cloud Abby how are you

00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:22,779
doing today

00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:24,400
fantastic you certainly the whole IPO

00:00:22,779 --> 00:00:26,920
thing happened how does it reflect you

00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,980
know on platform II well I think it's

00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:32,890
fantastic that one pivotal has got a

00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:34,930
great portfolio of capabilities both

00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:36,760
from pivotal Cloud Foundry as well as

00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:38,410
the enablement services they have around

00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:41,500
it and their data suite so I think

00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:43,449
they've got a great portfolio to to go

00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:47,140
public with but it's obviously really

00:00:43,449 --> 00:00:49,149
great for Cloud Foundry to see a company

00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:51,399
that's able to go public you know really

00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:53,859
with Cloud Foundry as the tip of the

00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:57,010
spear for them now let's look at cloud

00:00:53,859 --> 00:00:58,149
phone itself in the last 12 months can

00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:00,010
you talk about the growth and adoption

00:00:58,149 --> 00:01:00,969
of cloud foundry it's been super

00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:03,940
phenomenal I've been part of this

00:01:00,969 --> 00:01:06,340
ecosystem now for five years it's been

00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:10,240
really great to see cloud foundry grow

00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:11,440
and evolve we are in over half the

00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,510
fortune 500

00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:17,560
you know those numbers continue to go

00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:19,420
increase day by day we are you know

00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,130
really the standard for what a lot of

00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:23,680
companies are basing the future of their

00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:25,720
company on and we've seen a ton of

00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:29,049
growth and evolution in our ecosystem

00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:31,420
this year we also saw Alibaba cloud join

00:01:29,049 --> 00:01:34,270
as a gold number and Cloud Foundry is

00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:36,280
now natively available in Alibaba cloud

00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:38,520
and I think we'll see a lot more from

00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:41,860
them so we're seeing Cloud Foundry

00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,799
adoption grow by enterprise users we're

00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:46,810
seeing all of the major public clouds

00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:48,850
wanting to be part of the ecosystem and

00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:51,969
the offering around Cloud Foundry and

00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:53,790
we're seeing enterprises really that

00:01:51,969 --> 00:01:56,220
they've adopted it really lean in and

00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:58,440
the technology so it's been an amazing

00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:00,510
last 12 months and if you look at the

00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:03,690
growth of expansion our ecosystem we

00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:06,570
also embraced humanities with CF CR yes

00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:07,860
so how does that affect you know the

00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:09,810
ecosystem yourself kubernetes is

00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:13,950
fantastic I mean it's a great technology

00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:15,570
it brings a ton of capability to to

00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:17,610
containers and containers are really the

00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:19,080
fundamental building block for a lot of

00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:21,720
the portability for where cloud native

00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,380
us so I think having that technology has

00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,840
been great

00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:26,490
we launched CFC are as you said last

00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,350
year the Cloud Foundry container runtime

00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:30,750
which is kubernetes on Bosh it's our

00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:32,160
distribution of kubernetes and that's a

00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:34,200
lot of enterprises to start really

00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,209
sampling in that with that technology

00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,950
and running those containerized

00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:39,890
workloads alongside their Cloud Foundry

00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:42,450
deployment so they can have a single

00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:45,510
plane of operations that allows them to

00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:47,400
have a variety of applications now

00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:50,330
having said that what I really firmly

00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:53,010
believe is that we are entering into

00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:55,470
beyond us multi clouds multi-platform

00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:57,450
world where enterprises are going to

00:02:55,470 --> 00:03:00,300
really be running a variety of

00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:02,580
technologies and solutions to address

00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:05,250
their variety of workload needs with

00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:07,380
their applications and so you know I'm

00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:10,110
I'm very strongly and firmly that

00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:11,970
multiple technologies will really be

00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:14,420
part of the larger story for most

00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:16,320
enterprises what is malignant phone

00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:18,360
multi-platform means that they're gonna

00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:20,010
be wanting a variety of platforms for a

00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,290
variety of application workloads there's

00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:23,130
never going to be one technology that

00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:25,350
solves everything

00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:26,910
that's not Cloud Foundry that's not

00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:29,340
kubernetes that's not any platform and

00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:32,730
that's fine because at the end of the

00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:35,040
day enterprises are broad they're

00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:37,200
complex they have all we need

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,360
and I think recognizing that it's from a

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,070
technology standpoint is important and

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,160
an understanding that all these

00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:46,420
technologies really will complement each

00:03:44,160 --> 00:04:02,240
other over time

00:03:46,420 --> 00:04:02,240
