Description: 
	Keynote: Who Pays for Open Source? A Case for Open Governance & Enterprise Contributions - Angel Diaz, VP Developer Technology, Open Source & Advocacy, IBM

The beauty of open source is that it is developed in the open as a public collaboration between companies and individuals and then made freely available to download and use. It sounds perfect but at the end of the day, who really pays for open source to meet the demands of quality code contributions and best of breed maintenance? In his keynote, Angel Diaz explores this provocative question making the rounds in developer circles today and makes the case for open governance and enterprise contributions as the way forward. Learn about the best practices of open governance as well as the crucial importance of enterprise contributions to open source to drive quality code, deliver on maintenance needs and minimize overall risk for the community.

good morning how you doing all right all

00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:07,500
right well thank you thank you for

00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:09,809
coming it's been a fun a fun couple of

00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,929
days here I must say and I got to tell

00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:15,120
you I am so grateful so proud so humbled

00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:16,859
to be here with you all today like you

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,779
all I am a computer scientist I'm a

00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:22,109
developer and engineer data scientist

00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:23,960
and every time I wake up in the morning

00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:27,539
I see that we're living in this

00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:31,470
technology fueled business societal

00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:33,329
Renaissance you know cloud data

00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:35,430
artificial intelligence transactions

00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:38,399
this democratization of technology that

00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:41,550
allows us to do our jobs faster better

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:44,100
building on the shoulders of giants of

00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:46,260
open source projects that started in the

00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,440
80s with compilers all the way through

00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:53,219
to where we are today and it is such a

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:56,520
fun time to be an innovator but at the

00:00:53,219 --> 00:01:01,500
same time you know this doesn't come

00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:03,719
without blood sweat tears okay perhaps a

00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,760
little bit of tears right and and I want

00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:07,110
to start the conversation and in fact

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,689
you're gonna hear me say this several

00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:12,479
times throughout this presentation with

00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:14,909
one thing and that is thank you thank

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,369
you to all of you who spend your time

00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:18,960
writing code working in working groups

00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:22,560
etc so can you give yourselves a round

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:25,710
of applause please come on it's not that

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:29,670
early thank thank you thank you because

00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:32,040
it really does take a lot in fact it's

00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,750
interesting you know for those of us who

00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,030
for folks who don't live in this

00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:38,460
open-source world every day there's an

00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:41,579
incredible amount of very positive hype

00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:43,229
around open-source in fact I've hope you

00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:45,030
know I've heard people talk about open

00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:48,259
source like it smells like freshly

00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:52,229
washed linen well for that you know

00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:54,390
container build to run and act like

00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:57,240
freshly washed linen a lot of work

00:01:54,390 --> 00:02:01,049
happens in order to get there right so

00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:03,780
as I go through this investment that we

00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:08,520
all put in as a community and as an

00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:11,730
organization as people I like to do that

00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,310
by looking at the past first so let's go

00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:17,360
into a little time machine let's

00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:19,760
back let us jump into the past so does

00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,530
anybody know how open-source started or

00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,620
hold this notion of collaborative

00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:26,150
computing started well very academic

00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:29,330
driven we know that right because in

00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:31,849
academia we collaborate quite a bit but

00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:35,150
the first real big awakening was in the

00:02:31,849 --> 00:02:37,430
90s and I I remember I had just I grew

00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:38,750
up in Puerto Rico I went to college got

00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:41,090
a PhD in computer science and I went

00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:43,970
right to IBM research you know and I'm a

00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:45,680
and Here I am at IBM Research kids

00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:47,930
sitting here it's my left I have

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,519
Mandelbrot fractals you know it's my

00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:54,170
right I got Bob Denard the person who

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:55,549
met - dear Ann Wright because you know

00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:58,340
the world the computer science is so

00:02:55,549 --> 00:03:00,920
amazing but you know this notion of

00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:03,709
Linux and collaborating around operating

00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:06,110
systems or democratizing how people

00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:08,330
build technology around Java and tooling

00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:10,459
with Eclipse or what's happening in

00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:12,769
Apache those were the things that

00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:15,200
started to create open-source center of

00:03:12,769 --> 00:03:18,650
gravity's places where we as developers

00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:21,739
can go and innovate and do it in a safe

00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:24,829
way and do in a way that is meritocracy

00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:27,500
driven what matters is the value of your

00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:29,780
code the value of your test case the

00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:32,930
value of what you bring not the dollars

00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:35,930
in your pocket okay and that is what

00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:37,819
exploded an industry and that was given

00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:41,120
us all an opportunity to innovate and

00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:43,310
here we are now today in the second

00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,549
awakening or the second Renaissance of

00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:50,180
open-source right we have been building

00:03:46,549 --> 00:03:51,319
out together explicitly a lot of what I

00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:53,120
think about when I talk to our

00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:56,600
development teams and I run everything

00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:59,660
that touches developers in IBM in open

00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,920
cloud data artifact artificial

00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:04,150
intelligence and transaction

00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:07,730
architecture and that is significant

00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:09,950
sorry that is up a little punctuation

00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:13,420
point on that that is significant

00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:16,250
imagine you know we are reinventing

00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:19,220
technology democratizing technology

00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:20,959
right and we're doing that in a way that

00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:22,880
is open that allows everyone to

00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:26,760
contribute everyone to gain value from

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:28,620
that but the question that we always ask

00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,150
that folks always ask whether you work

00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:32,400
for a big company some of you all

00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:34,260
anybody work for companies raise your

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,620
hand if you work for a company right you

00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:39,360
work for yourself I would work for free

00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:41,790
by the way because I have so much fun

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,310
don't tell anybody right you have to

00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:46,380
somehow justify this right why do I have

00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:48,870
to go to Vancouver right why do I need

00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:51,450
to be in this working group who's paying

00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:53,610
for open source and who benefits from

00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:57,860
open source and when I say pay it's not

00:04:53,610 --> 00:05:00,240
all about money okay it is also time an

00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:02,790
investment right time away from your

00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,320
family time you spend coding time you

00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:06,540
spend thinking about things over dinner

00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,130
right so I like to put this in

00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:10,800
perspective across three areas the

00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:13,560
consortium the enterprise in individual

00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,730
and hopefully at the end as we get

00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,340
through this here in the next couple of

00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:21,180
minutes we'll also have an appreciation

00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:23,610
of who benefits because we all benefit

00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:26,340
the companies we work for benefit the

00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:32,300
consortium benefits us as individuals

00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:34,710
benefit and believe it or not the world

00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:36,050
benefits and we'll talk about that so

00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:37,940
let's start with the consortium

00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:40,200
something like say the Linux Foundation

00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:43,530
you know there is a huge responsibility

00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:45,720
in creating a nurturing open

00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:49,350
collaborative environment for innovation

00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:52,590
for code for development that spans not

00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:55,860
just you know the code itself but the

00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:57,630
end users which by the way is a big

00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:00,300
difference from how we used to do things

00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:02,400
in the 90s you know one of my first jobs

00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,930
did IBM research list of work with Tim

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,700
berners-lee on a lot of the original web

00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:08,880
standards and parsers and things so I

00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:11,400
got to co-author things like CSS and the

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,920
DOM and HTML and XML and I wrote you

00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:16,200
know first XML parser and C++ then in

00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:19,380
Java and you know when we were doing

00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:21,060
this stuff do you know why the web was

00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:26,400
created you know what do you know what

00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:28,080
the first use case for XML was it was

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:32,250
the mathematical markup language was the

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:34,230
first DTD know schemas DTD for for XML

00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:36,430
that was the use case and it's great

00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:38,860
because we want to disseminate math and

00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:40,870
information but when you're using your

00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:43,000
phone and you're using particles in HTTP

00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:44,980
and sending you know things on these

00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,920
protocols or viewing a page as being

00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:50,440
styled by CSS inside your browser or on

00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:51,280
the device you've got a different use

00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:54,280
case in mind

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,530
not so much math you know maybe you're

00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,700
buying something maybe you're playing a

00:06:56,530 --> 00:07:00,700
game right

00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:03,310
and so what's amazing and what Bill

00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:04,930
consortia one of the biggest things that

00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:07,990
they've done in this kind of second

00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:11,800
awakening is establishing the end user

00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:14,080
as a first-class entity and think about

00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:16,780
the innovation that can come when end

00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,850
users happen another really important

00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:21,040
thing that the consortia have done is

00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:23,440
that it's helped realize then that all

00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:25,660
open source is created equal some

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,490
couches are better than other some

00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:29,920
pieces of code is better than other

00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:32,170
right and when you're out there and

00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:33,880
you're using a piece of code I think

00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:36,280
you'd like to know that maybe that piece

00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:37,630
of code would last a little bit that if

00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:40,150
there's a change that it will get

00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:43,180
updated or you'll be notified or if you

00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:45,130
want to submit an update to a piece of

00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:46,600
code there's a way for you to do that so

00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:48,670
that you can actually use that code

00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:51,550
without forking it and keeping you know

00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:54,640
the legacy code yourself for the rest of

00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:56,830
your life right so this notion of

00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:59,830
governance this notion of you know

00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:03,820
taking those couches and helping creates

00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:06,310
you know beautiful rooms around them

00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:09,280
centers of gravity with responsible

00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:11,440
licensing you know a diversity ecosystem

00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:14,770
a meritocracy for how you participate

00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:18,670
open governance has been fundamental to

00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:21,160
the progress of open source and a case

00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:22,720
study that I absolutely loved that

00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,890
because I was fortunate to be a part of

00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,510
from the beginning is the cloud native

00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:27,340
computing foundation in fact Jim and

00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:28,930
myself and colleague from Google stood

00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:31,060
at stage a task on a couple years ago

00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:33,190
and announced this cloud native

00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:34,720
computing foundation and since then and

00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:38,080
thanks to the leadership of Linux

00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:39,940
Foundation I mean you can't kind of

00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,100
cross the street by getting but by not

00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:43,780
seeing a container somewhere right and

00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,380
someone's talking about micro services

00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:47,380
and

00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:49,180
and then how do I expose things as is AP

00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:51,550
ice to live in a micro-services whether

00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:53,170
I'm a spring bot app or some other app

00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:56,140
everybody wants to be at micro-service

00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:58,720
right and but it's amazing to see that

00:08:56,140 --> 00:09:00,670
as how that has happened so the

00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:06,280
investment in doing all of that is

00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:09,460
amazing so to all the consortium ember

00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:10,690
to booth I heard of you know the Linux

00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:12,220
Foundation aren't you alright let's give

00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:17,830
him thanks to the Linux Foundation thank

00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:19,960
you very much thank you so it's good to

00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:21,250
get her whoo at 9:00 in the morning let

00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,760
me tell you because I could use a little

00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:25,030
of that

00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:28,540
all right the enterprise folks who

00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:31,540
employ us right enterprise is kind of a

00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:34,110
strange big word but it's not just

00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:36,880
financial commitment obviously

00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:39,340
organizations Jim spoke about some of

00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,930
the things we've done early on in IBM

00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:44,140
and and you know I I didn't fully

00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:45,010
appreciate it when I first joined IBM

00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:47,860
because that's when the first

00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:49,690
Renaissance was occurring you know but

00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:50,950
for a company like IBM for example in

00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:52,870
the days of Linux to say you know what

00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:54,520
we're gonna protect all the intellectual

00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:57,970
property and open source with our patent

00:09:54,520 --> 00:10:01,330
portfolio that gave us as open-source

00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:05,410
practitioners a freedom that we're not

00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:08,410
going to be litigated right so it's

00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:10,840
those kinds of things that really make

00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:13,240
this all work for us but it's also

00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:16,420
sustained development and what do I mean

00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:19,240
by that well one thing in IBM we're not

00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:22,180
open source leeches I can quote me on

00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:24,790
that right we obviously use a lot of

00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:28,090
open source in fact you take your

00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:30,280
typical IBM product or service it's

00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:31,510
about 75% open source we run the open

00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,910
source process for the company

00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:35,170
everything sits in to see ICD all our

00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:37,840
developers are what we call open source

00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:39,280
certified right they know how to use

00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:42,040
codes they cannot a contribute code and

00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:43,770
we participate we have tens of thousands

00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:46,240
of developers using and contributing to

00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:48,370
communities whether it's some leadership

00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,470
roles or doing all the work and just

00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:52,780
building test cases running bills and so

00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:55,690
forth it is it is a fun thing to do in

00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:58,100
fact one question I often get asking the

00:10:55,690 --> 00:11:02,180
reason I show this is is that how do

00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:04,759
I how do I learn to do that as well so

00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:06,860
if you want to talk to your companies

00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:08,630
about how to become more open go visit

00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:09,980
developer to IBM the comp for slash open

00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:12,350
and that can give you some tips to

00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:14,839
convince them and explain the value but

00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:16,600
it all is about fixing bugs doing the

00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:18,740
dirty work and earning your stripes

00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,630
because at the end of the day just

00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:22,399
because you can write a check to help

00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:24,069
create a foundation you know how much

00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:27,290
influence that gives you in the code

00:11:24,069 --> 00:11:29,449
zero the influence comes from the people

00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:31,880
who are doing the work who get that

00:11:29,449 --> 00:11:35,839
voted in to run the different areas and

00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:37,850
get your code accepted so two things

00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:41,180
before I leave this part a beautiful

00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:44,209
example of an open community is the open

00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:44,690
mainframe project or the IBM's II think

00:11:44,209 --> 00:11:47,089
about it

00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:48,920
you can scale a node application to

00:11:47,089 --> 00:11:51,649
receive a billion respiratory

00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:54,470
one little button imagine had to write

00:11:51,649 --> 00:11:56,420
that in code and you don't yet and you

00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:57,560
don't even know what's the Z system so

00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:59,060
that's the kind of innovation that's

00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:01,040
occurring and you look at the cloud

00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:02,689
native computing foundation and all of

00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,449
the vendors have got excited about that

00:12:02,689 --> 00:12:08,329
another great example so to the

00:12:05,449 --> 00:12:12,250
enterprises to your bosses to our bosses

00:12:08,329 --> 00:12:16,430
let's give them a thank you thank you

00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:18,019
pattern right thank you because it

00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:21,199
allows us to do we do now the individual

00:12:18,019 --> 00:12:23,540
a whole that's the heart right this is

00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:26,540
this is what makes open-source work and

00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:28,459
we're responsible for doing the code for

00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:30,230
driving and erasing and front driving

00:12:28,459 --> 00:12:32,180
innovation in fostering collaboration

00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:34,579
we've got a handsome fellow up there on

00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:38,509
the left and mud that's me in Puerto

00:12:34,579 --> 00:12:39,889
Rico and and I got to say we all start

00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:41,750
from humble beginnings

00:12:39,889 --> 00:12:43,430
I wasn't born a computer scientist trust

00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:45,560
me I lived on a farm okay

00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:47,509
I used to follow the cows and shovel

00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:50,750
well sixth grade before I went to school

00:12:47,509 --> 00:12:52,880
and that wasn't very pleasant but I am

00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:56,029
so fortunate to be here because of

00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:59,300
others because of others who helped me

00:12:56,029 --> 00:13:03,709
learn how to code who brought together

00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:05,630
code community content in a place so

00:13:03,709 --> 00:13:07,279
that I can learn and participate and

00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:09,709
grow with others and all of you do that

00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,130
every day you're either being helped or

00:13:09,709 --> 00:13:13,830
you are helping

00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:16,130
okay and that's how we become great

00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:21,390
together through humble beginnings in

00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:55,680
fact we just relaunched a site developer

00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:59,790
at ibm.com/developerworks

00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:01,890
and it is all about how we behave okay

00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:03,720
and we know this but as individuals

00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:06,450
there's investment not just in our time

00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:09,360
and money but as in how we act you have

00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:10,710
to be nice you have to be a doer not a

00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,860
talker right

00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:15,390
you have to mentor people okay don't be

00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:16,620
a drive-by committer in other words

00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:18,270
don't just throw code once and then

00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:21,990
never do anything with it that's not

00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:24,090
cool all right you got to build trust do

00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:26,040
the dirty work all right

00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:27,840
learn about what you're doing don't

00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,700
think you know exactly everything about

00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:32,340
a piece of code that's there know the

00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:33,870
licenses be authentic these are the

00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:37,050
kinds of things that we think about and

00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:38,940
the people again following the case

00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:41,610
study cloud native computing foundation

00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:43,470
look at the growth look at the growth of

00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:45,200
the cloud native computing foundation in

00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:48,060
just a short amount of time is

00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:49,230
spectacular right the number of meetups

00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:52,350
number of end-users and number of

00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:58,770
participants or dealing with this now

00:14:52,350 --> 00:15:00,420
the world okay look if you think about

00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:03,300
it well first of all I forgot something

00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:05,970
thank you to the individual I think all

00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,300
of us the bank ourselves yes okay very

00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:08,130
good

00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:09,690
how can I forget the most important part

00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:10,800
and so I'm a little nervous up here you

00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:15,920
know as you can tell

00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:19,080
yellow nervous on stage all right look

00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,850
about out a year ago we were thinking

00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:23,550
about how can we harness the power

00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:24,990
developers to do good ok cuz you know by

00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:26,130
the way it's computer scientists

00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:29,250
we're coding all the time were you

00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:31,170
paying us or not okay and how do we

00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:32,660
harness that for good we launched

00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:37,110
something with the Linux Foundation

00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:38,760
United Nations the Red Cross a venture

00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:41,850
capital firm called NEA and at this

00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:43,260
point 50-plus other corporations and

00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:46,200
open-source communities called call for

00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:48,959
code it is a four-month long hack for

00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:51,060
good it answers September 28th so still

00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:53,339
time to participate and this year it's

00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:55,830
about preparing for disasters remember

00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:58,100
from Puerto Rico it was pretty rough my

00:15:55,830 --> 00:16:01,770
parents still don't have electricity

00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:02,880
okay in their house it's rough software

00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:04,800
could have made a different software

00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,149
will make a difference and there's lots

00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,149
of reasons for you all to join not just

00:16:06,149 --> 00:16:10,589
helping people prepare for disasters but

00:16:09,149 --> 00:16:12,149
guess what the first couple solutions

00:16:10,589 --> 00:16:14,130
will be deployed winners will be

00:16:12,149 --> 00:16:16,170
deployed for real so this is some hack

00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:17,550
for fun this is a hack that will make a

00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:20,279
difference so if we could save one life

00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:22,560
ten lives a thousand lives you can make

00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:25,140
a difference software open-source can

00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:27,450
make a difference $200,000 is not bad

00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:30,440
either right yeah that's that's good

00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:34,170
price you're also judged by folks who

00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:36,480
are pretty famous likeliness like the

00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:38,790
head of United Nations Human Rights the

00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:42,180
CEO of the red of the red movement right

00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:44,640
there's famous judges you'll have a

00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:47,160
chance if you win or in the finalists to

00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:49,830
to pitch your stuff to the world's

00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:53,700
largest venture firm it's not bad right

00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:55,110
and the top ten or so projects will live

00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:57,660
on and the Linux Foundation is

00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:59,850
open-source projects this is a five-year

00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:00,540
commitment that we made right bringing

00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:02,850
open-source

00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:06,990
to the world and so many people have

00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:10,170
gotten involved in fact and this is one

00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:13,079
thing that just blows my mind okay not

00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:15,510
just your typical companies your large

00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:18,890
enterprises open-source organizations

00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:22,020
charitable organizations but celebrities

00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:24,300
just in world humanitarian day which was

00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:27,209
a couple weeks ago whether you like DJ
