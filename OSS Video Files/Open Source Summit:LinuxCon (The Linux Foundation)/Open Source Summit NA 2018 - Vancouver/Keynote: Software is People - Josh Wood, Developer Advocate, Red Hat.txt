	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,380
good morning everyone I'm Josh wood from

00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:07,410
Red Hat I think you've already heard

00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:08,940
that I am a developer advocate for

00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:11,070
kubernetes and open shifts so I

00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,960
concentrate a lot on automation around

00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:15,379
these platforms some things I've talked

00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,750
about this week including operators

00:00:15,379 --> 00:00:20,520
relate directly to that we're not going

00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,650
to talk a lot about those things except

00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:25,380
at a very high level in today's talk

00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:30,090
instead I come to you folks with

00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:34,380
shocking news software is people it's

00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:35,430
people and what I mean by this I'm going

00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,800
to try to illustrate and I actually

00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,899
think by pure accident then it may

00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,329
dovetail fairly nicely with with the

00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:43,800
longer form talk that you just saw and I

00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:46,320
hope that it does so and serves as kind

00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:49,980
of a exhortation or peroration on the

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,530
end of that now in our industry we

00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:55,079
produce a litany of words we produce

00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:57,719
more words in terms than the best

00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:00,690
novelists just here at this conference

00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:02,789
open source summit just my company Red

00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:04,589
Hat is addressed a long list of topics

00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:06,270
that you can find in the schedule I'll

00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:08,340
hit a highlight a couple of them here

00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:10,680
we've of course talked about open shift

00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,750
our kubernetes distribution we've talked

00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,640
as I just mentioned about automation on

00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,290
that platform in the form of operators

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,360
and some of the other things we work on

00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:20,520
both upstream and in our own projects

00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,950
around kubernetes some of my colleagues

00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,750
have spoken about the security of the

00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,670
containers that actually run on those

00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,920
platforms and best practices for

00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:31,079
maintaining security as we move into

00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,939
these kind of architectures but we've

00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:34,560
also talked about things I might refer

00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:36,869
to as more of the people side of this

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,240
equation another of my colleagues has

00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:42,360
spoken this week about using open data

00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:44,729
to make Civic technical systems more

00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,920
sustainable and help improve decision

00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:49,350
making processes and the same fellows

00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,780
actually spoken about automation in the

00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:53,909
form of processes to make community

00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:57,509
management and collaboration easier

00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:59,909
among larger and more diverse groups now

00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:02,399
out of all of that litany of words that

00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:04,500
we hear even in a short talk like this I

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,829
think we can narrow down at least a few

00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:10,110
clarifying principles first of them for

00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:13,020
most on the technical side of things we

00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,560
believe at Red Hat security through

00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,620
automation

00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,900
is our only real weapon against the

00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:21,060
vulnerabilities arms race in which we

00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:23,940
find ourselves as software practitioners

00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:25,830
only by automating updates can we keep

00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:28,200
up with attacks against vulnerabilities

00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:30,840
that we know well or themselves

00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:33,750
automated the nice thing about that is

00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,790
is these practices of automation lead to

00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:37,950
velocity in our ability to deliver

00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:41,010
software faster and with better features

00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:43,170
a velocity is kind of this business word

00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:44,880
or a favorite word of project managers

00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:46,530
but in an engineering or even at a

00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,000
philosophical level I think it's one of

00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:49,890
the dimensions that can help describe

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,660
something John McCarthy wrote about in

00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:53,940
the 1960s and called utility computing

00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:55,560
and utility computing can mean a lot of

00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,630
things but what it's really about is

00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,700
making computer power me durable

00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:01,530
switchable like the outlets in your

00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:03,569
house or your faucets in other words

00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:04,709
it's about making this technology and

00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:07,650
the increasing power of these

00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:09,600
technologies easy for people to consume

00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:12,030
so that's sort of at a high level a

00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,830
technical approach to these problems now

00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:15,300
at Red Hat we see those two principles

00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:18,000
in security through automation

00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:20,340
illustrated by 4os technologies about

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,620
automatic over-the-air updates for the

00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:24,840
platform itself kubernetes clusters and

00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:27,030
OpenShift clusters at the top end of

00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:30,150
that we see open shifts traditional

00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:32,040
concern for developer experience for the

00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:33,600
automation of builds and tests and other

00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,890
things that make it much easier to build

00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,579
software and deliver it onto that

00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:39,299
platform

00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:42,900
we are performing that automation on new

00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:44,820
public resources that have led to new

00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,260
kinds of collaboration I think brought

00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:48,390
us to a sort of golden moment of

00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:49,980
collaboration think of announcements

00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:51,480
from Red Hat and Microsoft working

00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,790
together right at an IBM working

00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:55,799
together openshift on Azure and suddenly

00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:57,780
every Java developer I know is running

00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:00,540
Linux in a little window on their

00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:02,190
Windows laptop you can insert your

00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:04,680
favorite recent tale of unlikely

00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:06,600
bedfellows there I think from this we

00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:09,269
can say that collaboration of this sort

00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:11,519
works is happening at unprecedented

00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:13,799
scale and I think we know that it cannot

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,180
happen without open source and that's

00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:16,760
what brings us all to this conference

00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:19,250
and the reason for that is because

00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:22,770
collaboration happens between people not

00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:24,630
between projects another way of saying

00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:26,700
this I saw this on Twitter this week I

00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:27,060
really liked it I don't know mr. Nola's

00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,980
but

00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,750
he's a data scientist the most

00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:33,150
underrated algorithm and data sciences

00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:35,490
go talk to people again why because

00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:37,920
those algorithms all systems and again

00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:41,760
software is people that's why

00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:44,580
communities build the best software open

00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:48,840
diverse communities building open-source

00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:51,090
software so I urge you to go forth and

00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:53,460
collaborate join us in making utility

00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:56,250
computing a dream since almost the in

00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:58,590
the beginnings of our industry a reality

00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:00,600
by making these things automated and

00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:02,790
easy for people to consume to help

00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,010
developers concentrate on features

00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:07,140
instead of platforms and infrastructure

00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:09,360
and deliver continually more interesting

00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,830
and more powerful software designed for

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,750
security with automation and you will

00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:15,419
find velocity in those same techniques

00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:18,300
for automation most importantly designed

00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:21,030
for humans and for consequences we all

00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:22,320
compete or at least our companies do but

00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:23,970
I urge you in the spirit of this

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:27,240
conference that brings us together this

00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:29,580
morning to collaborate along the lines

00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:32,060
of that same competition to build better

00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:34,360
faster easier software in the future

00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:40,290
thank you

00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:40,290
