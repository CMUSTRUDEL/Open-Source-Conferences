00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:15,160
he had been you know letting the hyper

00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:16,900
ledger tragic for a while so can you

00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,910
just tell us the update what's going on

00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:20,950
in since he joined and where we are now

00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:22,450
sure well I join a hyper ledger about

00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:24,310
six months after it started and I've

00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:28,570
been there now for just over two years

00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:30,310
and the the project has grown in in a

00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:32,529
way that mirrors a lot of the growth of

00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:34,540
the blockchain industry right I mean

00:00:32,529 --> 00:00:36,280
when we started all of the excitement

00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:37,600
was around Bitcoin was around I mean

00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,180
theorem was just launching at the same

00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,559
time this was 2015 December 2015 when it

00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:42,910
was announced but there are a lot of

00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:45,250
people saying there's more to this than

00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:47,020
just spending money and moving money

00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:49,090
around could we use this as a way to

00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:51,550
reestablish how Trust works on the

00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:53,920
internet and and try to decentralize a

00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:55,660
lot of things that today with led to

00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,950
being centralized it might be okay to be

00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:58,750
centralized if you're talking about a

00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:01,030
ride hailing application or you're

00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:02,199
talking about a social network right but

00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:03,730
if you're talking about a banking

00:01:02,199 --> 00:01:04,930
Network if you're talking about supply

00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:07,180
chains you might not want to be so

00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:08,860
centralized so the blockchain industry

00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:10,869
has grown and at hyper literally

00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:12,550
realized pretty early we needed to be a

00:01:10,869 --> 00:01:14,320
home for a lot of different ways to

00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:16,030
build a blockchain it wasn't going to be

00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,710
like the Linux kernel project with one

00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:19,510
singular architecture it was going to be

00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:21,070
a couple of different ones and let's

00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:23,200
explore and see what happens does this

00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:25,540
look like my sequel and Cassandra and

00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,850
Redis or does is there really just one

00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:30,490
logical architecture now at hyper ledger

00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:32,590
we have ten different technology

00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:35,650
projects five of those are what we call

00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:37,900
frameworks these are software that a

00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:39,670
bank would run or a company would run to

00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:42,430
participate in a and a blockchain

00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:44,020
project and a distributed ledger with a

00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:45,579
bunch of other organizations they want

00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:48,040
to do business with two of those are now

00:01:45,579 --> 00:01:51,280
production quality hyper ledger fabric

00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:54,970
which is kind of the basis for a lot of

00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,560
IBM's work Oracle whywe they've all

00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:58,869
hosted kind of blockchains of service

00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,759
offerings a lot of companies now provide

00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:03,130
products and services on top of this as

00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:04,750
well as hyper ledger Sawtooth which is a

00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:06,340
pretty novel approach it's one that

00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:08,140
borrows even a little bit more of its

00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:10,630
kind of DNA from the kind of the

00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:12,400
cryptocurrency community and that was

00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,840
been led by Intel but now there's a

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,540
bunch of companies behind that as well

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,340
and these two platforms now drive about

00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:20,709
40 production networks that we see out

00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:23,140
there at about 60 different

00:02:20,709 --> 00:02:25,299
vendors and and hosts and other

00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:26,950
companies building on top of it so one

00:02:25,299 --> 00:02:28,540
way we've grown is by growing the

00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:31,359
commercial ecosystem around this code

00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:33,129
and that's also led to lots of pilots

00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:34,750
and proofs of concept and as I said

00:02:33,129 --> 00:02:36,849
about 40 different production networks

00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,329
those the other eight projects that

00:02:36,849 --> 00:02:39,099
hyper ledger

00:02:37,329 --> 00:02:40,959
some of them are other frameworks so

00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:43,060
hyper ledger indie very much focused on

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,590
digital identity which has been a very

00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:47,049
hot topic for us everyone's asking

00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:49,389
what's next after Aadhaar all right well

00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:52,120
the India system in India to attract

00:02:49,389 --> 00:02:53,889
digital identity what's next when it

00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,329
comes to e passports and those sorts of

00:02:53,889 --> 00:02:58,720
things and how do we do that in a way

00:02:55,329 --> 00:03:00,549
that doesn't create privacy concerns or

00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,250
meets concerns of the GDP our for

00:03:00,549 --> 00:03:04,959
example and so India is very hot and

00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:07,569
we're starting to say even here in the

00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:10,150
government of British Columbia there's a

00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:12,489
pilot involving business registrations

00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:14,319
using hyper ledger Indy the other one on

00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:15,939
that mention is hyper ledger burrow

00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,189
which is an implementation of the

00:03:15,939 --> 00:03:20,230
etherium smart contract language called

00:03:18,189 --> 00:03:22,989
solidity it's a way to run solidity

00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:24,879
smart contracts both standalone on its

00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:27,639
own kind of blockchain or on top of

00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:29,500
sawtooth and now on top of fabric so

00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:31,540
lots of interesting mixing lots of

00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:34,419
interesting kind of a Brownian motion of

00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:36,040
good ideas coming in and the idea is to

00:03:34,419 --> 00:03:38,229
take this and put it down a kind of a

00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:40,590
conveyor belt to production software

00:03:38,229 --> 00:03:43,030
that people can use to actually build

00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:44,709
real blockchain systems they don't have

00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:47,769
to wait for some day you know that

00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:51,549
something's gonna solidify and we're all

00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:54,549
a non cryptocurrency non ICO kind of

00:03:51,549 --> 00:03:56,979
oriented but I I like to call it call it

00:03:54,549 --> 00:03:58,090
token agnostic at this point and so as

00:03:56,979 --> 00:03:59,439
awareness has grown and people have

00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:01,449
really started deploy we've also seen

00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:04,959
lots of new users come in contributors

00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:06,759
we have over 600 different people who've

00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,040
contributed software in one form or

00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:11,560
another like a patch or for many people

00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,019
it's their full-time job now and finally

00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:16,019
I'll mention we've have put we put up

00:04:14,019 --> 00:04:18,970
some free training materials on EDX

00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:20,769
courses that have now been started by

00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:22,990
over a hundred thousand different people

00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:24,759
registering for and starting the down

00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:26,919
the learning curve and we're about to

00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:29,200
launch training and certification for

00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:31,210
Hyper ledger fabric and hyper ledger

00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,710
Sawtooth to really help professional

00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:34,510
eyes kind of the the

00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:36,160
that's out there around us so what are

00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:38,320
the other use cases that you are also

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,720
excited about which you did not know

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,760
kind of you know thought about in the

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,620
beginning I think for me the biggest the

00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,360
biggest one I didn't anticipate going in

00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,980
that I think is going to be the place we

00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,860
have the biggest impact is on digital

00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:53,710
identity right this idea of turning your

00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:54,970
your identity being defined by all these

00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,680
things known about you on a remote

00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:58,450
server and you have like a name and

00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:01,420
password to that alright to instead

00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:03,700
being about data you have locally and

00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:04,840
claims things like your passport and

00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,640
things like your healthcare records

00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,990
things that you hold close to you and

00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,970
it's something that looks like a wallet

00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:11,620
alright something looks like a folder or

00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:13,390
some story and then you decide when to

00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:16,150
share with somebody else when to present

00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:19,240
your passport to a border you know agent

00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:20,770
or your history of prescriptions to a

00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,880
doctor that you're seeing while you're

00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:23,440
on vacation so you can get a

00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,580
prescription and then knowing who you

00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,740
shared it with and being able to pull

00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:28,150
that back no matter what happens on the

00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:29,560
servers right no matter you know it's

00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:32,620
not like you have to log into Facebook

00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:35,050
to share that information right this

00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:36,610
reinvention of digital identity is goes

00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:38,590
under the name self sovereign identity

00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:40,210
and hyper ledger indie is an

00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:41,440
implementation of that and it's

00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:43,510
something we're building in conjunction

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,940
with a lot of different nonprofits

00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:47,560
organizations building that

00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:49,390
infrastructure and we're seeing even

00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,100
government's take a strong interesting

00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:53,170
so that for me is like I know it's not a

00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:54,820
use case it's like a whole sector you

00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:57,130
know digital identity but that's gonna

00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:58,360
be perhaps the most impactful kind of

00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:00,370
change I think we'll see in the in in

00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:02,980
the next five years from blockchain

00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:05,140
technology obvious certain regions of

00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:07,390
the world where you're seeing an option

00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:09,130
of blocking or hyper logic more than

00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:11,890
other parts the interest is in really

00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:13,930
strong in China and mainland China the

00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:17,020
Chinese government has actually said

00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:18,940
this is a top-level priority for us to

00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:21,250
to figure out how to make distributed

00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:23,710
Ledger's work and and and blockchain

00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:26,130
technology work as a way to help build

00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:28,870
audit ability to markets a way to build

00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:32,140
to modernize their their own kind of

00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:33,820
marketplace that's right but also build

00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:36,160
trust and confidence be in a country

00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:39,670
where that's often either take it for

00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,310
granted or ignored right and so so we

00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:43,040
have about

00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:45,470
a 20% of our members are based inside

00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,850
China companies like Baidu and $0.10 and

00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:48,470
why way and they are actually

00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:50,450
contributing code which is great to see

00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:53,420
and we have a technical working group

00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:55,250
focused on communicating in Chinese with

00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:57,110
developers who are there getting them

00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:58,790
involved in the projects getting bug

00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:00,470
reports in and improvements and that

00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:02,090
sort of thing that's great

00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:05,060
and helping cross the Great Firewall

00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:07,220
right in many ways and in the rest of

00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:10,400
Asia and other 20% of our members are

00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:12,200
based there so 40% total of our of our

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,870
kind of development efforts of our of

00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:16,940
our activity is out there right but this

00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:18,650
is also not a Silicon Valley driven type

00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:20,120
of phenomenon amazingly I mean there's a

00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:23,920
few Silicon Valley companies involved

00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:27,560
