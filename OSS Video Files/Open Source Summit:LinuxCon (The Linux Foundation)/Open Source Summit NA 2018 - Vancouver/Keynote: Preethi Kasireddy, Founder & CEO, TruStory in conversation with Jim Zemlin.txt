Description: 
	Keynote: Preethi Kasireddy, Founder & Chief Executive Officer, TruStory in conversation with Jim Zemlin, Executive Director, The Linux Foundation

Blockchains have been a catalyst for immense amounts of progress that is being made in the field of distributed systems. In fact, blockchains have forced technologists and scientists to question long-established paradigms in distributed systems. In this talk, Preethi will provide a high-level overview of traditional distributed systems and the consensus problem. Then she will explain how blockchains created a major reframing of the consensus problem within distributed and decentralized systems.

I am very excited about our next guest

00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:10,740
she is the CEO and founder of true story

00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:12,980
please welcome to the stage prithi casa

00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,980
ready

00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:22,060
[Music]

00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:28,290
thanks for coming but had to have a seat

00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:31,060
so you have an impressive background

00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:33,130
many of you may not have already heard

00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:34,900
of 3t but some of you certainly have you

00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:37,920
are the founder and CEO of true story

00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:40,780
which is doing incredible work in

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:44,470
rebuilding not only trust on the

00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:47,080
internet but truth on the internet which

00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:49,420
is an admirable effort you were a

00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:52,420
partner at Andreessen Horowitz he worked

00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:56,860
at Goldman Sachs you were an engineer at

00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:59,680
coinbase you talked about blockchain and

00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:02,110
educate folks it's it's an amazing

00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:05,979
background that you have and I have like

00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:08,320
a million questions for you and I will I

00:01:05,979 --> 00:01:10,090
want to talk about true story because I

00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:14,320
think it's just such a the timing of

00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:16,720
this company is so perfect but before

00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:20,890
that I I want to talk about something I

00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:23,799
think is really amazing you have an

00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:25,720
engineering degree and you took so you

00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:29,310
went to let hack reactor and took some

00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:33,040
courses for you know 12 weeks or so but

00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:36,640
you essentially taught yourself how to

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:39,610
code is the story I have heard - tell us

00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,530
about you know in open source we've got

00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:44,740
all these engineers who work in all

00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:46,119
these projects and some are mentors to

00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:47,770
other folks and projects and then

00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:49,510
there's a lot of folks who want to

00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:52,299
understand like how I could do something

00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:55,780
like you did tell us a little bit about

00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:57,460
how you taught yourself to code sure so

00:01:55,780 --> 00:02:00,250
I have an engineering degree but it

00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:01,930
wasn't software engineering and when I

00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:03,610
was working at Andreessen Horowitz my

00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:05,439
job was to meet with entrepreneurs and

00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:07,689
builders and understand what they're

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:10,060
building and decide whether it's a good

00:02:07,689 --> 00:02:11,500
investment or not and to be honest

00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:13,420
sitting on that side of the table

00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:15,220
I sure to get envious of the fact that

00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:18,040
they can build they can have this idea

00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:19,959
and just bring it into the world I I

00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:22,209
wanted that skillset I wanted that that

00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:23,799
toolset to be able to have an idea and

00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:26,380
just cut it up and bring it to the world

00:02:23,799 --> 00:02:28,420
and I felt like if I fundamentally had

00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:29,980
that skill set I can do anything in the

00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,569
world it's like this freedom that I

00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:33,209
didn't have

00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:35,609
that it wanted and so I started to look

00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:39,180
into how to how to learn how to code

00:02:35,609 --> 00:02:41,599
typical Google search to be honest there

00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:44,579
was I probably spent about a year

00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:46,739
struggling to get started I started with

00:02:44,579 --> 00:02:51,629
different platforms whether it was video

00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:53,310
courses or books or online courses and

00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:55,439
it was that kind of beginner struggle

00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:57,299
where you get started it's easy at first

00:02:55,439 --> 00:03:00,109
and then you get to like a little bit

00:02:57,299 --> 00:03:02,459
higher up and it you you fall down this

00:03:00,109 --> 00:03:03,569
this really you strut you think you spin

00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:06,329
your wheels on something and you just

00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:08,909
get frustrated and you give up and then

00:03:06,329 --> 00:03:10,620
I started to then something hit me and

00:03:08,909 --> 00:03:12,419
my I remember my ex-boyfriend was like

00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,260
why are you learning Python go learn

00:03:12,419 --> 00:03:15,419
JavaScript

00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:17,549
it runs anywhere so something about

00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:20,040
JavaScript one day I just sat at home I

00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:22,919
was like I'm gonna try JavaScript I sat

00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:24,689
for 10 hours that day just glued to the

00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:28,969
computer teaching myself JavaScript

00:03:24,689 --> 00:03:31,019
following like I think a code school

00:03:28,969 --> 00:03:33,239
course or something and I just got

00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:34,829
hooked something about JavaScript really

00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:36,629
really hooked me because I the immediate

00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:39,090
feedback look that you get when you code

00:03:36,629 --> 00:03:40,889
you don't need all these tooling you can

00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:43,409
just use any editor it was super easy to

00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:44,909
set up and that was just the start of it

00:03:43,409 --> 00:03:47,009
I would just get I just had fun just

00:03:44,909 --> 00:03:48,750
like playing around with CSS HTML

00:03:47,009 --> 00:03:51,530
Javascript and seeing how that works

00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:54,090
and over time over the next month just

00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:57,870
became obsessed with teaching myself how

00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:59,579
to code and then I was doing more I was

00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:01,620
spending more time coding then I was on

00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:03,389
my real job and that's when I realized

00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:06,030
actually I think I wanna I just want to

00:04:03,389 --> 00:04:07,500
focus on coding and that's when I

00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:09,150
decided to leave Andrews in harvest and

00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,729
just focus full-time on teaching myself

00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:13,500
how to code I did do a bootcamp and the

00:04:11,729 --> 00:04:16,889
reason I did a bootcamp is because I

00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:19,380
feel that the value of a bootcamp is

00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:20,849
they kind of curate the the knowledge

00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:23,070
and the information that you need to

00:04:20,849 --> 00:04:25,080
learn if you're just beginning it can be

00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:26,880
overwhelming to go on Google and try to

00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:29,580
figure out what you need to learn and

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:33,030
they really curate the projects the the

00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:35,190
the curate the steps for how to start

00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:37,259
creating a startup coding and also you

00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:39,180
have an entire peer group of people who

00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:41,219
are struggling with you to and the

00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:42,840
support system helps a lot because

00:04:41,219 --> 00:04:44,190
you're all going through the same thing

00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,199
rather than you sitting alone in the

00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:47,970
basement trying to spend your wheels on

00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:49,680
something so it was definitely helpful

00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:51,510
but it was definitely not the end-all

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,570
be-all that was just the beginning yeah

00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:56,790
and then you build on from there to

00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:59,220
continue to code so we have you know

00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:01,380
nodejs folks in the crowd here

00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:04,050
kubernetes different projects you know

00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:06,330
and I they're always struggling to get

00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:09,090
more developers to the party like what

00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:11,430
what advice would you give on on that

00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:13,440
side of the equation for are there

00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:16,260
programs are there boot camps like what

00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:18,270
what could they do to you know appeal to

00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:20,250
someone who's just bent on teaching

00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:22,560
themselves how to code like what would

00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:25,080
you suggest like you're saying what

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,690
would sorry what what kind of like is it

00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:30,600
is it a boot camp that these projects

00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:33,200
could build is it a online courses like

00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:36,630
what can they do to bring more people in

00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:39,139
there's no one-size-fits-all answer to

00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:41,490
this I think everyone learns differently

00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:44,130
for example some people learn really

00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:45,240
well just reading a book and hacking and

00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:47,370
some people are very much like the

00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:50,490
hacker mindset some people prefer a much

00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:52,410
more structured format for beginners I

00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:54,270
would say something more structured like

00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:57,150
free code camp is a good example of a

00:05:54,270 --> 00:06:00,180
platform that has done a phenomenal job

00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:01,950
of creating all this content for free or

00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:04,139
any developer in the world to come in

00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:06,450
and just start coding and they create

00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:08,460
like bite-size projects and you can

00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:10,770
complete them and reach different levels

00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:13,289
and then you start to build projects on

00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:15,180
your own so there's there's a lot you

00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:18,240
can do but I don't know if there's a

00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:19,800
one-size-fits-all I think like the

00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,690
reality is to become a programmer you

00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,250
just have to code and code and code and

00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:25,260
try but just different stuff until

00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,639
something sticks and if you don't have

00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:29,400
that mindset if you don't have that

00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:32,099
hacker mentality yeah maybe you are not

00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:34,139
a programmer at heart right grit

00:06:32,099 --> 00:06:38,610
combined with some structure yeah would

00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:40,410
be the summary well so that is cool like

00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:41,880
it takes a lot of termination I think to

00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:44,700
do something like teaching yourself to

00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:49,130
code but I really love to hear about

00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:53,159
true story so this is an organization

00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:55,060
you started I shudder to use the word

00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:58,270
fake news

00:06:55,060 --> 00:07:01,030
but I mean there's certainly if you look

00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:03,340
around the internet it's just filled

00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:07,180
chalk block with you know either

00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:10,600
anonymous trolling or falsehoods and you

00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:13,090
know from you know all corners tell us

00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:15,520
how you came up with this idea you know

00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:15,880
and what inspired you to start true

00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,040
story

00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:20,730
sure so in a nutshell what true story is

00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:23,139
it's a decentralized application where

00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:26,139
users we're validating claims that

00:07:23,139 --> 00:07:27,940
people make online and if you think

00:07:26,139 --> 00:07:29,410
about it what the internet did was it

00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:30,970
connected four billion people and

00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:34,630
allowed them to communicate ideas

00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:36,400
knowledge and share everything on online

00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:38,470
and it is undoubtedly one of the best

00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,850
innovations in the world but at the same

00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:42,820
time that openness and that

00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:44,979
permissionless Ness also meant that

00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:47,080
there's people can go online and say

00:07:44,979 --> 00:07:49,600
whatever they want there was never a

00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:52,180
trust layer built into the Internet and

00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:53,889
so that's when that's why that's what

00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:58,630
led us to the situation we are today

00:07:53,889 --> 00:08:01,510
which is fake news and companies like

00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:03,610
Facebook and platforms like that are

00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:06,640
trying to control the fake news problem

00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:10,000
in a very centralized way and there for

00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:13,320
example Facebook is employing offshore

00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,669
parties to validate fake news but then

00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:17,410
why do they get to decide what's fake

00:08:15,669 --> 00:08:19,390
and what's real how do we know their

00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:21,940
incentives are aligned for the like

00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:23,710
maybe there'll be more favoring to an

00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:25,360
advertiser on Facebook where it's it's

00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:28,270
not about what's fake news and what's

00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:31,300
not so instead what we're doing is we're

00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:33,880
using the community as a whole with the

00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:37,599
right token incentives to validate the

00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:40,209
claims that people make and basically

00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:43,240
it's a game theoretic so network and

00:08:40,209 --> 00:08:45,130
when a claim is made someone can submit

00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,900
it to true story and then people are in

00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:48,670
the network or incentivized to determine

00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:50,110
whether that's a valid claim or not so

00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:53,770
you can think of it as a truth as the

00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:56,170
truth layer on on the web right right

00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:58,690
and the reason I mean one of the one of

00:08:56,170 --> 00:09:00,370
the reasons it started was actually

00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:01,180
because of I'm not sure if anyway if

00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:04,030
people have been following the

00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:07,070
blockchain space at all but last year in

00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:10,339
2017 was this like crazy ico phenomena

00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:13,639
we're between the months of let's say

00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:15,730
March and December there were thousands

00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:18,110
of icos that started to come up and

00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:19,690
people were able to raise millions and

00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:22,730
millions and millions of dollars off of

00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:24,920
like white papers and websites like

00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:27,079
fancy websites and I was like holy crap

00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:29,690
like there's there's a few legitimate

00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:32,589
projects and then a vast majority of

00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:35,420
them were just making up stuff and

00:09:32,589 --> 00:09:36,980
making false claims and just raising

00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:38,420
millions of dollars off of it and

00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:39,649
sometimes running away with it

00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:41,569
it was really bill King investors

00:09:39,649 --> 00:09:44,720
basically yeah milking investors and I

00:09:41,569 --> 00:09:47,120
was honestly just like in shock seeing

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:50,300
all that and it really bothered me at a

00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,819
deep level that that that could happen

00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:54,709
and it was interesting because I was

00:09:52,819 --> 00:09:56,029
starting to notice that people there

00:09:54,709 --> 00:09:58,910
were a lot of people in the know who

00:09:56,029 --> 00:10:00,649
knew what was actually an authentic

00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:02,209
project and what was not we were talking

00:10:00,649 --> 00:10:05,660
about it and slack we were talking about

00:10:02,209 --> 00:10:07,459
it privately in dm's or in telegram but

00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:09,680
there was no platform to come out and

00:10:07,459 --> 00:10:10,880
say this in an organized way all these

00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,649
conversations were happening in a

00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,709
disorganized way so I was like what if I

00:10:12,649 --> 00:10:17,449
can build a community around just

00:10:15,709 --> 00:10:19,550
truth-seeking we're just talking about

00:10:17,449 --> 00:10:21,829
whether that's a valid claim or not yeah

00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:23,690
and it actually started there and I and

00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:25,430
I'm sure to figure out whether there's a

00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:27,620
token incentive system that I can design

00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:29,000
it's kind of like think of it like what

00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:32,829
true story is like is basically

00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,970
Wikipedia or reddit but instead of

00:10:32,829 --> 00:10:36,589
Wikipedia where you're curating just

00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:40,160
information and true story you're

00:10:36,589 --> 00:10:41,240
curating the truth right yeah and to

00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,170
tell us a little bit about how the

00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:47,990
incentive works in terms of how you

00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:50,449
curate and get these people to get to

00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:54,620
the truth so it's a stake based voting

00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:57,110
game and we'll release the details of it

00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:58,819
and in the near future but the idea is

00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:01,069
everything the stake everything has

00:10:58,819 --> 00:11:03,079
taken in the game so to create a claim

00:11:01,069 --> 00:11:04,639
you have to stake some mana tokens and

00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:06,500
then people who want to participate in

00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:08,899
validating that claim also have to stake

00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:11,870
some other tokens the votes are rated by

00:11:08,899 --> 00:11:14,269
a reputation score that's that the

00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:15,889
reputation score is not a centralized

00:11:14,269 --> 00:11:18,139
score that we're deeming the reputation

00:11:15,889 --> 00:11:18,680
score is basically the token balance of

00:11:18,139 --> 00:11:20,570
that use

00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:23,060
and the only way the user has a token

00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:25,520
balance is because they've been a part

00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:28,040
of the network and accumulated a token

00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:30,680
balance by being a good validator so

00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:32,540
your stake is a reputable and is your

00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:34,580
reputation right right you know you

00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:36,170
can't buy your reputation right you earn

00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:40,190
your reputation on the platform by being

00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:41,870
active and validating stories and then

00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:44,089
there's also various processes to

00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:46,010
challenge things that have been let's

00:11:44,089 --> 00:11:47,600
say some some stories Dean that's true

00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:49,220
you can also later challenge if you

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,290
think that's actually a false story and

00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:52,730
now the game would start again and

00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:55,399
people would try to figure out why

00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:56,690
that's a false story or not yeah I mean

00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:58,160
it's a fascinating system where you're

00:11:56,690 --> 00:12:00,800
trying to align these incentives to get

00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,810
to what truth is you know in many ways

00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,480
like how blockchain sort of is trying to

00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:08,720
create this distributed trust model I

00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:14,120
gotta say the distributed truth that is

00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:17,020
ambitious it is is an amazing journey

00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:18,740
its ambitious but we need it yeah and

00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:21,470
what do you think are some of the

00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:24,380
biggest challenges ahead of you or that

00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:25,850
you're even currently facing the biggest

00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:27,470
challenge is I would say obviously

00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:28,820
there's technical challenges because

00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:30,200
there's a lot of technical challenges in

00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:32,120
the blockchain space with just building

00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:34,580
something that's scalable and that's why

00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:37,220
you're seeing no meaningful applications

00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:41,170
out there today and everything is there

00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:43,300
either easy to dog slow the UX sucks or

00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:45,890
those are the main two challenges like

00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:47,870
because the blockchain so technical

00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:51,350
challenges is one and then the other

00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:53,089
challenge is we're trying to figure out

00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:54,830
which communities to start with first

00:12:53,089 --> 00:12:57,680
like we're not gonna solve the web's

00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:59,870
problem as a trust problem on the web as

00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:02,420
a whole at once we're starting with

00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:03,440
specific categories where we can where

00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:05,480
we think we can build meaningful

00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:08,720
communities of people who understand

00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:10,400
that category well so we're starting

00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,670
with categories specifically and crypto

00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:17,060
as well so categories like cryptography

00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:19,160
or Bitcoin or ethereal or consensus

00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:24,260
protocols and people that are making

00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:26,029
claims within those categories and then

00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:27,350
bringing building communities in those

00:13:26,029 --> 00:13:28,790
categories so that people in those

00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:29,580
categories can validate the claims that

00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:32,010
are being made in

00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:33,570
categories so for us like the the

00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:35,490
biggest efforts right now is like how do

00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:37,860
we build those early communities and how

00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:39,450
do we how do we make sure that we were

00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:41,460
picking the right people to validate

00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:43,440
these content in these early communities

00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:45,330
interesting interesting

00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,950
well the you know mean you mentioned the

00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:49,650
technical challenges around blockchain

00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:51,150
and how part of the reason because of

00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:53,280
those challenges you're not seeing a lot

00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:54,870
of interesting blockchain applications I

00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:57,810
do want to put you on the spot though in

00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:59,550
what you you go around and educate

00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:01,370
people about blockchain technology

00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:03,780
distribute later technology all the time

00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:05,760
and certainly at Andreessen Horowitz you

00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:08,040
would have seen a broad view of

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:11,850
different efforts and businesses and

00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:14,550
studies what aside from true story what

00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:16,350
are some of the really cool blockchain

00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:20,460
efforts that you are seeing out there

00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:22,200
now I think there's this hundreds of

00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:26,220
people are trying a lot of different

00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:30,030
things I would my focus has mostly been

00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:31,320
around projects that are based around

00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:34,290
token incentives

00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:38,250
I think I'm obsessed with I'm obsessed

00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:42,500
at the idea of using tokens to realign

00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:44,460
incentives in social systems and that's

00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:47,070
examples of projects that are doing that

00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:49,530
besides true story or other and there's

00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:51,810
another phenomenon called TCR token

00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:53,730
curated registries where they're using

00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:57,300
totally they're using token incentives

00:14:53,730 --> 00:15:02,310
to basically curate lists so like top

00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:04,020
ten movies or top ten I don't know

00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:06,420
developers or whatever it is like

00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:10,500
they're using tokens to curate certain

00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:12,120
kind of content or lists and so that's

00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:14,040
an interesting area and applications

00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:16,080
that are my on obsess it personally but

00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:19,080
besides that there's a lot of people

00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:22,530
that are trying to do obviously payments

00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:24,990
as huge micro payments microfinance

00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:26,550
there's a lot of people who are trying

00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:31,590
to do that but it's challenging today

00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:35,280
because the first of all the scalability

00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:36,900
problem right like Bitcoin doesn't scale

00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:39,150
if they're in business scale none of

00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:41,340
these platforms scale so to really do

00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:42,500
payments at a global scale we need to

00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:44,750
solve that problem for us

00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:46,400
so I think even though there's all these

00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,840
ideas that people have for different

00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:50,060
applications that the blockchain can be

00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:52,160
can you be used for a lot of the focus

00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:55,370
recently has shifted to more the

00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,930
infrastructure layer and so a lot of

00:15:55,370 --> 00:16:00,170
people are trying to build scalability

00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:02,510
solutions privacy solutions more more

00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:04,610
cryptographic primitives so that we can

00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:06,050
build the infrastructure for us before

00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:07,730
we think about what are the applications

00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:09,710
I can exist on top mm-hmm

00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:11,180
you know we're seeing we're home to the

00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:13,670
hyper laser project and I know you know

00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:17,240
brian behlendorf you know we're seeing

00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:19,400
govern governments now looking at using

00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:23,420
blockchain technology for national ID

00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:26,300
land registration are you know which are

00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:28,340
important systems that every citizen

00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:29,480
needs to interact with are you seeing

00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:31,160
any what are you seeing out there that's

00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:33,020
interesting are there particular regions

00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:34,940
countries that you think kind of on the

00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:38,270
leading edge in terms of leveraging this

00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:40,150
to create government transparency to you

00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:44,990
know make their society better

00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:46,730
to be honest I've my my interest my

00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:48,140
focus has been mostly ins but I would

00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:49,100
divide the blockchain world into public

00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:52,070
and private blockchains

00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:56,420
yep and they're very different of course

00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:58,160
and I would bucket government or that

00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:59,990
kind of block shape any kind of banking

00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,620
blockchain type stuff in private

00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:02,750
blockchains

00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:07,610
world and then public blockchain world

00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:10,550
and the private blockchain world to me

00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:14,780
is it's definitely big but it's less

00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:17,360
interesting it's like I don't know if it

00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:19,820
changes the world in a big way where is

00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:22,220
the public blockchain world I think it

00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:24,590
has the potential to I think it's much

00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:28,670
more meaningful and the reason is

00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:30,140
because it has a like with private

00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:32,000
blockchains basically they're taking a

00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:34,130
database and trying to open it up

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,140
amongst like a closed consortium group

00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:39,230
of people and see how that consortium

00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:42,710
can can maybe operate in a more

00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:44,300
transparent more effective way with

00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:46,400
public block chains you're talking about

00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:49,990
how the world at large can basically

00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:52,960
have this shared transaction log and

00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:55,650
communicate and transact with each other

00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,240
across the world like just be

00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:59,490
we people talking to people without

00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:03,660
middlemen right right right

00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:05,700
and you sue do you think that well and I

00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:08,190
want to ask the question I think a lot

00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:12,810
of people to mind here is so in terms of

00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:15,870
that public ledger as a currency are you

00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:18,150
long Bitcoin aetherium like do you what

00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:20,190
what are you what are you seeing in

00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:21,960
terms of these crypto currencies out

00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:24,710
there right now I'm definitely long

00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:28,890
Bitcoin and I'm definitely long a cerium

00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:30,830
but to be honest it's like I definitely

00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:33,540
believe in a multi blockchain world

00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:36,750
meaning I don't think it's Oh big coin

00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:38,220
wind or etherium winds or Cardano winds

00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,750
or whatever it is I don't think it's

00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:44,450
that I think there will be many many

00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:47,400
many block chains and and that's because

00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:48,750
every blockchain kind of has okay it's a

00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:51,210
it's a distributive system in the end

00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:53,850
and every blockchain is trying to

00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:55,950
optimize some part of it some block

00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:58,050
chains care about privacy some block

00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:59,250
chains care about scalability other

00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:01,440
block pains care about other

00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:03,060
characteristics and so you'll have a

00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,860
different block chains that serve

00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:09,090
different needs and the currency

00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:11,280
assuming that block chain gets adoption

00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:13,890
the currency will be valuable that's how

00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:16,230
I think yeah I mean I'm a that makes

00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:18,630
complete sense yeah I want to come back

00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:20,610
to something you mentioned about true

00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:25,320
story how you know it's sort of like

00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:28,230
Wikipedia right I mean this may be sort

00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:31,560
of a bold thing to ask but could it

00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:33,060
actually be Wikipedia I mean do you

00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:35,550
think this I mean it sounds a lot like

00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:36,660
what Wikipedia is to some degree you

00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:38,640
know what are your thoughts on that

00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:41,090
could this be a different way to go and

00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:51,380
curate something like Wikipedia

00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:53,010
absolutely any more to share I think I

00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:56,640
you

00:19:53,010 --> 00:20:00,090
true story less as a database of

00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:03,410
information or you know Wikipedia is

00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:06,270
just a database of information right and

00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:07,620
that's certainly valuable but I've you

00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:10,050
to story as

00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:12,540
Network mm-hmm where people can

00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:14,940
communicate and discuss why something is

00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:16,260
true why something is false there's a

00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:17,820
communication aspect to it that

00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:20,910
Wikipedia doesn't have today Wikipedia

00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:22,710
is very flat right in my opinion and I

00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:24,020
want information on shoes to her to be

00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:28,950
alive

00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:32,100
interesting you know today and in terms

00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:33,900
of yeah I mean I don't know if you are

00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,650
willing to name some of the the sectors

00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,840
your focus on you talked about

00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:40,260
securities and and financial services so

00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:41,850
forth but how do you get people into

00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:44,580
that world is there some gate that they

00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:46,530
initially come into or anybody open to

00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:49,050
it like just describe how it actually

00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:50,400
works so what for true story like if you

00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:54,270
wanted to be participating in the

00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:57,270
economy Oh in in a social network so

00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:58,679
yeah we will be generating the community

00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:01,380
members and we'll be curating the

00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:03,030
community members and over time it will

00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:04,320
be more decentralized in the sense of

00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:05,970
the community members will figure out

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,190
who that who they want to invite onto

00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:10,740
the platform and whether they believe

00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:12,929
they're good validators as well but in

00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:14,520
the early days the the community members

00:21:12,929 --> 00:21:16,410
that we select will be somewhat

00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:18,540
centralized based on what who we think

00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:21,540
are good community would be would make

00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:22,800
good community members right right it's

00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:25,320
not we're not doing like for example

00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:27,390
we're not doing an ICO we're not doing

00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:29,280
any kind of token sale and the reason is

00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:31,320
because we think that if if we give the

00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,970
token to anyone in the world we don't

00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,830
know what their incentives are we can't

00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:36,750
control whether they understand the

00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:39,210
purpose of true story and whether they'd

00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:41,640
be good validators on the platform but

00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:44,940
if we can create the community ourselves

00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:48,480
in the early days and really lock in the

00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:49,950
early community ethos using the or those

00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,350
early community members and then let

00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:54,390
that community grow by itself I think

00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:57,179
that's a better approach interesting

00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:58,559
well it is I wish we I have like a

00:21:57,179 --> 00:22:01,650
hundred more questions but I'm starting

00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:04,050
to run out of time there and it is I

00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:08,130
mean just the technical challenges the

00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:11,100
social challenges but when you look at

00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:15,120
sort of at a high level when you asked

00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:19,690
the question is the truth truth I mean

00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:21,700
what an important and compelling mission

00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:24,480
is there anything you'd like to say to

00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:27,279
get folks interested in true story or

00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:30,220
have them go and check out what you're

00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:31,419
doing I'm sure we're hiring so we're

00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:33,580
looking for a really really smart

00:22:31,419 --> 00:22:36,039
developers to join our team and built

00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:37,029
helped us build this vision and I would

00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:39,220
love to chat with you if you're

00:22:37,029 --> 00:22:42,279
interested there are a lot of smart

00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:43,779
folks running around this conference and

00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:47,649
you don't need to know blockchain to

00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:50,139
join us but you have to have some grit

00:22:47,649 --> 00:22:52,269
and be willing to to be dedicated and

00:22:50,139 --> 00:22:54,340
learn well thank you so much for coming

00:22:52,269 --> 00:22:55,860
it is just amazing what you're doing

00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:59,850
thank you

00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:59,850
