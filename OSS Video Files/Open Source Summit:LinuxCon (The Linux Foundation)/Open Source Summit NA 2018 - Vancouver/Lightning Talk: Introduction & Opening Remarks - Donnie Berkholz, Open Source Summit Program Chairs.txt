About Donnie Berkholz
Donnie has been driving the DevOps transformation at CWT (Carlson Wagonlit Travel) since early 2017. Prior to that, he led a global team at 451 Research providing research and consulting around leading-edge trends in software development and DevOps. His background includes roles at RedMonk — where he focused on DevOps and open source — and well over a decade at Gentoo Linux, where he worked his way up from a developer to lead a group of more than 250. One of his passions is the social side of technology, and he’s led initiatives to turn around unhealthy teams as well as measure and act on open-source community metrics.

He got into tech almost by accident, because his role as a biophysicist got increasingly computational and he decided he wanted to focus on the technology. Prior to tech and science, he did a stint as a journalist. Donnie now combines that diverse skillset in communications, data-driven thinking and technology to drive companies toward differentiation with leading-edge technology.
