this is this is great again my name is

00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:07,080
Ben Golub I'm gonna be joined on stage

00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,389
in a few minutes by Sean Wilkins who

00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,969
will give you more background on storage

00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:14,000
and what it is that we do the sort of

00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:17,160
five second version is we're a

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,930
decentralized version of cloud storage

00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,900
like a decentralized version of Amazon

00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:23,160
s3 a slightly more detailed explanation

00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,529
the one that I'm going to try and give

00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:28,109
to my parents at Thanksgiving is that

00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:30,720
we're like Airbnb but for disk drives

00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:32,279
and if that works like most of my

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,180
Thanksgiving explanations they'll then

00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:38,070
ask me to help fix their printer so I've

00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,170
shown about the past six months at

00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:42,480
storage getting deep into decentralized

00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,460
web and blockchain but most of my career

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,550
has been an open source as Jim says I

00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,350
was a CEO of docker before that CEO of

00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:51,000
Gloucester I spent most of my career in

00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:52,350
open source and so coming to the open

00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,600
source summit for me is kind of like

00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:56,160
coming home except it's coming home to

00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,289
find that your studio apartment has

00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,649
suddenly become Buckingham Palace it's

00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:03,329
just unbelievable to see the amount of

00:01:00,649 --> 00:01:04,920
energy and enthusiasm and growth and

00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:07,439
economic impact that open-source is

00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,880
having and I hope you all weres extends

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,369
as I was to see the kinds of statistics

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,290
that Jim was sharing but prior to

00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:15,000
getting into tech I actually spent a few

00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:18,540
years in international development in

00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,220
places like Kenya and Uzbekistan and I'm

00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:22,590
now at a stage in my life where I don't

00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:24,689
know I'm trying to recursively justify

00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:27,200
my existence by saying like what is it

00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:29,490
do these three things have in common and

00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,979
what they have in common is that the end

00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:33,540
goal is sustainability the end goal is

00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:35,820
saying how can we make these things

00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:38,040
continue to grow and can continue to

00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:41,040
expand and the interesting thing is in

00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,659
all three fields the answer seems to be

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,320
pretty clear the answer is consistent

00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:47,970
it's embracing concepts of openness its

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,000
embracing concepts of decentralization

00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:53,490
not keeping things too contained and

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,189
importantly driving for individual and

00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:57,990
economic empowerment so I'm gonna be up

00:01:56,189 --> 00:01:59,399
here talking about open source both its

00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,869
opportunities and challenges from my

00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:04,170
perspective Sean's going to do the same

00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:06,780
thing for decentralization but we're

00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:09,119
gonna really try and do is say hey given

00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,800
that we share these common values what

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,650
is it that we can do together sort of it

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,720
to take a phrase from Jim how can we

00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:18,000
drive the gears of economic development

00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:20,189
looking we do between open-source and

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,870
decentralization to make each other more

00:02:20,189 --> 00:02:27,060
successful and I think there's a very

00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:30,390
interesting answer ok that is the answer

00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:32,069
check on 2 and then you'll find I think

00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:34,500
what you'll find though is that we now

00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:38,189
have a really amazing new opportunity

00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:40,260
for individual open-source projects to

00:02:38,189 --> 00:02:43,739
control their own destiny and derive

00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:45,239
revenue from the centralized web so I'll

00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:47,040
get into that in a bit but to make these

00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:48,359
sort of these concepts of openness and

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,459
individual empowerment a bit more

00:02:48,359 --> 00:02:52,109
concrete I'd like to start with an

00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:54,799
example from my days in International

00:02:52,109 --> 00:02:59,040
Development so I started out my career

00:02:54,799 --> 00:03:00,569
in rural Kenya interviewing people on

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,970
demographic issues and I remember one

00:03:00,569 --> 00:03:04,680
conversation I had where I speaking to a

00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:06,269
subsistence farmer saying hey what could

00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,799
we the international community do to

00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:10,139
make your life better you know help

00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:12,629
build a hospital or give you money to

00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:14,159
you know rebuild your roof or a school

00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:15,989
for your kids and the answer that I got

00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,290
which I thought was both simple and

00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:21,150
really profound was none of the above

00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:23,280
give me a loan to buy my own tractor and

00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:25,079
the farmer went on to say if I did that

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,790
then I'd control my own destiny you know

00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:29,190
and if I had a tractor then I could

00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:30,449
build my own roof and my kids wouldn't

00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:32,730
have to work on the farm I could send

00:03:30,449 --> 00:03:34,349
them to school and that notion that the

00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:36,299
way you get great outcomes is by

00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:39,000
individually economically empowering

00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:41,400
people is profound and it turns out not

00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,560
to be true not only to a local level but

00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:46,829
the past you know 50 years of economic

00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:49,560
development have kind of proven that

00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:50,849
this is true so we're gonna spending a

00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,069
lot of time on tech today but you know

00:03:50,849 --> 00:03:54,329
take a bit of time to think about the

00:03:53,069 --> 00:03:56,069
rest of the world it actually turns out

00:03:54,329 --> 00:03:57,629
that the rest of the world has been

00:03:56,069 --> 00:04:00,840
making some amazing strides in the past

00:03:57,629 --> 00:04:03,180
60 years you know in 1960 half of the

00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:05,400
planet lived in extreme poverty that's

00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,840
down to under 10% now you look at other

00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,599
things like infant mortality and life

00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:12,440
expectancy amazing progress four times

00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:16,109
as many people now live in a democracy

00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:18,209
huge increases in literacy now we can go

00:04:16,109 --> 00:04:19,859
a lot farther and this isn't true in

00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:21,529
every country but the fact that isn't

00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:23,639
true in every country means that there's

00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:25,830
197 experiments out there to show what

00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:27,210
works and what doesn't work and the

00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,480
farmer was right it really comes down to

00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:30,260
in

00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:34,050
economic empowerment so charity is great

00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:36,450
but it doesn't go far enough having one

00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:40,130
centralized sector like oil that's

00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:42,840
dominated by one or two players

00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:46,290
it's an anti-pattern but what really

00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:48,750
works is in countries and programs where

00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:50,490
they've managed to take sharecroppers

00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:52,110
and give them the ability to become

00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:53,340
independent farmers or take people who

00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:54,840
work in sweatshops and give them the

00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:58,050
ability to buy their own sewing machine

00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,640
that makes a huge difference you might

00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:02,400
recall that previous on the previous

00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:03,690
slide the huge increases in the number

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,910
of girls who are completing primary

00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:07,530
schools it turns out that the single

00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:10,020
biggest predictor of whether a girl

00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:12,060
completes primary school is whether her

00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:14,550
mother has an independent means of

00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:18,120
generating income so individual economic

00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:20,070
empowerment achieves great things so why

00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,660
did I spend all this time on on an

00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:23,130
international development because I

00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:26,640
think if we look at the open source

00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:29,340
world the same patterns will help both

00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:30,810
explain the tremendous successes and the

00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:34,020
opportunities we have for improvement

00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:36,540
now open source we're crushing being

00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:37,950
open we're absolutely crushing and

00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:41,370
showing the power of being open for

00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:43,110
security and better code and I think

00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:45,300
probably everybody in this room can

00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:47,790
appreciate how profoundly powerful and

00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:50,010
empowering that individual pull request

00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:50,790
can be and the results kind of speak for

00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:54,180
themselves

00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:56,120
I all Jim's slide from last year this is

00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:59,670
sort of in the true open-source sense

00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:02,220
and look at that 23 million open-source

00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:05,190
developers amazing acceleration we're

00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:07,500
also the major driver of innovation in

00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:10,980
machine learning an AI and as Jim said

00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:13,380
90% of all cloud workloads are on Linux

00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:15,480
and beyond the operating system well

00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:17,390
over two thirds of all workloads are

00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:19,620
open-source so in a very real sense you

00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:22,140
you built the cloud give yourselves a

00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:26,340
round of applause open source we built

00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:29,310
the cloud and now speaking as somebody

00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:30,180
who's been an open source CEO it's also

00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:31,170
really exciting to see that we're

00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:33,170
starting to create real business

00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:35,370
successes so you know ten years ago

00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:36,870
there was Red Hat and nobody else could

00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:38,220
point to another successful open source

00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:40,170
business now there are over five

00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,010
companies that have gone public and

00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:41,430
there are a lot of others that are on

00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:45,449
the way

00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:46,889
and that's great news but the bad news I

00:06:45,449 --> 00:06:48,479
think there's still a huge disconnect

00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:50,250
between the bottom third of this slide

00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,330
and the top 2/3 do you think of the

00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:53,610
amount of value that open source is

00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:58,199
creating and the amount of pure-play

00:06:53,610 --> 00:07:02,340
business success there's a disconnect 24

00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:03,930
million OSS developers 17,000 work at

00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:08,490
those five public open source companies

00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:11,070
the the Red Hat Hadoop sorry

00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:14,280
how a Hortonworks cloud era and mule

00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:15,979
soft 180 billion-dollar cloud market

00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:18,930
according to Gartner going to grow

00:07:15,979 --> 00:07:20,430
probably another 20% this year five

00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:23,639
billion total revenue with those public

00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:25,470
OSS companies so while we're doing a

00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:26,760
great job of being sustainable in code

00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:29,070
development I think we've got a long way

00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:30,720
to go in terms of the economic

00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:32,250
development model and this is not to

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,460
castigate anybody obviously you've heard

00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:37,560
how generous people like like Google are

00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:40,530
being and in terms of supporting and

00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:42,660
generating new code and oh and driving

00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:45,260
growth in open source but how much

00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:47,190
better could we be if the open source

00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:48,900
projects and companies that are driving

00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:50,729
the cloud could actually directly

00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,870
benefit from that to drive further

00:07:50,729 --> 00:07:55,639
innovation so that there was a direct

00:07:51,870 --> 00:08:00,120
market-based mechanism for driving

00:07:55,639 --> 00:08:02,669
driving growth innovation know ten years

00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:04,770
ago when I started a CEO of Gluster and

00:08:02,669 --> 00:08:06,630
I spoke to other open-source CEOs we all

00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:08,820
had a pretty similar idea for how we

00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:10,620
were gonna you know grow we're gonna

00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:12,720
start out building a great community and

00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:14,400
project then we were going to try and

00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,900
monetize it through an excess service

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,909
and then after we were sustainable go

00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,380
after the large enterprise and as far as

00:08:17,909 --> 00:08:20,729
that excess service some of us were

00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:22,560
going to do path some of us were going

00:08:20,729 --> 00:08:24,750
to do I as some of us we're going to do

00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,520
says some of us couldn't tell our ads

00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:29,490
from our elbow but we knew that if we

00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,599
did this right we'd get sustainable we'd

00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:32,669
go after the small business and we do

00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:33,990
things that you know small tech

00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:35,580
companies are good at like building code

00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:36,930
as opposed to things that larger

00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:39,599
companies are good at like hiring large

00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:41,159
sales forces and unfortunately the

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:45,060
discontinuity is showing up there too

00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:48,450
and more often than not successful

00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:50,130
infrastructure projects if your sexual

00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:53,310
interest infrastructure project you'll

00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:55,140
find that there's a there's a cloud

00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:57,810
company offering a free version of your

00:08:55,140 --> 00:09:00,750
whereas a loss later and the same

00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:02,580
challenge as you move from and so that

00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:04,800
middle path is not there and so you have

00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:07,530
to try and do difficult things those

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,240
almost all of these successful open

00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:11,070
source companies that I mentioned before

00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,390
they've gone directly to the largest

00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:13,860
scale enterprise and most of them have

00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:16,200
had to raise over 200 million dollars in

00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:18,000
order to get there so that's a challenge

00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,490
for having a continual pipeline of new

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,830
companies and you know you see that I

00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:24,480
underlined this term loss leader I think

00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:26,850
it's a real challenge that the biggest

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,920
and most successful monetization model

00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:33,030
for right now and open source is not do

00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:35,220
a licensing or service and support or

00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:36,750
even open core it's the use of open

00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:38,490
source as a lost leader for

00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:40,380
infrastructure because I think that

00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:42,960
creates excess existential question for

00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:45,420
us as an industry if if lost leader is

00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,590
the is the dominant model velocity for

00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:48,930
infrastructure is a dominant model and

00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:51,360
we know that there you know maybe five

00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:54,270
companies in the world that can be

00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,550
successful public cloud companies that's

00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:57,960
going to be a problem how are we going

00:09:56,550 --> 00:10:01,740
to drive it economic growth and

00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:03,540
innovation and you know foundations are

00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:05,570
amazing Linux Foundation and cloud

00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:07,590
native is amazing but they're not enough

00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:09,030
the large cloud and traditional

00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:10,230
infrastructure companies it's fantastic

00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:11,610
that they're embracing open source the

00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:13,500
way they are but we don't want to be in

00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:14,820
a world I think where they're only ten

00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,460
companies making money off of open

00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:20,460
source and so again I asked can we drive

00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:24,090
direct meaningful broad economic growth

00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:26,340
in open source from the cloud and the

00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:28,320
answer is yes that's going to take a new

00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:30,000
type of cloud and one that's built into

00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,710
the centralized way which has

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,240
fundamentally different economics but

00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:35,130
also fundamentally new opportunities for

00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,120
open source so to explain a little bit

00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:38,490
more about two centralized

00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,780
infrastructure I'd like to ask Shawn

00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:42,660
Wilkinson to come on stage again he's

00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:46,100
the founder of founder of storage and

00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:46,100
all-around great guy so Shawn

00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:58,180
thanks man so my journey into

00:10:53,430 --> 00:11:00,940
decentralization starts in 2014 I was

00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:03,340
building various software projects and

00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:05,440
they needed to store a lot of data and

00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:08,620
so I was looking at the various options

00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:12,340
that I had available to me and they're

00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:15,430
really expensive or they really didn't

00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:18,730
have the feature sets that I wanted and

00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:21,580
these were closed source platforms and

00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:24,280
tools and so I wasn't really quite happy

00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:26,590
with the options and around this time I

00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:29,200
was playing around with kind of Bitcoin

00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:31,840
and blockchain I was mining some Bitcoin

00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:35,290
in my dorm room and I found the concept

00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:39,310
quite fascinating the idea that I could

00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:41,620
rent out my extra processing cycles on

00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:45,000
my computer to this magical Bitcoin

00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:47,320
network and then get paid from that and

00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,870
something in my head kind of clicked to

00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:53,770
say hey maybe these things go together

00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:57,100
what if I could build a decent sized and

00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:59,680
distributed network where I could store

00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:02,380
my data on money people's computers and

00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:05,380
then they could get paid and rewarded

00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:07,750
for that task and so I kind of went down

00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:09,310
the rabbit hole of how to build this

00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:11,650
kind of decentralized distributed

00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:12,190
application and I never came out of that

00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:13,960
rabbit hole

00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:15,810
so we'll talk a little bit more about

00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:18,340
that later so let's talk about

00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:19,420
decentralized applications and let's

00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:22,180
define them a little bit so a

00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:25,180
decentralized application is a way to

00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:28,690
create a service that no single entity

00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:30,880
controls now why would we do this well

00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:33,070
when you don't have a single person or

00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,540
entity control it you get a little bit

00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:36,460
better privacy right you don't have a

00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:37,950
single person that can go kind of

00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:40,540
snooping and looking through that data

00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:43,360
you end up getting a lot better security

00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:45,820
again you're not relying on a singular

00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,430
persons or entities security model and

00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:50,890
it ends up being a lot more trustless

00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:53,140
and you don't have to rely again on that

00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:55,420
single person who for some reason might

00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:58,150
not lucky like you and wants to ban you

00:12:55,420 --> 00:13:00,400
from their platform and it's a lot more

00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:01,780
automated for this to even work with

00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:04,120
multiple entities there needs to be a

00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:05,920
lot more automation and coordination in

00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:10,420
the system and so these are things that

00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:14,350
we generally like in applications now

00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:16,720
let's clear one thing up when you hear

00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:19,000
about decentralization descent routes

00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,010
applications you might have heard this

00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,710
associated with crypto currencies or

00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:26,440
blockchain so I'm just curious by a show

00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:28,360
of hands who who has Bitcoin or

00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:33,070
aetherium or dogecoin or any other

00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:37,500
cryptocurrencies okay so if this was the

00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:41,320
SAT I'd say that decentralization is two

00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:44,230
crypto currencies as the Internet is two

00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:48,250
cat pictures and videos right great

00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:52,000
niche interesting impactful use case but

00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:56,200
the concept is much more useful to us as

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:58,240
users so diving into decentralized

00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:00,550
applications a little bit more you know

00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:03,280
the majority of the applications that we

00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:04,990
use today are centralized applications

00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:09,550
right they're controlled by single

00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:12,640
company or person or entity and they

00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:15,040
have single points of failure so if

00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:19,180
someone happens to run I don't know why

00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:22,000
they would do this RM RF star on a

00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:25,290
centralized application well it's gone

00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,580
right and this is in sharp contrast to a

00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:29,890
decentralized application which again

00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:33,160
has no central authority a person

00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:35,590
running it no single point of failure so

00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:38,530
if you run that same application and in

00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:40,530
a decentralized application there might

00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:45,100
be some impact but it's not catastrophic

00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:47,620
and no decentralized applications try to

00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:49,930
take this a little further they're open

00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:51,700
source and to enable this coordination

00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:54,730
and enable this decentralized

00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:59,230
application to work they have to be led

00:14:54,730 --> 00:15:03,250
by math and algorithms and code rather

00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:07,210
than again trusting a singular group of

00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:12,100
people or entity so if some of these

00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:14,290
things sound familiar they should open

00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:18,189
source and essentially

00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:20,109
our tie decentralization is almost an

00:15:18,189 --> 00:15:23,709
extension of open-source where it tries

00:15:20,109 --> 00:15:25,779
to take you know trans be transparent

00:15:23,709 --> 00:15:26,979
and open and take that a little further

00:15:25,779 --> 00:15:29,559
by trying to make things more

00:15:26,979 --> 00:15:31,600
algorithmic and more baked into the code

00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:34,449
wherever you can see what's going on

00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,369
under the hood in real time and again

00:15:34,449 --> 00:15:39,519
this is what you need to enable that

00:15:36,369 --> 00:15:41,979
coordination of many different actors in

00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:44,799
this this ecosystem and it's again a

00:15:41,979 --> 00:15:46,479
very sharp contrast to more proprietary

00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:48,609
enclosed source systems which are the

00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:53,079
complete opposite of a decentralized

00:15:48,609 --> 00:15:57,309
system and open source so the question

00:15:53,079 --> 00:15:59,559
that we set out to solve was can we

00:15:57,309 --> 00:16:03,279
build the world's largest most

00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:05,519
performant economical and secure cloud

00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:11,129
storage network without building or

00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:15,429
operating a single data center now why

00:16:11,129 --> 00:16:17,979
would we do this well if you look at the

00:16:15,429 --> 00:16:22,480
graph on the right this is a mapping of

00:16:17,979 --> 00:16:27,220
the internet in 2004 and what do you

00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:30,399
notice about this well it's a

00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:32,230
decentralized network there's no one

00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:35,529
giant blob in the middle of it controls

00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:38,649
the entire internet and so when you

00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:41,189
build your applications much like how we

00:16:38,649 --> 00:16:43,269
access them and use them as if by magic

00:16:41,189 --> 00:16:44,980
you start to solve some of the

00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:47,919
fundamental problems that we're dealing

00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:50,579
with today so for example better

00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:53,679
security instead of putting all this

00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:56,889
application data in a nice manicure data

00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:57,569
center and hoping there's no breaches or

00:16:56,889 --> 00:16:59,649
hacks

00:16:57,569 --> 00:17:04,629
you have to take a fundamentally

00:16:59,649 --> 00:17:07,629
different more open and more a security

00:17:04,629 --> 00:17:11,079
model so in our network we take data and

00:17:07,629 --> 00:17:12,519
files we encrypt them client-side we

00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:14,679
break them into small pieces and

00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:16,299
distribute them over the network and so

00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:18,879
if you think of this security model it's

00:17:16,299 --> 00:17:21,789
almost like taking encrypted bits of

00:17:18,879 --> 00:17:23,889
sand and then spreading them over an

00:17:21,789 --> 00:17:27,290
encrypted beach and saying you know good

00:17:23,889 --> 00:17:30,080
luck trying to access the city you're

00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:33,190
be able to find it it ends up being a

00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:35,930
lot more performant being able to access

00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:39,980
data that might be stored in your

00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:41,450
neighbor's house next door is going to

00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:43,550
be a lot more performant than probably

00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:45,860
accessing that data in a data center you

00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:48,740
know and you know thousands of miles

00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:51,950
away in rural Kansas it ends up being a

00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:54,380
lot more available in our network you

00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:56,030
have 40 different pieces the file is

00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:58,280
broken up into 40 different pieces all

00:17:56,030 --> 00:18:00,110
on individual internet connections and

00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:02,690
power supplies and computers so the

00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:04,580
failure venue one it doesn't have that

00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:06,380
much of an impact versus if your data

00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:08,240
center goes down you know

00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:11,660
there goes your data and much more

00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:13,430
better economics because in this network

00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:15,500
you're not paying for the fire

00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:18,230
suppression systems of the data center

00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:21,320
or the HVAC or repaving the parking lot

00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:23,600
you're just paying for the cloud storage

00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:26,630
and so it just ends up being a much

00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:29,090
better bottle for building applications

00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:31,130
and while we're doing this for cloud

00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:32,690
storage there's many many other people

00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:36,620
around the world that are building

00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:38,840
decentralized applications and compute

00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:40,400
and databases and content distribution

00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:45,200
that have some really awesome

00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:48,970
interesting properties so have we done

00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:51,980
one year in sensor launch we've had over

00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:54,260
150 thousand farmers farmers or people

00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:55,670
who are on our network that are able to

00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:58,190
rent out their extra hard drive space

00:18:55,670 --> 00:19:01,040
and get paid for participating and

00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:02,840
building this network and we stored over

00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:05,450
a hundred and fifty petabytes of data

00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:08,570
and how did we do this

00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:10,430
well we didn't do it by using the

00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:13,040
traditional model of building out a six

00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:16,040
hundred million dollar datacenter in

00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:19,700
some row place with great electricity we

00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:21,770
did it by being an open project an open

00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:25,160
source project a decentralized project

00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:26,990
that allows individuals and parts of our

00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:29,780
communities to contribute their access

00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:31,640
resources and get paid for them and so

00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:34,190
it's a lot more economically empowering

00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:36,110
for our users in our community which is

00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:38,120
again in very sharp contrast to

00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:40,460
traditional applications and traditional

00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:41,250
centralized clouds where the cloud

00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:44,160
company

00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:46,890
is providing a majority of resources and

00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,780
getting a majority of the economic

00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:51,270
benefit so it's like Ben was talking

00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:53,310
about a lot more empowering to our users

00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:57,180
and community who participate in this

00:19:53,310 --> 00:20:01,800
network so I believe we're in the midst

00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:04,170
of a major transformation in 1983 Scott

00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:08,660
McNealy said the network is the computer

00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:12,210
and that model looked more like this

00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:17,010
very impactful but a lot of room for

00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:19,860
improvement and so I believe that the

00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:22,320
network is the marketplace and as we

00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:24,360
want these things such as better privacy

00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,460
and security and performance and con

00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:29,790
savings will trend towards more

00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:33,000
decentralized applications and there's

00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:35,790
one thing that decentralize applications

00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,910
and decentralization that can do that is

00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:41,660
that centralized applications cannot do

00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:45,210
and we believe that is very very

00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:48,810
impactful and probably game-changing for

00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:51,000
open-source so join me in welcoming Ben

00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:53,640
Golub back on the stage to talk just

00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:57,170
about that

00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:59,370
[Applause]

00:20:57,170 --> 00:21:01,880
the network is the marketplace so I'm

00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:03,510
gonna replace Scott McNealy with Sean

00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,920
what are the cool things about

00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:07,170
marketplaces of course is when you

00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:11,640
create a new marketplace you create new

00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:13,650
dynamics and as Sean said one important

00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:15,810
dynamic with this approach towards

00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:18,210
building you know cloud infrastructure

00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:20,880
is instead of spending millions or

00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:22,620
billions of dollars of capital you do it

00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,600
by fairly compensating and incentivizing

00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:26,100
people who bring supply well the same

00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:28,260
thing is can be true on demand as well

00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:29,520
right what if we could instead of

00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:31,440
spending millions of dollars on

00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,780
salespeople and marketing actually

00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,340
compensate the people who bring growth

00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:39,030
and demand to the market and we know

00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:40,860
that open source is driving the public

00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:43,710
cloud so why not come up with a plan

00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:45,180
that says hey can we directly compensate

00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:47,760
open source companies and projects for

00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:49,140
bringing demand to the cloud and so

00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,240
that's what we're doing

00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:52,710
storage announced a program today and we

00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,840
hope that others will join us in this

00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:57,570
but basically if you're an OSS project

00:21:54,840 --> 00:22:00,480
that generates storage if you're a couch

00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:03,590
base or an influx or a and people

00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:05,760
use you and create snapshots or backups

00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:08,400
create a connector it takes about a day

00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:10,170
that enables people to store on this

00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,970
network our network will

00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:14,610
programmatically built into our code so

00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:16,980
you can inspect it track usage and

00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:19,830
return a meaningful percentage of

00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:21,600
revenue to you and your project and we

00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:23,370
think this is very powerful we're very

00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,390
excited that when we shared this idea

00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:26,010
with a few friends

00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:28,290
the folks that you see up here like

00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:31,020
complement and and and Maria and

00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:33,420
influx and Mineo jumped on the bandwagon

00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:35,910
and we're excited about that for us I

00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:38,130
mean we're a network operator we make

00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:39,990
money the larger our network grows we're

00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:42,000
excited for our farmers but we also are

00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:43,410
excited to see if this model can catch

00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,450
on with the rest of the decentralized

00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:47,340
infrastructure community because if we

00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:48,960
do this right we're gonna create another

00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:51,930
one of those virtuous circles that Jim

00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,470
was talking about earlier have OSS drive

00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:55,020
innovation

00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:57,420
so OSS generates demand for the network

00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:59,760
the network benefits from that increased

00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:02,280
demand Network an operator benefits the

00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:04,350
farmers benefit and the people who drive

00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:06,600
demand to benefit as well and if we can

00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:09,270
drive meaningful revenue based off of

00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:12,000
usage back into open source the

00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:14,610
we can drive more innovation more demand

00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,980
more growth and keep the cycle going

00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:19,440
because as exciting as this open-source

00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:21,900
summit is on the 25th anniversary of

00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,910
Linux's birth I can only imagine how

00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:26,730
exciting it will be in five years if we

00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:28,390
can get this this engine going thank you

00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:31,890
all

00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:31,890
