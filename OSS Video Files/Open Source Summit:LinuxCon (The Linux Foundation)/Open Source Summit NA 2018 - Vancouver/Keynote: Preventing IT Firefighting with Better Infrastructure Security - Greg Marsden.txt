	Keynote: Preventing IT Firefighting with Better Infrastructure Security - Greg Marsden, Vice President, Linux Development, Oracle

The evolution of Linux and the open source model has delivered the proven performance, stability and reliability required in today’s enterprise/cloud-scale deployments. We continue to deploy in smaller independent on-prem environments, where there’s potential for security vulnerabilities to flare up. But more importantly, those CVEs that create brush fires on the on-prem prairies become towering infernos in the cloud. Case in point: Spectre and Meltdown. We’ve gone from isolated systems to large multi-tenancy environments that increase security risks. How do we build a more secure, less vulnerable infrastructure for every environment?

In his keynote, Greg will elaborate on security and how a very different OS deployment model can help developers react fast and keep their fire lines secure.
