	Lightning Talk: The Art of Scaffolding - Shelley Lambert, IBM

"The Art of Scaffolding" refers to an approach to agile and open development. Shelley discusses fast issue response, the ability to unblock dependent teams and how to still deliver quality solutions over the span of several open projects. She reminds us all how important it is to have fun while achieving project goals.

She draws from her own experiences and gives candid examples of ways to both enliven or destroy the social culture of an open project. Short of being a cautionary tale, through this presentation, Shelley speaks directly to those who want to make their projects buzz with activity and contributors.
