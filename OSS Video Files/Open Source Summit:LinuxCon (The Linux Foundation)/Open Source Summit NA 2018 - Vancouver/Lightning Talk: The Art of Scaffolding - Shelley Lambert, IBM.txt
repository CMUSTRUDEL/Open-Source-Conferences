Description: 
	Lightning Talk: The Art of Scaffolding - Shelley Lambert, IBM

"The Art of Scaffolding" refers to an approach to agile and open development. Shelley discusses fast issue response, the ability to unblock dependent teams and how to still deliver quality solutions over the span of several open projects. She reminds us all how important it is to have fun while achieving project goals.

She draws from her own experiences and gives candid examples of ways to both enliven or destroy the social culture of an open project. Short of being a cautionary tale, through this presentation, Shelley speaks directly to those who want to make their projects buzz with activity and contributors.

About Shelley Lambert
Shelley Lambert is the Test Lead for IBM Runtime Technologies team. Over the course of the last few years, they have systematically shifted from a very inward-focused test and development team to open-sourcing all of their product and test code into Eclipse OMR and Eclipse OpenJ9 projects, as well as their delivery pipelines to the AdoptOpenJDK project. Her team has delivered the test strategy, test code base, test frameworks and delivery mechanisms into these 3 projects. She is a committer at Eclipse OpenJ9 and at AdoptOpenJDK, where she also serves on the Technical Steering Committee.

She has presented at JavaOne and Eurostar conferences and many smaller meet-ups on a variety of topics, drawing stories and lessons from her experiences in the 3 open projects in which she is most active.

all right so I get to set the pace for

00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:08,420
this very first time that we do

00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:13,429
lightning talks I will try to do my best

00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:17,609
so hi I'm Shelley I implement

00:00:13,429 --> 00:00:19,619
verification solutions at several open

00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:22,050
projects and you've heard what some of

00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:26,130
them are at clips om are Clips open j9

00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:28,619
and adopt open JDK and particularly I'm

00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:32,070
interested in ensuring a free and open

00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:34,770
and fully verified Java binaries are

00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:36,360
available to the Java community and what

00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:39,600
I'm going to try to cover in the next 4

00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:42,030
and 1/2 minutes is what is scaffolding

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:46,579
why would you want to do it and why is

00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:49,140
it an art so scaffolding as you may know

00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:53,219
refers to temporary structures or

00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:55,620
solutions to aid construction and let's

00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:58,140
look at a simple real-world example of

00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:01,829
that a development team wants an open

00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:04,799
JDK 11 testing enabled so they can find

00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:06,720
and fix problems that they're working on

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,960
Java 11 features right now and they want

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:12,330
to find the failures fix the failures as

00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:14,159
they're developing the build team has

00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:15,960
not yet completed automating and

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,020
publishing the builds to a location

00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,159
expected by test scripts for automated

00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:23,490
pickup and testing

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,650
so in this scenario we have a couple of

00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:28,020
choices or I'm limiting it to a couple

00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:30,570
of choices for this lightning talk you

00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:33,420
can tell the dev team to go away no way

00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:36,299
wait until the build team is finished or

00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:38,520
you can scaffold you can build a

00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:41,729
temporary solution which unlocks the dev

00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,890
team so in this case some temporary

00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:47,250
scripting that picks up the build from

00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:51,720
some sketchy location built likely out

00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:54,750
of Perl code and gummi bears there are

00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:57,479
common mistakes that you can make if

00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:59,820
that project's make and I'll quickly

00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:01,829
cover them so you can only you can

00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,750
choose to only build scaffolding and

00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:05,759
this means you're hacking around and it

00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:09,020
doesn't scale and it becomes a rickety

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:12,840
and demoralizing mess so avoid this

00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:13,140
scenario - mistake - no scaffolding so

00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,420
your

00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:17,730
never trying to unblock teams and have

00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:20,220
them work in tandem it's always cereal

00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:22,170
you're working on building the

00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:24,180
monolithic thing you may never get

00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:25,920
completed or it's so late that the

00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:27,420
requirements changed underneath your

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,990
feet and you didn't solve the new

00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:32,730
problems scenario three is subtle the

00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:35,280
mistake number three that you can make

00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:37,380
your scaffolding falls apart before the

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,770
real solution is ready at this point you

00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:43,380
have a choice you can try to rebuild the

00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:45,870
scaffolding or push hard to complete the

00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:47,459
real task this is going to be a

00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:48,900
judgement call how close are you to

00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:53,280
building the real thing you need to

00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:55,980
build and then scenario four is you love

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,250
your scaffolding so much that you keep

00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:02,610
it even though you've finished the real

00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:04,890
story the real solution you keep your

00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:08,120
scaffolding around so congratulations

00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:13,050
now you have two things to maintain and

00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:15,840
go forward with so how do you know if

00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:18,030
you did scaffolding right you can ask

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,640
yourself a couple questions to know this

00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:22,260
did you achieve the goals you were

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:26,489
trying to achieve did you build the

00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:28,920
thing you set out to build and secondly

00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:31,230
did you help people along the way that's

00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:34,380
actually an important and subtle part of

00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:36,420
scaffolding the notion that you're

00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:39,030
actually looking for ways to help people

00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:41,820
who depend on you you know who depends

00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:45,540
on you and you ask them often how can I

00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:47,700
help you and the reason that's kind of

00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:50,040
the important story is because then it

00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:52,440
builds a community and it has people

00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:55,500
want to come back and work with you so

00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:57,989
in these last few seconds that I have in

00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,700
a lightning talk I just want to remind

00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:01,560
everyone everyone here knows this

00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:04,019
already but innovation happens in the

00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:06,090
open and I'd love the opportunity to

00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:10,530
innovate and collaborate with all of you

00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:12,840
gummy bears included so these are the

00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:16,049
details of how to get a hold of me how

00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:19,079
to get kind of involved in the projects

00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:21,810
that I'm involved in some of the talks I

00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:23,370
have upcoming at several conferences

00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:25,800
that I hope to share with everyone

00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:27,000
online thank you so much for your

00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,650
attention and let

00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,990
stay in touch find me at some of the

00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:33,120
events or in the conference later this

00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:37,480
week all right thank you

00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,480
