	Lightning Talk: Insights on the Open Source Job Market - Jack Humphrey, Indeed

What do we know about the market for open source jobs? What regions have the most jobs specific to open source or open source technologies? Which technologies are trending up or down in terms of the supply and demand of candidates?

Every month, over 200M unique visitors visit Indeed to search millions of jobs around the world, some of which target experience with open source and open source technologies. In this lightning talk, Jack Humphrey will share some insights based on Indeed's unique view of the employment marketplace.

all right hi I'm Jack and I work at

00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:07,649
indeed and I'm gonna share some insights

00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:10,170
about the open source job market at

00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:12,090
indeed our mission is to help people get

00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:14,309
jobs and we do this at scale around the

00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:16,800
world with over 200 million unique

00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:18,810
visitors every month and job seekers who

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,260
come to indeed have access every month

00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:25,199
to about 20 million jobs and operating

00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:28,859
at the scale allows us to explore our

00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:31,109
data and surface insights about the

00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:34,260
employment market today

00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:36,750
I'm going to share a few insights about

00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:39,360
how open source technologies are showing

00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:42,750
up his skills in job postings and

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:45,660
resumes and I'm gonna focus in on a few

00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:49,860
categories infrastructure public cloud

00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:52,379
databases and programming languages this

00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:57,120
is a shorter version of a more in-depth

00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:59,039
talk we did last month we believe that

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:03,000
these kinds of insights can be really

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:05,700
valuable for companies who are deciding

00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,580
what technologies to go with for people

00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:11,520
who are considering what should I be

00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:14,280
learning to provide more value to

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,890
potential future employers in other

00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:19,890
words this these insights might help you

00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:22,619
or somebody you know get a job if you're

00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:25,979
into life tweeting slides we're at Indy

00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:27,570
tinge so let's dive right in with the

00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:30,390
infrastructure group we looked at a few

00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:32,880
technologies that we consider open

00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:34,740
source infrastructure and we looked at

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,280
how they showed up in job postings and

00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:40,079
resumes and kubernetes is the fastest

00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,110
growing technology in this group that we

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:45,390
looked at just looking at January of

00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:47,220
this year versus June we saw twice as

00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:51,000
many job postings that mention

00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:53,880
kubernetes and here's a visualization of

00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,399
how the jobs are distributed in this

00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,890
group we included docker in this group

00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:02,189
in it it shows up in June with more than

00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:05,219
80 percent of the jobs kubernetes at 40

00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:09,929
percent OpenStack at about 15 percent

00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:11,849
and Mesa just under 10 percent moving on

00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:12,810
to the public cloud group where we

00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:15,090
looked at

00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:18,390
on Web Services Microsoft Azure and

00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:20,370
Google cloud platform AWS is the most

00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:23,190
commonly listed public cloud provider

00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:27,690
for both candidates and jobs in this

00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:29,580
group and here's data going back to the

00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:32,250
beginning of 2016 so here we have data

00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:36,180
points for each of these from January

00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:39,180
2016 January 2017 and January and June

00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:41,540
of this year we can see AWS hovering

00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:44,310
around 80 percent share of these jobs

00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:47,790
but we see growth in both Microsoft

00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:50,250
Azure and in Google cloud in fact

00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:53,310
comparing the beginning of 2016 to June

00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:56,660
of this year there are 4.5 times as many

00:02:53,310 --> 00:03:00,150
jobs that list Google cloud as a skill

00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:02,220
but when it comes to applications when

00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:04,769
it comes to application volume there are

00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:07,500
11 times more jobs that are getting

00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:11,489
applications that list

00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:13,890
AWS than list Google cloud in the

00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:17,040
databases category we looked at popular

00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:19,109
open source databases and my sequel is

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,910
the most commonly listed open source

00:03:19,109 --> 00:03:23,910
database from again for both candidates

00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:27,239
and jobs but it's also the most in

00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:28,739
declined here we look at those same four

00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:31,170
data points again for each of these

00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:34,590
database technologies and you can see

00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:37,500
the decline for my sequel also you can

00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:40,280
see that Postgres and elasticsearch are

00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:42,840
on the increase

00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,730
finally programming languages what's

00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,910
going on with programming languages well

00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:49,639
Java is the most commonly listed

00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:52,799
programming language and job postings

00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:54,329
but Python is growing really fast as the

00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,600
fastest growing programming language

00:03:54,329 --> 00:04:01,200
that we see in postings and here's that

00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:05,489
that visualization again we see Java up

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:08,430
it up around 45% in June of these jobs

00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:13,920
but JavaScript and Python are duking it

00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:15,420
out for second place we'd love to hear

00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,100
from you whether or not you find these

00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:18,630
kinds of insights interesting if you're

00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,880
interested in more please let us know

00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:22,530
tell us what you'd like to know give us

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,500
feedback on this we're going to decide

00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:26,410
on investment based on the response we

00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,530
get from the community

00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:32,260
so tweet at us at indeed Inge hashtag

00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:34,450
OSS job data I'd like to give a special

00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:36,970
thanks to an indeed product scientist

00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:39,430
named Rachel araÃºjo who produced this

00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:42,910
research and gave the more in depth talk

00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:44,560
last month at Aswan if you want to keep

00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:46,390
track of what indeed is up to an

00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,510
engineering we have a blog at indeed

00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:52,950
tech where and where we're hiring indeed

00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:52,950
jobs thanks

00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,819
