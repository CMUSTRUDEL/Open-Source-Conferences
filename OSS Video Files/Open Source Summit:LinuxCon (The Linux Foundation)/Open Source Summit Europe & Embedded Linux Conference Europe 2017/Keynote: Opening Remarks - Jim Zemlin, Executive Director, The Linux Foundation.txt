00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:09,120
good morning

00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:11,519
good morning everyone thank you all so

00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,950
much for coming I know there's a lot of

00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,990
people still waiting to get in so lots

00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,850
of seats still over here for those of

00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:21,210
you who are arriving a little bit late

00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:25,199
we are very happy to be here in Prague

00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:27,109
this week we have an amazing event lined

00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,570
up for you this week we've got

00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:32,399
incredible speakers this morning I think

00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:35,430
we have some of the best speakers of the

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:38,430
week leanest Torvalds the creator of

00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:43,530
Linux will be here on Wednesday like one

00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:50,129
clap out there for leanness like 26

00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:52,860
years thank you though we also want to

00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:54,809
thank our sponsors for helping us put on

00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:57,660
this event I would like to give a

00:00:54,809 --> 00:01:01,530
special thank to Intel our diamond

00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:04,339
sponsor sue say our gold sponsors civil

00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:08,610
infrastructure platform CN CF code

00:01:04,339 --> 00:01:10,650
Huawei IBM Microsoft Open SDS Red Hat

00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:17,189
and VMware let's give our sponsors a

00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:20,400
quick round of applause so at every one

00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:24,409
of these events we get hundreds and

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:28,560
hundreds of papers and talks submitted

00:01:24,409 --> 00:01:31,590
to the conference and it is incredibly

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,890
hard to choose from all these different

00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:37,170
talks I gave up a long time ago and now

00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:39,020
this year the whole l-left team has

00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:42,420
given up to bring in some outside

00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:44,970
program chairs to help create this these

00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:47,670
people spend a lot of time are experts

00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:50,100
in their field and they help us pick

00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:51,930
topics choose speakers and I want to

00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:56,070
give a quick shout out to all of them

00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:58,409

many events I think you're gonna have an

00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:55,329
amazing week and I want to take now let

00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:57,459
me see

00:03:55,329 --> 00:03:59,200
a couple of minutes to make some

00:03:57,459 --> 00:04:03,519
announcements for some new things that

00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:05,829
we're doing at the Linux Foundation how

00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,230
many people here know about how

00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:09,849
important data is to all of our lives

00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:11,260
how many people have heard the word Big

00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:15,400
Data lately

00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:17,109
yeah it's the big thing we are working

00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,130
on Big Data initiatives here at the

00:04:17,109 --> 00:04:19,180
Linux Foundation

00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:21,580
you're gonna hear from some of our

00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:24,190
speakers about big data and machine

00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:26,950
learning but one of the things that we

00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:30,870
recognized at the linux foundation about

00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:33,250
a year ago and started working on is a a

00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:36,520
licensing framework an intellectual

00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:40,320
property sharing framework would be an

00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:45,250
important thing for Big Data you know as

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:49,120
we embrace the idea of Big Data they're

00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:51,970
just like an open source where all of us

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,250
are smarter than any one of us right

00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:56,440
we've learned that through jointly

00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:58,960
writing code together well the same

00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:02,350
thing is going to apply to the knowledge

00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:04,510
we create using big data meaning that no

00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:06,640
one is going to possibly be able to

00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:09,340
create all the data by themselves

00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:12,910
we need good frameworks to actually

00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:15,400
share this data you know think about it

00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:18,760
whether it's AI or machine learning

00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:22,480
someone has to train these models using

00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:25,630
data it could be for of vehicle safety

00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:27,910
in autonomous vehicles you're not gonna

00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:30,970
get all of that data from one source in

00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:33,970
order to make sure that driverless cars

00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:36,460
remain safe on the highway and there are

00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:38,890
just tons of different use cases that we

00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:40,990
can all imagine where the sharing of

00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:44,290
data is going to be really really

00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:46,870
important and so at the Linux Foundation

00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:49,960
working with dozens and dozens of

00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:52,240
organizations all over the world we

00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:54,880
started about a year ago working on the

00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,460
CDL a license this is an agreement to

00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,140
share data openly and embody the best

00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:02,650
practices that we've learned over

00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:05,050
decades sharing source code but could be

00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:09,970
used to address the unique needs of

00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:12,610
sharing data so today we are going to

00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:15,370
announce version 1.0 of our community

00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:18,040
data license agreement now there are two

00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:20,440
types of agreements here and the reason

00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:22,210
that we only have two is because one of

00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:25,300
the lessons in open-source that we

00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:27,640
learned a long time ago is that when the

00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:30,250
number of different open-source licenses

00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:31,749
started to increase the compatibility

00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:34,930
for code share

00:06:31,749 --> 00:06:37,930
started to decrease and organizations

00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:41,139
like OSI and others got together and

00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:42,909
sort of created a system and started to

00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:45,400
try and limit the number of open-source

00:06:42,909 --> 00:06:47,919
licenses so that we could better enable

00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:50,499
sharing what we're hoping to do with

00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:52,870
data is get ahead of things so that the

00:06:50,499 --> 00:06:57,219
same thing doesn't happen in terms of

00:06:52,870 --> 00:07:00,129
data sharing but we did feel that we

00:06:57,219 --> 00:07:02,229
needed two distinct types of licenses

00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:04,900
for sharing data again based on the

00:07:02,229 --> 00:07:08,409
incredible precedent that you see in

00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:11,710
open source licenses one a sharing based

00:07:08,409 --> 00:07:14,979
on copyleft this is an idea that share

00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:17,589
and share alike that people can does it

00:07:14,979 --> 00:07:19,330
essentially if you use that data you're

00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:21,819
required to share back data with

00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:23,259
everyone else the next the other license

00:07:21,819 --> 00:07:25,180
that we have is a more permissive

00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:27,460
license like an apache style license

00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:29,229
where you can use the data and you're

00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:32,770
not required to share any of those

00:07:29,229 --> 00:07:37,270
changes and so those are both launching

00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:40,599
today at CDL a dot IO go check these out

00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:42,539
we'd love to get feedback it's an open

00:07:40,599 --> 00:07:45,939
community there'll be an ongoing process

00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:48,580
but if this works effectively I think we

00:07:45,939 --> 00:07:51,099
can get ahead of a lot of the data

00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:54,279
proliferation in terms of licenses and

00:07:51,099 --> 00:07:56,979
get big data working together to really

00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:58,449
train the machine learning and a

00:07:56,979 --> 00:08:01,110
algorithms that are really going to

00:07:58,449 --> 00:08:01,110
