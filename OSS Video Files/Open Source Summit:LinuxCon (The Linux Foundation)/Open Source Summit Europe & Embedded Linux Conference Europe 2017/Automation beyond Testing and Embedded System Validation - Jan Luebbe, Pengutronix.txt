	Automation beyond Testing and Embedded System Validation - Jan Luebbe, Pengutronix

Current OSS testing projects like LAVA have mostly achieved their goals: automate and simplify software testing on embedded hardware. However, the integrated automation layer is not easy to reuse for different scenarios: ad-hoc scripting to reproduce a sporadic error during development, automated flashing in the factory, git bisection, development scripts for repetitive steps or CI for whole system update processes including reboots.

Separating the automation layer from the testing infrastructure makes it easier to implement tools to handle these cases outside of a fixed CI framework. Also, combining the automation layer with a general software testing framework like pytest allows expressive test cases with little boiler-plate.

Jan will report on his experience with the existing tools, how the automation library labgrid does things differently and what is remains to be done.

About Jan Luebbe
After building Linux smartphones with OpenMoko and deploying open source GSM networks to cruise ships, Jan LÃ¼bbe joined Pengutronix in 2012 as a kernel hacker. Since then he helps customers understand Linux and how it can solve their problems. While not hacking Linux, Jan builds atomic clocks at the Stratum 0 hacker space in Brunswick. Previously, he presented at ELCE 2016, FOSDEM, the Linux Days in Chemnitz and the OSADL Networking Days.
