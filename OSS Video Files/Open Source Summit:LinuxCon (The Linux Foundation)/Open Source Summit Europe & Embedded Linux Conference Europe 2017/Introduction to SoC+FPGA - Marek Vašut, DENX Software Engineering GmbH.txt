	Introduction to SoC+FPGA - Marek Vašut, DENX Software Engineering GmbH

In this talk, Marek introduces the increasingly popular single-chip SoC+FPGA solutions. At the beginning, the diverse chip offerings from multiple vendors are introduced, ranging from the smallest IoT-grade solutions all the way to large industrial-level chips with focus on their software support. Mainline U-Boot and Linux support for such chips is quite complete and already deployed in production. Marek demonstrates how to load and operate the FPGA part in both U-Boot and Linux, which recently gained FPGA manager support. Yet to fully leverage the potential of the FPGA manager in combination with Device Tree (DT) Overlays, patches are still needed. Marek explains how the FPGA manager and the DT Overlays work, how they fit together and how to use them to obtain a great experience on SoC+FPGA, while pointing out various pitfalls.

About Marek Vašut
I have been contracting for DENX Software Engineering for a couple of years now. My primary responsibility is designing and implementing customer specific functionality. One important aspect of my work is leveraging the benefits of working inside the mainline Linux, U-Boot and OE / Yocto Project, explaining our customers the benefits of pushing the newly produced code back into mainline and effectively doing the contributions. I am therefore heavily involved with both mainline U-Boot and Linux kernel, be it my role as SoCFPGA and USB maintainer for U-Boot, MTD co-maintainer in Linux or others. My speaking experience includes giving talks at ELCE, LinuxCon Japan, EmbeddedWorld and various smaller events across Europe.
