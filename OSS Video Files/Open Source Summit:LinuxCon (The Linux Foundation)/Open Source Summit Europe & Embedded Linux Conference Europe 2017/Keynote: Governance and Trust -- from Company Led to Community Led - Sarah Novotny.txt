Description: 
	Keynote: Governance and Trust -- from Company Led to Community Led - Sarah Novotny, Head of Open Source Strategy, Google Cloud Platform 

Kubernetes is a success in part because of Google's commitment to making it a community led project.  It has taken 2 years and we have learned a lot from challenges of self organization, implicit governance, and the human condition. As an open source community committed to learning from our failures and asking hard questions we continue to iterate on our governance model.  Learn from our experiences. The future is bright.
