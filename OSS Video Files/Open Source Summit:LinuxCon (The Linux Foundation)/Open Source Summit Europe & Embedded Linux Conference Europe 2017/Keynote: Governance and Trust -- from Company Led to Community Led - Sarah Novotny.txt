Description: 
	Keynote: Governance and Trust -- from Company Led to Community Led - Sarah Novotny, Head of Open Source Strategy, Google Cloud Platform 

Kubernetes is a success in part because of Google's commitment to making it a community led project.  It has taken 2 years and we have learned a lot from challenges of self organization, implicit governance, and the human condition. As an open source community committed to learning from our failures and asking hard questions we continue to iterate on our governance model.  Learn from our experiences. The future is bright.

good morning all okay this morning but

00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:08,700
I'm not even on this time zone some of

00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:13,440
you have been here a while

00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:16,609
good morning thank you all right so I

00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,760
get to talk about the history of

00:00:16,609 --> 00:00:20,039
kubernetes

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,109
and the history of cloud native compute

00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:23,369
foundation that Chris gave some of the

00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:26,220
perspective from the cloud native

00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:27,570
compute foundation perspective I am

00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,420
going to give a little bit of it from

00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:33,870
the kubernetes perspective and from

00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:38,719
Google's perspective interestingly so

00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:40,820
first we're going to go back in time in

00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:45,510
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:48,410
2014 in 2015 Google and a broad number

00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:51,120
of industry partners brought together

00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:54,539
what was to be the next evolution of

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:57,180
borg and omega the internal container

00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:59,789
orchestration systems that Google had

00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:01,980
built and used for years and they

00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:05,129
brought forward this idea of kubernetes

00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:09,090
we had a huge cross industry

00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:12,600
collaboration we had Intel we had core

00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:15,540
OS we had Samsung we had Red Hat we had

00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:19,320
Google all contributing to this project

00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:22,110
to bring forward the idea of what core

00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:27,299
OS calls giffy Google infrastructure for

00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:32,970
everyone this project was launched in

00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:38,009
2015 with a 1.0 of of announcement at

00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:40,409
OSCON and all seven of the four founders

00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:43,290
of the industry had industry changing

00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:49,130
vision for kubernetes okay that's a joke

00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:51,990
I know it's morning all anyway thank you

00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:53,750
so all of the founders all of the people

00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:57,600
who were broadly interested in

00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:59,040
kubernetes had this vision that it was

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,689
going to change the industry we were

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:06,479
going to take the concept of portable

00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:09,149
workloads and move it from VMs or

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:13,260
software because Java of course had that

00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:15,209
portable workload vision for a long time

00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,530
but we were trying to take that portable

00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:18,930
workload vision and move it to

00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:21,510
containers but there was a problem in

00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:25,500
this there was a problem in making this

00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:31,349
transition and that was that it was

00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:33,750
kubernetes by Google now I was brought

00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:36,900
into the project in fact to help make

00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:40,230
this shift from a company led project to

00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:42,420
a community led project so the by Google

00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:46,260
line on this logo which was the logo

00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:48,930
that it launched within 2015 really was

00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:51,359
a challenge I got lots and lots of

00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:52,799
conversation started with here's the

00:02:51,359 --> 00:02:57,870
Wikipedia page of all the projects

00:02:52,799 --> 00:03:08,030
Google is killed why would I bother we

00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:12,180
all mourn Google Reader that said

00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:15,060
bringing together a broad industry group

00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:18,739
to change the conversation about cloud

00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:21,889
computing to move the concepts from

00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:24,750
talking about VMs or talking about

00:03:21,889 --> 00:03:28,919
sticky services and clouds to having a

00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:33,349
portable workload unit of containers was

00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:36,329
really going to be a thing that took

00:03:33,349 --> 00:03:38,040
corporate independence for the

00:03:36,329 --> 00:03:40,680
open-source project and the Linux

00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:44,340
Foundation is known for bringing

00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:47,970
together all of these groups all of

00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:52,859
these companies to move to move forward

00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:56,790
the actual industry changing big-picture

00:03:52,859 --> 00:04:01,500
visions so as we brought kubernetes out

00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:03,389
in a 1.0 in 2015 we knew and announced

00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:07,919
that this needed to be a foundation as

00:04:03,389 --> 00:04:12,329
Chris mentioned it wasn't really started

00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:14,579
until December or so of 2015 but with

00:04:12,329 --> 00:04:16,979
the announcement of 1.0 came the intent

00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:19,769
that Google was going to donate all of

00:04:16,979 --> 00:04:24,330
the IP all of the trademark and all of

00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:25,970
the content around kubernetes to the

00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:28,400
cloud or to

00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:30,950
a foundation which then became the cloud

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:35,410
native compute foundation so this cloud

00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:38,360
native compute foundation was set as a

00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:41,450
governing body that had a bigger vision

00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:45,770
than just kubernetes we really wanted it

00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:49,070
to be again industry changing so we set

00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:52,100
a three model government yes many of us

00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:53,780
are from the US and for all of the joys

00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:55,730
and flaws of our government the three

00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:57,590
models are actually pretty good so we

00:04:55,730 --> 00:05:00,110
have a governing board a technical

00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:02,300
oversight board and an end-user board

00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:07,550
offering checks and balances to one

00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:10,070
another and so we began the CNC F as

00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:12,320
they said we didn't want this to be just

00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:13,760
the kubernetes foundation we thought

00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,370
that that would be very narrow and very

00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:18,770
limiting and that we really wanted to

00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:21,350
have this broader conversation and I

00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:23,870
have to say great thanks the Linux

00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:27,440
Foundation the cloud native compute

00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:29,390
foundation staff Chris Dan everyone

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,740
who's been working on this and the

00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:34,160
technical oversight committee

00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:36,470
specifically for taking us from the one

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,740
project kubernetes inside the cloud

00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:43,850
native compute foundation to the 14 that

00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:46,430
are there today broadly addressing the

00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:49,490
whole stack that that landscape diagram

00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:53,780
showed us earlier from network to

00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:56,000
tracing to instrumentation to the

00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:59,200
containers that exist under the

00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,580
container standards that exist under

00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:04,520
orchestration or around orchestration

00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:07,450
and under this portable workload unit

00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:10,100
and all of the other pieces around

00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:12,800
kubernetes and more broadly the

00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:14,990
container native narrative but I'm

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,030
really here to talk more specifically

00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:20,270
about kubernetes because taking

00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:23,600
kubernetes from a company led project to

00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:26,660
a community led project has brought us a

00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,070
lot of interesting points to think about

00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:29,900
and work through so this has been a

00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:34,580
two-year journey that I'm going to

00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:36,169
summarize in another 13 minutes forgive

00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,690
me if I gloss over some of the finer

00:06:36,169 --> 00:06:39,690
points

00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:41,770
one of the things we learned was

00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:46,030
self-organization works really well in

00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:49,570
small groups kubernetes has enjoyed huge

00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:54,580
growth in the last two years and what

00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:57,070
worked early on doesn't now at this

00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:59,620
point kubernetes as the size of the

00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:01,300
project Dwarfs all the other projects

00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:04,630
inside the cloud native compute

00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:06,130
foundation as a single project but one

00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:08,560
of the tenants of the cloud native

00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:12,790
compute foundation is that each project

00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:14,980
is self-governing and so what we are

00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:17,730
learning inside kubernetes may or may

00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:20,400
not be adopted by other projects but

00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:22,300
they will adopt it as they need it so

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,540
self-organization doesn't work very well

00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:27,220
for small or for large groups early on

00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:30,520
we used hand-raisers people who

00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:33,280
volunteered to lead different special

00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:38,190
interest groups to do a lot of the work

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:42,070
that was needed in order to bring the

00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:45,100
project together and those hand-raisers

00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:46,540
in small groups have a lot of trust you

00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:48,190
have a small group you know each other

00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:52,060
even if you don't know this person

00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:54,700
exactly someone else that you know knows

00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:57,250
that person and so you have commutative

00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:59,350
trust in a small group in a way you just

00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:01,690
can't in a large group so these

00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:04,150
hand-raisers generally had the skills

00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:06,610
that they needed if they didn't they

00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:09,460
were supported by people around them but

00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:12,580
as the project grew the hand-raising

00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:15,669
got more complicated because there was

00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:17,800
status attached to different roles there

00:08:15,669 --> 00:08:20,680
was status attached to being part of the

00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:24,700
kubernetes project and it became more

00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:28,780
politicized so different cultural

00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:30,850
standards that we had including chopping

00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:34,090
wood and carrying water making sure that

00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:37,240
everyone was working on the core and the

00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:39,789
important pieces the boring pieces I

00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:44,560
would argue of the work that needs to be

00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:47,890
done those cultural norms got lost and

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:50,380
that made for some challenges in the

00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:51,260
last couple of years it's one of those

00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:53,360
things that we

00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:56,420
saw and have seen happen in other

00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,490
projects where the core doesn't get the

00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:00,470
attention that it needs because the

00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:02,870
edges are more interesting to say a

00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:05,590
vendor community or the edges are more

00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:08,600
interesting to a politicized community

00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:11,960
so this chopping wood in carrying water

00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:14,660
is a cultural value for kubernetes needs

00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:18,800
to be better communicated and needs to

00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:21,440
continue to be rewarded one of the other

00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:25,220
things that we found was implicit

00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:27,980
government generates mistrust so it's

00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:31,930
really simple if you say this is the

00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:35,690
deciding person Linux is great Linux has

00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:39,110
Linus and whenever there might actually

00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:42,470
be a huge dispute or a small dispute but

00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:46,610
with people who can't come together and

00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:50,920
come to a solution as the last resort -

00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:54,200
can decide that didn't work for

00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:55,910
kubernetes it sort of worked for a while

00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,920
we didn't want it to be a benevolent

00:09:55,910 --> 00:10:00,860
dictatorship but it was sort of a

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:03,020
corporate dictatorship for a while but

00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:04,820
then we said no we really want it not to

00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:07,430
be Google lead we want this to be

00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:09,370
community led but then it sort of was

00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:12,320
like well who can really make decisions

00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:16,400
and so it started to look like this

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:18,410
weird shadowy cabal those seven of the

00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:20,330
four founders maybe one of them could

00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:22,450
make a decision but if they disagreed

00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:26,780
who would actually decide in the end and

00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:29,000
we found that this really led to lots

00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:32,950
and lots of confusion for our end users

00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,950
or our end contributors I'm sorry

00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:38,960
someone would ask how do we make this

00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:40,520
decision the answer was oh I don't know

00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:42,530
maybe you should talk to Brian well

00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:44,830
maybe Tim I'll have an opinion or you'd

00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:47,870
get you know a hundred comments into a

00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:50,440
proposal on github and someone would go

00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:52,520
oh you know who should weigh in on this

00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:54,730
just as you thought you were getting to

00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:58,820
a resolution so this implicit governance

00:10:54,730 --> 00:11:05,440
really led to a lot of mistrust and led

00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:09,590
to a lot of churn and on discomfort so

00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:12,230
while we were working and we were moving

00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:14,630
the project forward even at a crazy the

00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:18,070
crazy velocity that it was moving there

00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:21,440
was a lot of wasted cycles in this

00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:23,620
discomfort and so we have spent a lot of

00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:27,290
this last two years trying to solve this

00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:30,440
another thing we learned as people are

00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:32,750
messy so I would argue that let's see

00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:35,690
there what is the running joke three

00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:39,110
different hard problems in technology

00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:41,570
naming things off by one errors maybe

00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:45,260
it's only - I'm gonna postulate that the

00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:48,530
other one is people because most of your

00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:51,560
challenges in a tech organization don't

00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:53,120
ultimately come down to the tech they

00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:55,630
come down to the people involved with

00:11:53,120 --> 00:12:00,020
them so we've built this massive

00:11:55,630 --> 00:12:03,680
platform to enable distributed compute

00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:06,080
workloads and so we tried very hard in

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,500
order to build this and not fall victim

00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:11,180
to Conway's law to make a distributed

00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:14,600
computed decision making system inside

00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:18,440
kubernetes we built out special interest

00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:20,900
groups we built out its autonomous

00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:23,360
working groups we built out groups that

00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:27,230
then should have the the permission and

00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:29,660
the accountability to make decisions on

00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:33,970
their own about their area of code and

00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:37,220
then work with other area owners and

00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:40,850
make decisions that are correct for the

00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:48,560
project at a technical level the problem

00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:53,020
is people someone wanted a less not

00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:57,650
someone some several ones wanted more

00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:59,840
direct authority they wanted to know

00:12:57,650 --> 00:13:02,570
that they were supported in this as

00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:06,050
opposed to organically growing these

00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:08,350
special interest groups who had leaders

00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:11,090
and should be making decisions

00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:15,140
independently but there was some level

00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:17,420
of need for blessing from a broader

00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:19,970
project group

00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:21,890
and so even when someone was a special

00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:24,920
interest group lead there wasn't

00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:26,630
necessarily clear trust from some of the

00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,680
people who were in the special interest

00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:30,050
group that that person would have the

00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,460
right skills and comfort from the person

00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:34,420
who was leading about making the

00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:39,800
decision be it driven collaboratively or

00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:41,840
not so in the middle of all of this we

00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:44,330
found lots and lots of opportunity to

00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:46,760
grow and the project continued to grow

00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:48,530
in spite of all of our challenges and we

00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:51,320
continued to put out good software it

00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:54,440
just was uncomfortable during this

00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:56,630
during this adventure so ultimately we

00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:59,060
decided we really needed project

00:13:56,630 --> 00:14:00,680
governance now we knew that we needed it

00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:03,320
all along but we thought we were doing

00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:08,030
it relatively well but there was lots of

00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:13,270
room for improvement so we started a

00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:17,120
plan trying to figure out how to

00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:19,550
bootstrap a governance process from a

00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:24,220
group that was incredibly distributed

00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:28,670
had lots of opinions and no clear

00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:31,340
anointed leadership so the broader

00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:34,960
community got together had a long

00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:38,450
conversation and came up with a

00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:40,460
bootstrap governance committee there

00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:46,550
were seven of us who sat on that

00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:49,340
committee with a single explicit need we

00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:51,260
need to figure out how to get to the

00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:54,320
first body that can help us make

00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:56,930
governance decisions because we are not

00:14:54,320 --> 00:15:00,260
the right body all by ourselves and this

00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:03,050
was the group that was roughly several

00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:05,270
of the founders and a few of the people

00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:09,860
who had joined to participate in the

00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:13,940
community later so this group wrote a

00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:17,090
steering committee Charter and built out

00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:20,360
a model for the first election and a

00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:22,870
transition model for the the governance

00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:25,430
so this bootstrap steering committee

00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:29,240
worked with the broader kubernetes

00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:31,050
community to elect additional members

00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,910
and have a large group

00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:34,920
for the first two years because we

00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:36,630
expect this to be a lot of work building

00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:39,899
out the rest of the governance for this

00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:42,720
project so we will have 13 people on

00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:45,240
this group for the next two years and

00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:49,350
then it will drop back to kubernetes

00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:52,589
favorite number of seven so in this

00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:55,230
steering committee charter one of the

00:15:52,589 --> 00:16:02,480
things that was explicitly called out

00:15:55,230 --> 00:16:06,570
was we are going to screw this up we

00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:09,660
actually in kubernetes spend a lot of

00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:11,040
time on retrospectives focusing on what

00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:12,630
we've done what we've done right what

00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:16,230
we've done wrong and how we can learn

00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:20,870
from it and that I think as a cultural

00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:25,649
underpinning is a huge and important

00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:28,769
point another thing that we spend a lot

00:16:25,649 --> 00:16:32,010
of time on and a lot of effort on is

00:16:28,769 --> 00:16:35,310
trying to bring together and grow that

00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:39,029
community bring together and teach and

00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:40,890
share our experiences in order to make

00:16:39,029 --> 00:16:43,140
sure that we are growing the next

00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:45,390
generation of leadership that is

00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:47,690
actually part of how this steering

00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:50,310
committee has been formed the

00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:52,380
long-standing founders of the project's

00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:54,930
long-standing contributors as part of

00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:56,310
the bootstrap steering committee ended

00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:59,100
up or the bootstrap Governance Committee

00:16:56,310 --> 00:17:00,839
ended up sitting and participating in

00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:03,750
the first two years of the steering

00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:06,870
committee in order to bring another six

00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:09,240
people together to think about things in

00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:11,600
a very smaller way so this transition of

00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:18,780
knowledge this transition of culture is

00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:21,600
huge we continue to see kubernetes grow

00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:23,490
madly I love this graph because it

00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,290
actually shows two things that I think

00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:28,940
are hysterical around this one of which

00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:32,100
is yay launch big spike there but also

00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:34,610
that we as a group tend to take the end

00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,610
of the year off

00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:42,380
so we continue to see huge growth and

00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:43,520
investment in kubernetes as Chris showed

00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:45,710
in ow

00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,200
in the slides about the CNC F there are

00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:50,750
more than 140 members now looking at

00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:53,660
this broader cloud native compute vision

00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:58,120
kubernetes is simply a piece of this and

00:17:53,660 --> 00:18:01,730
we really really hope that our vision of

00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:04,940
a learning organization a growing

00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:09,590
organization and an organization that

00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:12,669
allows for high trust at edges and

00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:19,160
intersections of both our independent

00:18:12,669 --> 00:18:22,850
group group software group areas of

00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:27,740
focus as well as the edges of the

00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:30,770
kubernetes ecosystem are a great way for

00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:36,190
us to continue to build a composable

00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:39,320
internet and also to change the model of

00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:41,510
cloud computing the model of computing

00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:44,000
so that it is more of a container

00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:48,400
orchestrated workload as opposed to

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:52,419
focusing on VMs or other hardware

00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:55,580
hardware based systems but this

00:18:52,419 --> 00:18:58,309
container orchestration allows us to

00:18:55,580 --> 00:19:01,940
work across multiple clouds across

00:18:58,309 --> 00:19:04,790
hybrid clouds and also to bring this

00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:08,270
workload system across all of our

00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:11,240
industries so functionally we see our

00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:13,340
future as very bright and that this

00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:16,460
kubernetes governance looking at the

00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:18,830
high trust building a community that

00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:22,790
works well together and making sure that

00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:26,630
the governance that we have is right for

00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:27,590
our communities is super important thank

00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:33,420
you
