	BoF: Bash the Kernel Maintainers - Laurent Pinchart, Ideas on Board

The Linux kernel maintainance process is known for often causing frustration among developers. This is a serious issue that the kernel community has been trying to address for years through various forums and initiatives. Most of these have tried to improve the maintenance process from a maintainer's point of view. The large crowd of silent occasional or smaller contributors remains today mostly unheard.

This BOF will try to tackle the kernel maintenance issue from another angle by giving a voice to all contributors. It will be a unique occasion to share the problems you experience when interacting with the upstream kernel community. All feedback will be aggregated in an anonymous form and used to improve the kernel maintenance process.
