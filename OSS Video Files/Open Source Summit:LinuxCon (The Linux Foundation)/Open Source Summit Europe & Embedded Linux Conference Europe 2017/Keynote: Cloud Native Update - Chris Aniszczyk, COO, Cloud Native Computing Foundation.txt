all right everyone could hear me

00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,750
everyone's awake cuz I'm not so as Jim

00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,400
mentioned I'm gonna go over some updates

00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:13,710
from the cloud native computing

00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,299
foundation you know obviously in this

00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:18,060
room it seemed like more people knew

00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:19,470
about you know one of our first projects

00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,420
kubernetes more than the foundation

00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,859
itself but that's sometimes how it is so

00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:30,900
I want to tell you a little bit about

00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:38,270
our origin stories so working clicker

00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:41,010
vo we got a little snafu but there we go

00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:43,500
it's a hard click all right so a little

00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:47,640
bit of an origin story around CN CF so I

00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:50,760
think we're good ah thanks you told me

00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,500
this would happen so cool so a little

00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,120
origin story I was fortunate enough to

00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,539
join a Linux Foundation all around 2

00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:59,070
years ago to be involved with the

00:00:56,539 --> 00:01:01,430
formation of the cloud native computing

00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:04,799
foundation so for those who aren't aware

00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:07,110
cloud native is really a form of

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,270
computing that was pioneered by the

00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:12,299
internet scale giants out there like

00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:14,729
Google Facebook Twitter Netflix and and

00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:17,640
so on and when I when I when I say clown

00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:19,530
native all I mean is you have services

00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,320
that live in containers that are

00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:24,840
orchestrated by some central system like

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,520
like like kubernetes and so we started

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,619
with this kind of simple goal of

00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,090
bringing clown native computing to the

00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:33,210
masses and when we started the

00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:35,640
foundation we humbly started with 22

00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:38,820
members and kubernetes is kind of our

00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:40,619
seed project and so that was about about

00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,549
two years ago like technically under two

00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:42,960
years ago because we didn't hold our

00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:46,020
first board meeting until December of

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,390
2015 but it's been amazing to kind of

00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:50,700
see the growth over time as Jim alluded

00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:52,170
to I argue really think we are the

00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,460
fastest growing open-source foundation

00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:56,189
with the Linux Foundation but some

00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:59,070
people will debate me on that one but as

00:01:56,189 --> 00:02:01,829
of today we've basically experienced

00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:05,189
over 6x growth in under two years we're

00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:07,740
at 141 members it's it's really amazing

00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:10,709
to kind of see a wide variety of

00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:12,780
companies really trying to adopt cloud

00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:13,770
native computing and for me if you kind

00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,350
of were studious and

00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,820
that this list of members I think for

00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:20,850
the first time in the history of

00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:22,860
open-source we have the top six cloud

00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:25,500
providers under one open-source

00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:27,630
foundation umbrella working together to

00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,910
advance the notion of cloud native

00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:31,350
computing - to me which is amazing for

00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:35,880
being someone who's been involved in

00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:37,970
open source for for a long time also as

00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:41,000
kind of like a geeky nerdy thing I

00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:43,260
completely find it fascinating that

00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,150
community is our first project is

00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,770
actually technically self hosted on

00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:49,020
itself for the first time I'm sure some

00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:51,480
of you have heard but github ESRI

00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:53,070
platform on kubernetes so community

00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,200
source code is on github github runs

00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:58,560
kubernetes so it's self hosted so I find

00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:02,180
this as a as a fun kind of a fun key

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:05,580
thing to think about but in reality here

00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:07,260
CN CF the the lifeblood of CN CF is its

00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:10,440
projects you know I love all of our I

00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:12,840
love all my projects equally and we have

00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,020
12 of them we've grown to 12 projects

00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:18,270
over the last two years they cover

00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:21,780
spaces from you know from orchestration

00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:23,660
to monitoring to tracing and and you

00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:27,150
know I'm sure some of you have seen this

00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:30,209
wonderful cloud native landscape if you

00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:31,890
haven't you know it's a bit of a crazy

00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:33,990
diagram it kind of shows the complexity

00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:36,840
of this space but I think the important

00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:39,840
thing here is that when it comes to

00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,490
clown native there are multiple paths to

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,020
get to cloud native right there's

00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:45,720
different technologies out there that

00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:47,550
could use obviously we love for you to

00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:49,350
consider CN CF projects we think they're

00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:50,340
of high quality and and you know

00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:52,380
something you should consider

00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:53,400
but we're realists right we understand

00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,690
there's other technology and the

00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,459
projects out there that you may want to

00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:58,820
use for specific things but the

00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:00,930
important thing in this diagram is there

00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:03,690
there's some missing holes here there's

00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:05,160
some missing pieces so you know today

00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:07,350
I'm happy announced that we're going to

00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:12,120
fill some missing gaps in this diagram

00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:13,709
and I'd like to introduce Ria's fazil a

00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,420
boy from docker to talk about some of

00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:18,329
these new gaps that were filling today

00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:21,569
so please welcome Ria's to the stage

00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:21,569
[Applause]

00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:30,509
[Music]

00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:32,729
thanks Chris so as Chris mentioned today

00:04:30,509 --> 00:04:35,069
we are feeling a couple gaps on that

00:04:32,729 --> 00:04:37,020
past diagram and so with great

00:04:35,069 --> 00:04:40,800
excitement I'm happy to announce two new

00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:47,389
projects to the CNC F the update

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:47,389
framework and notary so thank you so

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:53,940
give me some context both projects are

00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:57,240
focused on security and both projects

00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:59,520
focused on a trusted delivery of content

00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,740
what that means is getting some data

00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,930
from point A to point B the data could

00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:06,500
be anything across platform in a trusted

00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:08,490
way so many of you are probably thinking

00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:10,560
okay we have a way of doing this we

00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:13,710
maybe can use signatures so here's a

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,210
signature and you may recognize the

00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:17,340
signature you may not in which case you

00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:19,349
have some authenticity of the signature

00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:20,340
but we're really missing from just

00:05:19,349 --> 00:05:22,710
signatures we're missing a lot of

00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:25,349
context we're missing when was the

00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:28,080
signature made is it still valid is one

00:05:25,349 --> 00:05:29,879
signature enough for our data or

00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:33,319
software or the document that this was

00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:37,740
on and so what tough diptych framework

00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:40,979
really strives to achieve is providing

00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:43,830
context for more robust software updates

00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:46,589
in a trusted way so for some background

00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:48,120
on TUF TUF was developed by a group of

00:05:46,589 --> 00:05:50,909
researchers at the new york university

00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:54,930
the engineering school and they drew

00:05:50,909 --> 00:05:58,319
some ideas from tor which many of you

00:05:54,930 --> 00:06:00,960
may know as an anonymity the software

00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,639
the communication and tor had a very

00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,580
exciting update framework called Fandi

00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:08,639
where they SAP sought out to make a very

00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:09,690
secure update system for tor even in the

00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,020
face of some of the strongest

00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:15,029
adversaries and so in developing sandy

00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:17,000
and developing tough the tough

00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:19,589
researchers decided to really tackle

00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,509
giving more context around signatures

00:06:19,589 --> 00:06:23,819
that you can make very robust decisions

00:06:21,509 --> 00:06:25,710
so for example from signatures you may

00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:27,870
already get authenticity understanding

00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:30,240
who signed integrity understanding if

00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:32,669
was signed is the same thing that you

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,810
want but tuff goes beyond that by giving

00:06:32,669 --> 00:06:36,000
you freshness guarantee

00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,680
is this the most up-to-date signature

00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,040
the most up-to-date package it allows

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,690
you to do multi signature threshold

00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:45,930
entry's what I need do I have you know

00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:48,660
three signatures five sensors and very

00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:50,520
importantly in tough if a key is

00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:53,490
compromised it's not an end-of-the-world

00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:55,380
event you can rotate the key and your

00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:57,750
consumers of your package or whatever

00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:59,880
software or data you're providing can

00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:02,850
still verify your signature and continue

00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:05,040
with with fifthly process and so tough

00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:07,380
as I mentioned is cross-platform and

00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:09,270
many platforms and programming languages

00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:12,090
have already adopted or in the process

00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:16,560
of adopting adopting tough today which

00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:18,870
brings me to notary which is a open

00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:22,710
source project from docker that

00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:24,780
implements the tough specification it's

00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:27,000
open source on github here there today

00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:29,190
it's written and go you get a

00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,200
command-line interface a couple of micro

00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:34,380
services for the server-side operations

00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:38,040
of signing and holding data and you have

00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:39,120
a robust library to integrate with many

00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,460
of you might many of you might already

00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,740
know about notary as notary it's been at

00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:45,450
the forefront of container image

00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:48,780
provenance so understanding where an

00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:49,560
image comes from is it trusted but for

00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:51,150
those of you who aren't too familiar

00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:56,280
with image provenance I'd like to draw

00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:58,560
an analogy to normal PDF JPEG images

00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:02,580
especially in the Photoshop world we

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:04,560
live in so for example this is not a

00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:07,800
real image right like you could in some

00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,150
parts of the world penguins do go and go

00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,990
to the beach but you're not gonna see

00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:15,560
one drinking a tropical drink sunbathing

00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:18,300
and wearing some flowers and a hammock

00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:19,890
you're more likely to see something like

00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:22,110
this and you'd expect me like this

00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:24,270
to be a real image so in the same way

00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:28,740
that you'd want to expect real images

00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:30,720
for photos you want to expect that your

00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:32,430
containers are untampered with and

00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,700
trusted you want image provenance you

00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:37,560
want to know that the same developer or

00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:39,060
person who wrote the code for this image

00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:41,550
and packaged the image and pushed it is

00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:43,349
the that same image is the one that

00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:45,450
you're downloading and deploying your

00:08:43,349 --> 00:08:47,670
infrastructure and so notary by

00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:48,190
implementing the tough spec gives you

00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:49,690
all of the

00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:52,240
great guarantees of freshness

00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:54,610
authenticity integrity he compromised

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,260
that survivable and allows you to apply

00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:58,690
it to your doctor containers and other

00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:00,490
containers and with notary I shouldn't

00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:02,340
go one step further and have a

00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:05,220
cryptographic chain-of-custody

00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:08,470
what I mean by this is that you can

00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:11,530
mandate cryptographically by requiring

00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:15,790
signatures at each stage of your CI CD

00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:18,400
pipeline did my image pass see I did my

00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:20,590
image get security scan did my image

00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,810
successfully deployed to development and

00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:25,480
pass test there and before deploying to

00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:27,400
production you can check and verify each

00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,560
of these signatures and mandate that

00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,410
they exist before your containers

00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:34,260
deployed in your production environment

00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:37,540
so notary and tough are very powerful

00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:40,650
notary has been adopted by as well on

00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:45,370
many platforms including docker core OS

00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:47,920
VMware Linux kits and many others so I'd

00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:50,860
ask you to please join us both projects

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:53,290
are open source on the tough side the

00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:54,670
spec is a living spec so there are

00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:56,980
operation proposals where you can

00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:59,920
propose new additions to the spec and

00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:02,230
edits called taps and the notary we're

00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:05,890
approaching 1.0 and thinking about

00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:07,240
signing service specs pod specs and many

00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:09,460
other features so we invite you to come

00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:12,450
join us and with that I like to invite

00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:12,450
Chris back up on stage

00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:26,040
Thank You Ria's projects and we've added

00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:29,580
both notary and tough to the landscape

00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:31,680
so Thank You Ria's for your time and you

00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:33,810
know just a final kind of notice and

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,970
shout out for the audience is we're

00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:37,830
hosting cube con cloud native con in

00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:39,649
Austin in a little less than a couple

00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:42,060
months now so if you're interested in

00:10:39,649 --> 00:10:43,649
meeting the cloud Native community and

00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:46,370
and you know working with our projects

00:10:43,649 --> 00:10:48,450
please make your way to Austin and

00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:51,120
attend the conference and we'll be back
