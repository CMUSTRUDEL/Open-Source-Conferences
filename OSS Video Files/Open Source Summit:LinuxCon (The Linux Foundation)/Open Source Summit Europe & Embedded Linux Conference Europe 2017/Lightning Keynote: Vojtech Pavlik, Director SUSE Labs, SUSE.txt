	Lightning Keynote: Vojtech Pavlik, Director SUSE Labs, SUSE 

Open and Source are words, and as such they can be understood in many ways. While the Open Source movement and Free Software movements have taken the world by storm, it'd be premature to declare victory. New challenges appear both outside and inside the community. I'm offering my own perspective on what's important to keep the momentum.

hello thank you um actually I decided to

00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:09,179
forego slides entirely just that I can

00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,540
squeeze a thought a single thought into

00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:14,940
these five minutes I thought uh about

00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,809
something that Sousa cares about and let

00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:20,609
me start with the story

00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:24,570
it was um in 90s some time still before

00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:27,359
my Susa time that a to friends of mine

00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,220
were developing a interesting project it

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,830
was a hard web project it was a free

00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:34,170
space optic device that would allow a 10

00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:36,120
megabit bandwidth across a couple

00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:39,000
hundreds of meters for internet

00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:41,129
connection oh it was it in the time of

00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,649
dial-up so that was actually pretty

00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:45,030
amazing and they had it working and they

00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:47,190
wanted to attract the community to it

00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:49,710
some somebody that would help them to

00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:52,079
actually expand it and make it work

00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:53,910
better so they were coming to me and

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,399
said well you know we saw this

00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:58,890
open-source software movement we want to

00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,690
do something like that and I said okay

00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:02,910
well then you just publish the source

00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:05,309
for your device and that's it right but

00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:07,710
what is the source for a hardware device

00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:09,810
so initially they just published the

00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:12,420
list of materials all the steps that you

00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:17,490
needed to make the device the the the

00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:18,930
actual photos of the machine and well

00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:23,009
nobody really did that because nobody

00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:24,479
did understand how it works so then they

00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:26,970
talked to me okay but that's not enough

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:30,270
you actually need to go deeper you need

00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:32,159
to publish at least the schematics

00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:35,340
so the schematics was out it was

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,079
actually done in a nice open source open

00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,479
data format such that you could use open

00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:41,310
source tooling to do all the steps to

00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:43,409
create a printed circuit board and make

00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:47,040
your device and still that didn't work

00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:49,740
so they were flabbergasted right there

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,850
was it was all all there and there was

00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:56,430
nothing and so the last thing actually

00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:58,020
you need to explain why it works the way

00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:00,329
the way it works

00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:03,299
why have you designed it why have you

00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:05,280
added this particle component here and

00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:07,350
that particle component there because

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,410
without that understanding nobody can

00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:11,810
really expand on it

00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:13,670
and actually that worked that device

00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:17,900
became rather successful until well

00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:23,920
Wi-Fi came around and it was a happy

00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:28,010
project so what ice brings me um if you

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:29,750
are doing open source it is important to

00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:31,760
be open it is important to actually give

00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:33,560
out everything that you have all the

00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:37,630
thoughts are going to do that go into

00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:41,900
your project not just the source itself

00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:43,670
fortunately today we have source code

00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:46,850
repositories we have get we have

00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:48,770
subversion we have all those so actually

00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:54,560
a lot of that thought goes right into

00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:56,000
the commit commands so the GPL actually

00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,730
nicely captures that you need to share

00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,430
your source code the GPL v3 actually

00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:03,440
nicely captures the fact that what the

00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:05,360
source code is that it is actually the

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,900
form of the code that is the easiest for

00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:11,840
modification but still it does not tell

00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:15,080
you that the one component that is also

00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,610
needed is the how component how do you

00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,050
come to these conclusions how do you

00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:20,570
actually find out that this is the best

00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:23,210
software this is the best way to do it

00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:27,530
and well that's the message that I want

00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:29,360
to share today actually I'm also a

00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:33,380
manager right and so I've been taught

00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:35,390
that if I want to keep a a developer a

00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,890
employee working for me I need to teach

00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:38,959
them everything they need to know for

00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:41,060
the next job and then they will not

00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,890
leave because they are all safe so it's

00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:44,510
the same thing for your project you

00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:46,700
actually need to give out everything for

00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:48,880
people to be able to fork it and that's

00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:51,709
what makes it healthy

00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:57,260
once more about sucia we actually do

00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:59,660
practice that at least we try and so

00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:02,630
when my department is releasing the

00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:04,610
Linux kernel for customers obviously

00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:06,380
paying customers we also release a

00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:10,490
sources and we don't just release the s

00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:12,980
rpm with one big turbo love kernel

00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:14,930
sources and one huge patch of what we

00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:18,229
have changed what we actually already

00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:20,210
during development make public or of our

00:04:18,229 --> 00:04:23,120
internal git repository so that you can

00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:25,910
see what and why we changed

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,130
along the road to make an enterprise

00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:31,010
quality district you actually are able

00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:35,870
to replicate all that if you like and so

00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:37,550
again the message to you is it's the

00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:40,940
nature of people it's a nature of

00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:43,610
business that people try to keep the

00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:46,729
secret sauce to themselves don't do that

00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:50,660
it is contra productive if you see wall

00:04:46,729 --> 00:04:53,000
Gardens being built for contribution if

00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:55,400
you see that customers are actually not

00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,460
treated as potential contributors to the

00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:02,160
project tear down those wall gardens and

00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:06,689
always think about being open thank you

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,689
