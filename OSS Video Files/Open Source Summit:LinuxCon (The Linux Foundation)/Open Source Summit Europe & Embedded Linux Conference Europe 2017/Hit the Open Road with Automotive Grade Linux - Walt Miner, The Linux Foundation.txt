all right good morning everybody my name

00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:09,090
is Walt miner I am the community and

00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:13,860
development manager for automotive-grade

00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:15,540
Linux you can follow me on twitter at at

00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,850
v-- star walt you'll see a picture of

00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:20,670
everybody here in the room you could

00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,289
pick yourselves out I've been with the

00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:27,109
Linux Foundation and automotive-grade

00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:29,369
linux about three plus years now and my

00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:32,969
most of my message today is about

00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:37,050
collaboration AGL I think you'll find is

00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:39,660
one of the friendliest projects for

00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:41,629
working on with developers we have a lot

00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:44,760
of developers who pitch in and help out

00:00:41,629 --> 00:00:46,559
you'll you'll find that we were always

00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:50,010
more than happy to help people come onto

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:52,079
the project and we really love working

00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:54,930
together we had a an all number meeting

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:58,350
last week in Dresden about two hours

00:00:54,930 --> 00:01:01,530
away from here by train we had about 150

00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:03,059
developers come together everybody got a

00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:08,220
lot of work done had a lot of really

00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:11,460
good meetings and really helped advance

00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:14,159
the project so that's really the the

00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:16,110
message of today our tagline is

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,930
collaborating to build the car of the

00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:20,280
future through rapid innovation and hope

00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:20,930
to show you some of what that's all

00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,330
about

00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:26,430
so automotive-grade linux we're

00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:29,430
nonprofit or an open source project

00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:31,470
based in the with with the linux

00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:35,009
foundation itself and we're really

00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:38,729
working on rapid innovation of vehicle

00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:40,920
software throughout the vehicle we're

00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:44,640
working to build a single platform for

00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,290
the entire industry we're an OEM you

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,860
know someone who makes cars or a tier 1

00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:52,229
supplier to that OEM can take a GL and

00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:55,610
have about 70 to 80 percent of a

00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:59,549
starting point for a production project

00:01:55,610 --> 00:02:02,610
our mantra is code first you know as

00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:05,729
with any open source project commit

00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:07,439
early commits often and really we aim to

00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:10,020
reduce fragmentation in the automotive

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,150
industry by combining the best of

00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,840
various open-source projects that have

00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,730
been

00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:18,680
formed to work in the automotive

00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:21,390
industry over the last 10 to 15 years

00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:23,130
we're working to develop an ecosystem of

00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:27,080
course of developers suppliers and

00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:27,080
expertise all using that single platform

00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:34,830
like I said AGL is really the the only

00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:36,599
industry the only only organization

00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:38,190
trying to address all the software in

00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:39,900
the car Dan caoxi

00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:41,910
who's the executive director of

00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:44,040
automotive grade Linux likes to say if

00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:47,430
it's Linux in the car it should be based

00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:50,430
on a GL where we've been focusing the

00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:53,549
last few years on entertainment and ivi

00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:56,280
systems for the vehicle we're branching

00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:59,160
out into instrument cluster telematics

00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,870
heads-up display we're putting effort

00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:05,130
into functional safety over the next

00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:08,040
year to get the gets Asil B and ISO to

00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:09,780
six to plus qualified so we can

00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:13,980
eventually add advanced driver

00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:17,840
assistance or a TAS Private Eye products

00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:17,840
and autonomous driving to our portfolio

00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:26,250
and like I said AGL is a code first

00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:28,410
organization so we don't spend a lot of

00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:30,079
time on specifications but that doesn't

00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:33,000
mean we don't spend a lot of time on

00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:35,250
documentation but specifications as

00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,709
we've seen another in the automotive

00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:39,900
industry initiative specifications have

00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:41,790
led to fragmentation as different

00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:44,130
companies end up implementing those

00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:45,900
those specifications in different ways

00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:47,940
and there's been numerous examples of

00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:54,000
this in the automotive industry through

00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:55,920
the years so just to kind of give some

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,739
examples of collaboration within the

00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:02,160
project this is the list of the top 25

00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:04,950
get committers so far this year on an

00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:08,400
automotive grade Linux I really ran

00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:10,410
these statistics on October 1st so we've

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,090
had a total of two thousand seven

00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:16,289
hundred sixty five total commits this

00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:18,090
year to a GL repositories on our master

00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:22,440
branch this doesn't include our release

00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:23,900
branches that we've had 60 individual

00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:27,080
committers have commit

00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:29,479
code this year 27 individual companies

00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:31,580
have committed code this year and you

00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:34,039
can see some people take our committer

00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:36,880
aleikum it off and mantra to heart and

00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:39,590
they really do they really do that

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,600
others who may have fewer commits on

00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:43,580
this list are still contributing a great

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:48,500
deal of code they just don't tend to

00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:51,050
commit as as often as other people by

00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:54,350
company I listed every company that's

00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:56,419
committed this year you can see it's a

00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:59,060
pretty wide variety of companies that

00:04:56,419 --> 00:05:06,440
have committed to the project both tier

00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:08,479
ones tier two Zoe M's is fees some other

00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:11,150
numbers over the last we've been running

00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:14,930
the AGA GL what we call the unified code

00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:17,630
base project for the last two plus years

00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:20,419
now in that two and a half years or two

00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:23,060
plus years we've had 81 individuals

00:05:20,419 --> 00:05:27,289
unique individuals commit code 33

00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:29,690
different companies and interestingly

00:05:27,289 --> 00:05:32,060
seven individuals not affiliated with a

00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:33,740
member company have committed code as

00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:35,840
well so people who just saw what we were

00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:37,340
doing and wanted to contribute saw

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,909
something that they they wanted to help

00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:43,370
out on and then there's another measure

00:05:40,909 --> 00:05:45,889
this year and this number is actually a

00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:47,960
little little stale because we've done a

00:05:45,889 --> 00:05:50,870
release since I did this but this year

00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:53,449
we've closed 429 individual JIRA issues

00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:55,760
so those we use JIRA for project

00:05:53,449 --> 00:05:58,690
management and for bug tracking so

00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:00,860
that's a mix of defects new features

00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:03,349
improvements things like that that we've

00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:07,460
tracked throughout this year so we're

00:06:03,349 --> 00:06:10,370
making a lot of really good progress we

00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:13,789
release code twice a year we make more

00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:15,289
releases twice a year our members didn't

00:06:13,789 --> 00:06:17,360
like when I was just calling it you know

00:06:15,289 --> 00:06:19,010
version 1 version 2 they insisted that I

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,740
come up with some kind of naming system

00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:23,900
so after a lot of thought I put I came

00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:25,639
up a fish I spent a lot of time

00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:28,580
researching fish in alphabetical order

00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:31,029
and and of course appropriate adjectives

00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:33,560
this is a lot of my time spent on this

00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:35,719
so our next group we had our last

00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,009
release was a daring dab that was in

00:06:35,719 --> 00:06:39,169
July we've

00:06:37,009 --> 00:06:42,229
a few patch releases since then our

00:06:39,169 --> 00:06:44,210
upcoming release in December for that's

00:06:42,229 --> 00:06:52,059
targeting the Consumer Electronics Show

00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:55,099
is going to be called electric eel and

00:06:52,059 --> 00:06:59,419
you can see we released the daring dab

00:06:55,099 --> 00:07:01,819
release in July and since then we've

00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:04,490
done two patch releases over one oh no -

00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:09,099
we apply it on at least two more through

00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:11,389
this year and into next year after CES

00:07:09,099 --> 00:07:15,439
electric eel we're targeting for the

00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:17,089
middle of the middle of December the

00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:19,370
schedule and I've got a lot I uploaded

00:07:17,089 --> 00:07:22,580
the slides earlier today so you can go

00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:24,770
to the the schedule the schedule webpage

00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:27,889
and you can get a you get all the slides

00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:30,020
if you'd like I have all hyperlinks to -

00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:32,779
a lot of the different topics on here so

00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:34,849
you can see on our wiki page I keep the

00:07:32,779 --> 00:07:37,069
schedule up to date I tried to update it

00:07:34,849 --> 00:07:39,229
every couple weeks as new things happen

00:07:37,069 --> 00:07:40,669
and you'll find more much more detail

00:07:39,229 --> 00:07:42,229
than this you'll find that you know the

00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:49,099
opening dates and closing dates for our

00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:50,689
merge windows and things like that so I

00:07:49,099 --> 00:07:52,639
just wanted to give a quick overview of

00:07:50,689 --> 00:07:57,229
what we're working on in terms of the

00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:58,370
architecture we hgl is we have this

00:07:57,229 --> 00:07:59,899
thing we're calling it we call the

00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:02,839
unified code base we've got these

00:07:59,899 --> 00:08:07,339
releases twice a year we're based on the

00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:10,819
Yocto project so with every octo release

00:08:07,339 --> 00:08:12,589
we incorporate their release about three

00:08:10,819 --> 00:08:14,749
months three months after they make

00:08:12,589 --> 00:08:16,759
their initial release we switch over our

00:08:14,749 --> 00:08:18,889
master branch to using their release and

00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:21,349
then we take that and we spend about six

00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:24,979
months working on that adding new

00:08:21,349 --> 00:08:27,289
features stabilizing the bsp etc so that

00:08:24,979 --> 00:08:30,169
our release then is is about a nine

00:08:27,289 --> 00:08:35,750
month old up pocky release from Yocto

00:08:30,169 --> 00:08:39,319
project and you'll see here we we get

00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:41,719
the the octo project includes our our

00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:45,110
Linux kernel and BSP and device drivers

00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:48,350
and some of the basic services then we

00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:50,990
add we add this with these this

00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:54,860
reference code here in blue so things

00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:57,380
like audio control sound sound vehicle

00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:59,510
to cloud we have an AP of an HDL

00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:01,639
application framework that includes a

00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:04,220
service binder concept that I'll get

00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:07,750
into in a second and we also include

00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:10,550
security and some transport mechanisms

00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:13,069
AGL also includes some reference

00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:14,540
applications up here that you can use to

00:09:13,069 --> 00:09:17,300
start playing with to create your own

00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:19,880
apps and what I find whenever I go to a

00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:22,339
show like this or to the AGL or member

00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:23,630
meeting last week is that companies come

00:09:22,339 --> 00:09:25,519
to me with all these really cool

00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:30,110
applications that I hadn't even thought

00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:32,839
of and they're often using all of this

00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:35,120
all these bits and taking these

00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:37,040
reference applications as something to

00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,829
start off with and they go off and they

00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,639
create something pretty cool with it

00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:43,040
so there were some really good examples

00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:46,760
of that once again at in Dresden last

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:49,490
week of people using using a GL to

00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:53,660
create STL applications or smart device

00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:55,310
link all sorts of so all sorts of audio

00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:57,260
applications that we've seen coming out

00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:58,819
of out of smaller companies so it's

00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:05,720
really interesting to see what people do

00:09:58,819 --> 00:10:11,149
with this thing so we have this binder

00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:14,510
binding functionality built into our or

00:10:11,149 --> 00:10:18,889
a GL application framework you see here

00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:20,630
that each of the binders that are

00:10:18,889 --> 00:10:22,730
interconnecting are connected to each

00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:24,529
other and there's security built in

00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:27,559
there's a security concept there's a

00:10:24,529 --> 00:10:30,949
security context built into each binder

00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:32,059
so that your applications as they call

00:10:30,949 --> 00:10:34,279
these api's

00:10:32,059 --> 00:10:35,660
then we ensure that only the

00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:37,880
applications that are allowed to use

00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:39,829
those api's or other services that are

00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:42,589
allowed to use those api's can do that

00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:45,500
our security context our security is all

00:10:42,589 --> 00:10:46,939
built on smack and a lot of that work

00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:49,699
has was based on a lot of the

00:10:46,939 --> 00:10:54,019
application framework work was based on

00:10:49,699 --> 00:10:55,459
the Tizen application framework and a

00:10:54,019 --> 00:10:57,079
lot of the guys who work at on that

00:10:55,459 --> 00:10:59,540
Tizen application framework are now

00:10:57,079 --> 00:11:01,130
working on the AGL application framework

00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:03,200
and using a lot of the lessons learned

00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:06,320
there too

00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:09,650
help improve the AGL app framework of

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,570
the AGL binder binding mechanism so

00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:14,450
again I included a link we have a really

00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:17,570
good documentation site Doc's that

00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:20,540
automotive dot Linux org so I included a

00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:22,820
link here to the application framework

00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:26,000
binder information so you can learn how

00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:28,730
to build your own also this week I don't

00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,160
recall if it's today or tomorrow Scott

00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:34,220
Murray and Matt Porter will have a talk

00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:36,530
about building your own service binders

00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:38,900
in AGL and some of the experience that

00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:42,160
they've had in building the Bluetooth

00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:43,880
and audio and radio tuner binders so

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:48,560
there's some really good information

00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:50,570
available there as well one thing I

00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,280
should point out about this is when I

00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:56,000
talk about cool applications that people

00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:58,010
are doing Lee on an IV from consult

00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,800
codes also giving a talk later today

00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:03,800
I guess he's built a robotic controller

00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:06,740
using Raspberry Pi based on the AGL app

00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:08,090
framework in the AGL UCB so that's

00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:09,980
another interesting talk you can learn

00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:18,170
where people have actually made use of a

00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:20,450
GL we've also got an SDK available for

00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:23,510
you app developers or people who want to

00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:26,180
develop new services on a GL here's a

00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:30,140
link here to the documentation and how

00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:30,980
to how to download the app the SDK and

00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:33,770
get it up and running

00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:36,110
it's basically it's a docker image we're

00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:38,990
trying to eliminate hosts dependency

00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:41,480
issues though still tend to come up but

00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:45,920
with our with our platform developers

00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:48,430
who aren't using the SDK what we had

00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:51,110
found early in a GL was a lot of UI

00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:54,140
excuse me a lot of Yocto knowledge was

00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:57,080
needed for app developers and we really

00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:59,060
wanted to eliminate the need for app

00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:00,830
developers to have to learn a lot of

00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:03,250
Yocto and allow a lot about the build

00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:03,250
system

00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:12,300
so what was our so I just I presented

00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:14,880
this to our advisory board last week we

00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:16,230
our roadmap for this year just want to

00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,610
run through the roadmap for this year

00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:19,140
what we accomplished and what we're

00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:22,230
looking to accomplish next year and

00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:23,400
really the thing to keep in mind is for

00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:26,810
anything we're looking to accomplish

00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:30,000
coming up this year next year and Beyond

00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:31,590
hgl has you know people we have people

00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,380
that were funding for development but

00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:36,060
also a lot of people come to us and work

00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:38,760
on projects that they're just interested

00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:40,590
in because Lee I think leanest or volt

00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:42,780
said you know the best way to get

00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:44,460
involved in an open-source project is to

00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:49,200
find a niche that you need to scratch

00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:53,670
and so really Eddie you know we've got

00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:55,710
we've had people add code to the to the

00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:57,900
distribution based on something that

00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:59,910
they wanted to work on so by no means

00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:02,910
are we limited to just doing these kinds

00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:05,370
of things in the next year or two so

00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:07,710
like I said we've released our - we had

00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:09,690
our daring dab release in July we really

00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:14,670
planned to release and we're on track to

00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:15,990
release electric eel for CES the our

00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:17,670
vision of the beginning of the year was

00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:21,000
we would have the HDL apt frame or

00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:23,040
complete it's really hard to you know

00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,560
it's really hard to quantify to complete

00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,480
so you know we're on basically we're on

00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,110
track with the AGL the framework is

00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,970
usable

00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:32,430
we've got people developing apps we've

00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:35,430
got people using the SDK so I'll call

00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:37,860
that a win for this year we want to have

00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:40,490
a GL reference apps available in both

00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:44,190
cute five which is I've been our primary

00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:47,280
target and html5 we're a little behind

00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:50,840
on the html5 side it's looking more like

00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,840
that'll be the beginning of next year

00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:56,550
all API is available as app framework

00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:59,040
service binders well again how do you

00:14:56,550 --> 00:15:00,930
quantify all I'll say that we're in

00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,670
progress we've got a good number that

00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:04,170
are already available and a good number

00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:07,500
that are currently being developed and

00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:12,180
we should see all of them done pretty

00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:14,220
soon instrument cluster telematics other

00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:16,560
profiles like I said we want to be in

00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:18,870
all parts of the vehicle so we've had to

00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,310
do some rework of our our build system

00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:23,640
of our Yocto layers

00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:25,860
to enable headless profiles in order to

00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:28,800
do some more enablement of lower end

00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:30,570
radios and things like that so the

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,540
profiles are ready to go they're in our

00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:38,370
build system there's actually of a

00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:40,110
specific JIRA issue spec 145 you can

00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:41,610
follow along all of the trials and

00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:44,430
tribulations of the group working on

00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:46,200
that they're basically ready to go and

00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:48,690
will be turned on and validated more

00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:53,970
after CES at this point we don't want to

00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:55,260
risk the EE release with fooling around

00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:59,700
with the build system or at this point

00:15:55,260 --> 00:16:02,220
in time a complete set of documentation

00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:05,070
well again how do you quantify complete

00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:07,230
I'd say we have our newly launched the

00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:12,270
dock site at the end very end of last

00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:15,600
year the documentation there is it's in

00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:17,310
progress it's always evolving we need to

00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,370
do a better job of versioning the

00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:22,470
documentation for the various releases

00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:29,089
but I think we've got a pretty good

00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:31,650
start there we also wanted to do more

00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:34,470
continuous integration automated testing

00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:38,190
daily weekly event based builds for

00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:39,660
testing and publishing test results so

00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:41,850
we've got a lot of activity in our

00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:44,640
continuous integration automated test

00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:45,690
group if you go we use garrett i've got

00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,640
a lot i've got a lot of links to

00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:50,280
developer resources and the last few

00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:52,500
slides here that you can take a look at

00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:55,410
including to our garrett site and our

00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:57,120
various expert groups and you'll find

00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:59,940
that all of our all of our Garrett

00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:03,060
submit garrett submissions are built by

00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:05,010
our CI system there's some level of

00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:06,620
validation being done automated testing

00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:10,050
being done each of the submissions

00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:12,360
you'll see that we've got for our our

00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:14,699
latest electric eel release candidate we

00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:16,949
publish test results for the various

00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:20,010
boards so we're definitely on track for

00:17:16,949 --> 00:17:22,620
this and I think by March of next year

00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:24,630
we'll really have a very solid system

00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:27,510
and we're also we're also working with a

00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:33,090
number of outside open source projects

00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:33,990
like lava lake Fuego like CIP the civil

00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:35,550
infrastructure pride

00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:37,860
checked and coordinating our efforts

00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:46,170
with those guys so we can all jointly

00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:47,010
make a bigger impact in this area vision

00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:49,380
for next year

00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:52,170
really we're seeing a lot of interest in

00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:54,120
major content providers to bring bring

00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:56,970
that content on Sage onto the AGL

00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:59,580
platform so hopefully in the next year

00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:01,920
we'll see people like Spotify and Amazon

00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:04,650
and Comcast's and streaming providers in

00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:06,660
the u.s. coming on board to AGL and

00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:09,390
making their apps available to the AGL

00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:12,929
community we're seeing a lot of interest

00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:14,520
in this area already we want we've had a

00:18:12,929 --> 00:18:18,059
number of OEMs that are interested in

00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:19,170
porting legacy apps to AGL so basically

00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:21,210
making sure we've got all that

00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:25,340
enablement in place and start seeing the

00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:28,830
first of those apps being ported in 2018

00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:32,250
to two releases for next year funky

00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:36,200
flounder and grumpy guppy spent a lot of

00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:38,340
time with these names functional safety

00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:40,020
advancing the farce functional safety

00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:42,450
initiative we've got a lot of different

00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:45,120
ideas on how to accomplish this and we

00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:49,130
just need to invest some time and some

00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,130
some resources into getting this done

00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:59,040
our board and a lot of our members we

00:18:56,040 --> 00:19:01,559
use leaves cute cute five four four all

00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:05,730
of our most of our graphics back-end our

00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:08,210
graphics toolkit so our board and our

00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:11,270
members really want to see us move to

00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:14,190
more of a true open-source toolkit

00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:16,770
there's some concern I mean q5 is a

00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:18,780
great tool don't get me wrong there's

00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:20,910
some concern about the costs and

00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:23,580
production so they still want us to

00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:26,970
continue to explore with other consumer

00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:29,640
electronics projects and a true open

00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:33,059
source toolkit this is a much bigger

00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:34,470
project than just a GL though so we need

00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:38,670
to work with other projects to figure

00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:40,410
out how or what we're going to do we've

00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:41,520
been working I didn't mention it in the

00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:43,650
vision for this year but we've been

00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:47,419
working on on a new home screen and

00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:49,159
window managers services for hgl we

00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:52,370
we're getting the first version of that

00:19:49,159 --> 00:19:54,230
into electric eel I was a lot of

00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:56,679
discussion last week on exactly how to

00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:59,090
do that when we were in Dresden

00:19:56,679 --> 00:20:01,820
basically want to complete that in the

00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:03,740
first half of next year have that have

00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:05,929
that all in the system and have all of

00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:11,059
our legacy apps ported have all the new

00:20:05,929 --> 00:20:14,200
apps running that chromium based html5

00:20:11,059 --> 00:20:17,210
apps like I said earlier as we move into

00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:19,820
running html5 based apps we need

00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:22,820
something to run the backend of that so

00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:27,070
we're working with agalya on get making

00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:27,070
chromium available to the AGL community

00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:35,360
continue to evolve our app framework

00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:37,370
improving security lessons learned from

00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:40,159
the work that we do this year we're

00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:41,870
always doing post mortems on on with our

00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:44,570
app developers to try to figure out what

00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:46,750
we can improve working with our security

00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:49,429
team to figure out what we can improve

00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:51,950
Tizen recently released their version

00:20:49,429 --> 00:20:54,080
4.0 of their framework their app

00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:59,120
framework so what can we take from their

00:20:54,080 --> 00:21:02,419
security work that they've done also

00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:07,010
improving user management and then using

00:21:02,419 --> 00:21:08,840
C groups and namespace and and new work

00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:13,659
that's been done in system D especially

00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:17,419
in the latest version v2 35 for using

00:21:13,659 --> 00:21:20,570
dynamic use dynamic users for managing

00:21:17,419 --> 00:21:27,919
power managing memory and CPUs and

00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:30,289
things like that another another part of

00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:32,870
our vision for next year having alcohol

00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:35,150
at a sustainable audio solution we've

00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:38,049
been using some pieces of the Geneva

00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:40,309
which is another open-source project

00:21:38,049 --> 00:21:42,860
using some parts of the Geneva Audio

00:21:40,309 --> 00:21:45,710
Manager we found that parts of that are

00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:49,130
kind of inappropriate for app level

00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:51,260
api's and for managing the actual

00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:54,200
devices it can be very complicated to

00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:56,510
write plugins to their audio manager so

00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:59,810
we've got a lot of work in progress the

00:21:56,510 --> 00:22:03,950
we call it the HDL advanced

00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:06,490
Audio architecture or for a again I come

00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:11,440
up with these really cool acronyms for a

00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:13,940
and having a video player reference app

00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:16,070
vehicle to cloud services there's a lot

00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:18,800
of you know there's been for many many

00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:22,250
years in the US especially but also in

00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:24,410
Europe a lot of telematics services

00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:26,860
which nobody would have thought of

00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:30,110
calling vehicle to cloud ten years ago

00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:32,090
but now that's what we call it so having

00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:34,400
a telematics architecture and a vehicle

00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:36,860
vehicle to a standardized vehicle to

00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,510
cloud architecture is very much

00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:40,490
interesting and we're forming a new

00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:44,900
expert group in this area over the next

00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:49,910
month speech to text text to speech

00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:52,370
services not that we would have a speech

00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:54,560
engine integrated into a GL but at a pet

00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:56,300
what we would have a common API where

00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:58,550
different speech providers could then

00:22:56,300 --> 00:23:00,770
plug in their engine and our apps could

00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:05,260
then develop to those specific api's

00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:07,610
that we provide we have an ongoing

00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:10,700
reference hardware system architecture

00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:15,650
effort being led by some of our OEMs we

00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:17,990
have ten OEMs in a GL Bay pretty much

00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:20,630
all the Japanese OEMs plus mercedes-benz

00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:24,500
here in Europe Jaguar Land Rover here in

00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:26,450
Europe and Ford in the US and they've

00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:29,390
been they've been working on defining

00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:34,250
what the system architecture of the

00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:37,970
future is in vehicle for not only ivi

00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:39,800
but also telematics and a DES and things

00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:41,600
like that so they've released the

00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:44,360
initial version of that document and

00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:46,160
we'll be continuing to review that and

00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:48,320
figure out the takeaways from that

00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:52,090
document that we can use for

00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,090
incorporating that into the software

00:23:55,750 --> 00:24:00,830
so just a quick overview we have these

00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,270
things I really don't like the name we

00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:04,880
have these things called expert groups

00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:06,140
but let's call them working groups you

00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,250
don't necessarily need to be an expert

00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:12,890
to be involved in one of them we have

00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:14,780
six active expert groups right now with

00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:17,780
a vehicle to cloud expert group coming

00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:20,090
online very shortly at framework and

00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:24,500
security connectivity continuous

00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:28,550
integration automated test etc so just a

00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:32,000
quick overview our expert groups when we

00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:33,920
formed them we wanted we really only

00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,740
sweetleaf stuck to this principle

00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:38,660
throughout the last four or five years

00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:40,370
we wanted them we didn't want to create

00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:42,290
a bunch of expert groups just to have

00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:45,110
say we had complete coverage throughout

00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:47,570
the vehicle we really wanted a critical

00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:50,600
mass so that we would have a minimum of

00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:52,880
five to ten people who were

00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:57,050
participating in these expert groups and

00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:58,610
and working on these issues and so what

00:24:57,050 --> 00:25:02,300
you'll see as I go through these is some

00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:06,410
of the some of the definitions of these

00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:07,820
expert groups get a little big and we're

00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:11,000
not really really haven't split them out

00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:12,530
unless there's been a again one of these

00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,470
critical masses that are willing to take

00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:17,000
on the work for these expert groups so

00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:19,640
you'll see the application framework and

00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,930
security expert group takes on a lot of

00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22,430
different things that you might not

00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:24,590
think of immediately when you think of

00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:25,820
either of those topics and some people

00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:29,560
don't even think of application

00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:29,560
framework and security is going together

00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:39,770
so the app framework and security expert

00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:42,580
group tasks they've made namespace and C

00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:45,470
groups are now available to use in hgl

00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:47,630
but we really need to work on exactly

00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:50,900
how we're going to make use of those so

00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:54,160
the enablement is there we've talked

00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:56,480
about doing some resource management

00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:59,540
recently the system that we're using

00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:03,560
system D to third beat version 232 which

00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:06,350
is the latest Yocto version we know it

00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:08,250
until the version 235 has some really

00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:12,060
interesting features in there for

00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:14,190
or dynamic users and things like that as

00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:17,190
well as additional features in the

00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:18,780
namespace and cgroups areas so we really

00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:21,860
want to up Rev to that as soon as

00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:25,980
possible and start making use of that I

00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:28,200
talked about Tyson Florida already our

00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:31,050
SDK we've we've done a lot of work with

00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:32,700
the SDK we've created app templates so

00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:36,330
that the app developers have something

00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:38,850
they can start with learning how to

00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:41,100
create widgets service binders with a

00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:44,070
developer guide all that's available now

00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:48,600
with the SDK and and this group isn't is

00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:50,430
tasked with owning that more things

00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:52,470
we'll be working on in the next year or

00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:54,720
the in the upcoming year including

00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:58,290
identity and user management so that you

00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:59,820
can bring a RFID card and it'll

00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:02,930
recognize you and it'll change the

00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:04,800
Preferences on the ivi system to yours

00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:06,090
you know you'll you'll have your

00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:08,190
Facebook account you'll have your

00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:14,310
Spotify playlist you'll have whatever it

00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:17,720
is that comes with your identity key

00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:19,770
management for app installation band and

00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:22,110
making sure that the policies are all

00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:25,070
correct and sayonara consent management

00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:32,550
things like that are all upcoming on our

00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:34,170
docket for this group the connectivity

00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:36,710
expert group was one of those that was

00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:39,360
again had a very broad remit and

00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:42,240
recently we like I said we've split that

00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:45,930
out some of these out to the to a new

00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:47,460
vehicle to cloud expert group so but the

00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:50,070
connectivity group I think now has a

00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:53,280
fairly reasonable focus which includes

00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:56,190
vehicle connectivity can most glynn

00:27:53,280 --> 00:28:00,780
things like that network and vehicle

00:27:56,190 --> 00:28:02,670
firewalls Bluetooth Wi-Fi NFC and smart

00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:06,060
device link so they've actually got a

00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:09,480
fairly reasonable amount of amount of

00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:13,830
tasks on their plate compared to some of

00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:16,440
the others they've been working on

00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:18,480
vehicle messaging and a vehicle

00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:20,700
messaging app framework binder so that

00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,110
we can abstract the signals coming in

00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,940
from the vehicle

00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:26,610
whether they come from kin or they come

00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:28,830
from GPIO or they come from anywhere

00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:30,470
else the applications don't have to care

00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:33,360
about that

00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:36,420
bluetooth we've got binders available

00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:38,130
for Bluetooth we're refactoring some of

00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:41,280
the binders now based on some of the

00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:44,970
lessons learned we've got a telephony

00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:47,250
binder that's in progress an NFC binder

00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:50,400
that's in progress a Wi-Fi binder that's

00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:56,100
already available so a lot of work

00:28:50,400 --> 00:29:00,080
that's been done by this group already a

00:28:56,100 --> 00:29:00,080
continuous integration automated test

00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:06,060
they've been integrating Lava with Fuego

00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:08,360
so we can do remote remote board testing

00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:10,740
for our for our automated testing

00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:13,560
they've really done a lot of work with

00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:16,070
improving the our Garrett Jenkins Lava

00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:18,780
workflow over the last few months

00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:20,850
they've created a web interface for test

00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:23,100
results so now that you can for any

00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:24,840
given board any given build you can

00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:27,630
drill down into what tests have been run

00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:29,640
which tests have pat passed which tests

00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:31,650
have failed taking a look at the log

00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:34,800
file for any failed test things like

00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:39,000
that we've been working with up

00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:41,960
streaming our Fork of Fuego we have a

00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:44,190
concept of the lab in a box so that

00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:46,290
companies or individuals will be able to

00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:48,330
take our test environment and our test

00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:52,110
cases and move them inside their

00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:55,560
firewall and run the tests inside their

00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:57,480
firewall without having to a lot of

00:29:55,560 --> 00:30:00,600
companies are a little iffy about

00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:04,050
punching holes in their firewall so we

00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:05,760
want to take care of that eventually we

00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:08,100
want to add some static code analysis

00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:10,470
tools that's been on our plate for a

00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:13,190
while but we haven't had a lot of time

00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:13,190
to look at that yet

00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:23,590
you eye and graphics expert expert group

00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:26,950
has a really big set of tasks that might

00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:28,510
seem haphazard as well but they're

00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:29,919
looking at the what you the basically

00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:32,470
what you would consider for UI and

00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:34,900
graphics which would be compositor layer

00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:37,990
manager window manager GPU interface

00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:43,419
things like that but we also bundled

00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:45,760
multimedia audio display audio manager

00:30:43,419 --> 00:30:47,860
media we've got a media reference media

00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:50,169
player and media manager so that's all

00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:58,179
bundled into this you Iying graphics

00:30:50,169 --> 00:31:00,010
expert group as well so they've been

00:30:58,179 --> 00:31:03,520
working on updating everything to

00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:07,270
waylynn 2.0 refactoring the home screen

00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:09,100
and the window manager updating the

00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:12,220
window manager for better secondary

00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:13,870
display support as well as updating it

00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:17,470
to include the ability to have a

00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:19,120
multiple apps running owning parts of

00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:23,020
the parts of the display and running

00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:25,059
their parts of the window better focus

00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:28,120
management for out-of-focus applications

00:31:25,059 --> 00:31:34,570
we do kind of a not a great job always

00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:37,210
with that they're working on watham for

00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:40,780
internode display protocol so that you

00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:44,350
can have apps running and uh on your ivi

00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:45,880
system and displaying parts of the parts

00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:48,100
of a window in the instrument cluster

00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:51,360
it's a pretty standard feature these

00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:53,260
days in most in a lot of vehicles

00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:55,000
improving audio management and

00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:56,320
configuration we talked about that a

00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:00,059
little bit already with the 4a

00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:03,480
architecture adding speech services and

00:32:00,059 --> 00:32:03,480
chromium of course

00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:13,360
so we're looking to bring this vehicle

00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:17,050
to cloud expert group online in the next

00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:21,070
month or so including we need to need to

00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:24,180
take a look at the overall use cases tal

00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:28,420
maddox personalization and to end

00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:31,570
authentication things like that define a

00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:33,790
reference application work with some

00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:36,940
back-end providers on how to standardize

00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:39,610
what the backend expects and then

00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:44,550
identify any reference applications that

00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:44,550
we want to develop in that expert group

00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:53,190
so as I wrap up here I just got a bunch

00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:55,480
of links to our our developer resources

00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:58,230
we have a getting started guide on our

00:32:55,480 --> 00:33:04,390
wiki links to our documentation site

00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:05,920
links to our JIRA the getting the

00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:08,020
getting started guide will also give you

00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:11,770
information on how to sign up for you

00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:14,200
needed an LF ID Lynch foundation ID to

00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:15,580
access our sites but most of you

00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:17,350
probably already have one of those so

00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:18,750
you can you can get the access pretty

00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:21,730
quickly

00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:25,960
we have pre-built binaries and source

00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:27,850
tarball is available on our basically

00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:30,700
through this it's on our wiki page with

00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:34,090
all the release notes release notes are

00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:36,040
available on our wiki page which also

00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:42,370
includes the links to the guitar balls

00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:47,860
and the the binaries like I said we use

00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:51,070
Garrett for our workflow and and get

00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:52,120
obviously on the back end so I have

00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:54,400
about five minutes left

00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:56,020
oh one other thing to point out we do

00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:58,020
like I said in the spirit of

00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:59,710
collaboration we have any number of

00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:01,960
face-to-face meetings with our

00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:03,930
developers you can see this is just this

00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:06,850
is the list of what we've had this year

00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:10,480
so not only at our all member meetings

00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:13,270
in which we have twice a year we had

00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:16,600
them in Tokyo and Dresden this year but

00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:20,110
also various various sites hosted by

00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:21,370
companies within AGL for there's usually

00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:23,800
specific topics

00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:26,140
we have a automotive discussions mail

00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:27,940
list you can sign up for whenever

00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:29,770
there's a new face to face meeting we

00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:32,230
make an announcement through the the

00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:35,950
mail list anybody is free to sign up and

00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:40,360
attend these Sam house

00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:44,680
San Jose was focused on audio manager

00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:46,360
and window manager then various topics

00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:51,060
throughout the year and we have our next

00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:51,060
one coming up in Yokohama in November so

00:34:53,370 --> 00:35:04,260
five minutes left

00:34:55,030 --> 00:35:04,260
any questions one over there

00:35:10,069 --> 00:35:15,500
yeah that's an optional yeah

00:35:18,309 --> 00:35:22,819
we have I guess I didn't show this slide

00:35:21,109 --> 00:35:24,440
for the we have a virtuals so the

00:35:22,819 --> 00:35:26,750
question was about hypervisor in the

00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:28,430
architecture slide I showed the AGL

00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:30,970
running on a hypervisor and the question

00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:34,099
was do we have a particular hypervisor

00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:35,480
we have a virtualization expert group if

00:35:34,099 --> 00:35:39,349
you go to the wiki you can take a look

00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:42,380
at that they've been exploring a number

00:35:39,349 --> 00:35:45,200
of different hypervisors Michelle

00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:47,869
Paulino of virtual open systems leads

00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:52,430
that group and he submitted patches now

00:35:47,869 --> 00:35:56,539
for AGL to run on KVM but they're also

00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:59,089
looking at jailhouse and Zen and some

00:35:56,539 --> 00:36:00,799
others so one at one I'm I should have

00:35:59,089 --> 00:36:03,380
mentioned this one of the topics in the

00:36:00,799 --> 00:36:05,950
next month or so is having that expert

00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:09,109
group kind of take a step back and

00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:12,170
explore what the real use cases are for

00:36:09,109 --> 00:36:14,510
hypervisors in automotive and create a

00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:16,460
white paper and then create create a

00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:19,279
white paper that will release early next

00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:20,809
year and then use that to drive the work

00:36:19,279 --> 00:36:23,569
of the virtualization expert group

00:36:20,809 --> 00:36:25,579
through that throughout 2018 so if

00:36:23,569 --> 00:36:27,500
anybody is interested in participating

00:36:25,579 --> 00:36:30,259
in that effort I'll be sending out a

00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:33,049
call for participation next week or

00:36:30,259 --> 00:36:40,900
maybe I guess this week on the AGL mail

00:36:33,049 --> 00:36:40,900
list to get people working on that yes

00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:51,940
that's a great question I don't have the

00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:56,589
answer

00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:58,539
oh I'm sorry he we took he asked he says

00:36:56,589 --> 00:37:00,369
I were talking about we I had in my

00:36:58,539 --> 00:37:02,500
slides I talked about an upcoming ace

00:37:00,369 --> 00:37:06,369
will be a certification how are we going

00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:08,200
to accomplish that with Linux that's a

00:37:06,369 --> 00:37:10,539
great question and we're going to that's

00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:14,170
what we need to figure out it's a big

00:37:10,539 --> 00:37:16,390
big topic and it really is is a is there

00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:19,270
a hypervisor there that we ice used just

00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:21,730
to just isolate Linux is there some kind

00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:23,289
of scaled-down version of Linux fully

00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:25,390
documented that's that's what we're

00:37:23,289 --> 00:37:32,559
working what we need to figure out what

00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:34,829
we're doing can you repeat the beginning

00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:34,829
part

00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:43,100
the comment was we wouldn't have we

00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,210
wouldn't have any luck getting into a

00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:48,100
cluster without that kind of

00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:48,100
certification yes I agree

00:37:48,220 --> 00:38:03,140
any other questions can you repeat that

00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:04,280
one more time great question I should

00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:07,130
have mentioned that so

00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:08,540
Toyota announced the question was are

00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:10,850
there any car manufacturers that have

00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:13,280
adopted a GL into their products yet

00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:15,710
Toyota announced at the automotive Linux

00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:19,120
summit earlier this year that AGL is

00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:22,270
running on the 2018 Toyota Camry and

00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:24,410
will be migrating to the rest of their

00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:27,020
vehicle platforms throughout the next

00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:32,390
few years and we expect other car

00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:34,990
manufacturers will quickly follow any

00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:34,990
other questions

00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:46,690
I can't hear you we have the question

00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:49,660
was do we have a hardware reference

00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:51,910
platform we we're running basically all

00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:55,090
of our code is available on a number of

00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:59,680
the eval boards hardware Hardware eval

00:38:55,090 --> 00:39:04,420
boards from Rena sauce from Intel TI the

00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:06,310
Bayou board what we want to do is is use

00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:10,780
the system reference hardware system

00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:14,350
architecture team to drive a to a more

00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:15,850
automotive looking hardware architecture

00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:21,160
where we're to where we're truly have

00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:23,290
the the startup startup from say NAND

00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:26,770
flash as opposed to an SD card and have

00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:28,990
some some of the real wake up circuits

00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:30,850
in there so we're working towards that

00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:32,980
but right now we are available on about

00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:41,020
eight or nine different boards and you

00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:41,770
can find all those on the wiki page any

00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:48,100
other questions

00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:52,230
if thirty seconds left No
