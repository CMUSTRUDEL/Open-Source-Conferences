Description: 
	Farming Together - Andrew Murray, Witekio

Everyone is talking about board farms and becoming farmers to their own board farms. Board farms add a link to continuous integration that allows for continuous deployment and automated testing. However we are all working on this in silos - yet we come across the same challenges and solve them with very different proprietary solutions.

During this session, Andrew will provide an overview of the Witekio farm highlighting the challenges faced - both in hardware challenges (connecting boards to farms) and software challenges (providing a software platform to higher level software such as Jenkins, KernelCI to use). The BoF will then open the discussion to see who currently participates in this new community, what solutions already exist and crucially how we can come together to harmonise our efforts and create an open-source platform for farming.
