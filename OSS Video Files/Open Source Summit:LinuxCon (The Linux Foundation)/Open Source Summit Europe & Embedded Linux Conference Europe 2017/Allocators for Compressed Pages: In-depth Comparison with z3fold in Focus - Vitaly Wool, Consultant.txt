	Allocators for Compressed Pages: In-depth Comparison with z3fold in Focus - Vitaly Wool, Consultant

Right now there are 3 allocators for compressed pages (zbud, zsmalloc, z3fold) and 2 main users of these allocators (zswap, zram). However, you can't normally have all 6 combinations due to the restrictions of zram implementation which will be proved artificial in this talk.

Apart from that and the performance and compression ratio comparisons for the allocators mentioned, we'll discuss the ongoing z3fold streamlining work, such as evaluating lock-less lists (lllists), wider use of atomic operations, trying bit read-write locks and implementing support for movable z3fold pages.
