	How to Combine Debian and Yocto/Bitbake? - Manuel Traut, Linutronix GmbH

Debian is popular for its stability and security. ELBE utilizes Debian to create system images from Debian binary packages and supports building modified Debian source packages. This allows automated monitoring for security updates, which becomes more and more important.

ELBE has its shortcomings vs. yocto/bitbake. Building root file systems for an architecture unsupported by Debian or variant management beyond the selection of packages, e.g. applying patches depending on the target, is not supported.

Yocto/bitbake main focus is on that flexibility for the price of maintenance, security and bugfix tracking of all upstream packages. So utilizing Debian sources as base for bitbake might combine the best of both worlds.

This talk looks at various efforts, like meta-isar and meta-debian, which combine yocto/bitbake, Debian and ELBE. New ideas and possible solutions are shown.
