all right good morning thank you so

00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:12,389
networking is cool again in in the past

00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:16,020
thirty years we were like boring right

00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:18,390
the only time we got called was when an

00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:21,210
IP address didn't you know work or a

00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:24,720
network was down or an app was broken

00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:26,279
and was all networks fault and now it's

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,849
no longer the case where it

00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:32,430
disaggregated we are software define

00:00:28,849 --> 00:00:34,590
were virtualized you don't know where

00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:37,559
the fault is so you can't blame us

00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:40,890
anymore well what I what I want to talk

00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:44,309
about today is where things are heading

00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:46,739
and it is an extremely important time

00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:50,430
for our industry whether you're working

00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:52,530
in an enterprise cloud or carrier and so

00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:55,829
let me walk you through the vision of

00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:58,350
where things are heading and how we see

00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:01,500
the world but before we go there I want

00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:04,019
to set some context of open source in

00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,360
general we always you know Jim always

00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:08,340
talks about this slide and and you know

00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:10,350
he didn't do that yesterday so I said

00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:14,220
let's do it here but this is important

00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:16,530
there's open source projects 23 plus

00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:20,009
million developers you know over 2,000

00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:22,460
of those are here in this room billions

00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:26,220
of lines of code lots of new projects

00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:28,680
which projects matter the ones that have

00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:30,659
a sustainable ecosystem and those are

00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,439
the ones that we host at Linux

00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:37,770
Foundation and we grouped them into

00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:40,259
areas and we all know the acronyms right

00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:43,110
so starting from the left you got Lennox

00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:44,939
and nodejs and let's encrypt and sort of

00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:47,880
more of the platforms if you may

00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:50,220
I'm moving to data blockchain etc right

00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,259
you talked about the cloud huge huge

00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:54,930
momentum and then of course embedded in

00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:57,240
IOT where you have you know things like

00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:59,280
Ajax foundry or automotive-grade Lennox

00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,350
etc and the one on the right is

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,500
networking which is what I was going to

00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:07,110
talk about today and and in networking

00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:10,440
it's a very interesting proposition

00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:13,440
because according to network well Lennox

00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:15,210
foundation hosts eight of the ten

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,010
top networking projects are the most

00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:19,830
important projects so we have the

00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:22,170
critical mass to move this industry

00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:24,420
forward and I'll tell you how we're

00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:28,560
doing it all of the networking vendors

00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:30,210
the top ones are active with the tipping

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,660
point reached in terms of the global

00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:35,700
population participating in open source

00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:40,740
lots of millions of dollars being spent

00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:43,620
on this all for one simple simple use

00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:46,680
case which is can I get services faster

00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:49,110
and more reliable right that's it and

00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,030
it's all the complexity just because of

00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:54,960
that so let me sort of walk you through

00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:56,790
how far we have come so the past hundred

00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,920
and thirty seven years ever since the

00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:02,670
telephone was invented it was all

00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,270
proprietary solutions okay it was

00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:06,330
bookend

00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:09,150
from one point to the other and then the

00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:11,100
last five years disaggregation came in

00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:13,320
and this word is a heavy word and it's

00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:16,560
used left and right by the industry but

00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:19,380
what disaggregation means is hardware is

00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,870
separated from software components of

00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:24,300
software are separated from each other

00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:26,790
with standard api's so if you are a

00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:28,230
hardware engineer hard to find in this

00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:31,170
room but let's say you are a hardware

00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:32,850
engineer you're the way you build

00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:35,760
hardware is exactly how we're building

00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:39,030
software these days with api's and

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,580
reusable blocks and modules and the way

00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:44,489
hardware is getting built is exactly how

00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:46,260
software was getting built right so you

00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:49,230
know where we're kind of disaggregating

00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:51,810
this world where all these components

00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:53,670
now have become production ready they

00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:56,820
are running some of the most powerful

00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:59,900
networks in this world globally okay and

00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:03,570
that's what started off last year and

00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:06,290
then where we are heading is how do you

00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:08,790
bring these components together and

00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:11,430
scale the deployment in a more

00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:15,150
harmonized manner ok so that's kind of

00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:17,310
where the big big trends are and I want

00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:19,950
to show you visually and architectural e

00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:23,160
where the challenges lie and what we are

00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:25,470
trying to do to fix them on the top very

00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,240
simple cloud services residential

00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:30,180
services enterprise services I

00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:32,250
services those are kind of the bulk of

00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:35,310
the things that everybody makes money on

00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:37,229
right and and you have you know the

00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:39,210
carriers or the operators sort of trying

00:04:37,229 --> 00:04:41,400
to get the middle part of it

00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:43,650
IOT is still a battle that's being

00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,330
fought right now obviously we talked

00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,710
about the cloud cloud native services

00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:50,130
and all that and on the bottom you have

00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:51,840
infrastructure very simple either you

00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:53,370
are have an enterprise data center which

00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,199
has moved to Software Defined you have

00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:58,440
the carrier network it could be a cable

00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:01,020
or an MSO or it could be just a straight

00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:04,349
cloud and these services and

00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:07,979
applications are going through a layer

00:05:04,349 --> 00:05:11,849
of software that goes between these

00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:15,000
three cylinders at the bottom and today

00:05:11,849 --> 00:05:19,710
it is completely fragment and disjoint

00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,800
manual tooling imagine a service that

00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:24,690
you want to start that goes across these

00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:26,430
you got a call you got to ask you ought

00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:29,069
to put a request you go to interface

00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:34,320
with the web and all that that tooling

00:05:29,069 --> 00:05:35,729
is not acceptable in a5g world it's

00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,770
mandatory to automate it

00:05:35,729 --> 00:05:39,930
you can't have an IOT device on the

00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:41,909
phone waiting for a service it's going

00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:44,789
to come in milliseconds and go off log

00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:48,270
your logger meter or a device or any of

00:05:44,789 --> 00:05:50,669
these things and get out right so it's

00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:53,039
mandatory and the way we want to do that

00:05:50,669 --> 00:05:56,849
and and why we want to do that is just

00:05:53,039 --> 00:06:00,419
the sheer volume that is gonna be

00:05:56,849 --> 00:06:05,340
brought inside the network is just

00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:08,699
beyond human power thousand X the volume

00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:11,729
100 X the data rate 100 X the devices

00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:14,430
and now it's it could be a car it could

00:06:11,729 --> 00:06:16,409
be an oven it could be anything of

00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:20,430
course it'll be a phone but a lot of

00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:22,680
things come in okay so that's where we

00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:25,380
have projects in Lennox foundation that

00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:27,150
are pulling it all together the middle

00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:29,009
part is what I'm going to focus on which

00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:32,099
is open Network automation which a set

00:06:29,009 --> 00:06:35,300
of projects Chris just talked about the

00:06:32,099 --> 00:06:37,979
left side which is cloud automation with

00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:40,889
applications being developed by the

00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:42,960
cloud foundry platform where

00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:44,759
you know a lot of infrastructure

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,710
independent applications are being

00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:49,289
developed for cloud native apps and then

00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:50,879
of course CN CF and and the automation

00:06:49,289 --> 00:06:53,460
and the orchestration of cloud native

00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:56,120
right on the right-hand side you got the

00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:58,800
edx foundry which is a lot of IOT

00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:01,610
automation comes in and then you see

00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:04,529
that these clouds intersect right and

00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:07,919
there's a reason for that the network

00:07:04,529 --> 00:07:09,270
portion of cloud native is the cni the

00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,919
cloud native interface right or

00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:13,259
networking interface and and we come

00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:15,840
together they're there you have to

00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:18,389
transport policies and orchestration

00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,009
information between apps that are

00:07:18,389 --> 00:07:21,300
running in a service provider network

00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:22,740
and in a cloud there's a lot of

00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:26,340
requirements that go back and forth

00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:28,919
between kubernetes and or our own app

00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:32,250
and and networking projects the same

00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:34,469
thing is true for the IOT and open

00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:36,689
network right they intersect at what's

00:07:34,469 --> 00:07:38,849
called mobile edge computing or mac and

00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:40,409
mark will come after me and you know

00:07:38,849 --> 00:07:42,270
talk about some of the innovations that

00:07:40,409 --> 00:07:44,460
are happening you know from an Intel

00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:47,129
perspective in that zone very very

00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:49,560
important and an interesting aspect so

00:07:47,129 --> 00:07:52,949
that's kind of where you know we want to

00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:55,620
focus and automate things on so now if I

00:07:52,949 --> 00:07:58,080
go one level down into the proprietary

00:07:55,620 --> 00:08:00,210
stack and and show you the technologies

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:03,330
that are being used to do this it's very

00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:05,129
simple from a high level perspective the

00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:07,199
left hand side is vendor a you know the

00:08:05,129 --> 00:08:09,180
hundred and thirty seven years of work

00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,219
proprietary work that we all did in

00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:13,500
networking not we I mean for those of

00:08:11,219 --> 00:08:14,789
you are still alive that long but you

00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:17,399
note you're talking about hardware

00:08:14,789 --> 00:08:20,009
silicon layer then you come into the OS

00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:22,069
control plane management services and

00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:25,370
then on the right hand side we became

00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:27,689
horizontal iced with these layers

00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:29,849
disaggregating from each other and each

00:08:27,689 --> 00:08:33,209
of these projects which are sort of the

00:08:29,849 --> 00:08:36,690
symbols that are coming in aimed at

00:08:33,209 --> 00:08:38,849
innovating that layer of software so the

00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:41,219
hardware became disaggregated the

00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:42,959
control became software-defined and all

00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:45,269
the applications became virtual

00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:48,839
functions that could run on a standard

00:08:45,269 --> 00:08:52,350
x86 hardware that could be virtualized

00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:55,650
and put in any of those cylinders

00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:59,720
local enterprise data center public

00:08:55,650 --> 00:09:03,420
network or public cloud okay

00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:05,790
so given that what is the landscape

00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:08,460
looking up like Chris put up a slide

00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:10,710
with all the companies I'm putting up a

00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:12,330
slide with just the open source project

00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:13,950
so for those of you are not familiar

00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:16,290
with the networking stack this is fairly

00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:19,020
standard all the way from hardware up to

00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:21,900
software and application and here's the

00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:25,200
entire set of open source networking

00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:27,390
stack this includes projects from the

00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:30,000
Linux Foundation as well as projects

00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:33,660
outside the Linux Foundation now keep in

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,430
mind some of these projects are that

00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:37,410
there's many choices at each of these

00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:39,060
layers so for example you have two

00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:41,250
Hardware projects outside Linux

00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:43,710
Foundation that's focusing on on the

00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:46,710
hardware openness open compute and tip

00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:48,960
okay you brick go up a layer you're

00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:51,830
talking about the i/o abstraction and

00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:54,660
the data acceleration that's where

00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:58,440
basically take hardware and make sure

00:09:54,660 --> 00:10:01,290
that the the amount of traffic that's

00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:03,060
thrown at that Hardware can easily go

00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:05,100
through and accelerate at a very very

00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,900
high speed level right that's kind of

00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,910
the data plane acceleration as we talk

00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:11,430
and there's many of these some of you

00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:13,790
might be working on on on projects that

00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:16,080
are like Iowa's are for example that's a

00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:18,240
acceleration inside the kernel right and

00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:21,000
and kind of put it from that perspective

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,610
DB DB K set of libraries that sort of go

00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,470
into and help projects like FD io

00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:28,710
accelerate and and push a lot of

00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:30,810
information through a server so you move

00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:33,390
up there obviously everybody's familiar

00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:35,370
with the OSS that run on it and then you

00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:37,620
get into the control plane and then the

00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:40,140
application analytics management layer

00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:42,030
which is where bulk of the action is

00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:44,010
right we have solved some of the lower

00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:46,050
layer problems but the middle layer and

00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:49,290
the orchestration automation is where

00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:51,900
bulk of the people are focusing on and

00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:54,540
by the way there's projects there which

00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:56,520
is kind of onap and and NOP and a fee

00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:59,700
that kind of cut across the entire thing

00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:01,320
I'm also showing the the containerized

00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,060
version of that sort of in the middle

00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:05,400
right where cloud native and Cloud

00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,790
Foundry and OSI I fit in like the open

00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,250
container

00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:10,560
initiative and then a very important

00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:13,350
thing in networking that we need to not

00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:15,680
like ignore our standards right

00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:18,180
standards have been around forever and

00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:21,180
we want to make sure that we harmonize

00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:22,380
them as much as possible as you know you

00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,910
know it becomes a de-facto

00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:26,160
software big open source software

00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:28,740
becomes a de-facto standard and if we

00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:31,200
can work with the with the community of

00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:33,930
stem standards folks and as the

00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,000
organization it's much better and much

00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:38,520
more effective for the end-user so we're

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,070
working extremely tightly with these

00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:42,300
folks now let me focus on a couple of

00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:44,250
things and have a couple of

00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:46,700
announcements so the first one is own

00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:48,960
app and then the next one is OPN efi so

00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:52,650
how many of you in this room have heard

00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:55,440
about own app Oh more than I expected

00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:58,740
very good so this is a very interesting

00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:01,320
project it started off with two open

00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:03,990
source projects one called ecomp and one

00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:06,720
called open o open all was hosted open

00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:10,230
all stands for open orchestration it was

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:13,770
hosted by Linux Foundation and ecomp was

00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:16,320
kind of an AT&T lead project that also

00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:18,660
came into the open into the Linux

00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,490
Foundation last year we combined the two

00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:23,010
and we combined the two because the

00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:25,200
community was similar they were going

00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:29,190
after the same problems and we wanted

00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:33,210
synergies and so we when we did that the

00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:36,600
value just tripled okay it created

00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:39,510
really fast automation services for 4G

00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:41,690
and 5g and businesses you know the value

00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:45,120
was eliminating manual steps and

00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:47,370
complete design for automation it's a

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,290
huge project right now it's one of the

00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:51,450
fastest-growing networking projects

00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:54,290
under the Linux Foundation right now and

00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:59,070
it it any and I'll show you some of the

00:12:54,290 --> 00:13:01,080
ecosystem that has has has pushed this

00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:04,770
it's pretty much all the vendors and

00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:06,690
today we have over 55 percent of the

00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:08,370
global subscribers represented by this

00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:11,610
project by the way just think think of

00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:14,310
that this is six six weeks or six months

00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:18,690
into the project 50 plus members growing

00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:19,650
very very very rapidly okay I won't go

00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:23,370
into the details if

00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:25,680
interested on a Borg this wiki but it's

00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:28,190
a collection of modules with a very

00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:30,750
modular architecture that allows for

00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:32,850
stitching together of these 11

00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:35,730
components from design time to run time

00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:38,550
okay over 10 million lines of code

00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:40,980
combined so it's not a trivial project

00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:43,140
that any one single vendor can do but it

00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:45,330
is the most important project to

00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:48,570
automate the layer of network that that

00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:50,970
I've been talking about okay model

00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:53,310
driven design virtual functions physical

00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:56,820
functions it supports all the clouds so

00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:58,410
OpenStack is your VMware you know

00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:02,250
working on kubernetes working with

00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:06,020
kubernetes etc goes across carriers okay

00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:09,390
huge community here we're talking about

00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:11,220
1,500 developers working on this you

00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:13,080
know not a single vendor will be able to

00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:17,790
do this and this is just in the last six

00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:20,640
months a lot of lot of great great

00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:24,270
contribution and we are we are really

00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:26,400
really excited about this okay this

00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:28,560
couple of weeks ago we just announced

00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:31,470
partnership with meth meth is the Metro

00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:33,690
Ethernet forum and think of it this way

00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:35,010
when you're going across carriers so

00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:36,720
when you're growing across network

00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:39,060
operators or when you're growing across

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,860
going across an enterprise and an

00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:43,550
operator or a cloud and an operator

00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:48,089
right remember the picture I showed you

00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:51,480
you need a set of standards based api's

00:14:48,089 --> 00:14:53,550
now there are people like TM Foreman and

00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:56,029
mmm EF that are working on that and

00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:59,040
we're going to look at it and adopt a

00:14:56,029 --> 00:15:02,490
portion of that modify a portion of that

00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:05,130
and basically give one set of api's that

00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:07,680
connect what is known as BSS systems

00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:09,990
right or business support systems in the

00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:13,730
telco world and it's very very critical

00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:16,350
that we all sort of harness the power of

00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:18,839
standards and open source here so we

00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:21,810
announced this and and so onap in

00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:23,640
general is focused on automation and it

00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:24,740
is becoming the de facto automation

00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:27,540
platform so if you're not already

00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:29,190
participating or if not you know go

00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:31,980
ahead and do that

00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:33,690
it's got full support from a lot of

00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:35,760
members and developer

00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:38,370
and we're leading the harmonization

00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:40,350
effort so that's one of the projects and

00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:42,090
then the second one that we have a

00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:45,540
couple of announcements on today is

00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:49,230
obviously o P n Fe o P n Fe as you know

00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:53,040
is a cross community project and it kind

00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:54,900
of tests and facilitates the CI CD or

00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:58,070
test the integration of components

00:15:54,900 --> 00:16:00,660
you know version 3.2 of this works with

00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:03,570
4.7 of this with this and there's a

00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:05,700
backward compatibility issue and etc and

00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:09,300
it provides that system level test and

00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:12,300
automation framework for nfe so what

00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:14,490
we're doing is we are announcing today

00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:17,670
and the press release just crossed the

00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:21,690
wire is announcing OPN EFI's latest

00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:24,170
software release you frutos now the most

00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:26,520
important thing about this is it has

00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:28,680
container support with kubernetes

00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:30,690
orchestration engine so we're really

00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:33,650
excited about that you know it also has

00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:37,410
containerized OpenStack integrated in it

00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:41,390
along with that cloud native aspects of

00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:43,590
OPN EFI we also have enhanced a lot of

00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:46,470
visibility a lot of service assurance

00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:50,160
frameworks we have provided tools that

00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:53,060
actually do benchmark vnf onboarding etc

00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:55,920
etc and it's a cross community

00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:57,540
continuous integration xci as we call it

00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,370
there's a session on that as well if you

00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:03,240
want to attend it but essentially what

00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:04,830
we are able to do is allow you know

00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,930
integration and tests to be done

00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:09,510
constantly and pull in all these

00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:13,770
components and clearly you can see this

00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:15,540
there's a lot of support on this and

00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:17,670
we're working with communities like own

00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:20,910
app and ODL and OpenStack to bring it

00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:23,370
all together ok so I can't go into all

00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:25,430
the projects but you can see the amount

00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:28,380
of energy that is being spent into

00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:32,040
getting all the networking projects

00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:35,220
harmonized and all the standards come

00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:37,200
together in one umbrella and that's what

00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:39,330
we're doing at at the Lenox foundation

00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:42,000
there's a white paper on the Lennox

00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:43,920
foundation website that talks about the

00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,080
harmonization story if you have not

00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:47,850
already please downloaded it's a great

00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,890
it's a great

00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:51,600
Oriol on how standards and open-source

00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:54,059
work together and how they can come

00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,590
together so with that thank you very

00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:57,900
