	Linux Powered Autonomous Arctic Buoys - Satish Chetty, Hera Systems

In my talk/presentation, I cover the technical, and design challenges in developing an autonomous Linux powered Arctic buoy. This system is a low cost, COTS based, extreme/harsh environment, autonomous sensor data gathering platform. It measures albedo, weather, water temperature and other parameters. It runs on a custom embedded Linux and is optimized for efficient use of solar & battery power. It uses a variety of low cost, high accuracy/precision sensors and satellite/terrestrial wireless communications. 

I talk about using Linux in this embedded environment, and how I address and solve various issues including building a custom kernel, Linux drivers, frame grabbing issues and results from cameras, limited power challenges, clock drifts due to low temperature, summer melt challenges, failure of sensors, intermittent communication issues and various other h/w & s/w challenges.

About Satish Chetty
I serve as VP, software engineering At Hera Systems, a predictive analytics, Earth Imaging Company. Prior to Hera Systems, I served in multiple engineering and management roles. I am actively involved with embedded Linux, Robotics, and polar research technology groups. I co-founded Polar Technology Conference. I have built extreme-environment technology solutions, including polar instrumentation and field-tested hardware that operate at very low polar temperatures and harsh environment.
